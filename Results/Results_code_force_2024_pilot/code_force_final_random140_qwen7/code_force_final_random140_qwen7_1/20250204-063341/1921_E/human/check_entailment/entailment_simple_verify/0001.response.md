### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly parses the input for each test case, extracting the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips. This part is handled correctly.

2. **Initial Conditions Check**:
   - The program checks if Bob's chip is initially at a lower or equal row compared to Alice's chip. If so, it immediately prints "Draw" because Bob cannot win in this scenario. This is correct.

3. **Odd and Even Distance Analysis**:
   - If the vertical distance between the two chips is odd, the program checks if Alice can force a win. This is done by ensuring that Alice can move to a position where she can capture Bob's chip. However, the logic here is flawed. Specifically, the program incorrectly assumes that Alice can always force a win just because the vertical distance is odd. This is not necessarily true; Alice might not have a valid move that captures Bob's chip.
   - If the vertical distance is even, the program checks if Bob can force a win similarly. Again, the logic here is flawed. Bob might not have a valid move that captures Alice's chip just because the vertical distance is even.

4. **Detailed Moves Analysis**:
   - The program handles various scenarios where Alice and Bob can move their chips. It ensures that the moves are within the board boundaries. This part is mostly correct but could be more robust.
   - The program also checks if Alice or Bob can force a win by moving to a position where they can capture the opponent's chip. However, the logic for determining these conditions is overly complex and may not cover all edge cases.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles edge cases such as when Alice or Bob reaches the boundary of the board, which would result in a draw if no winning move is available. This is correct.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the correct outcome ("Alice", "Bob", or "Draw") based on the analysis. However, due to the flaws in the logic, the output may not always be correct.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is inaccurate because the program's logic for determining the winner is flawed. Specifically, the program incorrectly assumes that Alice can always force a win if the vertical distance is odd, and Bob can always force a win if the vertical distance is even. These assumptions are not always valid and do not cover all possible game states.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly determine the outcome of the game in all scenarios.
