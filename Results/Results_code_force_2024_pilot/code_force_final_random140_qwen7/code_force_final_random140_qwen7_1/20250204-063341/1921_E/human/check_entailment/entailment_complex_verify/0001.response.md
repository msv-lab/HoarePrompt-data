### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly parses the input for each test case, extracting the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips. This part is correct.

2. **Initial Conditions Check**:
   - The program checks if Bob's chip is initially at a lower or equal row compared to Alice's chip. If so, it immediately prints "Draw" because Bob cannot win in this scenario. This part is correct.

3. **Odd and Even Distance Analysis**:
   - If the vertical distance between the two chips is odd, the program checks if Alice can force a win. This is done by ensuring that Alice can move to a position where she can capture Bob's chip. However, the logic here is flawed. Specifically, the program does not correctly simulate the optimal moves for Alice and Bob to determine if Alice can force a win. The program incorrectly assumes that Alice can always force a win if the vertical distance is odd, without considering the horizontal distance and the possible moves Bob can make.

   - If the vertical distance is even, the program checks if Bob can force a win similarly. Again, the logic here is flawed. The program does not correctly simulate the optimal moves for Bob to determine if Bob can force a win. The program incorrectly assumes that Bob can always force a win if the vertical distance is even, without considering the horizontal distance and the possible moves Alice can make.

4. **Detailed Moves Analysis**:
   - The program handles various scenarios where Alice and Bob can move their chips. It ensures that the moves are within the board boundaries. However, the logic for determining if Alice or Bob can force a win is incorrect. The program does not correctly simulate the optimal moves for Alice and Bob to determine if they can force a win.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles edge cases such as when Alice or Bob reaches the boundary of the board, which would result in a draw if no winning move is available. This part is correct.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the correct outcome ("Alice", "Bob", or "Draw") based on the analysis. However, due to the flawed logic in the main decision-making parts, the outcomes are not always correct.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is inaccurate because the program's logic for determining if Alice or Bob can force a win is flawed. The program does not correctly simulate the optimal moves for Alice and Bob to determine the outcome of the game.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
