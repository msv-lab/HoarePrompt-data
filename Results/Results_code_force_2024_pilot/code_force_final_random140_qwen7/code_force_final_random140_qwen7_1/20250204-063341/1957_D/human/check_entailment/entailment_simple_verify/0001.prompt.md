You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the number of tuples (x,
y, z ) such that:

  * 1 \leq x \leq y \leq z \leq n , and 
  * f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) > f(x, z) . 

We define f(l, r) = a_l \oplus a_{l + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r} , where
\oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR
operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the number of
described tuples.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3
    
    6 2 4
    
    1
    
    3
    
    5
    
    7 3 7 2 1

Output

    4
    0
    16
    
Note

In the first case, there are 4 such tuples in the array [6, 2, 4] :

  * (1 , 2 , 2 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2) = 4 \oplus 2 > (a_1 \oplus a_2) = 4 
  * (1 , 1 , 3 ): (a_1) \oplus (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 6 \oplus 0 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 2 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2 \oplus a_3) = 4 \oplus 6 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 3 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) \oplus (a_3) = 0 \oplus 4 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 

In the second test case, there are no such tuples.

    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `arr` contains the original list of integers, and `prefix` is a list where each element is the result of XORing all the elements in `arr` up to that point in the list. The final element in `prefix` will be the cumulative XOR of all elements in `arr`.

Each sublist `suf[i]` will contain two elements. The first element of each sublist will represent the count of times the expression `(cur >> i & 1)` was false, and the second element will represent the count of times it was true across all iterations of the outer loop for `i` from 31 down to 1.

    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all 32 iterations, `j` will be 32, `n` will be 1, and `suf` will be a list of 32 sublists. Each sublist `suf[i]` will contain two elements: the first element will be -1 (indicating that the expression `(cur >> i & 1)` was false for the last iteration), and the second element will be 0 (indicating that the expression was true 0 times). `pre` will also be a list of 32 sublists, where each sublist `pre[i]` will contain two elements: the first element will be 0 (indicating that the expression `(cur >> i & 1)` was false 0 times), and the second element will be 32 (indicating that the expression was true 32 times). `ans` will be the sum of `pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]` for all `k` from 0 to 31, which simplifies to 0 because `suf[i][0]` is -1 and `suf[i][1]` is 0, and `pre[i][0]` is 0 and `pre[i][1]` is 32, making each term in the sum equal to 0.
    #
    #In natural language: After the loop completes all 32 iterations, `j` will be 32, `n` will be 1, and both `pre` and `suf` will be lists where each sublist contains 0 and 32 for the first and second elements respectively, indicating that the expression `(cur >> i & 1)` was true for all iterations for each bit position. The value of `ans` will be 0 because the contributions from `pre` and `suf` cancel each other out.

    #This is printed: 0



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   
2. **Prefix XOR Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the prefix XOR values for the array. This part is correct and necessary for solving the problem efficiently.

3. **Initialization of Pre and Suf Arrays:**
   - The `pre` and `suf` arrays are initialized to store counts of zeros and ones for each bit position. This is a key part of the solution, but there are some issues with how these arrays are used later.

4. **Filling Pre and Suf Arrays:**
   - The program incorrectly initializes `pre` and `suf` arrays. Specifically, `pre[i][0]` should be incremented for each bit position where the prefix XOR value has a zero, and `suf[i][0]` should be incremented for each bit position where the suffix XOR value has a zero. However, the current implementation is flawed.

5. **Counting Valid Tuples:**
   - The program attempts to count valid tuples using the `pre` and `suf` arrays. However, the logic for updating and using these arrays is incorrect. The current implementation does not properly account for the conditions required to form valid tuples.

### Detailed Issues

1. **Initialization of Pre and Suf Arrays:**
   - The initialization of `pre` and `suf` arrays is incorrect. It should be done based on the actual prefix and suffix XOR values, not just incrementing counts without considering the actual values.

2. **Logic for Counting Valid Tuples:**
   - The logic for counting valid tuples is flawed. The current approach does not correctly handle the conditions \( f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) > f(x, z) \).

### Corrected Approach

To correctly solve this problem, we need to use a different approach. One effective method is to use a segment tree or a Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree) to efficiently query and update the XOR values. However, the given solution does not follow this approach and instead uses a flawed method.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the provided program is incorrect due to the flawed initialization and usage of the `pre` and `suf` arrays, as well as the incorrect logic for counting valid tuples.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
