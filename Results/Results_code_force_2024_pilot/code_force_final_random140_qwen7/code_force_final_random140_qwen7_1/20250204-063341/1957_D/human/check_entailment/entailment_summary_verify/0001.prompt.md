You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the number of tuples (x,
y, z ) such that:

  * 1 \leq x \leq y \leq z \leq n , and 
  * f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) > f(x, z) . 

We define f(l, r) = a_l \oplus a_{l + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r} , where
\oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR
operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the number of
described tuples.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3
    
    6 2 4
    
    1
    
    3
    
    5
    
    7 3 7 2 1

Output

    4
    0
    16
    
Note

In the first case, there are 4 such tuples in the array [6, 2, 4] :

  * (1 , 2 , 2 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2) = 4 \oplus 2 > (a_1 \oplus a_2) = 4 
  * (1 , 1 , 3 ): (a_1) \oplus (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 6 \oplus 0 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 2 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2 \oplus a_3) = 4 \oplus 6 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 3 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) \oplus (a_3) = 0 \oplus 4 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 

In the second test case, there are no such tuples.

- Program:
T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    prefix = [0]
    for v in arr:
        prefix.append(v ^ prefix[-1])
    pre = [[0, 0] for _ in range(32)]
    suf = [[0, 0] for _ in range(32)]
    for i in range(32):
        pre[i][0] += 1
    for i in range(n, 0, -1):
        cur = prefix[i]
        for j in range(32):
            if cur >> j & 1:
                suf[j][1] += 1
            else:
                suf[j][0] += 1
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        y = arr[i - 1]
        k = y.bit_length() - 1
        ans += pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]
        c = prefix[i]
        for j in range(32):
            if c >> j & 1:
                pre[j][1] += 1
                suf[j][1] -= 1
            else:
                pre[j][0] += 1
                suf[j][0] -= 1
    print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each t, a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). It constructs a prefix XOR array and then uses this array to compute a value based on bit counts. Finally, it prints the computed value, which turns out to be 0 for all test cases.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   
2. **Prefix XOR Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the prefix XOR values for the array. This part is correct and necessary for solving the problem efficiently.

3. **Initialization of Pre and Suf Arrays:**
   - The `pre` and `suf` arrays are initialized to store counts of zeros and ones for each bit position. This is a key part of the solution, but there are some issues with how these arrays are used later.

4. **Filling Pre and Suf Arrays:**
   - The program incorrectly initializes `pre` and `suf` arrays. Specifically, `pre[i][0]` should be incremented for each bit position where the prefix XOR value has a zero, and `suf[i][0]` should be incremented for each bit position where the suffix XOR value has a zero. However, the current implementation is flawed.

5. **Counting Valid Tuples:**
   - The program attempts to count valid tuples using the `pre` and `suf` arrays. However, the logic for updating and using these arrays is incorrect. The current implementation does not properly account for the conditions required to form valid tuples.

### Detailed Issues

1. **Initialization of Pre and Suf Arrays:**
   - The initialization of `pre` and `suf` arrays is incorrect. It should be done based on the actual prefix and suffix XOR values, not just incrementing counts without considering the actual values.

2. **Logic for Counting Valid Tuples:**
   - The logic for counting valid tuples is flawed. The current approach does not correctly handle the conditions \( f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) > f(x, z) \).

### Corrected Approach

To correctly solve this problem, we need to use a different approach. One effective method is to use a segment tree or a Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree) to efficiently query and update the XOR values. However, the given solution does not follow this approach and instead uses a flawed method.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the provided program is incorrect due to the flawed initialization and usage of the `pre` and `suf` arrays, as well as the incorrect logic for counting valid tuples.
