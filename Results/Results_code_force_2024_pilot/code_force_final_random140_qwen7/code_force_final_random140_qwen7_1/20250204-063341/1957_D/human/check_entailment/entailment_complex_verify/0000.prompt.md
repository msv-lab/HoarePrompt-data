You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the number of tuples (x,
y, z ) such that:

  * 1 \leq x \leq y \leq z \leq n , and 
  * f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) > f(x, z) . 

We define f(l, r) = a_l \oplus a_{l + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r} , where
\oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR
operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the number of
described tuples.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3
    
    6 2 4
    
    1
    
    3
    
    5
    
    7 3 7 2 1

Output

    4
    0
    16
    
Note

In the first case, there are 4 such tuples in the array [6, 2, 4] :

  * (1 , 2 , 2 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2) = 4 \oplus 2 > (a_1 \oplus a_2) = 4 
  * (1 , 1 , 3 ): (a_1) \oplus (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 6 \oplus 0 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 2 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2 \oplus a_3) = 4 \oplus 6 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 3 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) \oplus (a_3) = 0 \oplus 4 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 

In the second test case, there are no such tuples.

    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `arr` contains the original list of integers, and `prefix` is a list where each element is the result of XORing all the elements in `arr` up to that point in the list. The final element in `prefix` will be the cumulative XOR of all elements in `arr`.

Each sublist `suf[i]` will contain two elements. The first element of each sublist will represent the count of times the expression `(cur >> i & 1)` was false, and the second element will represent the count of times it was true across all iterations of the outer loop for `i` from 31 down to 1.

    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all 32 iterations, `j` will be 32, `n` will be 1, and `suf` will be a list of 32 sublists. Each sublist `suf[i]` will contain two elements: the first element will be -1 (indicating that the expression `(cur >> i & 1)` was false for the last iteration), and the second element will be 0 (indicating that the expression was true 0 times). `pre` will also be a list of 32 sublists, where each sublist `pre[i]` will contain two elements: the first element will be 0 (indicating that the expression `(cur >> i & 1)` was false 0 times), and the second element will be 32 (indicating that the expression was true 32 times). `ans` will be the sum of `pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]` for all `k` from 0 to 31, which simplifies to 0 because `suf[i][0]` is -1 and `suf[i][1]` is 0, and `pre[i][0]` is 0 and `pre[i][1]` is 32, making each term in the sum equal to 0.
    #
    #In natural language: After the loop completes all 32 iterations, `j` will be 32, `n` will be 1, and both `pre` and `suf` will be lists where each sublist contains 0 and 32 for the first and second elements respectively, indicating that the expression `(cur >> i & 1)` was true for all iterations for each bit position. The value of `ans` will be 0 because the contributions from `pre` and `suf` cancel each other out.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each t, a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). It constructs a prefix XOR array and then uses this array to compute a value based on bit counts. Finally, it prints the computed value, which turns out to be 0 for all test cases.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program does not properly handle the calculation of the XOR values for the subarrays defined by the indices \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\). The program attempts to use bit manipulation to count the number of valid tuples but fails to correctly compute the XOR values for the subarrays \(f(x, y)\), \(f(y, z)\), and \(f(x, z)\).

To illustrate the issue, consider the following example:

Input:
```
3
3
6 2 4
```

Expected Output:
```
4
```

However, running the provided program with this input will produce incorrect results. The program incorrectly counts the number of valid tuples without properly computing the XOR values for the specified subarrays.

Here is a breakdown of the issues:
1. The program initializes the `prefix` array to store cumulative XOR values, but it does not correctly update these values for the subarray XOR computations.
2. The `pre` and `suf` arrays are intended to count the occurrences of specific bit patterns, but they are not used correctly to compute the required XOR values.
3. The logic for updating the `pre` and `suf` arrays is flawed and does not accurately reflect the XOR operations needed for the problem.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and thus is incorrect.
