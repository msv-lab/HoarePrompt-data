Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the number of tuples (x,
y, z ) such that:

  * 1 \leq x \leq y \leq z \leq n , and 
  * f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) > f(x, z) . 

We define f(l, r) = a_l \oplus a_{l + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r} , where
\oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR
operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the number of
described tuples.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3
    
    6 2 4
    
    1
    
    3
    
    5
    
    7 3 7 2 1

Output

    4
    0
    16
    
Note

In the first case, there are 4 such tuples in the array [6, 2, 4] :

  * (1 , 2 , 2 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2) = 4 \oplus 2 > (a_1 \oplus a_2) = 4 
  * (1 , 1 , 3 ): (a_1) \oplus (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 6 \oplus 0 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 2 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2 \oplus a_3) = 4 \oplus 6 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 3 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) \oplus (a_3) = 0 \oplus 4 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 

In the second test case, there are no such tuples.

# Annotated Program:
T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    prefix = [0]
    for v in arr:
        prefix.append(v ^ prefix[-1])
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `v` is the last element of `arr`, and `prefix` is a list where each element is the cumulative XOR of all previous elements in `arr`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `arr` contains the original list of integers, and `prefix` is a list where each element is the result of XORing all the elements in `arr` up to that point in the list. The final element in `prefix` will be the cumulative XOR of all elements in `arr`.
    pre = [[0, 0] for _ in range(32)]
    suf = [[0, 0] for _ in range(32)]
    for i in range(32):
        pre[i][0] += 1
        
    #State: After the loop executes all 32 iterations, `i` is 31; `pre[0][0]` is 32; `pre[2][0]` is 32; `pre[31][0]` is 32.
    for i in range(n, 0, -1):
        cur = prefix[i]
        
        for j in range(32):
            if cur >> j & 1:
                suf[j][1] += 1
            else:
                suf[j][0] += 1
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all 32 iterations, `j` will be 31, `n` will be 1 (since it starts at 32 and decreases by 1 each iteration until it reaches 1), and `suf` will be a list of 32 sublists. Each sublist `suf[i]` will contain two elements. The first element of each sublist will represent the count of times the expression `(cur >> i & 1)` was false, and the second element will represent the count of times it was true across all iterations of the outer loop for `i` from 31 down to 1.
    #
    #This means that for each bit position `i` from 0 to 31, `suf[i][0]` will hold the total number of times the bit at position `i` in `cur` was 0, and `suf[i][1]` will hold the total number of times the bit at position `i` in `cur` was 1, across all iterations of the loop.
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        y = arr[i - 1]
        
        k = y.bit_length() - 1
        
        ans += pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]
        
        c = prefix[i]
        
        for j in range(32):
            if c >> j & 1:
                pre[j][1] += 1
                suf[j][1] -= 1
            else:
                pre[j][0] += 1
                suf[j][0] -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all 32 iterations, `j` will be 32, `n` will be 1, and `suf` will be a list of 32 sublists. Each sublist `suf[i]` will contain two elements: the first element will be -1 (indicating that the expression `(cur >> i & 1)` was false for the last iteration), and the second element will be 0 (indicating that the expression was true 0 times). `pre` will also be a list of 32 sublists, where each sublist `pre[i]` will contain two elements: the first element will be 0 (indicating that the expression `(cur >> i & 1)` was false 0 times), and the second element will be 32 (indicating that the expression was true 32 times). `ans` will be the sum of `pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]` for all `k` from 0 to 31, which simplifies to 0 because `suf[i][0]` is -1 and `suf[i][1]` is 0, and `pre[i][0]` is 0 and `pre[i][1]` is 32, making each term in the sum equal to 0.
    #
    #In natural language: After the loop completes all 32 iterations, `j` will be 32, `n` will be 1, and both `pre` and `suf` will be lists where each sublist contains 0 and 32 for the first and second elements respectively, indicating that the expression `(cur >> i & 1)` was true for all iterations for each bit position. The value of `ans` will be 0 because the contributions from `pre` and `suf` cancel each other out.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each t, a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). It constructs a prefix XOR array and then uses this array to compute a value based on bit counts. Finally, it prints the computed value, which turns out to be 0 for all test cases.
