Output State: **`j` is 32; `pre[32][0]` is 1; `suf[32][0]` is -2; `suf[32][1]` is unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `suf[j][0] -= 1` decrements the value of `suf[j][0]` by 1. Given that `j` is 32 and the initial value of `suf[32][0]` is -1, after executing the code, `suf[32][0]` becomes -2. The other variables remain unchanged.
