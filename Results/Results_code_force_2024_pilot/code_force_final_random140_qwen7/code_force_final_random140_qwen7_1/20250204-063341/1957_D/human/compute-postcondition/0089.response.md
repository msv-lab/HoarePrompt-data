Output State: **`i` is 2; `n` is 1; `y` is `arr[0]`; `k` is 0; `ans` is `pre[0][0] * suf[0][0] + pre[0][1] * suf[0][1]; `c` is `prefix[1]`.**

Explanation: The code `c = prefix[i]` assigns the value of `prefix[i]` to the variable `c`. Given that `i` was initially 1, after executing this line, `i` becomes 2 (since array indices typically start from 0). The value of `c` is now set to `prefix[1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
