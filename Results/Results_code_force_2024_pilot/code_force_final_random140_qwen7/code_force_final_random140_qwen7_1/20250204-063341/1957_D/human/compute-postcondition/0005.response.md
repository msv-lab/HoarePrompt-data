Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables and their initial states:**
   - `v` is the first element of `arr`.
   - `prefix` is a list where the second element is `v ^ prefix[0]`.

2. **Understand the loop condition:**
   - The loop iterates over each element `v` in the list `arr`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration:**
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
   - `arr` is a non-empty list of integers.
   - `v` is the first element of `arr`.
   - `prefix` is a list where the second element is `v ^ prefix[0]`.

4. **Analyze the loop head:**
   - The loop variable `v` is being updated to the next element in the list `arr`.

5. **Adjust the states for the next iteration:**
   - Since `v` is the next element in the list `arr`, the new value of `v` will be the second element of `arr`.
   - The `prefix` list remains unchanged because it is initialized based on the first element of `arr`.

6. **Formulate the new state:**
   - `t` remains the same as it is not involved in the loop.
   - `n` remains the same as it is not involved in the loop.
   - `arr` is now a list with its first element replaced by the second element.
   - `v` is now the second element of `arr`.
   - `prefix` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `arr` is a non-empty list of integers with the first element replaced by the second element, `v` is the second element of `arr`, `prefix` is a list where the second element is `v ^ prefix[0]`**.
