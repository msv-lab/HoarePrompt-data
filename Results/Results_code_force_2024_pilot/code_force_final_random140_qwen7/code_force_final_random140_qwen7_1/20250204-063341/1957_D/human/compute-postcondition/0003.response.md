Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop is iterating over the elements of the list `arr`. Therefore, the objects involved in the loop head are `v` (the variable used in the loop) and `arr`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer.
   - `v` is the variable that will take on the value of each element in `arr` during each iteration of the loop.

3. **Understand the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `arr` must contain at least one element because the loop iterates over each element in `arr`.
   - The loop will start with `v` being the first element of `arr`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `arr` is a list of integers, we need to ensure that it contains at least one element. This means that the input string should result in a non-empty list when split and converted.
   - The variable `v` will take on the value of the first element of `arr` during the first iteration of the loop.

Given the above points, we need to adjust the state to ensure that the loop can execute. Specifically, we need to ensure that `arr` is not empty and that `v` is set to the first element of `arr`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `v` is the first element of `arr`**.
