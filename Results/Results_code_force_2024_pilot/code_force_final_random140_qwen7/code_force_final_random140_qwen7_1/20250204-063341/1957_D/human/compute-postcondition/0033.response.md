Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` is 32, `suf[1][0]` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `suf[j][0] += 1` increments the value of `suf[j][0]` by 1. Given the initial state where `j` is 1, the value of `suf[1][0]` is incremented from its initial value (which is 0, since no other value was specified) to 1. The values of `j`, `n`, and the other elements of `suf` remain unchanged.
