Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variable `j` and the range `range(32)`. This means the loop will iterate over values of `j` from 0 to 31.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `j`**: The initial state before the loop starts is given as `j` is 31.

3. **Adjust the State of `j`**: Since the loop starts with `j` being 31, and the loop will iterate from 0 to 31, we need to ensure that `j` is set to 0 at the beginning of the loop. Therefore, we need to adjust `j` to be 0.

4. **Check Other Variables**: The other variables (`cur`, `suf`, `i`, and `n`) are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is `j` to be 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`j` is 0**
