Output State: **`j` is 2; `suf[1][1]` is decremented by 1; `suf[1][0]` remains unchanged; `pre[2][1]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `suf[j][1] -= 1` decrements the value of `suf[j][1]` by 1. Given that `j` is 2, the correct line should be `suf[2][1] -= 1`, but since the initial state specifies `suf[j][1]` (which is `suf[2][1]`), we directly decrement it. The other variables (`suf[1][1]`, `suf[1][0]`, and `pre[2][1]`) remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
