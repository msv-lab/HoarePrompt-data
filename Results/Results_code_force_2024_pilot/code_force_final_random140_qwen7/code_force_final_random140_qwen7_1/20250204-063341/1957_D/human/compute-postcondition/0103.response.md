Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is 1, `y` is `arr[0]`, `k` is 0, `ans` is `pre[0][0] * suf[0][0] + pre[0][1] * suf[0][1]`, `c` is `prefix[1]`, `j` is 3, `pre[3][1]` is increased by 1, `suf[3][1]` is decreased by 1**.

The code `suf[j][1] -= 1` decreases the value of `suf[j][1]` by 1. Given that `j` is 3, the value of `suf[3][1]` is decreased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
