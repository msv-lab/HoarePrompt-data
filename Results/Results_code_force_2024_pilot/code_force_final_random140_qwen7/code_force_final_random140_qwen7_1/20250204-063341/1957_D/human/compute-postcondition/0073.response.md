Output State: **`j` is 1, `suf[0][0]` is 1, and `suf[1][0]` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `suf[j][0] += 1` increments the value of `suf[j][0]` by 1. Given that `j` is 1, `suf[1][0]` is incremented by 1. Initially, `suf[0][0]` is 1 (as per the initial state condition), and since no other conditions or changes affect `suf[0][0]` or `suf[1][0]`, the updated value of `suf[1][0]` is 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
