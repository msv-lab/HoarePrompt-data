Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `j` is 0
- `n` is 32
- The postcondition: If `(cur >> j & 1)` is True, then `suf[0][1]` is 1. Otherwise, `suf[0][0]` is 1.

### Loop Head
The loop is defined as:
```python
for j in range(32):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
- The loop variable `j` ranges from 0 to 31.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 0.
- The loop will increment `j` by 1 in each iteration.

### Next Iteration
- Since `j` starts at 0 and increments by 1, the next value of `j` will be 1.
- The value of `n` remains unchanged at 32.
- The postcondition needs to be checked for `j = 1`.

### Adjusting the State
- `j` will be incremented to 1.
- `n` remains 32.
- The postcondition will be evaluated for `j = 1`.

### Final State
- `j` is 1.
- `n` is 32.
- The postcondition will be checked for `j = 1`.

### Answer
State: **`j` is 1, `n` is 32, if `(cur >> 1 & 1)` is True, then `suf[0][1]` is 1. Otherwise, `suf[0][0]` is 1.**
