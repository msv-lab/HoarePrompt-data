Output State: After the loop executes all 32 iterations, `j` will be 31, and `n` will remain 32. For each `j` from 0 to 31, `suf[j][1]` will contain the count of positions where the bit at position `j` in `cur` is 1, and `suf[j][0]` will contain the count of positions where the bit at position `j` is 0. 

This means that `suf` will be a list of 32 lists, where each sublist contains two elements: the number of 1s and the number of 0s for each bit position from 0 to 31 in the binary representation of `cur`.
