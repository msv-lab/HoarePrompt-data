Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `j` which ranges from `0` to `31`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `j < 32`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `j` is 1.
   - `cur` is an integer (its value is not specified but it does not change within the loop head).
   - `suf` is a list where `suf[0][0]` is 2 and `suf[0][1]` is 1 if the value of `(cur >> 1 & 1)` is true, otherwise `suf[0][1]` is 2 if the value of `(cur >> 1 & 1)` is false.

4. **Update the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `j` by 1 each time it executes, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `2`.
   - The values of `cur` and `suf` remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop head.

5. **Formulate the New State**:
   - `j` will be `2`.
   - `cur` remains the same.
   - `suf` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`j` is 2, `cur` is an integer, and `suf` is a list where `suf[0][0]` is 2 and `suf[0][1]` is 1 if the value of `(cur >> 1 & 1)` is true, otherwise `suf[0][1]` is 2 if the value of `(cur >> 1 & 1)` is false**.
