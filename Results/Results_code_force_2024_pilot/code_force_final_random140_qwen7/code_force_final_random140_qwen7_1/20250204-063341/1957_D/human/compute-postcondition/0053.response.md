Output State: **`j` is 1, `cur` is an integer, `suf` is a list where `suf[0][0]` is 2 and `suf[0][1]` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `suf[j][0] += 1` increments the value at `suf[j][0]` by 1. Given that `j` is 1 and initially `suf[0][0]` is 1 (since `suf[0][1]` is 1 if `(cur >> 1 & 1)` is true, otherwise `suf[0][0]` is 1), the value of `suf[0][0]` becomes 2. All other variables and their states remain unchanged.
