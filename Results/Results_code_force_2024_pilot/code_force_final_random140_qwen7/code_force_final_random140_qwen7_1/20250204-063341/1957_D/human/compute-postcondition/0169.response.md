Output State: **`j` is 32; `pre[32][1]` is increased by 1; `suf[32][1]` is decreased by 1; `pre[32][0]` is 1; `suf[32][0]` is -1.**

Explanation: The code `suf[j][1] -= 1` decreases the value of `suf[j][1]` by 1. Given that `j` is 32, the value of `suf[32][1]` is decreased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
