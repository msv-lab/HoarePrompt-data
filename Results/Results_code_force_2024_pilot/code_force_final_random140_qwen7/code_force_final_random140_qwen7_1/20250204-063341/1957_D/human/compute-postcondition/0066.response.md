Output State: **`j` is 0; `suf[0][1]` is incremented by 1; the current value of `cur` shifted right by `j` bits and bitwise ANDed with 1 is greater than 0**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `suf[j][1]` by 1, where `j` is 0. So `suf[0][1]` is incremented by 1. The condition `cur >> j & 1 > 0` remains true because shifting `cur` right by `j` (which is 0) bits and performing a bitwise AND with 1 does not change the least significant bit of `cur`, which must be 1 for the condition to be true.
