Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `n` to `0` in steps of `-1`. This means `i` starts from `n` and decreases by 1 in each iteration until `i` becomes `0`.

3. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 31, `cur` is an integer, and `suf` is a list of 32 sublists. Each sublist `suf[i]` contains two elements: the count of times `(cur >> i & 1)` was false and the count of times it was true.

4. **Determine the Next Iteration State**:
   - Since the loop runs in reverse order (decreasing `i`), the next iteration will decrease `i` by 1 from its current value.
   - Given that `j` is 31 at the end of the previous iteration, `i` must have been 31 at the start of the previous iteration.
   - Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` will be 30.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is the starting point of the loop, which is 31.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be 30.
   - `n` will remain 31.

6. **Final State**:
   - `j` will remain 31 as it is not affected by the loop.
   - `cur` will still be an integer.
   - `suf` will still be a list of 32 sublists, each containing the same counts as before because the loop body is omitted and no changes are made to `suf`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`j` is 31, `cur` is an integer, `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, `i` is 30, `n` is 31**.
