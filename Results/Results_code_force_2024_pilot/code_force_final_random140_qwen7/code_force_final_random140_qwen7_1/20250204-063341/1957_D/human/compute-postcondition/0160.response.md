Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `j`. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `j`.

2. **Determine the Initial Value of `j`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 31.

3. **Determine the New Value of `j`**: Since the loop increments `j` by 1 each time it iterates, the new value of `j` will be `31 + 1 = 32`.

4. **Check the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `for j in range(32)`. This means `j` should range from 0 to 31. When `j` reaches 32, the loop will terminate.

5. **Adjust the States**: We need to adjust the state of `j` to reflect its new value after the next iteration.

**Final State**:
- `j` is now 32 (since it was 31 in the previous iteration and the loop increments `j` by 1).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`j` is 32**
