Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After the loop executes all 32 iterations, `j` will be 31, `n` will be 1, and `suf` will be a list of 32 sublists. Each sublist `suf[i]` will contain two elements. The first element of each sublist will represent the count of times the expression `(cur >> i & 1)` was false, and the second element will represent the count of times it was true across all iterations of the outer loop for `i` from 31 down to 1. `ans` will be 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    y = arr[i - 1]
    k = y.bit_length() - 1
    ans += pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]
    c = prefix[i]
    for j in range(32):
        if c >> j & 1:
            pre[j][1] += 1
            suf[j][1] -= 1
        else:
            pre[j][0] += 1
            suf[j][0] -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `i` is 2, `n` is 1, `y` is `arr[0]`, `k` is 0, `ans` is `pre[0][0] * suf[0][0] + pre[0][1] * suf[0][1]`, `c` is `prefix[1]`, `j` is 32.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all 32 iterations, the variable `j` will have reached 32. The loop does not modify `i`, `n`, `y`, `k`, `ans`, or `c` directly within its body. Therefore, these variables retain their initial values. The loop modifies the `pre` and `suf` arrays based on the bits of `c` (which is `prefix[1]`). Since the loop runs 32 times, it processes each bit of `c` exactly once. Given the description of the loop's behavior, after 32 iterations, every bit of `c` will have been processed, but the exact values of `pre` and `suf` depend on the binary representation of `c`. However, since no specific values for `c` were provided, we can only state that `j` will be 32 after the loop completes.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `j` is 31, `c` is an integer, `pre[31][1]` is either incremented by 1 or remains unchanged, `suf[31][1]` is either decremented by 1 or remains unchanged, `pre[j][0]` ranges from 1 to 32, and `suf[j][0]` ranges from 0 to 31.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After the loop executes all the iterations, `j` will be 32, `pre[32][0]` will be 1, `suf[32][0]` will be -1, and `suf[32][1]` will be 0 if `c >> 32 & 1` was false during the last iteration, or -1 if `c >> 32 & 1` was true during the last iteration. The value of `ans` will be the sum of `pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]` for all `k` from 0 to 31, plus any additional contributions from the final state of `pre[32]` and `suf[32]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
