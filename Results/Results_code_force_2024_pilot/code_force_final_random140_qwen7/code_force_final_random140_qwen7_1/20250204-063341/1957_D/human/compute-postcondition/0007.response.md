Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `v` and `arr`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**:
   - The loop iterates over each element in the list `arr`.
   - Initially, `v` is set to the second element of `arr`.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `v` is the second element of `arr`.
   - The loop will proceed to the next element in `arr` for the next iteration.

4. **Update the state**:
   - Since `v` is the current element being processed, in the next iteration, `v` will be the next element in the list `arr`.
   - The list `arr` remains unchanged within the loop body, so its state does not change.

Given these points, let's update the state:

- `t` remains a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` remains an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `arr` remains a non-empty list of integers with the first element replaced by the second element.
- `v` changes to the next element in `arr`.
- `prefix` remains as it is because it is updated inside the loop body based on the current value of `v`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `arr` is a non-empty list of integers with the first element replaced by the second element, `v` is the next element in `arr`, and `prefix` is a list where the second element is `v ^ prefix[0]` and has an additional element which is `v ^ prefix[-1]`**.
