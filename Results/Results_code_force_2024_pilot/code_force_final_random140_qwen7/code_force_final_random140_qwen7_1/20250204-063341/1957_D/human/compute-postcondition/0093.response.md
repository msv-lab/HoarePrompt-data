Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is 1, `y` is `arr[0]`, `k` is 0, `ans` is `pre[0][0] * suf[0][0] + pre[0][1] * suf[0][1]`, `c` is `prefix[1]`, `pre[j][1]` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `pre[j][1] += 1` increments the value of `pre[j][1]` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `j` is such that when `j` is bitwise right shifted by `c` and ANDed with 1, the result is 1, which means `j` must be an odd number since shifting an odd number right by any amount and then ANDing with 1 will yield 1. However, the exact value of `j` is not specified, so we only know that `pre[j][1]` has been incremented by 1.
