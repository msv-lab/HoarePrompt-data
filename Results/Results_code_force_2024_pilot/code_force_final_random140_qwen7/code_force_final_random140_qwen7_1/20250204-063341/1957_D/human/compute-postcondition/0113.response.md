Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` is 1, `y` is `arr[0]`, `k` is 0, `ans` is `pre[0][0] * suf[0][0] + pre[0][1] * suf[0][1]`, `c` is `prefix[1]`, `j` is 4, if the bit at position 4 of `prefix[1]` is 1, then `pre[3][1]` is increased by 1 and `suf[4][1]` is decreased by 1; if the bit at position 4 of `prefix[1]` is 0, then `suf[4][0]` is decreased by 1.
