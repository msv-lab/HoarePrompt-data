Output State: **`j` is 0, `n` is 32, `suf[0][1]` is 1**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `suf[j][1]` by 1. Given that `j` is 0 and initially `suf[0][1]` is True (which we interpret as 1 in integer context), after executing `suf[j][1] += 1`, `suf[0][1]` becomes 2 - 1 (since True is treated as 1). However, since the initial state specifies `suf[0][1]` as True, we directly increment it by 1, making it 2 - 1 = 1. The values of `j` and `n` remain unchanged.
