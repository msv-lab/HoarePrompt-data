Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is 1, `y` is `arr[0]`, `k` is 0, `ans` is `pre[0][0] * suf[0][0] + pre[0][1] * suf[0][1]`, `c` is `prefix[1]`, `j` is 0, `pre[0][0]` is 1**.

Explanation: The code `pre[j][0] += 1` increments the value of `pre[j][0]` by 1. Given that `j` is 0, the value of `pre[0][0]` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
