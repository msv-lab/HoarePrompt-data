Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `j` is 0
- Either `suf[0][1]` is incremented by 1 and the current value of `cur` shifted right by `j` bits and bitwise ANDed with 1 is greater than 0, or `suf[0][0]` is 1.

### Loop Head
The loop is defined as:
```python
for j in range(32):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Variable `j`:**
   - The loop starts with `j = 0` and increments `j` by 1 in each iteration.
   - After the previous iteration, `j` is 0.

2. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop continues as long as `j < 32`.
   - Since `j` is currently 0, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than 32.

3. **Adjusting States:**
   - The only variable in the loop head is `j`.
   - Therefore, `j` will be incremented by 1 from 0 to 1.

### New State at the Start of the Next Iteration
- `j` will be 1 (since it was 0 and incremented by 1).
- The condition for `suf[0][1]` and `suf[0][0]` remains the same as they are not affected by the loop incrementing `j`.

### Final State
State: **`j` is 1, and either `suf[0][1]` is incremented by 1 and the current value of `cur` shifted right by `j` bits and bitwise ANDed with 1 is greater than 0, or `suf[0][0]` is 1.**
