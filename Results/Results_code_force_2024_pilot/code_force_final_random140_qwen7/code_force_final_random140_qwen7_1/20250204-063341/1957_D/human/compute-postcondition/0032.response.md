Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` is 32, `suf[j][1]` is 2**.

Explanation: Initially, `j` is 1, `n` is 32, and if `(cur >> 1 & 1)` is True, then `suf[0][1]` is 1. Otherwise, `suf[0][0]` is 1. The code snippet updates `suf[j][1]` by adding 1 to its current value. Since `j` is 1, it updates `suf[1][1]`. Given the initial state, `suf[0][1]` is 1 (if `(cur >> 1 & 1)` was True), so `suf[1][1]` starts from 0 and is incremented by 1, making `suf[1][1]` equal to 1. After executing `suf[j][1] += 1`, `suf[1][1]` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
