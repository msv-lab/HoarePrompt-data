Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `v` is the first element of `arr`, `prefix` is a list where the second element is `v ^ prefix[0]`**.

Explanation: The code appends the bitwise XOR of the first element of the list `arr` (`v`) and the last element of the `prefix` list (which is initially just `v` since `prefix` starts empty) to the `prefix` list. Since `prefix` was initially empty, `prefix[-1]` is equivalent to `v`, so the second element of `prefix` becomes `v ^ v`, which is `0`. All other variables remain unchanged.
