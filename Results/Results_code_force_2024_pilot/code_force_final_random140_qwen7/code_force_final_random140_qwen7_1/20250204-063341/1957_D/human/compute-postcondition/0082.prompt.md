Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After the loop executes all 32 iterations, `i` is 31; `pre[0][0]` is 32; `pre[2][0]` is 32; `pre[31][0]` is 32.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n, 0, -1):
    cur = prefix[i]
    for j in range(32):
        if cur >> j & 1:
            suf[j][1] += 1
        else:
            suf[j][0] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After the loop executes all 32 iterations, `j` will be 31, `n` remains 32, and `suf` will be a list of lists where each sublist has two elements. The first element of each sublist represents the count of positions where `cur >> k & 1` was False, and the second element represents the count where it was True for `k` ranging from 0 to 31.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the loop executes all 32 iterations, `j` will be 31, `cur` will still be an integer, and `suf` will be a list of 32 sublists. Each sublist `suf[i]` will contain two elements. The first element of each sublist will represent the count of times the expression `(cur >> i & 1)` was false, and the second element will represent the count of times it was true.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After the loop executes all 32 iterations, `j` will be 31. For each `j` from 0 to 31, if `cur >> j & 1` is true, `suf[j][1]` will be incremented by 1; otherwise, `suf[j][0]` will be incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
