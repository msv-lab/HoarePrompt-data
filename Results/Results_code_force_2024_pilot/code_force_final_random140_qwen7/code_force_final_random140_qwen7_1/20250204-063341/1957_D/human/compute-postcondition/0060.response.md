Postcondition: `j` is 2, `cur` is an integer, and `suf` is a list. If the value of `(cur >> 1 & 1)` is true, then `suf[0][0]` is 2 (or 3 depending on the if-else condition) and `suf[0][1]` is 1. If the value of `(cur >> 1 & 1)` is false, then `suf[0][0]` is 2 (or 3 depending on the if-else condition) and `suf[0][1]` is 2. Additionally, `suf[2][1]` is always 1.
