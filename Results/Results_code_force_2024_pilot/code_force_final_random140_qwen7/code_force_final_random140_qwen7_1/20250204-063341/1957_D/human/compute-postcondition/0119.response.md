Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is 1, `y` is `arr[1]`, `k` is `arr[1].bit_length() - 1`, `ans` is `pre[0][0] * suf[0][0] + pre[0][1] * suf[0][1]`, `c` is `prefix[1]`, `j` is 32**

Explanation: The code `k = y.bit_length() - 1` calculates the bit length of the variable `y` (which is `arr[1]`) and subtracts 1 from it. The value of `y` remains unchanged, so it is still `arr[1]`. The value of `k` is now set to the bit length of `arr[1]` minus 1. All other variables remain in their original states.
