Output State: **`j` is 32; `pre[32][0]` is 1; `suf[32][0]` is -1; `suf[32][1]` is unchanged.**

Explanation: The initial state sets `j` to 32. The condition `c >> 32 & 1` is not specified, so we assume it is false (since no specific value of `c` is given, we consider the general case). Therefore, `pre[32][0]` is set to 1 and `suf[32][0]` is set to -1. The code `pre[j][0] += 1` increments `pre[32][0]` by 1, making it 1. Since the condition was false, `suf[32][1]` remains unchanged from its initial state.
