Output State: **`j` is 2, `cur` is an integer, and `suf` is a list where `suf[0][0]` is 2 and `suf[0][1]` is 1 if the value of `(cur >> 1 & 1)` is true, otherwise `suf[0][1]` is 2 if the value of `(cur >> 1 & 1)` is false; `suf[2][1]` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `suf[j][1] += 1` increments the value of `suf[j][1]` by 1. Given that `j` is 2, it updates `suf[2][1]` to 1. The values of `j`, `cur`, and the initial conditions of `suf` remain unchanged.
