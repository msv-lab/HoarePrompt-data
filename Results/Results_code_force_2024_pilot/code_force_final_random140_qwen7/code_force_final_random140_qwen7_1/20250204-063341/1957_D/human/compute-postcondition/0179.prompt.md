You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    prefix = [0]
    for v in arr:
        prefix.append(v ^ prefix[-1])
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `v` is the last element of `arr`, and `prefix` is a list where each element is the cumulative XOR of all previous elements in `arr`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `arr` contains the original list of integers, and `prefix` is a list where each element is the result of XORing all the elements in `arr` up to that point in the list. The final element in `prefix` will be the cumulative XOR of all elements in `arr`.
    pre = [[0, 0] for _ in range(32)]
    suf = [[0, 0] for _ in range(32)]
    for i in range(32):
        pre[i][0] += 1
        
    #State: After the loop executes all 32 iterations, `i` is 31; `pre[0][0]` is 32; `pre[2][0]` is 32; `pre[31][0]` is 32.
    for i in range(n, 0, -1):
        cur = prefix[i]
        
        for j in range(32):
            if cur >> j & 1:
                suf[j][1] += 1
            else:
                suf[j][0] += 1
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all 32 iterations, `j` will be 31, `n` will be 1 (since it starts at 32 and decreases by 1 each iteration until it reaches 1), and `suf` will be a list of 32 sublists. Each sublist `suf[i]` will contain two elements. The first element of each sublist will represent the count of times the expression `(cur >> i & 1)` was false, and the second element will represent the count of times it was true across all iterations of the outer loop for `i` from 31 down to 1.
    #
    #This means that for each bit position `i` from 0 to 31, `suf[i][0]` will hold the total number of times the bit at position `i` in `cur` was 0, and `suf[i][1]` will hold the total number of times the bit at position `i` in `cur` was 1, across all iterations of the loop.
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        y = arr[i - 1]
        
        k = y.bit_length() - 1
        
        ans += pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]
        
        c = prefix[i]
        
        for j in range(32):
            if c >> j & 1:
                pre[j][1] += 1
                suf[j][1] -= 1
            else:
                pre[j][0] += 1
                suf[j][0] -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all 32 iterations, `j` will be 32, `n` will be 1, and `suf` will be a list of 32 sublists. Each sublist `suf[i]` will contain two elements: the first element will be -1 (indicating that the expression `(cur >> i & 1)` was false for the last iteration), and the second element will be 0 (indicating that the expression was true 0 times). `pre` will also be a list of 32 sublists, where each sublist `pre[i]` will contain two elements: the first element will be 0 (indicating that the expression `(cur >> i & 1)` was false 0 times), and the second element will be 32 (indicating that the expression was true 32 times). `ans` will be the sum of `pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]` for all `k` from 0 to 31, which simplifies to 0 because `suf[i][0]` is -1 and `suf[i][1]` is 0, and `pre[i][0]` is 0 and `pre[i][1]` is 32, making each term in the sum equal to 0.
    #
    #In natural language: After the loop completes all 32 iterations, `j` will be 32, `n` will be 1, and both `pre` and `suf` will be lists where each sublist contains 0 and 32 for the first and second elements respectively, indicating that the expression `(cur >> i & 1)` was true for all iterations for each bit position. The value of `ans` will be 0 because the contributions from `pre` and `suf` cancel each other out.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: 0
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases, where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each t, a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The function returns nothing explicitly but processes the data according to the given constraints and relationships.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
