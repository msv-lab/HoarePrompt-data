Output State: **`i` is 0; `pre[0][0]` is 1**

Explanation: The code `pre[i][0] += 1` increments the value at `pre[i][0]` by 1. Given that `i` is 0, it means the value at `pre[0][0]` is incremented by 1. Initially, `pre[0][0]` was presumably 0 (since no other initialization is given), so after executing the code, `pre[0][0]` becomes 1. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 0.
