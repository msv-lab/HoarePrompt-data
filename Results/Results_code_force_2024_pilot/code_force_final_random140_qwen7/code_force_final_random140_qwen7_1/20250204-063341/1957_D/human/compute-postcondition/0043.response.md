Output State: **`j` is 31, `n` is 32, `suf` is a list of lists where each sublist has two elements, `i` is 1, `cur` is `prefix[1]`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `prefix[i]` to the variable `cur`. Since `i` is 1, `cur` is now set to `prefix[1]`. The values of `j`, `n`, `suf`, and `i` remain unchanged.
