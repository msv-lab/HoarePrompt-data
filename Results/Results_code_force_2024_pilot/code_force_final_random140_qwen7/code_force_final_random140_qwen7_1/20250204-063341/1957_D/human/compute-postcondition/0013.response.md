Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`. The loop runs from `0` to `31`, inclusive.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: Since the loop starts at `0` and ends at `31`, the initial value of `i` should be `0`.

3. **Check Other Variables**: The other variables (`t`, `n`, `arr`, `v`, `prefix`, `pre`, `suf`) are not directly involved in the loop condition or the loop body, so their values do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given this analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the initial value of `i`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0**
