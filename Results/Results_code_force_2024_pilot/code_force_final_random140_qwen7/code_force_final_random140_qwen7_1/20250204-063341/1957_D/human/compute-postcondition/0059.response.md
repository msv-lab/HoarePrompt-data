Postcondition: `j` is 2, `cur` is an integer, and `suf` is a list. If the value of `(cur >> 1 & 1)` is true, then `suf[0][0]` is 2 and `suf[0][1]` is 1, and `suf[2][1]` is 1. If the value of `(cur >> 1 & 1)` is false, then `suf[0][0]` is 3 and `suf[0][1]` is 1 if the value of `(cur >> 1 & 1)` is true, otherwise `suf[0][1]` is 2.
