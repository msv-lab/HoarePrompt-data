Output State: After the loop executes all 32 iterations, `j` will be 31, `n` will be 1 (since it starts at 32 and decreases by 1 each iteration until it reaches 1), and `suf` will be a list of 32 sublists. Each sublist `suf[i]` will contain two elements. The first element of each sublist will represent the count of times the expression `(cur >> i & 1)` was false, and the second element will represent the count of times it was true across all iterations of the outer loop for `i` from 31 down to 1.

This means that for each bit position `i` from 0 to 31, `suf[i][0]` will hold the total number of times the bit at position `i` in `cur` was 0, and `suf[i][1]` will hold the total number of times the bit at position `i` in `cur` was 1, across all iterations of the loop.
