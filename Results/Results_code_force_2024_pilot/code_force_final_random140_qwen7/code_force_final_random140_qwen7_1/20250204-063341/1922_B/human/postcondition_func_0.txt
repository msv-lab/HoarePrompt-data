The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer t, another integer n, and a list of n integers a. For each test case, it sorts the list a and calculates the cumulative sum of specific values based on the sorted list. The function then prints the result for each test case. The final state of the program is that it outputs the calculated results for all test cases.
