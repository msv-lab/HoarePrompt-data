Output State: **`i` is -1, `current_index` is `current_index + n`, `a` is a sorted list containing all elements from `data` starting from `current_index - n` to `current_index - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. The values of `i` and `current_index` remain unchanged. The list `a` now contains elements from `data` starting from `current_index - n` to `current_index - 1`, and these elements are sorted.
