Output State: **`current_index` is 2, `t` is an integer equal to `data[0]`, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, and `results` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `results`. This does not affect the values of `current_index`, `t`, or `n`, nor does it modify the content of the `data` list. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
