Output State: **`i` is 7, `n` must be greater than 6, and `ans` is the previous value of `ans` plus `hashing[a[6]]`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += hashing[a[i]]` increments `ans` by the value of `hashing[a[i]]`. Given that `i` was initially 6, `a[i]` now refers to `a[6]`. Since `a[6]` is not in `hashing`, `hashing[a[6]]` is set to 0. Therefore, `ans` is incremented by 0. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
