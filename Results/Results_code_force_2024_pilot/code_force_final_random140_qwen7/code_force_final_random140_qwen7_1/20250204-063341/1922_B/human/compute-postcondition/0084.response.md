Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` is greater than 4, `a` is a list of integers where the element at index 3 is 0, and `hashing` is a dictionary where the key corresponding to the element at index 3 of `a` (which is 0) is mapped to 0, and `hashing[0]` is now 4.**

Explanation: The code `hashing[a[i]] += i` updates the value of `hashing` at the key `a[i]` by adding `i` to its current value. Given that `i` is 4 and `a[3]` is 0, the code effectively does `hashing[0] += 4`. Since `hashing[0]` was initially 0, it is now updated to 4. All other variables remain unchanged.
