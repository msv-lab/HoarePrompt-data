Output State: `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `a` is a list with three elements where the first element is `int(data[current_index-2])`, the second element is `int(data[current_index-1])`, and the third element is `int(data[current_index])`, and `current_index` is increased by 1.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `n` should be at least 3 (since the loop runs `n` times), `i` will be 3 (as it increments by 1 each time through the loop), `a` will contain the first three elements from `data` starting from `data[current_index-2]` (because `current_index` is incremented after each append operation), and `current_index` will be increased by 1 compared to its value at the start of the last iteration.
