Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `current_index` is `current_index + 2`, `a` is a list with the element `data[current_index - 1]` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `current_index += 1` increments the value of `current_index` by 1. Initially, `current_index` was `current_index + 1`. After the increment, `current_index` becomes `current_index + 2`. The other variables (`i` and `a`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
