Output State: **`i` is `n`, `current_index` is `current_index + 2`, `a` is a list with the elements `data[current_index - 1]` and `int(data[current_index])` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code snippet appends `int(data[current_index])` to the list `a`. Initially, `a` contains the element `data[current_index - 1]`. After appending `int(data[current_index])`, `a` now contains both `data[current_index - 1]` and `int(data[current_index])`. The values of `i` and `current_index` remain unchanged from their initial states.
