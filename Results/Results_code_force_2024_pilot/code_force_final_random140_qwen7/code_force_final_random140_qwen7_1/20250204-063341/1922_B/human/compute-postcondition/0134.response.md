Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n - 2`. This means the loop will execute as long as `i < n - 1`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `n - 2`.
   - `n` is at least 1.
   - `ans` is the previous value of `ans` plus `hashing[a[i]]` if `a[i] == a[i + 1]`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n - 2`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `n - 1`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `i < n - 1`. Since `i` is now `n - 1`, the loop will not execute again unless `n` is increased.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` should be updated to `n - 1`.
   - `n` remains the same (at least 1).
   - `ans` remains unchanged unless the condition `a[i] == a[i + 1]` is met, but since `i` is now `n - 1`, `i + 1` would be `n`, which is out of bounds, so `ans` does not change.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is at least 1, and `ans` is the previous value of `ans`**.
