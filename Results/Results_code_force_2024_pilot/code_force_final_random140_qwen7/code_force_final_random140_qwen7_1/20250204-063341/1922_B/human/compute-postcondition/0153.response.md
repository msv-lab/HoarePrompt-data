Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5), and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n). It returns a result based on the given inputs for each test case.**

This means the function `func_1` is designed to handle multiple test cases, where each test case includes an integer `t`, another integer `n`, and a list of `n` integers. The function processes these inputs and returns a result specific to each test case, adhering to the constraints provided.
