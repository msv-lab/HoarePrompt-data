Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, and `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.**

Explanation: The code `data = input().split()` reads a line of input from the standard input (replaced by `sys.stdin.read`), splits it into a list of strings using whitespace as the delimiter, and assigns this list to the variable `data`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
