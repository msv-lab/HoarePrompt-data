Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current values**:
   - `current_index` is 6.
   - `t` is an integer equal to `data[0]` and must be a positive integer.
   - `n` is an integer equal to `data[2]` and must be greater than 0.
   - `results` is an empty list.
   - `hashing` is an empty dictionary.
   - `a` is `[int(data[4])]`.
   - `i` is 0.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` must be greater than 0.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1.
   - `n` must remain the same and still be greater than 0.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `current_index` remains unchanged at 6.
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is derived from `data[0]` and must be a positive integer.
   - `n` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 0.
   - `results` remains an empty list.
   - `hashing` remains an empty dictionary.
   - `a` remains `[int(data[4])]`.
   - `i` is now 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`current_index` is 6, `t` is an integer equal to `data[0]` and must be a positive integer, `n` is an integer equal to `data[2]` and must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `hashing` is an empty dictionary, `a` is `[int(data[4])]`, `i` is 1**
