Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the list `a`, `hashing` is a set of integers where the value of `hashing[a[i]]` is increased by `i`, and `ans` is increased by the value of `hashing[a[i]]`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += hashing[a[i]]` increments the value of `ans` by the value of `hashing[a[i]]`. The values of `a`, `i`, and `hashing` remain unchanged from their initial states. The only change is that `ans` is updated to include the value of `hashing[a[i]]`.
