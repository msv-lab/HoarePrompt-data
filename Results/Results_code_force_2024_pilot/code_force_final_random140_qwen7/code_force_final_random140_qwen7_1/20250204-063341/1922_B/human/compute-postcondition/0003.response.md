Output State: **`current_index` is 1, `t` is an integer equal to `data[0]`, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, and `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `data[current_index]` (which is `data[0]` since `current_index` is 0) to `t`. This changes the value of `t` to the first element of the `data` list. The `current_index` is incremented by 1 because the value of `data[current_index]` was accessed, moving the index to the next position in the list. The values of `n` and the `data` list remain unchanged from the initial state.
