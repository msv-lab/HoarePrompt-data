Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`; `ans` is the previous value of `ans`; `hashing[a[i]]` is 0**

Explanation: The code updates the dictionary `hashing` by setting the value of `hashing[a[i]]` to 0. Here, `a[i]` refers to the element at index `i` in the list `a`. Since `i` is `n - 1`, `a[i]` is the last element in the list `a`. The value of `ans` remains unchanged from its previous value, and `i` also remains unchanged as no operation modifies its value.
