Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The key variables here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `n` is assigned to `data[current_index]`.
   - `i` is initialized to 0 (as per the `range(n)` syntax).

3. **Check if the loop can execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1 because `range(n)` will generate numbers from 0 to `n-1`.
   - `i` will start at 0 and increment in each iteration.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `n` is derived from `data[current_index]`, `current_index` must point to an index where `data[current_index]` is at least 1.
   - `i` will start at 0, so no adjustment is needed for `i`.

5. **Final state**:
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0 initially.

Given the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
