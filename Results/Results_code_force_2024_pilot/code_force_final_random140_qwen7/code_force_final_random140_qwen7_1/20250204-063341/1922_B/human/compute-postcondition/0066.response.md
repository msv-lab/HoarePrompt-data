Output State: `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `a` is a list with three elements where the first element is `int(data[current_index-2])`, the second element is `int(data[current_index-1])`, and the third element is `int(data[current_index])`, `current_index` is increased by 1.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `a` will contain the first `n` elements from `data` starting from `data[current_index - n]` to `data[current_index - 1]`, and `current_index` will be incremented by `n`. The variable `n` must be at least 3 for the loop to complete all its iterations as specified.
