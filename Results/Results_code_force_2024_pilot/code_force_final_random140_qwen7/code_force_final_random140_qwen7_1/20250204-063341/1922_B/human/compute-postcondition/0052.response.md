Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, the `hashing` dictionary is empty, the variable `ans` is the cumulative sum of the values in `hashing` for elements that are consecutive in the list `a`, the list `a` remains unchanged, the `results` list has appended the current value of `ans`, and `t` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The line `hashing = {}` initializes an empty dictionary named `hashing`. This means that the dictionary no longer contains any key-value pairs from its previous state. All other variables and lists remain unchanged from their initial state.
