Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 4, `a` is a list of integers where the element at index 3 is 0, and `hashing` is a dictionary where the key corresponding to the element at index 3 of `a` (which is 0) is mapped to 3. If `a[3]` is equal to `a[4]`, then `ans` is equal to 3. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.
