Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `current_index` is 2, `t` is an integer equal to `data[0]`, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, and `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    hashing = {}
    n = int(data[current_index])
    current_index += 1
    a = []
    for i in range(n):
        a.append(int(data[current_index]))
        current_index += 1
    a.sort()
    ans = 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if a[i] not in hashing:
            hashing[a[i]] = 0
        hashing[a[i]] += i
        if a[i] == a[i + 1]:
            ans += hashing[a[i]]
    results.append(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: All iterations of the loop have been executed, the variable `i` is now `n - 1`, the `hashing` dictionary contains the sum of indices for each unique element in the list `a` up to `i`, the variable `ans` is the cumulative sum of the values in `hashing` for elements that are consecutive in the list `a`, the list `a` remains unchanged, and the `results` list has appended the current value of `ans`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `i` is equal to `n-1`, the variable `n` is still greater than or equal to 3, the list `a` contains integers starting from `data[current_index - n]` to `data[current_index - 1]` as it did after the third iteration, but now `current_index` is increased by 3 for each iteration until `i` reaches `n-1`, the dictionary `hashing` has keys corresponding to elements in `a` up to `a[n-2]`, with their respective values updated according to the loop's logic, the variable `ans` is the sum of `hashing[a[i]]` for all consecutive equal elements found in `a` during the loop's execution, and the variable `results` is appended with the value of `ans`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `results` contains the value of `ans`, `i` is `n - 1`, `ans` contains the sum of `hashing[a[i]]` for each `i` where `a[i]` is equal to `a[i + 1]`, and `hashing[a[i]]` is updated based on the index `i` for each unique element encountered in the list `a` up to the second last element.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
