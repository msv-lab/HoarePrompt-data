Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `a` is a sorted list with the first three elements from `data` starting from `data[current_index - n]` to `data[current_index - 1]`, and `current_index` is increased by 3; `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if a[i] not in hashing:
        hashing[a[i]] = 0
    hashing[a[i]] += i
    if a[i] == a[i + 1]:
        ans += hashing[a[i]]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 4, `a` is a list of integers where the element at index 3 is 0, and `hashing` is a dictionary where the key corresponding to the element at index 3 of `a` (which is 0) is mapped to 3. If `a[3]` is equal to `a[4]`, then `ans` is equal to 3. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 4, `n` is greater than 4, `a` is a list of integers where the element at index 3 is 0, and `hashing` is a dictionary where the key corresponding to the element at index 3 of `a` (which is 0) is mapped to 0, and `ans` is equal to 4. If `a[i]` is equal to `a[i + 1]`, then the function does nothing.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 7, `n` must be greater than 6, and `ans` is the previous value of `ans` plus `hashing[a[6]]` if `a[i]` equals `a[i + 1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
