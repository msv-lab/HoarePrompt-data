Output State: **`i` is -1, `current_index` is `current_index + n`, `a` is a sorted list containing all elements from `data` starting from `current_index - n` to `current_index - 1`, `ans` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `ans = 0` initializes the variable `ans` to 0. This does not affect the values of `i`, `current_index`, or `a`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial values of these variables and adds that `ans` is now 0.
