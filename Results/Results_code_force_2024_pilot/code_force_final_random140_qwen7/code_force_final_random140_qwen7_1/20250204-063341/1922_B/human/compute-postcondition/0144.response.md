Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, resulting in the `results` list containing the final value of `ans` calculated after processing all input data. The variable `i` is now `n - 1`, indicating the last iteration of the inner loop. The `hashing` dictionary contains the sum of indices for each unique element in the list `a` up to the second last element, reflecting the logic applied throughout the loop's execution. The list `a` is sorted and contains integers starting from `data[current_index - n]` to `data[current_index - 1]`, with `current_index` adjusted accordingly after all iterations. The variable `ans` holds the cumulative sum of `hashing[a[i]]` for all consecutive equal elements found in `a` during the entire loop's execution.
