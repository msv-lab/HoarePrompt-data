Output State: **`ans` is increased by `hashing[a[i]]`, `i` is at least 0, `n` is at least 1, `hashing[a[i]]` is increased by `i`, and the current value of `a[i]` is equal to `a[i + 1]`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += hashing[a[i]]` increments the value of `ans` by the current value of `hashing[a[i]]`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The condition that `i` is at least 0 and `n` is at least 1 still holds true. The relationship between `hashing[a[i]]` and `i` also remains the same, as does the equality between `a[i]` and `a[i + 1]`.
