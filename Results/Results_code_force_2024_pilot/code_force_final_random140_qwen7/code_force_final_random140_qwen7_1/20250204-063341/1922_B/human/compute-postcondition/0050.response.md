Output State: **All iterations of the loop have been executed, the variable `i` is now `n - 1`, the `hashing` dictionary contains the sum of indices for each unique element in the list `a` up to `i`, the variable `ans` is the cumulative sum of the values in `hashing` for elements that are consecutive in the list `a`, the list `a` remains unchanged, and the `results` list has appended the current value of `ans`.**

This means that after executing the line `results.append(ans)`, the value of `ans` is added to the `results` list. All other conditions and values remain the same as the initial state, except for the addition of `ans` to `results`.
