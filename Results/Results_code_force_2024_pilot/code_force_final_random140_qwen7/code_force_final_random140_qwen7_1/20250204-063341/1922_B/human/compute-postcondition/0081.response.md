Output State: **`i` is 4; `n` is greater than 4; `a` is a list of integers where the element at index 3 is 0; `hashing` is a dictionary where the key corresponding to the element at index 3 of `a` (which is 0) is mapped to 0; if `a[3]` is equal to `a[4]`, then `ans` is equal to 0. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `hashing[a[i]] = 0` updates the dictionary `hashing` such that the key corresponding to the element at index `i` of list `a` (which is 0) is mapped to 0. Since `i` is 4, the element at index 4 of list `a` is updated in the dictionary. The other conditions and values remain unchanged.
