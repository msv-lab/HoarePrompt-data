Output State: **`current_index` is 2, `t` is an integer equal to `data[0]`, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, and `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `current_index` by 1. Initially, `current_index` was 1, so after executing `current_index += 1`, its value becomes 2. The values of `t`, `n`, and `data` remain unchanged from their initial states.
