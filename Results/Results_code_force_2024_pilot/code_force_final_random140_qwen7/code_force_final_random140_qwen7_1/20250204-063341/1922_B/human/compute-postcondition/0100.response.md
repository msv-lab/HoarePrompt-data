Output State: **`t` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `current_index` is increased by 3, the list `a` contains integers starting from `data[current_index - n]` to `data[current_index - 1]`, the dictionary `hashing` is empty, the variable `ans` is the sum of `hashing[a[i]]` for all consecutive equal elements found in `a` during the loop's execution, and the variable `results` is appended with the value of `ans`, `n` is an integer obtained from `data[current_index]`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `data[current_index]` to `n`, which is an integer. The other variables and their states remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the new value of `n`.
