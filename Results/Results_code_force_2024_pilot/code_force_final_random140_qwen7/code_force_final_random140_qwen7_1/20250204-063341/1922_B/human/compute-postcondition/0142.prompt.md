Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is -1, `current_index` is `current_index + n`, `a` is a sorted list containing all elements from `data` starting from `current_index - n` to `current_index - 1`, `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if a[i] not in hashing:
        hashing[a[i]] = 0
    hashing[a[i]] += i
    if a[i] == a[i + 1]:
        ans += hashing[a[i]]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is at least 0, `n` is at least 1, `hashing[a[i]]` is increased by `i`, and if `a[i]` is equal to `a[i + 1]`, then `ans` is increased by `hashing[a[i]]`. If `a[i]` is not equal to `a[i + 1]`, the values of `i`, `n`, `hashing[a[i]]`, and `ans` remain as they were after the increase by `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `n - 2`, `n` is at least 1, and `ans` is the previous value of `ans` plus `hashing[a[i]]`, because if `a[i]` equals `a[i + 1]`, then `ans` is incremented by `hashing[a[i]]`. There is no change in `ans` if the condition `a[i] == a[i + 1]` is not met.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `n - 2`, `ans` is the previous value of `ans`, and `hashing[a[i]]` is updated to `i + 1` if `a[i]` is not already in `hashing`. If `a[i]` equals `a[i + 1]`, then `ans` is incremented by `hashing[a[i]]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
