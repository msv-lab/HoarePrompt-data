Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 4, `a` is a list of integers where the element at index 3 is 0, `hashing` is a dictionary where the key corresponding to the element at index 3 of `a` (which is 0) is mapped to 3, and `ans` is equal to 3.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `ans` by adding the value of `hashing[a[i]]`. Given that `a[i]` (where `i` is 3) is 0, and the dictionary `hashing` maps the key 0 to 3, `ans` is incremented by 3. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
