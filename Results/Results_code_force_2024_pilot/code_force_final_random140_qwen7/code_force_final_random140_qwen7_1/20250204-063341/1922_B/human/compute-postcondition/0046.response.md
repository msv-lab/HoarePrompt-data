Output State: **`a` remains the same list of integers, `i` is now `i + 1`, `ans` is increased by `hashing[a[i]]`.**

Explanation: The variable `i` is incremented by 1, and `ans` is updated by adding the value of `hashing[a[i]]` to its current value. The list `a` and the dictionary `hashing` remain unchanged from their initial state.
