Output State: **`i` is at least 0, `n` must be at least 1, the current value of `a[i]` is now in `hashing` with the value 0.**

Explanation: The line `hashing[a[i]] = 0` assigns the value 0 to the key `a[i]` in the dictionary `hashing`. This means that the value of `a[i]` is now stored in `hashing` with the corresponding value 0. The conditions on `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
