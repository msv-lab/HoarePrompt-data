Output State: **`current_index` is 3, `t` is an integer equal to `data[0]` and must be a positive integer, `n` is an integer equal to `data[2]`, and `results` is an empty list, `hashing` is an empty dictionary.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(data[current_index])` updates the value of `n` by converting `data[current_index]` to an integer. Initially, `current_index` is 2, so `n` is set to `data[2]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
