Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(n - 1):`.
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 4.
   - `n` is greater than 4.
   - `a` is a list of integers where the element at index 3 is 0.
   - `hashing` is a dictionary where the key corresponding to the element at index 3 of `a` (which is 0) is mapped to 0.
   - `ans` is equal to 4.

3. **Determine the Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n - 1`.
   - Given that `i` is currently 4, for the loop to continue, `n - 1` must be greater than 4, meaning `n` must be greater than 5.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 5.
   - `n` must remain greater than 5 to allow the loop to continue.

5. **Consider the Loop Body:**
   - The loop body is omitted, but we know that if `a[i]` is equal to `a[i + 1]`, the function does nothing.
   - Since `i` is now 5, we need to check if `a[5]` is equal to `a[6]`. However, this condition does not affect the continuation of the loop itself.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 5, `n` must be greater than 5**
