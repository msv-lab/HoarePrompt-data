Postcondition: `a` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the list `a`, `hashing` is a set of integers where the value of `hashing[a[i]]` is increased by `i`, and `ans` is increased by the value of `hashing[a[i]]` if `a[i]` equals `a[i + 1]`. If `a[i]` does not equal `a[i + 1]`, the values of `a`, `i`, `hashing`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
