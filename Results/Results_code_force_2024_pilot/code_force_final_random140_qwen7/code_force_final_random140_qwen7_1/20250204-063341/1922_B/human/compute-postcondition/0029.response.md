Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the list `a`, and `hashing` is a set of integers where the value of `hashing[a[i]]` is increased by `i`.**

This means that if `a[i]` was already in `hashing`, its value in `hashing` is now its original value plus `i`. If `a[i]` was not in `hashing`, it is now added to `hashing` with a value of `i`. The lists `a` and the index `i` remain unchanged.
