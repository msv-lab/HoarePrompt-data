Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 3
   - `n` is greater than 4
   - `a` is a list of integers where the element at index 3 is 0
   - `hashing` is a dictionary where the key corresponding to the element at index 3 of `a` (which is 0) is mapped to 3
   - If `a[3]` is equal to `a[4]`, then `ans` is equal to 3. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - The loop condition is `i < n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3 and `n` is greater than 4.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 4.
   - Since `n` is greater than 4, it remains unchanged.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be 4.
   - `n` must still be greater than 4.
   - The values of `a`, `hashing`, and `ans` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head variables.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 4, `n` is greater than 4, `a` is a list of integers where the element at index 3 is 0, and `hashing` is a dictionary where the key corresponding to the element at index 3 of `a` (which is 0) is mapped to 3. If `a[3]` is equal to `a[4]`, then `ans` is equal to 3. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**
