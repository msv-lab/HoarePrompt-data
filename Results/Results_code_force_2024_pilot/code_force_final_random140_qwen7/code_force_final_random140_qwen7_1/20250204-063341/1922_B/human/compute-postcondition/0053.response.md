Output State: **`data[current_index]` is assigned to `n`, `hashing` dictionary is empty, `ans` is the cumulative sum of the values in `hashing` for elements that are consecutive in the list `a`, the list `a` remains unchanged, the `results` list has appended the current value of `ans`, and `t` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(data[current_index])` assigns the integer value of `data[current_index]` to the variable `n`. All other variables and their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
