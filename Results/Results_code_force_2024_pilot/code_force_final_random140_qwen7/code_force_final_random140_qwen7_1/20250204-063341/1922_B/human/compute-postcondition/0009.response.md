Output State: **`current_index` is 4, `t` is an integer equal to `data[0]` and must be a positive integer, `n` is an integer equal to `data[2]`, and `results` is an empty list, `hashing` is an empty dictionary.**

The code `current_index += 1` increments the value of `current_index` by 1. Initially, `current_index` is 3, so after executing the code, `current_index` becomes 4. The values of `t`, `n`, `results`, and `hashing` remain unchanged.
