Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 4, `a` is a list of integers where the element at index 3 is 0, and `hashing` is a dictionary where the key corresponding to the element at index 3 of `a` is mapped to 0. If the element at index 3 of `a` is not in `hashing`, then no change is made to `hashing`.
