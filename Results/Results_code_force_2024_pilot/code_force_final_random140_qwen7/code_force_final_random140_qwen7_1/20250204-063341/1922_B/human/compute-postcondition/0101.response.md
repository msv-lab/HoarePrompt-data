Output State: **`t` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `current_index` is increased by 4, the list `a` contains integers starting from `data[current_index - n]` to `data[current_index - 1]`, the dictionary `hashing` is empty, the variable `ans` is the sum of `hashing[a[i]]` for all consecutive equal elements found in `a` during the loop's execution, and the variable `results` is appended with the value of `ans`, `n` is an integer obtained from `data[current_index]`**.

Explanation: The line `current_index += 1` increments the value of `current_index` by 1. Initially, `current_index` was increased by 3, so now it is increased by 4 in total. All other variables remain unchanged as no operations were performed on them in the given code snippet.
