Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` is greater than 4, `a` is a list of integers where the element at index 3 is 0, and `hashing` is a dictionary where the key corresponding to the element at index 3 of `a` (which is 0) is mapped to 0, and `ans` is equal to 4.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is incremented by the value of `hashing[a[i]]`. Given that `i` is 4 and the element at index 3 of `a` is 0, `hashing[a[i]]` is `hashing[0]`, which is 4. Therefore, `ans` is updated to 4. All other variables remain unchanged.
