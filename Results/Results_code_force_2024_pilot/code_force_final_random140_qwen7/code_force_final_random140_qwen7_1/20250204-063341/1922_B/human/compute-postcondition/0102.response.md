Output State: **`t` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `current_index` is increased by 4, the list `a` is empty, the dictionary `hashing` is empty, the variable `ans` is 0, `results` is appended with 0, `n` is an integer obtained from `data[current_index]`**.

Explanation: The line `a = []` initializes the list `a` as an empty list. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `t`, `i`, `current_index`, `hashing`, `ans`, and `results` retain their initial values, and `n` remains as an integer obtained from `data[current_index]`.
