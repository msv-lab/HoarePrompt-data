Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `ans` is the previous value of `ans`, and `hashing[a[i]]` is updated to `i + 1` if `a[i]` is not already in `hashing`.**

Explanation: The code `hashing[a[i]] += i` increments the value of `hashing[a[i]]` by `i`. Given the initial state, `i` is `n - 1`, so after executing the line of code, `i` becomes `n - 2`. The value of `ans` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. Additionally, `hashing[a[i]]` is updated to `i + 1` if `a[i]` is not already present in `hashing`.
