Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n - 1):`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i` and `n`**:
   - From the given state, `i` is -1.
   - The variable `n` is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state, but it is required for the loop to execute.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop `for i in range(n - 1)` will execute as long as `n - 1` is a non-negative integer. This means `n` must be at least 1 (i.e., `n >= 1`).

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` starts at -1, it will increment in each iteration of the loop. For the loop to start executing, `i` should be incremented to 0 or more.
   - Therefore, `i` must be adjusted to be within the range that allows the loop to start, which means `i` should be at least 0.
   - `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

5. **Consider other variables**:
   - `current_index`, `a`, and `ans` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted based on the loop execution conditions.

Based on the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is at least 0, `n` must be at least 1**
