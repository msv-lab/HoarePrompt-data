Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `a` has an additional element which is `int(data[current_index])`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `int(data[current_index])` to the list `a`. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it was initially set to `n-1`. The list `a` now contains one more element, which is the integer value of `data[current_index]`.
