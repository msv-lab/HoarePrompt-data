Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
  - `i` is `n-2`
  - `current_index` is `current_index + 1`

- **For Loop Statement:**
  ```python
  for i in range(n):
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition:**
   The loop condition is `for i in range(n)`. This means `i` will iterate from `0` to `n-1`.

2. **Current Value of `i`:**
   At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n-2`.

3. **Next Iteration:**
   For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `n-1`.

4. **Value of `current_index`:**
   The variable `current_index` was updated in the loop body. Since it was updated by `current_index + 1`, at the end of the previous iteration, `current_index` is `current_index + 1`.

5. **Adjusting States:**
   - `i` should be set to `n-1`.
   - `current_index` should be set to `current_index + 1`.

### Final State:
- `i` is `n-1`
- `current_index` is `current_index + 1`

### Answer:
State: **`i` is `n-1`, `current_index` is `current_index + 1`**
