Postcondition: `i` is 4, `n` is greater than 4, `a` is a list of integers where the element at index 3 is 0, and `hashing` is a dictionary where the key corresponding to the element at index 3 of `a` (which is 0) is mapped to 0. If `a[3]` is not in `hashing`, then `ans` remains unchanged. If `a[3]` is in `hashing`, then `ans` is equal to 0.
