Output State: **`i` is 5, `n` must be greater than 5, `hashing[a[5]]` is 0**

Explanation: The code `hashing[a[i]] = 0` assigns the value 0 to the key `a[i]` in the dictionary `hashing`. Given that `i` is initially 5, the key used is `a[5]`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the updated state includes that `i` is still 5, `n` must still be greater than 5, and the dictionary `hashing` now has a key `a[5]` with the value 0.
