Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is at least 1, `ans` is the previous value of `ans` plus `hashing[a[i]]`.**

Explanation: The line `ans += hashing[a[i]]` increments the value of `ans` by the value of `hashing[a[i]]`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state. The exact value of `ans` depends on its initial value and the value of `hashing[a[i]]`, but the relationship is clearly stated.
