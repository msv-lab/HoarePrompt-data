Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `n-1`
   - `current_index` is `current_index + 2`
   - `a` is a list with the element `data[current_index - 1]` appended to it.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently `n-1`, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `n`.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged.
   - The value of `current_index` will be updated to `current_index + 2`.
   - The value of `a` will be updated based on the new `current_index`.

Given these points, let's update the states:

- `i` will be incremented from `n-1` to `n`.
- `current_index` will be updated to `current_index + 2`.
- `a` will be updated based on the new `current_index`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is `n`, `current_index` is `current_index + 2`, `a` is a list with the element `data[current_index - 1]` appended to it**.
