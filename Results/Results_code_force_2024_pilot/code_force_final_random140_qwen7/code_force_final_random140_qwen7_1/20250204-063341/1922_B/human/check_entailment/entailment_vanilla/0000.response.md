### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
2. **Processing Test Cases**: It iterates over each test case.
3. **Sorting and Hashing**: For each test case, it sorts the array `a` and uses a dictionary `hashing` to keep track of the number of elements less than the current element.
4. **Counting Valid Triangles**: It counts the number of valid triangles by checking if the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side. This is done using the sorted array and the `hashing` dictionary.
5. **Output**: It prints the result for each test case.

However, there is an issue with the logic used to count valid triangles. Specifically, the program uses the `hashing` dictionary to count the number of elements less than the current element, which is not the correct approach for counting valid triangles.

### Correct Approach:
To count the number of valid triangles, we need to use the triangle inequality theorem, which states that for three sides \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) (where \(a \leq b \leq c\)), a triangle can be formed if and only if \(a + b > c\).

### Corrected Program:
Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    current_index = 0
    t = int(data[current_index])
    current_index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[current_index])
        current_index += 1
        a = [int(data[current_index + i]) for i in range(n)]
        current_index += n
        a.sort()
        ans = 0
        for i in range(n - 2):
            k = i + 2
            for j in range(i + 1, n - 1):
                while k < n and a[i] + a[j] > a[k]:
                    k += 1
                ans += k - j - 1
        results.append(ans)
    for result in results:
        print(result)

func_1()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Reading Input**: The same as before.
2. **Processing Test Cases**: The same as before.
3. **Sorting**: Sorts the array `a`.
4. **Counting Valid Triangles**: Uses nested loops to check the triangle inequality theorem. For each pair of sides `(a[i], a[j])`, it finds the number of valid third sides `a[k]` such that `a[i] + a[j] > a[k]`.

### Conclusion:
The original program was incorrect due to the misuse of the `hashing` dictionary. The corrected program uses the correct logic to count the number of valid triangles.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
