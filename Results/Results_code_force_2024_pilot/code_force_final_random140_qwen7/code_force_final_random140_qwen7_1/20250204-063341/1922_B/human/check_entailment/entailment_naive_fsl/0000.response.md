Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem of counting the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks to form a non-degenerate triangle. The logic in the program is flawed and does not account for the triangle inequality theorem, which states that for three lengths to form a triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the remaining side.

The program attempts to count pairs of sticks with the same length but does not check if these pairs, along with a third stick, can form a triangle. Additionally, the program does not handle the sorting and comparison of stick lengths to ensure the triangle inequality condition is met.

Here is an example to illustrate the issue:

Consider the input:
```
3
4
2 3 2 3
```

The expected output should be 4 because we can form the following triangles:
- (2, 2, 3)
- (2, 2, 3)
- (2, 3, 3)
- (3, 3, 2)

However, the provided program will not correctly compute this and will likely produce an incorrect result. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
