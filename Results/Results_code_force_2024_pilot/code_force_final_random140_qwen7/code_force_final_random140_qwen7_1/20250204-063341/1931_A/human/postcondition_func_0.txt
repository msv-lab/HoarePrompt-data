The function `func_1` accepts an integer `num` within the range of 3 to 78 inclusive. If `num` is between 1 and 26, it returns the corresponding lowercase letter from 'd' to 'z'. Otherwise, it also returns a character between 'd' and 'z', though the exact character is not specified based on the input.
