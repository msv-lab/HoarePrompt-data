You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that can be encoded to a given integer `n`.
   - The encoding is the sum of the positions of the letters in the alphabet.
   - The letters 'a' to 'z' are indexed from 1 to 26 respectively.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it calculates the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` based on the value of `n` divided by 26.
   - It uses the formula to determine the characters for `a`, `b`, and `c`:
     - If `n // 26 == 0`, then `a` and `b` are both 'a' (index 1), and `c` is the remaining part of `n` minus 2.
     - If `n // 26 == 1`, then `a` is 'a', `b` is the remaining part of `n` minus 27, and `c` is 'z' (index 26).
     - If `n // 26 == 2`, then `a` is the remaining part of `n` minus 52, and `b` and `c` are both 'z'.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic seems to handle the different cases correctly based on the division of `n` by 26.
   - However, there are some issues with the logic:
     - The conditions for `n // 26` should cover all possible ranges of `n` without gaps.
     - The conditions do not handle cases where `n` is between 27 and 51, which should be handled separately.

4. **Testing the Cases:**
   - Let's test the given examples:
     - For `n = 24`:
       - `24 // 26 == 0`, so `a = 'a'`, `b = 'a'`, `c = 24 - 2 = 'v'`. This gives "aav".
     - For `n = 70`:
       - `70 // 26 == 2`, so `a = 70 - 52 = 'r'`, `b = 'z'`, `c = 'z'`. This gives "rzz".
     - For `n = 3`:
       - `3 // 26 == 0`, so `a = 'a'`, `b = 'a'`, `c = 3 - 2 = 'a'`. This gives "aaa".
     - For `n = 55`:
       - `55 // 26 == 2`, so `a = 55 - 52 = 'c'`, `b = 'z'`, `c = 'z'`. This gives "czz".
     - For `n = 48`:
       - `48 // 26 == 1`, so `a = 'a'`, `b = 48 - 27 = 'u'`, `c = 'z'`. This gives "auz".

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program does not handle the case where `n` is between 27 and 51 correctly.
   - The conditions should be adjusted to cover all possible values of `n`.

### Correctness:
- The given program is **incorrect** because it does not handle all possible values of `n` correctly.

**Final Answer:**
Correctness: **False**
