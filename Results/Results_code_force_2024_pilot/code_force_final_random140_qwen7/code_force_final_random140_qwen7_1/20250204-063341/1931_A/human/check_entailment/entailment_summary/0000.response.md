Reasoning:
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the logic to find the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have been encoded for each test case.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and then processes each test case by reading the encoded integer `n`.

2. **Logic for Encoding**:
   - The program attempts to break down the encoded integer `n` into contributions from each of the three letters.
   - It uses the quotient and remainder of `n` divided by 26 to determine the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.
   - However, the logic provided in the program does not accurately reflect the encoding process described in the problem statement. Specifically:
     - When `n // 26 == 0`, it sets `a` and `b` to `'a'` and `c` to the character corresponding to `n - 2`. This is incorrect because `n` should be split into contributions from three letters, not just two.
     - When `n // 26 == 1`, it sets `a` to `'a'`, `b` to the character corresponding to `n - 27`, and `c` to `'z'`. This is also incorrect because `n - 27` might not yield a valid contribution for `b` if `n` is small.
     - When `n // 26 == 2`, it sets `a` to the character corresponding to `n - 52`, and both `b` and `c` to `'z'`. Again, this is incorrect because `n - 52` might not yield a valid contribution for `a` if `n` is small.

3. **Character Generation**:
   - The function `func_1` is defined to return a character based on the input number, but it is not used in the main loop of the program. Therefore, it does not contribute to the correctness of the solution.

4. **Output**:
   - The program constructs the word using the incorrectly determined values of `a`, `b`, and `c` and prints the result.

Given these observations, the program does not correctly implement the logic to find the lexicographically smallest word that could have been encoded. The provided logic for determining `a`, `b`, and `c` is flawed and does not match the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
