### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` which represents the encoded value of a three-letter word.

2. **Decoding Logic**:
   - The logic in the program aims to decode the integer `n` back into a lexicographically smallest three-letter word.
   - The program uses a series of conditional statements to determine the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` based on the value of `n`.

3. **Conditions Analysis**:
   - If `n // 26 == 0`, the word is "aaa".
   - If `n // 26 == 1`, the word is "aav" (where `a` is 'a', `v` is the 22nd letter, and the remaining part is adjusted).
   - If `n // 26 == 2`, the word is "rzz" (where `r` is the 18th letter, and the remaining part is adjusted).

4. **Character Conversion**:
   - The program uses `chr(96 + 1)` to represent 'a'.
   - It calculates the remaining part of the word using `n - 2`, `n - 27`, and `n - 52` respectively for the different conditions.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases where `n` is within the range of 3 to 78, ensuring that the word is constructed correctly.
   - The function `func_1` is not used in the main logic and seems redundant, but it is defined correctly for converting integers to characters.

Given the analysis, the program correctly decodes the integer `n` into the lexicographically smallest three-letter word. The conditions and calculations are accurate for the given constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the problem description and the provided execution states.

### Correctness:
**True**
