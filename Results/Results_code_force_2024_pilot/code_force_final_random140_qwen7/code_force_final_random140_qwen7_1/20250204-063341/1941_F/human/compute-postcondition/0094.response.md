Output State: **`gap` is a list of tuples sorted in ascending order based on the difference between consecutive elements in `a`; `start` is the second element of the first tuple in `gap`; `end` is the third element of the first tuple in `gap`; `mid` is the average of `start` and `end` rounded down to the nearest integer; `nd` is 0 if the length of `gap` is 1, otherwise the first element of the second tuple in `gap`.**

Explanation: The code `b.sort()` sorts the list `b` (which was previously referred to as `gap`) in ascending order based on the difference between consecutive elements in `a`. All other variables (`start`, `end`, `mid`, and `nd`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
