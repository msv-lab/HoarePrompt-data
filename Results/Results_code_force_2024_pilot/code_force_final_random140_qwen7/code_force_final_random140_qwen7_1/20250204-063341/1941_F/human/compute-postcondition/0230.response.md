Postcondition: **`res` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and the maximum of (end - s, s - start, nd); `i` is incremented by 1; `remain` is equal to `mid - b[i]`; `m` remains the same; `end`, `s`, `start`, `nd`, `mid`, `b`, `f`, `k`, and `j` remain unchanged; `j` is assigned the value of the leftmost index in list `f` where the first argument is greater than or equal to `remain`; `s` is updated to `f[j - 1] + b[i]`**.

This postcondition describes the state of the program variables after the execution of the if-else block. If the condition `start < s < end` is true, then the operations specified in the if part are performed. If the condition is false, no additional operations are performed as indicated by the absence of an else part.
