Postcondition: `i` is 2, `m` must be greater than 0, `j` is the index of the first element in `f` which is not less than `remain`, `remain` is `mid - b[1]`, `res` is updated to the minimum value between `res` and the maximum of `end - (f[j] + b[1])`, `(f[j] + b[1]) - start`, and `nd` if `start < (f[j] + b[1]) < end`. If `(f[j] + b[1])` is not between `start` and `end`, the value of `res` remains unchanged; `s` is equal to `f[j - 1] + b[2]`, and if `start < s < end`, `res` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`.
