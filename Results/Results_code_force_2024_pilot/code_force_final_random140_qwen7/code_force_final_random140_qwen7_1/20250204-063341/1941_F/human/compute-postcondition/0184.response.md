Output State: **`i` is 0; `mid` is a variable, `b[i]` is subtracted from `mid` to get `remain`.**

Explanation: The variable `remain` is assigned the value of `mid - b[i]`. Since `i` is 0 in the initial state, `b[i]` refers to `b[0]`. However, the exact value of `b[0]` is not specified, so we express it as `b[i]` or `b[0]`. The value of `mid` is also not specified, so it remains as a variable. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 0.
