Postcondition: `i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `remain` is `mid - b[0]`, `j` is the index of the leftmost insertion point of `remain` in list `f`, `s` is `f[j] + b[i]`, `j` is not equal to `k`, and `res` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`. If `j >= 1`, `s` is updated to `f[j - 1] + b[i]`.
