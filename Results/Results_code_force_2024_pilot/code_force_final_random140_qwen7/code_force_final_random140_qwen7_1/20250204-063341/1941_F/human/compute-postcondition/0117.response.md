Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `j` is the index of the first element in `f` which is not less than `remain`, `remain` is `mid - b[0]`, `j` is not equal to `k`, `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[i]`, and `res` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`. Additionally, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, and `start < s < end` holds true.**
