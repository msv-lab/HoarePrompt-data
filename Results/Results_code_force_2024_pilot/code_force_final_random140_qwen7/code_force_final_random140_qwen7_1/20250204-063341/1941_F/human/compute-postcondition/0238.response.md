Postcondition: **`res` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and the maximum of (end - s, s - start, nd); `i` is incremented by 1; `remain` is equal to `mid - b[i]`; `m` remains the same; `end`, `s`, `start`, `nd`, `mid`, `b`, `f`, `k`, and `j` remain unchanged; `j` is assigned the value of the leftmost index in list `f` where the first argument is greater than or equal to `remain`; `s` is updated to either `f[j] + b[i]` or `f[j - 1] + b[i]` depending on whether `j` is greater than or equal to 1.**
