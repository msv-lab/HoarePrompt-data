Output State: **`i` is `m`, `m` remains unchanged, `remain` is `mid - b[m-1]`, `j` is the index of the leftmost insertion point of `remain` in the list `b`, `res` is the minimum value among all the updates made during the loop iterations, `n`, `k` are input integers, and `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `b` is updated to a list of integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `b = [*map(int, input().split())]` reads a line of space-separated integers from the standard input, converts each integer to an int using `map(int, ...)` and then creates a list `b` from these integers. The values of `i`, `m`, `remain`, `j`, `res`, `n`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged. The list `b` is updated to the list of integers entered by the user.
