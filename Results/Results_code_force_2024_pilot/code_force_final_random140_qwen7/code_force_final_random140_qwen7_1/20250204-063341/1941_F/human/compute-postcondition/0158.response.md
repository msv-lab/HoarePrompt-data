Postcondition: **`i` is 3, `m` must be greater than 0, `j` is the index of the first element in `f` which is not less than `remain`, `remain` is `mid - b[3]`, `res` is updated to the minimum value between `res` and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd` if `start < s < end`, `s` is updated to `f[j] + b[i]`, `j` is assigned the value of `bisect.bisect_left(f, remain)`.** 

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the execution of the if statement where `j` is checked to be greater than or equal to 1. If the condition is true, `s` is updated to `f[j] + b[i]` instead of `f[j - 1] + b[i]`. If the condition is false, no changes are made to the variables as specified in the else part (which is not present in this case).
