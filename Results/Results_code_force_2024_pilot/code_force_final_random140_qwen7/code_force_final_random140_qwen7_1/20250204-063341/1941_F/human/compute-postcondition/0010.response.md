Output State: **`nd` is 0 if the length of `gap` is 1 else `gap[1][0]`, `start` is equal to `gap[0][1]`, `end` is equal to `gap[0][2]`, `mid` is the average of `start` and `end`**.

This means that the value of `nd` is determined based on the length of the list `gap`. If `gap` has only one element, `nd` is set to 0. Otherwise, `nd` is set to the value of `gap[1][0]`. The values of `start`, `end`, and `mid` remain unchanged from their initial state.
