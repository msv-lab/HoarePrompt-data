Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer entered, `m` is the second integer entered, and `k` is the third integer entered.**

Explanation: The code splits the input into three integers and assigns them to `n`, `m`, and `k`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was part of the initial state and no operation altered its value.
