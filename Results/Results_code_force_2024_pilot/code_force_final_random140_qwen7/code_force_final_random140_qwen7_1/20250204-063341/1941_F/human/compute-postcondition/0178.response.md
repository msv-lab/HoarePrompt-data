Output State: **`start` is equal to the first element of the tuple in `gap` which has the largest difference between consecutive elements in `a` and the corresponding elements in `a`; `end` is equal to `gap[0][2]`; `mid` is equal to (`start` + `end`) // 2.**

This means that `mid` is calculated as the integer division of the sum of `start` and `end` by 2. The values of `start` and `end` remain unchanged from their initial state.
