Postcondition: `i` is either 1 or 2, `m` must be greater than 0, `j` is the index of the first element in `f` which is not less than `remain`, `remain` is `mid - b[1]`, `res` is updated to the minimum value between `res` and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd` if `start < s < end`. If `s` is not between `start` and `end`, the value of `res` remains unchanged. Here, `s` is defined as `f[j - 1] + b[1]` if `j != k`, and as `f[j - 1] + b[1]` since `j != k` (assuming `k` was previously defined). If `j == k`, `s` is set to `f[j - 1] + b[1]`. If `j` is at least 1, `s` is equal to `f[j - 1] + b[2]`, and if `start < s < end`, `res` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`.
