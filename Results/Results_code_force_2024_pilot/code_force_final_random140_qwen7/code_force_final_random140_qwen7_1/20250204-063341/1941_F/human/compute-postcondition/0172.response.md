Output State: **`a` is now a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `b` is the same list as `a`.**

Explanation: The code `b = [*map(int, input().split())]` takes input from the user, splits it into individual strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and then assigns the resulting list of integers to both `b` and `a` (since `a` was already defined as a list of integers from the input split and mapped). Therefore, `a` and `b` now refer to the same list of integers.
