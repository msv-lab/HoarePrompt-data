Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `mid` is a variable, `b[i]` is subtracted from `mid` to get `remain`, `j` is the index where `remain` would be inserted to keep list `f` sorted, `j` is not equal to `k`, `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[i]`, and the current value of `s` satisfies `start < s < end`, and `j` is greater than or equal to 1.**
