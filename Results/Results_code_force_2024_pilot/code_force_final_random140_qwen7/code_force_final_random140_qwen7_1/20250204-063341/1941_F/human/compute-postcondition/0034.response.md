Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `remain` is `mid - b[0]`, `j` is the index of the leftmost insertion point of `remain` in list `f`, `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[i]`, `j` is not equal to `k`, and `res` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`.**

This postcondition summarizes that regardless of whether the condition `start < s < end` is true or false, the variables retain their specified relationships and constraints from the precondition, with `res` being updated to the minimum of its current value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`.
