Postcondition: **After the loop executes all iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `m`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `m` remains unchanged from its initial value. The variable `remain` will hold the value of `mid - b[m-1]`. The variable `j` will be the index of the leftmost insertion point of `remain` in the list `f`. The variable `res` will be the minimum value among all the updates made during the loop iterations, where each update is the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`, with `s` being either `f[j - 1] + b[i]` if `j` equals `k` or `f[j] + b[i]` if `j` is not equal to `k` and `j >= 1`. If `res` was updated during the loop, `res` will be the minimum of those updates; otherwise, `res` will remain infinity (`inf`).**
