Postcondition: **`res` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and the maximum of (end - s, s - start, nd), and the conditions `i = 0`, `mid` is a variable, `remain` is obtained by subtracting `b[i]` from `mid`, `j` is the index where `remain` would be inserted to keep list `f` sorted, `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[i]`, and the condition `j == k` are still true. Additionally, `start < s < end` holds true.**
