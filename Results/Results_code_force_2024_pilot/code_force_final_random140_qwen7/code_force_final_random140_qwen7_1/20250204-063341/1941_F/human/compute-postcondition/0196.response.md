Postcondition: `i` is 0, `mid` is a variable, `b[i]` is subtracted from `mid` to get `remain`, `j` is the index where `remain` would be inserted to keep list `f` sorted, `j` is not equal to `k`, `s` is `f[j] + b[i]`, and `res` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and the maximum of (end - s, s - start, nd).
