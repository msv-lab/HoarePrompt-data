Postcondition: `res` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and the maximum of (end - s, s - start, nd). If `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `res` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`. If `j` is less than 1, the value of `res` remains unchanged.
