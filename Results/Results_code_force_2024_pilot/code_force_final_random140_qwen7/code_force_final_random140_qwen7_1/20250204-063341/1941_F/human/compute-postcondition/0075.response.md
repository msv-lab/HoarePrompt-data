Postcondition: `i` is 3, `m` is greater than 0, `remain` is `mid - b[3]`, `j` is the index of the leftmost insertion point of `remain` in list `f`, `res` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `max(end - (f[j] + b[3]), f[j] + b[3] - start, nd)`. This holds true whether `start < s < end` is satisfied or not, as the if part does not change the conditions and the else part updates `res` based on the value of `j`.
