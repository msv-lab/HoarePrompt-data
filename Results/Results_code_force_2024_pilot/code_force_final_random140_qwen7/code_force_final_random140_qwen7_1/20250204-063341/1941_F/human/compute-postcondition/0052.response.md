Postcondition: `i` is 2, `m` is greater than 0, `remain` is `mid - b[2]`, `j` is the index of the leftmost insertion point of `remain` in list `f`, `res` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `max(end - s, s - start, nd)`, `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[i]`, and if `start < s < end` is true, `res` is further updated to the minimum of `res` and `max(end - s, s - start, nd)`.
