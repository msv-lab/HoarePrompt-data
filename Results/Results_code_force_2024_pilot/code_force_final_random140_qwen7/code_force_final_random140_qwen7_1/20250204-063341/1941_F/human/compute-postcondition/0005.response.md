Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer entered, `m` is the second integer entered, and `k` is the third integer entered; `a` is a list of three integers converted from the input split by spaces, `b` is a list of integers entered by the user split by spaces, `f` is a list of integers entered by the user split by spaces; `gap` is a list of tuples, each tuple containing (y - x, x, y), where (x, y) are consecutive elements from the list `a`.**

Explanation: The code creates a list called `gap` which contains tuples. Each tuple is formed by taking two consecutive elements from the list `a`, subtracting the first element from the second (`y - x`), and including both elements `x` and `y` in the tuple. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, and `f` remain unchanged.
