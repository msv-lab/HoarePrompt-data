Postcondition: **`i` is 3, `m` must be greater than 0, `j` is the index of the first element in `f` which is not less than `remain`, `remain` is `mid - b[3]`, `res` is updated to the minimum value between `res` and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd` if `start < s < end`, `s` is updated to `f[j - 1] + b[i]`, `j` is assigned the value of `bisect.bisect_left(f, remain)`**.

This postcondition describes the state of the variables after the execution of the if statement. Since there is no else part, the postcondition directly reflects the changes and conditions specified in the if part.
