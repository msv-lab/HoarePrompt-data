Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(m)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `m`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 2.
   - `m` is greater than 0.
   - `remain` is `mid - b[2]`.
   - `j` is the index of the leftmost insertion point of `remain` in list `f`.
   - `res` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `max(end - s, s - start, nd)`, where `s` is either `f[j - 1] + b[i]` if `j` equals `k` or `f[j] + b[i]` if `j` is not equal to `k` and `j >= 1`, and if `start < s < end` is true, `res` is further updated to the minimum of `res` and `max(end - s, s - start, nd)`.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop is controlled by `i` and `m`, and `i` is currently 2, the loop will continue if `i < m`.
   - After the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 3.
   - `m` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be 3.
   - `m` remains greater than 0 (since it was greater than 0 before and no changes were made to it).
   - `remain` remains the same as it is not modified in the loop.
   - `j` remains the same as it is determined based on the value of `remain` and list `f`, and these values do not change within the loop.
   - `res` remains the same as it is not updated in the loop unless certain conditions are met, but since we are only considering the state at the start of the next iteration, we do not need to adjust `res`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `m`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 3, `m` is greater than 0, `remain` is `mid - b[2]`, `j` is the index of the leftmost insertion point of `remain` in list `f`, `res` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `max(end - s, s - start, nd)`**.
