Postcondition: `i` is 6 if the substring `s` (starting from index 3 and having length 3) is either 'map' or 'pie'. Otherwise, `i` is 4. `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an input string and `len(a)` must be greater than 5, `ans` is 2 if the substring `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 0, `s` is a substring of `a` starting from index 3 and having length 3.
