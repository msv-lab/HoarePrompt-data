Based on the initial state described, let's break down the components involved in the `print(ans)` statement:

1. **`a`**: This is an input integer greater than 0. However, since `a` is treated as a string in this context (as it contains substrings), we need to consider it as a string representation of the integer. For example, if `a = 123456789`, then the string representation is `"123456789"`.

2. **`ans`**: This is the total number of occurrences where the substring `s` (of length 3) starting from index `i` is either 'map' or 'pie'. The value of `ans` depends on how many times 'map' or 'pie' appears as a substring in the string representation of `a`.

3. **`i`**: This is the last index `i` where the condition was met plus 3, or it is `len(a)` if no more valid substrings are found. Since `i` is not directly used in the `print(ans)` statement, we only need to focus on `ans`.

Given these points, the `print(ans)` statement will output the count of how many times the substrings 'map' or 'pie' appear in the string representation of `a`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the count of occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' as substrings in the string representation of a)**
