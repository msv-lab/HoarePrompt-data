Based on the initial state provided:

- `ans` is either 1 or 0.
- `i` is either 3 or 1.
- `s` is a substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`.
- `s` is set to either 'map', 'pie', or neither 'map' nor 'pie'.

Given these conditions, let's break down the possible scenarios:

1. If `i` is 3, then `s` would be a substring of `a` starting from index 3 to index 6 (inclusive).
2. If `i` is 1, then `s` would be a substring of `a` starting from index 1 to index 4 (inclusive).

However, the value of `s` itself is explicitly stated to be either 'map', 'pie', or neither 'map' nor 'pie'. This means that regardless of the value of `i`, the substring `s` is already determined to be one of these three values.

Since the value of `s` is explicitly defined as 'map', 'pie', or neither 'map' nor 'pie', and no other information is provided to determine which specific value it takes, we must consider the given options.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be one of the following:

Output: **'map', 'pie', or neither 'map' nor 'pie'**
