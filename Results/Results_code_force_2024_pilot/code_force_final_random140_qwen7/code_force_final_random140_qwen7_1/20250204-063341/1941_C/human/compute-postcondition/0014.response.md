To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the loop head condition, which is `i < len(a) - 2`.

Given the current state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 3
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `a` is an input string and `len(a)` must be greater than 2
- `ans` is 1 if the substring `s` (starting from index 0 and having length 3) is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 0
- `i` is 3 if `s` is 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `i` is 1

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `i < len(a) - 2` must be true.

Let's analyze the condition:
- The current value of `i` is 3.
- For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `len(a) - 2`.

Since `i` is currently 3, `len(a) - 2` must be greater than 3. Therefore, `len(a)` must be greater than 5.

No other states need to be adjusted because the loop condition depends solely on `i` and `len(a)`.

Thus, the state that needs to be adjusted is `len(a)` must be greater than 5.

State: **`i` is 3, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an input string and `len(a)` must be greater than 5, `ans` is 1 if the substring `s` (starting from index 0 and having length 3) is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 0**
