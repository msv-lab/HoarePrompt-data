The code `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. Given the initial state where `ans` is 2 if the substring `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 0, and knowing that `s` is a substring of `a` starting from index 3 and having length 3, the value of `s` will determine the value of `ans`. Since the code only increments `ans` by 1, the value of `ans` will be 3 if `s` is 'map' or 'pie', and 1 otherwise. However, since the exact value of `s` is not specified, we consider both cases.

Output State: **`i` is 9, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an input string and `len(a)` must be greater than 6, `ans` is 3 if the substring `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 1, `s` is a substring of `a` starting from index 3 and having length 3.**
