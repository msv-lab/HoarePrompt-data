Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is an input string and len(a) must be greater than 2, `ans` is 0, `s` is a substring of `a` starting from index 0 and having length 3.**

Explanation: The code `s = a[i:i + 3]` creates a substring `s` from the string `a` starting at index `i` (which is 0) and taking the next 3 characters. The values of `i`, `t`, `a`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
