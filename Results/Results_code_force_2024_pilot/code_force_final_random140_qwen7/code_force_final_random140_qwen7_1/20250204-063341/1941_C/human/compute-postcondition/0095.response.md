Output State: **`ans` is either 1 or 0, `i` is less than `len(a) - 1`, `s` is a substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Since the initial state says `i` is less than `len(a) - 2`, after incrementing `i` by 1, `i` will now be less than `len(a) - 1`. The values of `ans` and `s` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
