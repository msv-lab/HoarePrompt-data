Output State: **`ans` is either 1 or 0, `i` is equal to `i + 3`, `s` is a substring of `a` from index `i - 3` to `i`, `s` is set to either 'map', 'pie', or neither 'map' nor 'pie'**.

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 3, making it equal to `i + 3`. The other variables (`ans`, `s`) remain unchanged as the code only modifies `i`. The substring `s` is still a substring of `a` from index `i - 3` to `i`, and its value remains either 'map', 'pie', or neither 'map' nor 'pie'.
