Postcondition: **`a` is an input integer greater than 0, `ans` is 2 if the substring `s` starting from index 3 and having a length of 3 is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 1, `i` is 6 if `s` is 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `i` is 4, and `s` is a substring of `a` starting from index 3 and having a length of 3.**
