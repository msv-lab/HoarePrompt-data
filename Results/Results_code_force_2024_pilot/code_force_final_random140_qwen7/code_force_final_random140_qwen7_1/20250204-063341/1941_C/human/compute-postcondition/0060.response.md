Output State: **`a` is an input integer greater than 0, `ans` is 3 if s is 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 2, `i` is 9 if s is 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `i` is 7, `s` is a substring of `a` starting from index 6 and having a length of 3, and `len(a)` must be greater than 8.**

Explanation: The value of `ans` is incremented by 1, so if `s` is 'map' or 'pie', `ans` becomes 3 (originally 2 + 1), otherwise it remains 2. The values of `a`, `i`, `s`, and the condition on `len(a)` remain unchanged.
