Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 3.
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `a` is an input string and `len(a)` must be greater than 5.
- `ans` is 1 if the substring `s` (starting from index 3 and having length 3) is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 0.
- `s` is a substring of `a` starting from index 3 and having length 3.

The key point here is the value of `s`. Since `s` is a substring of `a` starting from index 3 and having a length of 3, it means `s` is `a[3:6]`.

Given that `ans` is determined by whether `s` is 'map' or 'pie', the value of `s` will directly determine the value of `ans`. However, the question specifically asks for what will be printed by the `print(s)` statement.

Therefore, the output will depend on the actual value of `a[3:6]`. Without knowing the exact value of `a`, we cannot specify `s` precisely, but we know it is a substring of length 3 starting from index 3.

Output: **s (where s is the substring of a starting from index 3 and having length 3)**
