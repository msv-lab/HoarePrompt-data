Output State: **`a` is an input integer greater than 0, `ans` is 2 if s is 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 1, `i` is 9 if s is 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `i` is 7, `s` is a substring of `a` starting from index 6 and having a length of 3, and `len(a)` must be greater than 8.**

Explanation: The variable `i` is incremented by 3, so if `i` was initially 6 (when `s` is 'map' or 'pie'), it becomes 9. If `i` was initially 4 (when `s` is not 'map' or 'pie'), it becomes 7. The other variables (`a`, `ans`, `s`, and `len(a)`) remain unchanged as per the initial state.
