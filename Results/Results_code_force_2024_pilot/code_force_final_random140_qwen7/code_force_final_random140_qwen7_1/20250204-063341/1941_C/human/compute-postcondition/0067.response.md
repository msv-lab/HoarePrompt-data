Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State
- `a` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `ans` is the total number of occurrences where the substring `s` (of length 3) starting from index `i` is either 'map' or 'pie'.
- `i` is the last index `i` where the condition was met plus 3, or it is `len(a)` if no more valid substrings are found.
- `s` is the last valid substring of length 3 checked during the loop, which could be 'map', 'pie', or any other 3-character substring depending on the input `a`.

### Loop Head
The loop head is defined by the `for _ in range(int(input())):` statement. This means the loop will iterate based on the integer input provided by the user.

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Determine the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as the user provides an integer input. Each iteration of the loop will process this input.
2. **Adjusting States**: The only states that can be adjusted within the loop head are the ones that are modified or initialized inside the loop body. However, since the problem does not specify any changes to these states within the loop body, we assume the states remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

### Final State
Since the loop is controlled by the user input and there are no specific modifications to the states (`a`, `ans`, `i`, `s`) within the loop body, the states remain unchanged from the initial state provided.

### Conclusion
The states do not change because the loop head does not modify them; they depend on the user input, which is outside the scope of the loop head.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`a` is an input integer greater than 0, `ans` is equal to the total number of occurrences where the substring `s` (of length 3) starting from index `i` is either 'map' or 'pie', `i` is the last index `i` where the condition was met plus 3, or it is `len(a)` if no more valid substrings are found, `s` is the last valid substring of length 3 checked during the loop, which could be 'map', 'pie', or any other 3-character substring depending on the input `a`.**
