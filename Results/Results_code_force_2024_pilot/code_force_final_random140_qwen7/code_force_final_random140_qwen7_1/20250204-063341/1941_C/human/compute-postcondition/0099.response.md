Output State: `ans` will be the total number of occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in the input string `a`, and `i` will be the index just after the last valid substring of length 3 was checked. If no 'map' or 'pie' substrings were found, `ans` will remain 0 and `i` will be equal to `len(a)`. If 'map' or 'pie' substrings are found, `ans` will be incremented each time one of these substrings is encountered, and `i` will be adjusted accordingly to skip over these substrings.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, `ans` will reflect the count of 'map' and 'pie' substrings in the input string `a`, and `i` will point to the position right after the last substring of length 3 that was checked.
