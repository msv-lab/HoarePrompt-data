Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the range function, which takes an integer input from the user. The loop will execute as long as the input integer is greater than 0.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than the length of the string `a` minus 2. This means that the loop will stop when `i` reaches `len(a) - 2`.

3. **Determine the State Adjustments**:
   - The variable `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 or 3 each iteration.
   - The variable `t` remains unchanged.
   - The variable `a` remains the same.
   - The variable `ans` keeps track of the count of occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' in every possible 3-character substring of `a`.

Given that the loop continues as long as the input integer is greater than 0, the only variable that needs to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration is the input integer itself.

**Step-by-step Adjustment**:
- At the end of the previous iteration, the input integer has been decremented by 1.
- For the loop to execute one more time, the input integer must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state adjustment needed is:

State: **`i` is 0, `t` remains a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` remains the original input string, `ans` remains the count of occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' in every possible 3-character substring of `a`, and the input integer must be greater than 0**.

However, since the loop head is defined by the input integer, the only state that needs to be explicitly adjusted is the input integer itself.

State: **The input integer must be greater than 0**.
