Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6). The sum of all `n` across all test cases does not exceed 10^6. For each test case, the function returns a result based on the given `t` and `s`.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing a value for `t` and a string `s`. It processes these test cases according to the specified constraints and returns a result for each one.
