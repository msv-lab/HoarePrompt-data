Output State: **`i` is 6, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an input string and `len(a)` must be greater than 5, `ans` is 1 if the substring `s` (starting from index 3 and having length 3) is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 0, `s` is a substring of `a` starting from index 3 and having length 3.**

The value of `i` is incremented by 3, changing its value from 3 to 6. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `ans`, and `s`) remain unchanged as they were not affected by the given code snippet.
