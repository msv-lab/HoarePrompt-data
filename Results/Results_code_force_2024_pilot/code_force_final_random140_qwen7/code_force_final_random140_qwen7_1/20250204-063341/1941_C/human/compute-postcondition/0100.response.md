Based on the initial state provided, `ans` is the total number of occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in the input string `a`. The value of `i` is the index just after the last valid substring of length 3 that was checked. If no 'map' or 'pie' substrings are found, `ans` remains 0 and `i` is equal to `len(a)`. If 'map' or 'pie' substrings are found, `ans` is incremented each time one of these substrings is encountered, and `i` is adjusted to skip over these substrings.

Given this, the `print(ans)` statement will output the count of 'map' and 'pie' substrings in the input string `a`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the total number of occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in the input string a)**
