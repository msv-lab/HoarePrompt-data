Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States:
- `i` is 6 if the substring `s` (starting from index 3 and having length 3) is either 'map' or 'pie'. Otherwise, `i` is 4.
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `a` is an input string and `len(a)` must be greater than 5.
- `ans` is 2 if the substring `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 0.
- `s` is a substring of `a` starting from index 3 and having length 3.

### Loop Condition:
```
while i < len(a) - 2:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `len(a) - 2`.
2. **Current Value of `i`**: 
   - If `s` is 'map' or 'pie', then `i` is 6.
   - Otherwise, `i` is 4.

### Determining Next Iteration:
For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(a) - 2`.

#### Case 1: `s` is 'map' or 'pie'
- If `s` is 'map' or 'pie', then `i` is 6.
- For the loop to continue, `6 < len(a) - 2` must hold true.
- Therefore, `len(a) > 8`.

#### Case 2: `s` is not 'map' or 'pie'
- If `s` is not 'map' or 'pie', then `i` is 4.
- For the loop to continue, `4 < len(a) - 2` must hold true.
- Therefore, `len(a) > 6`.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to ensure that `len(a) > 6`. Since `len(a) > 5` is already given, the condition `len(a) > 6` is sufficient.

### Adjusted States:
- We need to adjust `len(a)` to ensure it is greater than 6.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 6 if the substring `s` (starting from index 3 and having length 3) is either 'map' or 'pie'. Otherwise, `i` is 4, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an input string and `len(a)` must be greater than 6, `ans` is 2 if the substring `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 0, `s` is a substring of `a` starting from index 3 and having length 3.**
