Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all cases where the string contains the substrings "pie" or "map". Specifically, the program only checks for the substrings "pie" and "map" in blocks of three characters and skips over them without considering other possible positions of these substrings within the string. 

For example, consider the input string "ppiee". According to the problem description, this string should be considered ugly because it contains the substring "pie". However, the program will not detect this substring and will output `0` instead of `1`, which is incorrect. 

To fix this, the program needs to check for the substrings "pie" and "map" at every possible position in the string, not just in blocks of three characters.
