Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to make the string beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters. Instead, it simply counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" in the string and prints the count. This does not address the requirement to remove the minimum number of characters to eliminate these substrings.

To fix this, the program should iterate through the string and remove characters to avoid the substrings "map" and "pie". Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = input()
        ans = 0
        i = 0
        while i < len(a):
            if i + 2 < len(a) and (a[i:i+3] == 'map' or a[i:i+3] == 'pie'):
                # Remove the characters that form the substring
                ans += 3
                i += 3
            elif i + 1 < len(a) and a[i:i+2] == 'ma' or a[i:i+2] == 'pi':
                # Remove the characters that form part of the substring
                ans += 2
                i += 2
            else:
                i += 1
        print(ans)

func()
```

However, based on the current implementation in the provided program, it does not meet the requirements. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
