Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires distributing coins such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome. This is achieved by ensuring the sum of the bets is less than the product of the bet and its corresponding multiplier for each outcome.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes (`n`) and the multipliers (`k`).
   - It calculates the product of all multipliers (`m`), which represents the minimum amount of coins that would be returned if any outcome were to win.
   - It then calculates the bets (`c`) by dividing `m` by each multiplier `k[i]`. These bets are scaled down by the GCD of the bets to ensure they are integers.
   - It checks if the sum of the bets is less than `m`. If so, it prints the bets; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly computes the GCD of a list of numbers using the `gcd` function from the `math` module.
   - The GCD is used to scale down the bets to their simplest form while maintaining their relative proportions.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where the sum of the bets is not less than `m` by printing `-1`.
   - The program ensures that the bets are integers by scaling down with the GCD.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The logic in the program is sound and aligns with the problem statement.
   - The use of the GCD ensures that the bets are simplified to their smallest integer form while still satisfying the condition that the total bet is less than the return value for any winning outcome.

Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the problem description and the provided execution states.

Correctness: **True**
