### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The goal is to distribute coins among \(n\) outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome.
   - Each outcome has a multiplier \(k_i\), and the total bet should be less than \(k_i \times \text{bet}_i\) for all \(i\).

2. **Key Insight**:
   - To ensure the total bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each outcome, we need to find a common factor that can scale the bets appropriately.
   - The idea is to use the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers, but since we need the greatest common divisor (GCD) to scale down, we use `func_1` which calculates the GCD of the multipliers.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it calculates the product of all multipliers (`m`).
   - It then divides this product by each multiplier to get potential bet values (`c`).
   - It uses `func_1` to find the GCD of these bet values.
   - It scales down the bet values by dividing each by the GCD.
   - Finally, it checks if the sum of the scaled-down bet values is less than the product `m`. If so, it prints the scaled-down bet values; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The program handles the constraints correctly, ensuring the sum of the bets is less than the product of multipliers.
   - The GCD calculation ensures that the bets are scaled down to the smallest possible values while maintaining the required condition.

5. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic in the program aligns with the problem requirements.
   - The use of GCD ensures that the bets are scaled down appropriately.
   - The check at the end ensures that the sum of bets is strictly less than the product of multipliers.

However, upon closer inspection, there is a critical flaw in the logic of the program. Specifically, the program calculates the product of all multipliers (`m`) and then divides each multiplier by `m` to get the potential bet values (`c`). This approach is flawed because it does not necessarily yield valid bet values. Instead, the correct approach would be to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers and then distribute the bets accordingly.

Let's consider an example to illustrate the issue:
- Suppose we have two outcomes with multipliers \(k_1 = 3\) and \(k_2 = 4\). The product `m` would be \(3 \times 4 = 12\).
- Dividing `m` by each multiplier gives us potential bet values of \(c_1 = 4\) and \(c_2 = 3\).
- However, the correct approach would be to find the LCM of 3 and 4, which is 12, and then distribute the bets such that the total bet is less than 12 for both outcomes. A valid distribution could be \(c_1 = 3\) and \(c_2 = 4\).

The program does not correctly handle this scenario. Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly distribute the bets using the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers.
