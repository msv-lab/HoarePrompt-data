Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to distribute coins across different outcomes in such a way that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount of coins received back for any winning outcome. The provided code aims to find such a distribution.

2. **Key Logic**:
   - The code calculates the product of all multipliers (`m = 1` followed by a loop to multiply all `k_i`).
   - It then calculates a list `c` where each element is `m / k[i]`.
   - The function `func_1` computes the GCD of all elements in `c`.
   - Finally, it divides each element in `c` by the GCD to simplify the numbers and checks if their sum is less than `m`. If so, it prints the simplified list; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

3. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - **GCD Calculation**: The function `func_1` correctly computes the GCD of all elements in the list `c`.
   - **Simplification and Validation**: After simplifying the list `c` by dividing each element by the GCD, the code checks if the sum of the simplified list is less than `m`. This step ensures that the total bet is less than the potential winnings for any outcome.
   - **Edge Cases**: The code handles the edge case where the sum of the simplified list is not less than `m` by printing `-1`.

Given the logic and the steps involved, the provided code appears to correctly implement the required functionality based on the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
