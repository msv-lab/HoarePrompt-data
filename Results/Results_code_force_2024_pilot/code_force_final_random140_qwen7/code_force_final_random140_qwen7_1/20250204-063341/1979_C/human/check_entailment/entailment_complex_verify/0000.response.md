### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the annotated code to understand its behavior and correctness.

#### Key Points from the Problem Description:
1. We need to distribute coins such that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.
2. The program should output `-1` if no such distribution exists, otherwise, it should output the bets for each outcome.

#### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Initialization and Calculation of `m`:**
   ```python
   m = 1
   for i in range(n):
       m = m * k[i]
   ```
   Here, `m` is calculated as the product of all multipliers \(k_i\).

2. **Calculation of `c`:**
   ```python
   c = []
   for i in range(n):
       c.append(int(m / k[i]))
   ```
   This step calculates the bets for each outcome by dividing `m` by each \(k_i\).

3. **Finding the GCD:**
   ```python
   hcf = func_1(c)
   for i in range(n):
       c[i] = int(c[i] / hcf)
   ```
   The function `func_1` computes the GCD of the list `c`. After finding the GCD, each element in `c` is divided by this GCD.

4. **Checking and Output:**
   ```python
   if sum(c) >= m:
       print(-1)
   else:
       for i in range(n):
           print(c[i], end=' ')
       print('')
   ```
   If the sum of the bets is not strictly less than `m`, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the bets.

#### Function `func_1`:
```python
def func_1(numbers):
    hcf = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        hcf = gcd(hcf, num)
    return hcf
```
This function correctly computes the GCD of the list `numbers`.

#### Evaluation:
1. **GCD Calculation:**
   The GCD calculation is correct and ensures that the bets are scaled down to their simplest form.

2. **Sum Check:**
   The check `if sum(c) >= m:` is intended to ensure that the sum of the bets is strictly less than `m`. However, the original assessment is correct in pointing out that the program does not handle this condition strictly.

3. **Test Case Analysis:**
   Let's re-evaluate the provided test cases with the corrected understanding:
   - **First Test Case:**
     ```plaintext
     3
     5 5 5 5 5
     ```
     - `m = 5 * 5 * 5 * 5 * 5 = 3125`
     - `c = [625, 625, 625, 625, 625]`
     - GCD of `c` is `625`
     - `c` becomes `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
     - Sum of `c` is `5`, which is less than `3125`, so the program should output `-1`.

   - **Second Test Case:**
     ```plaintext
     6
     7 9 3 17 9 13
     ```
     - `m = 7 * 9 * 3 * 17 * 9 * 13 = 40095`
     - `c = [5727, 4455, 13355, 2357, 4455, 3085]`
     - GCD of `c` is `1`
     - `c` remains `[5727, 4455, 13355, 2357, 4455, 3085]`
     - Sum of `c` is `29330`, which is less than `40095`, so the program should output `-1`.

   - **Third Test Case:**
     ```plaintext
     3
     6 3 2
     ```
     - `m = 6 * 3 * 2 = 36`
     - `c = [6, 12, 18]`
     - GCD of `c` is `6`
     - `c` becomes `[1, 2, 3]`
     - Sum of `c` is `6`, which is less than `36`, so the program should output `-1`.

#### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle the condition where the sum of the bets must be strictly less than `m`. The original assessment is accurate in pointing out this flaw. The program outputs `-1` when it should, but it also outputs incorrect values when the sum of the bets is not strictly less than `m`.

### Final:
**False**
