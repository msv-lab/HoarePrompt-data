#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, each test case contains an integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and a list of n integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_n such that 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20.
def func_1(numbers):
    hcf = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        hcf = gcd(hcf, num)
        
    #State: Output State: `hcf` is equal to the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all the numbers in `numbers`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `numbers` must have at least 2 elements, and `num` is the last element processed in the loop, which is `numbers[-1]`.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `hcf` will hold the GCD of all the numbers in the list `numbers`.
    return hcf
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all the numbers in the list 'numbers'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all the integers in the list. Given a list of integers, the function iterates through each number, updating the GCD until it has processed all numbers in the list, ultimately returning the GCD of the entire list.
