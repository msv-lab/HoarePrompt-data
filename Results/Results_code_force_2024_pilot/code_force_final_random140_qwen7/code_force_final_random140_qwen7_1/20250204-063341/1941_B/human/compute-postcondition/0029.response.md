Output State: `loop_counter` is less than 100, `length` is greater than 1, `elementIndex` is equal to `length - 2`, and `highestNumber` is the maximum value found in the array `inputarray` from index 1 to `length - 2`. `highestIndex` is the index of the maximum value in the array within this range. If no such maximum value was found (which theoretically shouldn't happen given the conditions), `highestIndex` would remain -1.
