Output State: **`loop_counter` is less than 100, `length` is greater than 1, `elementIndex` is 3, `highestNumber` is either the original `highestNumber` (which is `inputarray[2]`) or `inputarray[2]` if `inputarray[2]` is greater than or equal to `highestNumber`, `highestIndex` is 3**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `elementIndex` to `highestIndex`. Since `elementIndex` is 3, `highestIndex` is also set to 3. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
