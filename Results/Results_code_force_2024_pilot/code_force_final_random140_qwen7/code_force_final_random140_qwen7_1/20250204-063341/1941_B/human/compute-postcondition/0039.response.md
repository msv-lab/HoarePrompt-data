The code appends the string `'YES'` to the list `answers`. This operation does not affect any other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except for the addition of `'YES'` to the `answers` list.

Output State: **`loop_counter` is less than 100, `length` is greater than 1, `elementIndex` is equal to `length - 2`, `highestNumber` is the maximum value found in the array `inputarray` from index 1 to `length - 2`, `highestIndex` is the index of the maximum value in the array within this range, `newArray` is the result of `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`, and `func_2(newArray)` returns True; `answers` is now a list containing the elements from the initial state plus `'YES'`.**
