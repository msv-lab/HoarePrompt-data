Postcondition: `loop_counter` is less than 100, `length` is greater than 1, `elementIndex` is equal to `length - 2`, `highestNumber` is the maximum value found in the array `inputarray` from index 1 to `length - 2`, and `highestIndex` is the index of the maximum value in the array within this range. The current value of `highestNumber` is less than 0.
