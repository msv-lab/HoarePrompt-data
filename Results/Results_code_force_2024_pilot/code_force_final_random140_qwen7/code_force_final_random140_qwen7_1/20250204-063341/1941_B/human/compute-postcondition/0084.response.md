Output State: **`elementIndex` is 1, `length` is the length of `inputarray`, `highestNumber` is `inputarray[1]`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `inputarray[elementIndex]` to the variable `highestNumber`. Given that `elementIndex` is initially 1, `highestNumber` is set to the first element of `inputarray`. The values of `length` and `elementIndex` remain unchanged, and the initial value of `highestIndex` is also preserved as it is not affected by this line of code.
