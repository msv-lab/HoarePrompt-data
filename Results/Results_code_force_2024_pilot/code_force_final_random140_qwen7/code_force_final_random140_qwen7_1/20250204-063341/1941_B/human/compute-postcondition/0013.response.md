Output State: **`highestIndex` is 1, `loop_counter` must be less than 100, `length` must be greater than 1, and the current value of `highestNumber` is less than or equal to `inputarray[elementIndex]`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `elementIndex` (which is 1) to `highestIndex`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
