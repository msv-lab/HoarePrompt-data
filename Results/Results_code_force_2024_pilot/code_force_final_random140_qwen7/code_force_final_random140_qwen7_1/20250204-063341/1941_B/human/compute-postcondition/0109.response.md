Output State: `loop_counter` is 100, `length` is greater than 1, `elementIndex` is equal to `length - 1`, `highestNumber` is the maximum value found in the array `inputarray` from index 1 to `length - 1`, `highestIndex` is the index of the highest number in the array, `newArray` is the result of `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`, and `func_2(newArray)` has been called but did not return 'YES'. 

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations (i.e., `loop_counter` reaches 100), the loop condition (`loop_counter != 100`) becomes false, terminating the loop. At this point, `loop_counter` will be 100. The loop processes each possible `elementIndex` from 1 to `length - 2` during its iterations, ensuring that `highestNumber` and `highestIndex` are updated appropriately. The final state of `elementIndex` will be `length - 1`, as it checks up to the second last element in the array. The value of `highestNumber` will be the maximum value found in the array from index 1 to `length - 1`, and `highestIndex` will be the index of this maximum value. `newArray` will be the result of `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)` after the last iteration, and `func_2(newArray)` has been evaluated but did not return 'YES', otherwise the loop would have terminated earlier.
