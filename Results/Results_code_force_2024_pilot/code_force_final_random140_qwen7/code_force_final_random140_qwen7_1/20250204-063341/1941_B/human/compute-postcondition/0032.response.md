Output State: **`loop_counter` is less than 100, `length` is greater than 1, `elementIndex` is equal to `length - 2`, `highestNumber` is the maximum value found in the array `inputarray` from index 1 to `length - 2`, `highestIndex` is the index of the maximum value in the array within this range, and `answers` list has 'NO' appended to it.**

Explanation: The code appends the string `'NO'` to the list `answers`. Since no other variables are affected, their states remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the new element in the `answers` list.
