Output State: `loop_counter` is 100, `length` is greater than 1, `elementIndex` is `length`, `highestNumber` is the maximum value found in the array `inputarray` from index 1 to `length - 1`, `highestIndex` is the index of the highest number in the array, `newArray` is the result of `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`, and `func_2(newArray)` has been evaluated but did not cause the function to return 'YES' or 'NO'. 

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations (i.e., `loop_counter` reaches 100), the loop condition `loop_counter != 100` becomes false, terminating the loop. At this point, the loop counter has incremented 99 times starting from 1, making it 100. The `elementIndex` variable has iterated through the entire range of valid indices in `inputarray`, and the process of finding the highest number and updating `highestIndex` and `highestNumber` has been completed for the entire array. The `newArray` is the final result of calling `func_1` with the index of the highest number, and `func_2(newArray)` has been evaluated without returning 'YES', implying that the loop did not find a condition to break early.
