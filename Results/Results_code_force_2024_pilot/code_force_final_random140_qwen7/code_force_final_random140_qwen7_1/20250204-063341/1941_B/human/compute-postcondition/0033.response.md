Output State: **The program returns None**

Explanation: The provided code snippet does not perform any operations that would modify the existing variables or add new values to be returned. It simply includes a `return` statement without specifying any value to return. Therefore, the program returns `None`, which is the default return value when no value is explicitly returned in Python.
