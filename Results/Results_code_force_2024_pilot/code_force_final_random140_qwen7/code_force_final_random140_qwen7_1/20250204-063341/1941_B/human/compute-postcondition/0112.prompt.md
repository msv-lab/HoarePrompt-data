You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: inputarray is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, where each element is in the range [0, 10^9].
def func_3(inputarray):
    if func_2(inputarray) :
        answers.append('YES')
        return
        #The program returns 'YES'
    #State: inputarray is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, where each element is in the range [0, 10^9], and the function func_2(inputarray) returns False
    loop_counter = 1
    while loop_counter != 100:
        length = len(inputarray)
        
        highestNumber = -1
        
        highestIndex = -1
        
        for elementIndex in range(1, length - 1):
            if inputarray[elementIndex] >= highestNumber:
                highestIndex = elementIndex
                highestNumber = inputarray[elementIndex]
        
        if highestNumber < 0:
            answers.append('NO')
            return
        
        newArray = func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)
        
        if func_2(newArray):
            answers.append('YES')
            return
        
        loop_counter += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `loop_counter` is 100, `length` is greater than 1, `elementIndex` is equal to `length - 1`, `highestNumber` is the maximum value found in the array `inputarray` from index 1 to `length - 1`, `highestIndex` is the index of the highest number in the array, `newArray` is the result of `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`, and `func_2(newArray)` has been called but did not return 'YES'. 
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations (i.e., `loop_counter` reaches 100), the loop condition (`loop_counter != 100`) becomes false, terminating the loop. At this point, `loop_counter` will be 100. The loop processes each possible `elementIndex` from 1 to `length - 2` during its iterations, ensuring that `highestNumber` and `highestIndex` are updated appropriately. The final state of `elementIndex` will be `length - 1`, as it checks up to the second last element in the array. The value of `highestNumber` will be the maximum value found in the array from index 1 to `length - 1`, and `highestIndex` will be the index of this maximum value. `newArray` will be the result of `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)` after the last iteration, and `func_2(newArray)` has been evaluated but did not return 'YES', otherwise the loop would have terminated earlier.
    answers.append('NO')
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter inputarray, which is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, where each element is in the range [0, 10^9]. Depending on certain conditions, the function returns 'YES', None, 'YES', None, a list containing 'YES', 'NO', or None.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 'YES'

Case_2: The program returns None

Case_3: The program returns 'YES'

Case_4: The program returns None

Case_5: The program returns a list containing 'YES'

Case_6: The program returns 'NO'

Case_7: The program returns None


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
