Output State: **`elementIndex` is `length - 2`, `length` must be greater than 2, and the current value of `inputarray[highestIndex]` is equal to the current value of `inputarray[elementIndex]`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `elementIndex` to `highestIndex`. Since `elementIndex` was originally `length - 2`, `highestIndex` now also holds the value `length - 2`. The condition that `length` must be greater than 2 remains unchanged. Additionally, since `inputarray[elementIndex]` is greater than or equal to `highestNumber`, it follows that `inputarray[highestIndex]` (which is now the same as `inputarray[elementIndex]`) is also greater than or equal to `highestNumber`.
