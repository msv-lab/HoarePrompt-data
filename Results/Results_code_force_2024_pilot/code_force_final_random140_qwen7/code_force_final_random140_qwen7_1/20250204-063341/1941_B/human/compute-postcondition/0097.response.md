Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `elementIndex` is `length - 1`, `highestNumber` is the maximum value found in `inputarray` from index 1 to `length - 1`, and `highestIndex` is the index of the highest number in the array.**

Explanation: The loop iterates through the array from index 1 to `length - 2`. During each iteration, it checks if the current element is greater than or equal to `highestNumber`. If so, it updates `highestNumber` and `highestIndex` to the current element's value and index, respectively. After completing all iterations, `elementIndex` will be `length - 1`, and `highestNumber` will hold the maximum value found in the array within the specified range, with `highestIndex` pointing to the index of this maximum value.
