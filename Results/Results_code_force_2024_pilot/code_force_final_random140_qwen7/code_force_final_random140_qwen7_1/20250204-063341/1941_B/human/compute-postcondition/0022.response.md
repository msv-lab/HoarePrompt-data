Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `elementIndex`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `elementIndex` is less than `length - 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `loop_counter` is less than 100
   - `length` is greater than 1
   - `elementIndex` is 2
   - `highestNumber` is either the original `highestNumber` (which is `inputarray[2]`) or `inputarray[2]` if `inputarray[2]` is greater than or equal to `highestNumber`

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `elementIndex` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to continue, `elementIndex` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `elementIndex` will be 3.
   - The other variables (`loop_counter`, `length`, and `highestNumber`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `loop_counter` remains less than 100
   - `length` remains greater than 1
   - `elementIndex` is now 3
   - `highestNumber` remains either the original `highestNumber` or `inputarray[2]` if `inputarray[2]` is greater than or equal to `highestNumber`

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `loop_counter` is less than 100, `length` is greater than 1, `elementIndex` is 3, and `highestNumber` is either the original `highestNumber` (which is `inputarray[2]`) or `inputarray[2]` if `inputarray[2]` is greater than or equal to `highestNumber`.**
