Output State: **`elementIndex` is `length - 2`, `length` must be greater than 2, and the current value of `inputarray[highestIndex]` is equal to the current value of `highestNumber`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `inputarray[elementIndex]` to the variable `highestNumber`. Since `elementIndex` is `length - 2`, `highestNumber` now holds the value of `inputarray[length - 2]`. The conditions and values of other variables remain unchanged.
