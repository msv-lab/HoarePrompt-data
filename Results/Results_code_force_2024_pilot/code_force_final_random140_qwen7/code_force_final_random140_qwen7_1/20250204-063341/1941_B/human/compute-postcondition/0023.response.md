Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head specifies the variables that change within the loop. In this case, the loop head involves `elementIndex`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `length - 1`. This means `elementIndex` starts at `1` and increments by `1` until it reaches `length - 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `loop_counter` is less than 100.
   - `length` is greater than 1.
   - `elementIndex` is 2.
   - `highestNumber` is either the original `highestNumber` (which is `inputarray[2]`) or `inputarray[2]` if `inputarray[2]` is greater than or equal to `highestNumber`.

4. **Determine the next value of `elementIndex`**: Since `elementIndex` is currently 2, the next value it will take is `3`.

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `loop_counter` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `length` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `elementIndex` changes to `3`.
   - `highestNumber` remains unchanged as it is not directly affected by the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`loop_counter` is less than 100, `length` is greater than 1, `elementIndex` is 3, and `highestNumber` is either the original `highestNumber` (which is `inputarray[2]`) or `inputarray[2]` if `inputarray[2]` is greater than or equal to `highestNumber`**.
