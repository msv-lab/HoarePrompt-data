Output State: **`elementIndex` is `length`, `highestIndex` is the index of the maximum value in the array from index 1 to `length - 2`, `highestNumber` is the maximum value between the current `highestNumber` and `inputarray[elementIndex]`, and `answers` is a list containing 'NO'.**

The code appends the string `'NO'` to the list `answers`. The values of `elementIndex`, `highestIndex`, and `highestNumber` remain unchanged from their initial states.
