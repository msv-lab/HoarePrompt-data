Output State: **`elementIndex` is `length - 1`, `highestNumber` is the maximum value found in `inputarray` from index 1 to `length - 1`, `highestIndex` is the index of the highest number in the array, `newArray` is the result of `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`, and `answers` contains 'YES'**

Explanation: The line `answers.append('YES')` adds the string `'YES'` to the list `answers`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `elementIndex`, `highestNumber`, `highestIndex`, and `newArray` remain unchanged, and `answers` now includes the string `'YES'`.
