Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `loop_counter` is 1
Code of the loop:
while loop_counter != 100:
    length = len(inputarray)
    highestNumber = -1
    highestIndex = -1
    for elementIndex in range(1, length - 1):
        if inputarray[elementIndex] >= highestNumber:
            highestIndex = elementIndex
            highestNumber = inputarray[elementIndex]
    if highestNumber < 0:
        answers.append('NO')
        return
    newArray = func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)
    if func_2(newArray):
        answers.append('YES')
        return
    loop_counter += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `loop_counter` is less than 100 and equals `loop_counter` + 1, `length` is greater than 1, `elementIndex` is equal to `length - 2`, `highestNumber` is the maximum value found in the array `inputarray` from index 1 to `length - 2`, `highestIndex` is the index of the maximum value in the array within this range, `newArray` is the result of `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`, and `func_2(newArray)` returns `False`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `elementIndex` is `length`, `highestIndex` is the index of the maximum value in the array from index 1 to `length - 2`, `highestNumber` is the maximum value between the current `highestNumber` and `inputarray[elementIndex]`, `newArray` is the result of calling `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`, and `loop_counter` is increased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `elementIndex` is `length - 1`, `highestNumber` is the maximum value found in `inputarray` from index 1 to `length - 1`, `highestIndex` is the index of the highest number in the array, `newArray` is the result of `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`, and `loop_counter` is increased by 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
