Output State: **`elementIndex` is `length`, `highestIndex` is the index of the maximum value in the array from index 1 to `length - 2`, and `highestNumber` is the maximum value between the current `highestNumber` and `inputarray[elementIndex]`.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `elementIndex` will be set to `length` because the loop increments `elementIndex` from 1 to `length - 1`. The loop updates `highestIndex` and `highestNumber` based on the maximum value found in the array from index 1 to `length - 2`. Since the loop iterates through all elements in this range, `highestIndex` will be the index of the maximum value in this subarray, and `highestNumber` will be the maximum value itself.
