Output State: **`elementIndex` is `length`, `highestNumber` is -1, `newArray` is the result of calling `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`, `length` is the length of `inputarray`, and `loop_counter` is less than 100.**

Explanation: The line `highestNumber = -1` sets the value of `highestNumber` to -1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
