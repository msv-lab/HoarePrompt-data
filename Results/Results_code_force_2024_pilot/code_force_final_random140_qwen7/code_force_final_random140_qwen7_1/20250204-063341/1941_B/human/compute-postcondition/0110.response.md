Output State: **`loop_counter` is 100, `length` is greater than 1, `elementIndex` is equal to `length - 1`, `highestNumber` is the maximum value found in the array `inputarray` from index 1 to `length - 1`, `highestIndex` is the index of the highest number in the array, `newArray` is the result of `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`, `answers` is a list containing 'NO', and `func_2(newArray)` has been called but did not return 'YES'.**

This means that after the loop completes, the loop counter remains at 100, and the other variables retain their previous values. The `answers` list now contains 'NO', indicating that `func_2(newArray)` did not return 'YES'.
