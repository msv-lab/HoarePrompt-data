Output State: **`loop_counter` is 1**

The initial state indicates that `inputarray` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, each in the range [0, 10^9], and the function `func_2(inputarray)` returns `False`. The code snippet initializes `loop_counter` to 1. Since no operations are performed on `inputarray` or `func_2`, and no other variables are affected, the only change is the assignment of the value 1 to `loop_counter`.
