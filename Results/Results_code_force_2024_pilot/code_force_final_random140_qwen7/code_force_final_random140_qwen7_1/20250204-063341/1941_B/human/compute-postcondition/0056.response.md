Output State: **`elementIndex` is incremented to `length - 1`; `highestIndex` is equal to `elementIndex`.**

Explanation: The code sets `highestIndex` to `elementIndex`. Since `elementIndex` is incremented to `length - 1`, `highestIndex` also becomes `length - 1`. The length remains unchanged and is still greater than 2. The condition for `highestNumber` remains as per the current state unless `inputarray[elementIndex]` is checked and found to be less than `highestNumber`.
