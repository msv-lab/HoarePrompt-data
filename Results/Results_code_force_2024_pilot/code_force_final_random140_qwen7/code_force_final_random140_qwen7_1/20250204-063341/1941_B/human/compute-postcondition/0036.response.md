Output State: **`loop_counter` is less than 100, `length` is greater than 1, `elementIndex` is equal to `length - 2`, `highestNumber` is the maximum value found in the array `inputarray` from index 1 to `length - 2`, `highestIndex` is the index of the maximum value in the array within this range, `newArray` is the result of `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`**.

Explanation: The code `newArray = func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)` creates a new array `newArray` by calling the function `func_1` with `inputarray` and `highestIndex` as arguments. The values of `loop_counter`, `length`, `elementIndex`, `highestNumber`, and `highestIndex` remain unchanged from their initial states.
