Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for elementIndex in range(1, length - 1):`.
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `elementIndex` and `length`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute:**
   - The loop starts with `elementIndex` set to 1 and ends when `elementIndex` is less than `length - 1`.
   - Therefore, `elementIndex` must be at least 1 and less than `length - 1` for the loop to execute.

3. **Check the Given States:**
   - `elementIndex` is currently set to `length`.
   - `length` is the length of `inputarray`.
   - `highestNumber` is -1 (not relevant to the loop).
   - `newArray` is the result of calling `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)` (not relevant to the loop).
   - `highestIndex` is -1 (not relevant to the loop).
   - `loop_counter` is less than 100 (not relevant to the loop).

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since `elementIndex` must be at least 1 and less than `length - 1` for the loop to execute, we need to adjust `elementIndex` to be 1.
   - `length` should remain as it is because it is used to determine the upper limit of the loop.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `elementIndex` to be 1 and `length` to remain as it is.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`elementIndex` is 1, `length` is the length of `inputarray`**
