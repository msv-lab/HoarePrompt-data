Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has a few issues that prevent it from correctly determining whether it's possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operations. Here are the key problems:

1. **Global `answers` Variable**: The variable `answers` is not defined within the functions. This would result in a NameError when trying to append 'YES' or 'NO'.

2. **Loop Termination Condition**: The loop in `func_3` is set to run up to 100 iterations, which is arbitrary and does not guarantee correctness. If the array cannot be made zero within 100 steps, the function incorrectly returns 'NO'. The correct approach should be to ensure the array can be reduced to all zeros or prove it's impossible.

3. **Operation Application Logic**: The logic for selecting the highest number and applying the operation is correct but could be optimized. However, the main issue lies in the termination condition and the use of a fixed number of iterations.

4. **Edge Cases**: The solution does not handle edge cases where the array might not be reducible to all zeros even with multiple operations.

### Suggested Solution:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to check if the sum of the array elements is divisible by 3. If it is, then it is possible to reduce the array to all zeros; otherwise, it is not.

Hereâ€™s a revised version of the solution:

```python
def can_reduce_to_zero(array):
    total_sum = sum(array)
    # Check if the total sum is divisible by 3
    return total_sum % 3 == 0

# Example usage:
t = int(input())
answers = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    array = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if can_reduce_to_zero(array):
        answers.append('YES')
    else:
        answers.append('NO')

for answer in answers:
    print(answer)
```

This solution checks the divisibility of the sum by 3 and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly. This approach is more efficient and handles all edge cases correctly.
