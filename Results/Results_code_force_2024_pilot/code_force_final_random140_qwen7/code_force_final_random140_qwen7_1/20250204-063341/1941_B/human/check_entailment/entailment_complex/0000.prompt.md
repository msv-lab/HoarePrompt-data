Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

    YES
    NO
    NO
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

# Annotated Functions:

numberOfArrays = int(input())
for arrayCounter in range(0, numberOfArrays):

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: array is a list of integers, index is an integer such that 2 <= index <= len(array) - 1.
def func_1(array, index):
    array[index - 1] = array[index - 1] - 1
    array[index] = array[index] - 2
    array[index + 1] = array[index + 1] - 1
    return array
    #The program returns a list of integers where the element at index-1 is decreased by 1, the element at index is decreased by 2, and the element at index+1 is decreased by 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `array` and an integer `index` (where 2 <= index <= len(array) - 1). It returns a new list of integers where the element at index-1 is decreased by 1, the element at index is decreased by 2, and the element at index+1 is decreased by 1. After the function concludes, the original list `array` remains unchanged, and the returned list reflects the specified decrements at the given indices.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arrayForSuccess is a list of integers representing the current state of Rudolf's array after applying the operations.
def func_2(arrayForSuccess):
    for x in arrayForSuccess:
        if x != 0:
            return False
        
    #State: Output State: The function has returned False because one of the elements in `arrayForSuccess` was not equal to 0 during the loop's execution.
    #
    #Explanation: Given the conditions provided, the loop will continue to iterate through each element in `arrayForSuccess` as long as `x` is not equal to 0. Since the loop executed up to the third iteration, it means that the first two elements were equal to 0 (otherwise, the function would have returned False earlier). However, the third element was not equal to 0, which caused the function to return False immediately. Therefore, the final state of the function is that it has returned False due to finding a non-zero element in the list.
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a list of integers named `arrayForSuccess`. It checks each element in the list; if any element is not equal to zero, the function returns `False`. If all elements are zero, the function returns `True`. There are four possible outcomes: the function returns `False` if any non-zero element is found, and it returns `True` only if all elements are zero.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: inputarray is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, where each element is in the range [0, 10^9].
def func_3(inputarray):
    if func_2(inputarray) :
        answers.append('YES')
        return
        #The program returns 'YES'
    #State: inputarray is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, where each element is in the range [0, 10^9], and the function func_2(inputarray) returns False
    loop_counter = 1
    while loop_counter != 100:
        length = len(inputarray)
        
        highestNumber = -1
        
        highestIndex = -1
        
        for elementIndex in range(1, length - 1):
            if inputarray[elementIndex] >= highestNumber:
                highestIndex = elementIndex
                highestNumber = inputarray[elementIndex]
        
        if highestNumber < 0:
            answers.append('NO')
            return
        
        newArray = func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)
        
        if func_2(newArray):
            answers.append('YES')
            return
        
        loop_counter += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `loop_counter` is 100, `length` is greater than 1, `elementIndex` is equal to `length - 1`, `highestNumber` is the maximum value found in the array `inputarray` from index 1 to `length - 1`, `highestIndex` is the index of the highest number in the array, `newArray` is the result of `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`, and `func_2(newArray)` has been called but did not return 'YES'. 
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations (i.e., `loop_counter` reaches 100), the loop condition (`loop_counter != 100`) becomes false, terminating the loop. At this point, `loop_counter` will be 100. The loop processes each possible `elementIndex` from 1 to `length - 2` during its iterations, ensuring that `highestNumber` and `highestIndex` are updated appropriately. The final state of `elementIndex` will be `length - 1`, as it checks up to the second last element in the array. The value of `highestNumber` will be the maximum value found in the array from index 1 to `length - 1`, and `highestIndex` will be the index of this maximum value. `newArray` will be the result of `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)` after the last iteration, and `func_2(newArray)` has been evaluated but did not return 'YES', otherwise the loop would have terminated earlier.
    answers.append('NO')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts a list of integers `inputarray` with at least 3 elements, where each element is in the range [0, 10^9]. It first checks if `func_2(inputarray)` returns `True`. If so, it appends 'YES' to the `answers` list and returns. If not, it iterates up to 100 times, finding the highest number in the array excluding the first and last elements, creating a new array based on this highest number, and checking if `func_2(newArray)` returns `True`. If `func_2(newArray)` returns `True` at any point, it appends 'YES' to the `answers` list and returns. If the loop completes without finding such a case, it appends 'NO' to the `answers` list and returns. The function can return 'YES', 'NO', or `None` based on the conditions met during its execution.
