Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly performs the specified operation by decrementing the elements at specific indices in the array. It does not modify the original array but returns a new list with the decremented values. This function is correctly implemented.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function checks if all elements in the array are zero. If any element is non-zero, it returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`. This function is correctly implemented and serves its purpose accurately.

3. **Function `func_3`**: This function is designed to determine if it's possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operations. It first checks if the array is already zero using `func_2`. If not, it enters a loop where it finds the highest number in the array (excluding the first and last elements) and applies the operation defined in `func_1`. It then checks if the resulting array is zero using `func_2`. If it finds a way to make the array zero, it appends 'YES' to the `answers` list. If it exhausts 100 iterations without finding a solution, it appends 'NO'. The logic here is sound and correctly implements the problem's requirements.

Given the annotations and the implementation details, the program correctly handles all aspects of the problem statement. It checks the initial condition, attempts to reduce the array to zero using the specified operations, and correctly identifies when it is impossible to do so.

Correctness: **True**
