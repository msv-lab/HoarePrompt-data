You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

    #
    #Explanation: Given the conditions provided, the loop will continue to iterate through each element in `arrayForSuccess` as long as `x` is not equal to 0. Since the loop executed up to the third iteration, it means that the first two elements were equal to 0 (otherwise, the function would have returned False earlier). However, the third element was not equal to 0, which caused the function to return False immediately. Therefore, the final state of the function is that it has returned False due to finding a non-zero element in the list.

    #State: Output State: `loop_counter` is 100, `length` is greater than 1, `elementIndex` is equal to `length - 1`, `highestNumber` is the maximum value found in the array `inputarray` from index 1 to `length - 1`, `highestIndex` is the index of the highest number in the array, `newArray` is the result of `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`, and `func_2(newArray)` has been called but did not return 'YES'. 
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations (i.e., `loop_counter` reaches 100), the loop condition (`loop_counter != 100`) becomes false, terminating the loop. At this point, `loop_counter` will be 100. The loop processes each possible `elementIndex` from 1 to `length - 2` during its iterations, ensuring that `highestNumber` and `highestIndex` are updated appropriately. The final state of `elementIndex` will be `length - 1`, as it checks up to the second last element in the array. The value of `highestNumber` will be the maximum value found in the array from index 1 to `length - 1`, and `highestIndex` will be the index of this maximum value. `newArray` will be the result of `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)` after the last iteration, and `func_2(newArray)` has been evaluated but did not return 'YES', otherwise the loop would have terminated earlier.
    answers.append('NO')




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic in `func_3` does not guarantee that all elements can be reduced to zero. Here's a counterexample:

Consider the array `[2, 2, 2]`. According to the problem description, we can apply the operation to reduce the middle element by 2, but this operation also reduces the adjacent elements by 1. This means that after applying the operation once, the array becomes `[1, 0, 1]`. From this point, no further operations can reduce the array to all zeros because the middle element is zero, and the adjacent elements cannot be reduced without violating the operation rules.

The current implementation of `func_3` does not account for such scenarios, leading to incorrect results for certain inputs. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
