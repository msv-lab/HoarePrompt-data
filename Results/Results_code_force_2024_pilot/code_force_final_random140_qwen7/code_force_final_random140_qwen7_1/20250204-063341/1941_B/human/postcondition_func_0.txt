The function accepts a list of integers `array` and an integer `index` (where 2 <= index <= len(array) - 1). It returns a new list of integers where the element at index-1 is decreased by 1, the element at index is decreased by 2, and the element at index+1 is decreased by 1. After the function concludes, the original list `array` remains unchanged, and the returned list reflects the specified decrements at the given indices.
