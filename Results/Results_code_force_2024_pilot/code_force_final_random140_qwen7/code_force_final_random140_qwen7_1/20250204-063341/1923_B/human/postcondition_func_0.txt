The function processes two lists, `a` and `b`, based on user inputs for `n` and `k`. It reads `n` integers into list `a` and `n+1` integers into list `b`. For each integer `x` read, it updates `b[abs(x)]` by adding the corresponding element from `a`. After processing, it calculates a running total `r` starting from `k`, subtracting the values in `b` from `r` up to `n`. If at any point `r` becomes less than the current value in `b`, it prints 'NO' and exits. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. If the input format is invalid, it prints 'Invalid input format'. The function does not return any value.
