Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `for i in range(1, n + 1):` statement. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `i < n + 1` must be true.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` is greater than 0
   - `r` is decreased by `b[2]`

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 3.
   - The condition for the loop to continue (`i < n + 1`) still holds as long as `n` remains greater than 0.
   - The value of `r` is not directly affected by the loop, so it remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0**
