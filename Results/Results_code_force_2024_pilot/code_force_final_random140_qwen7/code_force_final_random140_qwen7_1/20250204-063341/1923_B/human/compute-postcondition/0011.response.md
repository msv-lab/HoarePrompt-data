Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input data through a series of test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `t` (representing the number of test cases), followed by pairs of integers `n` and `k` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^9), and lists of integers `a_i` and `x_i` (where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and -n ≤ x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n ≤ n with x_i ≠ 0). It returns different outputs based on the conditions specified for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each involving specific ranges and conditions for integers `n`, `k`, `a_i`, and `x_i`, and it processes these inputs to produce the appropriate output for each case.
