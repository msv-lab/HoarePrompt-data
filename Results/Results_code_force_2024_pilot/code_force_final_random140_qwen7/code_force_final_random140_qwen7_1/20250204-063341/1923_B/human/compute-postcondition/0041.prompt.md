You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^9; a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; b is a list of n+1 integers initialized to 0, and for each i (0 ≤ i ≤ n), b[abs(x_i)] += a_i, where x_i is an integer such that -n ≤ x_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ 0.
def func_1():
    try:
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b = [0] * (n + 1)
        for i in range(n):
            x = int(input())
            
            b[abs(x)] += a[i]
            
        #State: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `x` will be the last input integer provided, and `b[abs(x)]` will be increased by `a[n-1]`.
        #
        #In more detail, the loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`. After all iterations, the final value of `i` will be `n`. During each iteration, the value of `x` is taken as input and `b[abs(x)]` is incremented by the corresponding element in list `a`. Therefore, the final state of the list `b` will have its elements updated based on the absolute values of the inputs provided and the values in list `a`.
        r = 0
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            r += k
            
            if r < b[i]:
                print('NO')
                return
            
            r -= b[i]
            
        #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `r` will be the initial value of `r` minus the sum of all elements in the list `b` from index 1 to `n`.
        #
        #Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n`. In each iteration, `r` is decreased by the value of `b[i]`. Therefore, after all iterations, `r` will be the initial value of `r` minus the sum of all elements in `b` from index 1 to `n`.
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
    except (ValueError):
        print('Invalid input format')
        #This is printed: Invalid input format
    #State: `n` and `k` are integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers, and `b` is a list of `n+1` integers initialized to 0. After the loop executes all its iterations, `r` will be the initial value of `r` minus the sum of all elements in the list `b` from index 1 to `n`. If the input format is invalid, the function prints 'Invalid input format' and returns.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and does not return any value since there is no return statement provided.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program does not return any value since there is no return statement provided.

Case_2: The program returns None

Case_3: The program returns None


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
