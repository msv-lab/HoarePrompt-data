Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable involved here is `t`.

2. **Understand the condition for loop execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**: At the end of the previous iteration, `t` must be greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0. Since the loop decrements or otherwise modifies `t` by 1 each iteration (as implied by the use of `range(t)`), `t` will be reduced by 1 at the start of each new iteration.

5. **Update the state**: Since `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to continue, at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be `t - 1` and it must still be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` must be greater than 1**
