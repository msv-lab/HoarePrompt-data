Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `r` is decreased by `b[1]`.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n + 1`.
   - Since `i` is currently 1, the loop will execute if `1 < n + 1`, which simplifies to `n > 0`. This condition is already satisfied based on the current state.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 2.
   - `n` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 0.
   - `r` is not part of the loop head, so its state does not change for this iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0**
