Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `r` will be decreased by the sum of all elements in the list `b` from index 1 to `n`.

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n`. In each iteration, `r` is decreased by `b[i]`. Therefore, after all iterations, `r` will be decreased by `b[1] + b[2] + ... + b[n]`.
