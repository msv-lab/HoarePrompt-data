Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `r` is increased by `k`.**

The code `r += k` increments the value of `r` by the value of `k`. However, since the initial value of `r` is not specified, we only know that `r` has been increased by `k`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
