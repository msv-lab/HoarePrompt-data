Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `t` in the expression `range(t)`. This means `t` is the only variable that affects whether the loop can execute.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `t` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

3. **Adjust the State**: Since `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again, we need to ensure that `t` remains greater than 0.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `t` must still be greater than 0.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
