You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are playing a computer game. The current level of this game can be modeled
as a straight line. Your character is in point 0 of this line. There are n
monsters trying to kill your character; the i -th monster has health equal to
a_i and is initially in the point x_i .

Every second, the following happens:

  * first, you fire up to k bullets at monsters. Each bullet targets exactly one monster and decreases its health by 1 . For each bullet, you choose its target arbitrary (for example, you can fire all bullets at one monster, fire all bullets at different monsters, or choose any other combination). Any monster can be targeted by a bullet, regardless of its position and any other factors; 
  * then, all alive monsters with health 0 or less die; 
  * then, all alive monsters move 1 point closer to you (monsters to the left of you increase their coordinates by 1 , monsters to the right of you decrease their coordinates by 1 ). If any monster reaches your character (moves to the point 0 ), you lose. 

Can you survive and kill all n monsters without letting any of them reach your
character?

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 3 \cdot 10^4 )
— the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines:

  * the first line contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ; 1 \le k \le 2 \cdot 10^9 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains n integers x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n (-n \le x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < \dots < x_n \le n ; x_i \ne 0 ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if you can kill all n monsters before they reach
your character, or NO otherwise.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

    1 2 3
    
    -1 2 3
    
    2 1
    
    1 1
    
    -1 1

    -3 -2 1 3
    
    5 3
    
    2 1 3 2 5
    
    -3 -2 3 4 5
    
    2 1
    
    1 2
    
    1 2

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, you can act as follows:

  * during the 1 -st second, fire 1 bullet at the 1 -st monster and 1 bullet at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 1 -st monster dies, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd monster move closer; 
  * during the 2 -nd second, fire 2 bullets at the 2 -nd monster. Then the 2 -nd monster dies, the 3 -rd monster moves closer; 
  * during the 3 -rd second, fire 2 bullets at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 3 -rd monster dies. 

In the second example, you can fire only 1 bullet, so you can kill only one of
the two monsters during the 1 -st second. Then, the remaining monster moves
closer and kills your character.

        #In more detail, the loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`. After all iterations, the final value of `i` will be `n`. During each iteration, the value of `x` is taken as input and `b[abs(x)]` is incremented by the corresponding element in list `a`. Therefore, the final state of the list `b` will have its elements updated based on the absolute values of the inputs provided and the values in list `a`.

        #
        #Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n`. In each iteration, `r` is decreased by the value of `b[i]`. Therefore, after all iterations, `r` will be the initial value of `r` minus the sum of all elements in `b` from index 1 to `n`.

After the loop executes all its iterations, `r` will be the initial value of `r` minus the sum of all elements in the list `b` from index 1 to `n`. If the input format is invalid, the function prints 'Invalid input format' and returns.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes two lists, `a` and `b`, based on user inputs for `n` and `k`. It reads `n` integers into list `a` and `n+1` integers into list `b`. For each integer `x` read, it updates `b[abs(x)]` by adding the corresponding element from `a`. After processing, it calculates a running total `r` starting from `k`, subtracting the values in `b` from `r` up to `n`. If at any point `r` becomes less than the current value in `b`, it prints 'NO' and exits. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. If the input format is invalid, it prints 'Invalid input format'. The function does not return any value.

        #
        #Natural Language Description: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `t` must be greater than or equal to the total number of iterations because the loop continues as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since the loop runs up to the third iteration with the given conditions, `t` must initially be at least 3 to allow for all iterations to complete.

    #State: `t` is an integer, and it must be greater than or equal to the total number of iterations. If the input is not a valid integer, the function prints 'Invalid input format' and returns None.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t` (representing the number of test cases), followed by pairs of integers `n` and `k`, and lists of integers `a_i` and `x_i`. If the input is valid, it executes a series of operations defined within `func_1()` for each test case. If the input is invalid (i.e., not a valid integer), it prints 'Invalid input format' and returns `None`. The function ensures that `t` is an integer and is greater than or equal to the total number of iterations, allowing all test cases to be processed.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - `func_1` reads the number of monsters `n` and the number of bullets `k`.
   - It then reads the health values `a` for each monster.
   - It reads the positions `x` of each monster.
   - The positions are stored in an array `b` where `b[abs(x)]` is incremented by the corresponding health value `a[i]`.

2. **Logic to Determine Survival**:
   - The program iterates through the positions from 1 to `n` (inclusive).
   - For each position `i`, it calculates how many bullets are needed to kill all monsters at that position (`r += k`).
   - If the number of bullets needed (`r`) is less than the total health of the monsters at that position (`b[i]`), the function prints 'NO' and returns immediately.
   - Otherwise, it subtracts the health of the monsters at that position from the number of bullets (`r -= b[i]`).

3. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**:
   - `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case.

### Correctness Check

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly handles the input format and catches invalid input using a `try-except` block.

2. **Logic for Determining Survival**:
   - The logic to determine if the player can survive is correct. The program checks if the number of bullets available is sufficient to kill all monsters at each position before they can move closer to the player.
   - The logic ensures that the player can only fire up to `k` bullets per second, and it correctly accounts for the health of the monsters and their movement.

3. **Test Case Handling**:
   - The program correctly processes multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each test case.

### Example Walkthrough

Let's verify the logic with the provided examples:

#### Example 1:
```
3 2
1 2 3
-1 2 3
```
- `b` array: `[0, 1, 3, 3]`
- Iteration:
  - Position 1: `r = 2` (2 bullets needed), `b[1] = 1` (1 bullet used), `r = 1`
  - Position 2: `r = 2` (2 bullets needed), `b[2] = 3` (3 bullets used), `r = -1` (not enough bullets, print 'NO')
- Output: `NO`

#### Example 2:
```
2 1
1 1
-1 1
```
- `b` array: `[0, 1, 1]`
- Iteration:
  - Position 1: `r = 1` (1 bullet needed), `b[1] = 1` (1 bullet used), `r = 0`
  - Position 2: `r = 1` (1 bullet needed), `b[2] = 1` (1 bullet used), `r = 0`
- Output: `NO`

### Conclusion

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if the player can survive and kill all monsters without letting any of them reach the player. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
