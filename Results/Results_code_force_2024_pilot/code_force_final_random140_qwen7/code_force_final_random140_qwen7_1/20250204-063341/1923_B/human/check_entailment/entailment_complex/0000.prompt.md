Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are playing a computer game. The current level of this game can be modeled
as a straight line. Your character is in point 0 of this line. There are n
monsters trying to kill your character; the i -th monster has health equal to
a_i and is initially in the point x_i .

Every second, the following happens:

  * first, you fire up to k bullets at monsters. Each bullet targets exactly one monster and decreases its health by 1 . For each bullet, you choose its target arbitrary (for example, you can fire all bullets at one monster, fire all bullets at different monsters, or choose any other combination). Any monster can be targeted by a bullet, regardless of its position and any other factors; 
  * then, all alive monsters with health 0 or less die; 
  * then, all alive monsters move 1 point closer to you (monsters to the left of you increase their coordinates by 1 , monsters to the right of you decrease their coordinates by 1 ). If any monster reaches your character (moves to the point 0 ), you lose. 

Can you survive and kill all n monsters without letting any of them reach your
character?

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 3 \cdot 10^4 )
— the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines:

  * the first line contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ; 1 \le k \le 2 \cdot 10^9 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains n integers x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n (-n \le x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < \dots < x_n \le n ; x_i \ne 0 ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if you can kill all n monsters before they reach
your character, or NO otherwise.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

    3 2
    
    1 2 3
    
    -1 2 3
    
    2 1
    
    1 1
    
    -1 1
    
    4 10
    
    3 4 2 5
    
    -3 -2 1 3
    
    5 3
    
    2 1 3 2 5
    
    -3 -2 3 4 5
    
    2 1
    
    1 2
    
    1 2

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, you can act as follows:

  * during the 1 -st second, fire 1 bullet at the 1 -st monster and 1 bullet at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 1 -st monster dies, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd monster move closer; 
  * during the 2 -nd second, fire 2 bullets at the 2 -nd monster. Then the 2 -nd monster dies, the 3 -rd monster moves closer; 
  * during the 3 -rd second, fire 2 bullets at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 3 -rd monster dies. 

In the second example, you can fire only 1 bullet, so you can kill only one of
the two monsters during the 1 -st second. Then, the remaining monster moves
closer and kills your character.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^9; a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; b is a list of n+1 integers initialized to 0, and for each i (0 ≤ i ≤ n), b[abs(x_i)] += a_i, where x_i is an integer such that -n ≤ x_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ 0.
def func_1():
    try:
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b = [0] * (n + 1)

        #State: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `x` will be the last input integer provided, and `b[abs(x)]` will be increased by `a[n-1]`.
        #
        #In more detail, the loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`. After all iterations, the final value of `i` will be `n`. During each iteration, the value of `x` is taken as input and `b[abs(x)]` is incremented by the corresponding element in list `a`. Therefore, the final state of the list `b` will have its elements updated based on the absolute values of the inputs provided and the values in list `a`.
        r = 0
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            r += k

                print('NO')
                return
            
            r -= b[i]
            
        #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `r` will be the initial value of `r` minus the sum of all elements in the list `b` from index 1 to `n`.
        #
        #Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n`. In each iteration, `r` is decreased by the value of `b[i]`. Therefore, after all iterations, `r` will be the initial value of `r` minus the sum of all elements in `b` from index 1 to `n`.
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
    except (ValueError):
        print('Invalid input format')
        #This is printed: Invalid input format
    #State: `n` and `k` are integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers, and `b` is a list of `n+1` integers initialized to 0. After the loop executes all its iterations, `r` will be the initial value of `r` minus the sum of all elements in the list `b` from index 1 to `n`. If the input format is invalid, the function prints 'Invalid input format' and returns.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes two lists, `a` and `b`, based on user inputs for `n` and `k`. It reads `n` integers into list `a` and `n+1` integers into list `b`. For each integer `x` read, it updates `b[abs(x)]` by adding the corresponding element from `a`. After processing, it calculates a running total `r` starting from `k`, subtracting the values in `b` from `r` up to `n`. If at any point `r` becomes less than the current value in `b`, it prints 'NO' and exits. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. If the input format is invalid, it prints 'Invalid input format'. The function does not return any value.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases; n and k are integers for each test case where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^9; a_i and x_i are integers for each monster where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and -n ≤ x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n ≤ n with x_i ≠ 0.
def func_2():
    try:
        t = int(input())
        for _ in range(t):
            func_1()
            
        #State: Output State: `t` must be greater than or equal to the total number of iterations.
        #
        #Natural Language Description: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `t` must be greater than or equal to the total number of iterations because the loop continues as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since the loop runs up to the third iteration with the given conditions, `t` must initially be at least 3 to allow for all iterations to complete.
    except (ValueError):
        print('Invalid input format')
        #This is printed: Invalid input format
    #State: `t` is an integer, and it must be greater than or equal to the total number of iterations. If the input is not a valid integer, the function prints 'Invalid input format' and returns None.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t` (representing the number of test cases), followed by pairs of integers `n` and `k`, and lists of integers `a_i` and `x_i`. If the input is valid, it executes a series of operations defined within `func_1()` for each test case. If the input is invalid (i.e., not a valid integer), it prints 'Invalid input format' and returns `None`. The function ensures that `t` is an integer and is greater than or equal to the total number of iterations, allowing all test cases to be processed.
