Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine if the player can survive and kill all monsters without letting any of them reach the player's character. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - It reads the values of `n` and `k`, which represent the number of monsters and the number of bullets that can be fired per second, respectively.
   - It then reads the health values `a_i` for each monster.
   - It reads the positions `x_i` of the monsters and calculates the total health of the monsters that would be within `i` units from the player after `i` seconds.
   - It iterates through each possible distance `i` from 1 to `n` and checks if the player can kill all monsters within that distance using `k` bullets per second.
3. **Logic Check**:
   - The variable `r` keeps track of the remaining bullets after firing them at the monsters.
   - If at any point the remaining bullets `r` are less than the total health of the monsters within the current distance `i`, it prints 'NO' indicating the player cannot survive.
   - If the loop completes without finding such a situation, it prints 'YES', indicating the player can survive.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the function `func_1()` and `func_2()` correctly handle the input and produce the expected output. Therefore, the program is correct.
