### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - This function processes a single test case.
   - It reads the number of monsters (`n`) and the number of bullets per second (`k`).
   - It then reads the health points (`a_i`) and positions (`x_i`) of the monsters.
   - The positions are mapped to indices in a list `b`, where `b[abs(x_i)] += a_i`.
   - The function then checks if it's possible to kill all monsters before they reach the player. It does this by simulating the process of firing bullets and moving monsters.
   - The logic in the function is correct for determining whether the player can survive and kill all monsters.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - This function handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1()`.
   - The function correctly handles the loop for processing each test case and ensures that the input format is valid.

3. **Overall Program**:
   - The program structure is correct. It first reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually.
   - The input and output handling is appropriate, and the functions are called in the correct order.

Given the detailed analysis, the program appears to be correct according to the problem statement and the provided execution states.

### Correctness:
**True**
