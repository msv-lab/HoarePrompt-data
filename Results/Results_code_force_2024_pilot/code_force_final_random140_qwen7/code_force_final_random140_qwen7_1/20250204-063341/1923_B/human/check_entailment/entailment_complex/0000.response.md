Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly processes the input for a single test case.
   - It initializes the list `b` to store the total health of monsters at each position.
   - It then iterates through the positions and updates the list `b` with the health of monsters.
   - After updating `b`, it checks if the character can survive by ensuring that the running total `r` (starting with `k`) can handle the health of monsters moving towards the character.
   - If at any point `r` becomes less than the current health of a monster, it prints 'NO' and exits.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1` to process the input and determine if the character can survive.
   - If the input format is invalid, it prints 'Invalid input format'.
   - The function ensures that `t` is a valid integer and processes all test cases.

Given the problem description and the annotated functions, both functions together correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. They handle the input, process each test case, and determine the correct output ('YES' or 'NO') based on the given constraints and rules of the game.

Correctness: **True**
