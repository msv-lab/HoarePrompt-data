Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves determining if a player can survive and kill all monsters without any of them reaching the player's position (point 0) on a straight line. The player can fire up to `k` bullets per second, and each bullet reduces a monster's health by 1. Monsters move towards the player after each second, and if any monster reaches the player's position, the player loses.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1()**: This function processes a single test case. It reads the necessary inputs (`n`, `k`, `a`, and `x`) and calculates whether the player can survive. The logic in `func_1()` correctly simulates the process of firing bullets and moving monsters, checking if the player can survive.
   - **func_2()**: This function handles multiple test cases. It reads the number of test cases `t` and then calls `func_1()` for each test case. The function ensures that the input format is valid and processes each test case appropriately.

3. **Verification**:
   - The execution summary of `func_1()` matches the problem description. It correctly processes the inputs, simulates the game mechanics, and determines if the player can survive.
   - The execution summary of `func_2()` also matches the problem description. It correctly handles multiple test cases and calls `func_1()` for each one.

Given that both functions correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem and match the provided execution summaries, the overall program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
