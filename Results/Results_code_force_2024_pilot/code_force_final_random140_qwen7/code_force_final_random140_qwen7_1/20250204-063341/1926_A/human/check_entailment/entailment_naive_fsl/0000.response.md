Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic to count the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in the string. Specifically, the line `list(userString)` is unnecessary and does not affect the outcome, but it also does not contribute to the counting process. The actual issue lies in the fact that the program does not handle the case where the input string might not contain any 'B's or 'A's at all, which would result in an incorrect output.

For example, if the input string is "CDEFG" (which is not possible according to the problem constraints but serves to illustrate the point), the program would not execute the counting logic and would simply skip over the `else` block, leading to no output or an incorrect default behavior. However, since the problem specifies that the input string will only contain 'A' and 'B', this specific case is not applicable here. 

The main issue is that the program does not correctly count the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' and determine which one appears more frequently. The provided implementation does not have a clear way to handle ties or to ensure that it prints the character that appears most frequently. 

To fix this, the program should clearly count the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' and then print the one that appears more frequently. Here is a corrected version:

```python
def func_1(userString):
    countA = 0
    countB = 0
    for letter in userString:
        if letter == 'A':
            countA += 1
        elif letter == 'B':
            countB += 1
    if countA >= countB:
        print('A')
    else:
        print('B')

# Test cases
userStrings = ['ABABB', 'ABABA', 'BBBAB', 'AAAAA', 'BBBBB', 'BABAA', 'AAAAB', 'BAAAA']
for userString in userStrings:
    func_1(userString)
```

This corrected version ensures that the program correctly counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' and prints the one that appears most frequently.
