Reasoning:

1. **Function Logic**: The function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in the given string `userString`. It iterates through each character in the string, increments the respective counter (`countA` or `countB`), and handles invalid characters with a `continue` statement (though in this specific implementation, it should not encounter any other characters since the input is guaranteed to be 'A' or 'B').

2. **Conditional Statements**: The conditional logic within the function correctly determines which character ('A' or 'B') appears more frequently. If the count of 'A' is greater, it prints 'A'. If the count of 'B' is greater, it prints 'B'. If the counts are equal, it does nothing, but since the problem specifies that all strings are distinct and of length 5, the counts will never be exactly equal (as there must be at least one 'A' or 'B' due to the constraints).

3. **Input Handling**: The annotated program initializes `userStrings` with a predefined list of test cases. However, the actual input handling is not shown in the provided code snippet. The function `func_1` is called with each element of `userStrings`, which is consistent with the problem statement requiring multiple test cases.

4. **Output**: The function directly prints the result, which matches the problem requirement of printing the character that appears most frequently for each test case.

Given the above points, the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic required by the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
