Output State: **`userString` is a string of length 5 consisting of the characters 'A' and 'B', `letter` is the first character of `userString` and `letter` is equal to 'A', `countA` is 1**.

Explanation: The variable `countA` is incremented by 1, starting from an unspecified initial value (which was 0 before the increment). Since `letter` is equal to 'A', `countA` is incremented once, making its value 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
