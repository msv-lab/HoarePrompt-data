Output State: **`userString` is a string of length 5 consisting of the characters 'A' and 'B', `letter` is the third character of `userString`, `countB` is 2 if the second character was 'B' and 1 otherwise.**

Explanation: The code `countB += 1` increments the value of `countB` by 1. Since `countB` was initially 1 if the second character of `userString` was 'B', after executing the code, if the second character was 'B', `countB` will be 2, otherwise, it will remain 1. The values of `userString`, `letter`, and `countA` are not affected by this code.
