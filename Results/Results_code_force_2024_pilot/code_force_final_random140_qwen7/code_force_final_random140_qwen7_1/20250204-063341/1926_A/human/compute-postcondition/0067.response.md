Postcondition: `a` is a non-empty string, `l` is the total count of characters in `a` that are 'A' (either incremented by 1 if `j` is 'A' or unchanged if `j` is not 'A'), `h` is the total count of characters in `a` that are not 'A' (either incremented by 1 if `j` is not 'A' or unchanged if `j` is 'A'), `i` is incremented by 1, and `t` is the same as before.
