Postcondition: `userString` is a string of length 5 consisting of the characters 'A' and 'B', `countA` is the total number of 'A's in `userString`, and `countB` is the total number of 'B's in `userString`. After executing the if-else block, either `countA` is greater than `countB` or `countB` is greater than or equal to `countA`.
