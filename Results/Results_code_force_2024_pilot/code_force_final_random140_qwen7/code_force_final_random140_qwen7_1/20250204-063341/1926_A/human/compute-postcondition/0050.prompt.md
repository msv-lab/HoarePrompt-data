Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a new string input from the user, `l` is the total count of characters in `a` that are in 'A', `h` is the total count of characters in `a` that are not in 'A', `i` is `t`, and the condition `l > h` holds true if `l` is greater than `h`.
Code of the loop:
for j in a:
    if j in 'A':
        l += 1
    else:
        h += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `a` is a new string input from the user, `j` is the first character of `a`, `l` is the total count of characters in `a` that are in 'A', and `h` is the total count of characters in `a` that are not in 'A'. If the first character `j` is in 'A', then `l` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `h` is incremented by 1. Additionally, it is guaranteed that `l > h` remains true after the execution of the if-else block.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a new string input from the user, `j` is the second character of `a`, `l` is the total count of characters in `a` that are in 'A' with an adjustment based on whether `j` is in 'A' (if `j` is in 'A', `l` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `l` remains unchanged), and `h` is the total count of characters in `a` that are not in 'A' with an adjustment based on whether `j` is not in 'A' (if `j` is not in 'A', `h` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `h` remains unchanged).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a new string input from the user, `j` is the third character of `a`, `l` is the total count of characters in `a` that are in 'A' with an adjustment based on whether the third character `j` is in 'A' (either plus 1 or not), and `h` is the total count of characters in `a` that are not in 'A' with an adjustment based on whether the third character `j` is not in 'A' (either plus 1 or not).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
