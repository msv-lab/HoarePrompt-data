Output State: **`userString` is a string of length 5 consisting of the characters 'A' and 'B', `letter` is the second character of `userString`, `countB` is 1.**

Explanation: The variable `countB` is incremented by 1. Since `letter` is the second character of `userString`, and `userString` consists of characters 'A' and 'B', `countB` was initially 0 (as it is not specified otherwise). After executing `countB += 1`, `countB` becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
