Postcondition: `userString` is a string of length 5 consisting of the characters 'A' and 'B'. If the first character of `userString` is 'B', then `letter` is 'B' and `countB` is 1. If the first character of `userString` is not 'B', then `letter` remains the same as the first character of `userString`.
