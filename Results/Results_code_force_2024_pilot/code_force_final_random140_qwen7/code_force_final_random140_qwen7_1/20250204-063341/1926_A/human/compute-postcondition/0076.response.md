Postcondition: `a` is a non-empty string, one character shorter than before, `l` is the total count of characters in `a` that are 'A' (either incremented by 1 or unchanged), and `h` is the total count of characters in `a` that are not 'A', either incremented by 1 or unchanged. If the character `j` is 'A', `l` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `h` is incremented by 1.
