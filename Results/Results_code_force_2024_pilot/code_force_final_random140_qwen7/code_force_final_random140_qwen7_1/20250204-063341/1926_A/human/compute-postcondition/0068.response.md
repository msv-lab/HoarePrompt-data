Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `a`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each character `j` in the string `a`.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `a` remains the same because it is the string being iterated over.
   - `j` will be the next character in the string `a`.
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `l` and `h` will either remain the same or change based on the value of `j` ('A' or not 'A').

Given the postconditions from the previous iteration:
- `a` is a non-empty string.
- `l` is the total count of characters in `a` that are 'A'.
- `h` is the total count of characters in `a` that are not 'A'.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `t` remains the same.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `a` remains the same.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `j` will be the next character in `a`.
- `l` and `h` will either remain the same or change based on the value of `j`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect these changes.

**State: **`a` is a non-empty string, `l` is the total count of characters in `a` that are 'A', `h` is the total count of characters in `a` that are not 'A', `i` is incremented by 1, and `t` is the same as before.**
