Output State: **`userString` is a string of length 5 consisting of the characters 'A' and 'B', the first character of `userString` is 'B', and `letter` is 'B', `countB` is 1**.

Explanation: The variable `countB` is incremented by 1. Since the initial state specifies that the first character of `userString` is 'B', `countB` starts at 1 (as counting the first 'B'). The other variables remain unchanged.
