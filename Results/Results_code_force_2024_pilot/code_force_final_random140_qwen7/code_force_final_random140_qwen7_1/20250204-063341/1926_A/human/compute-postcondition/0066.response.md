Postcondition: `a` is a non-empty string, `l` is the total count of characters in `a` that are 'A', possibly incremented by 1, `h` is the total count of characters in `a` that are not 'A', possibly incremented by 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `t` is the same as before, and `j` is a character in the string `a`. If `j` is 'A', `l` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `h` is incremented by 1.
