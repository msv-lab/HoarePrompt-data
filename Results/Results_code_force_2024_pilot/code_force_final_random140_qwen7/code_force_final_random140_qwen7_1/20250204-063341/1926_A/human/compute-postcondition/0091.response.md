Functionality: **The function processes `t` input strings, each of length 5 consisting of characters 'A' and 'B'. It counts the total occurrences of 'A' and 'B' across all input strings. After processing, it prints 'A' if the total count of 'A' characters is greater than the total count of 'B' characters; otherwise, it prints 'B'. The function does not return any value.**
