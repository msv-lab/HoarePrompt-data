Output State: **`userString` is a string of length 5 consisting of the characters 'A' and 'B', `letter` is the first character of `userString`, and `letter` is not 'B'. We continue the loop or iteration.**

The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only moves the control flow to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the values of `userString` and `letter` remain unchanged, and the condition that `letter` is not 'B' still holds.
