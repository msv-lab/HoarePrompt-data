The function `func_1` accepts a string `userString` of length 5 consisting of the characters 'A' and 'B'. It counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in the string. Based on the count, it prints 'A' if there are more 'A's, 'B' if there are more 'B's, and does nothing if the counts are equal. The function does not return anything; instead, it prints the result directly.
