You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length n , a positive integer m , and a string of
commands of length n . Each command is either the character 'L' or the
character 'R'.

Process all n commands in the order they are written in the string s .
Processing a command is done as follows:

  * First, output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array a when divided by m . 
  * Then, if the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from the array a , if the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from the array a . 

Note that after each move, the length of the array a decreases by 1 , and
after processing all commands, it will be empty.

Write a program that will process all commands in the order they are written
in the string s (from left to right).

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases in the input. Then descriptions of t test cases follow.

Each test case of the input is given by three lines.

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5, 1 \le m
\le 10^4 ) — the initial length of the array a and the value to take the
remainder by.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^4 )
— the elements of the array a .

The third line contains a string s consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases in a test
does not exceed 2\cdot10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n , where b_i is the
remainder when dividing the product of all elements of the current state of
the array a by m at the beginning of the execution of the i -th command.

Note

In the first test case of the example:

  * 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 24 \bmod 6 = 0 ;
  * s_1 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get the array [1, 4, 2] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 8 \bmod 6 = 2 ;
  * s_2 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1, 4] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \bmod 6 = 4 \bmod 6 = 4 ;
  * s_3 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1] ;
  * 1 \bmod 6 = 1 ;
  * s_4 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get an empty array.

    #State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows: `s` is the initial string, `l` is either -1 or 0, `r` is the length of `s` minus 1, `p` is the final product of the sequence of multiplications defined by the characters in `s` read from right to left, modulo `m`, and `ans` is a list containing all the intermediate values of `p` after each iteration of the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, followed by the array `arr` and the string `s`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The program initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to represent the left and right bounds of the array.
   - It also initializes a variable `p` to store the product of the array elements modulo `m`.

3. **Processing Commands:**
   - The program iterates through the string `s` in reverse order.
   - For each command:
     - If the command is 'R', it increments the right pointer `r` and updates the product `p` by multiplying it with the current rightmost element of the array and taking modulo `m`.
     - If the command is 'L', it decrements the left pointer `l` and updates the product `p` by multiplying it with the current leftmost element of the array and taking modulo `m`.
   - After updating the product, it appends the result to the answer list `ans`.

4. **Reversing the Answer List:**
   - Finally, the program prints the results in the correct order by reversing the answer list `ans`.

### Issues in the Program:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Array Elements:**
   - The program uses `l` and `r` to track the bounds of the array but does not actually modify the array itself. Instead, it directly accesses the elements using these bounds.
   - This approach is flawed because the bounds `l` and `r` do not reflect the actual size of the array as elements are removed during processing.

2. **Incorrect Order of Operations:**
   - The program processes the commands in reverse order (`s[::-1]`), which means it should append the results in the correct order. However, the logic inside the loop is still based on the original order of commands, leading to incorrect results.

### Corrected Approach:

To correctly implement the problem, the program should:
1. Process the commands in the correct order.
2. Update the product `p` and the bounds `l` and `r` accordingly.
3. Append the results in the correct order.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        s = input()
        p = 1
        ans = []
        for k in s:
            if k == 'L':
                if l > 0:
                    p = (p * arr[l]) % m
                    l -= 1
            else:
                if r < n - 1:
                    p = (p * arr[r + 1]) % m
                    r += 1
            ans.append(p)
        print(*ans)
```

### Conclusion:

The given program has logical errors and does not correctly implement the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
