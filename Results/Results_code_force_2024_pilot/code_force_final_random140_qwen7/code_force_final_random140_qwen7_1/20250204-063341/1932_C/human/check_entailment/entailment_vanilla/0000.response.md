Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, followed by the array `arr` and the string `s`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The program initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to represent the left and right bounds of the array.
   - It also initializes a variable `p` to store the product of the array elements modulo `m`.

3. **Processing Commands:**
   - The program iterates through the string `s` in reverse order.
   - For each command:
     - If the command is 'R', it increments the right pointer `r` and updates the product `p` by multiplying it with the current rightmost element of the array and taking modulo `m`.
     - If the command is 'L', it decrements the left pointer `l` and updates the product `p` by multiplying it with the current leftmost element of the array and taking modulo `m`.
   - After updating the product, it appends the result to the answer list `ans`.

4. **Reversing the Answer List:**
   - Finally, the program prints the results in the correct order by reversing the answer list `ans`.

### Issues in the Program:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Array Elements:**
   - The program uses `l` and `r` to track the bounds of the array but does not actually modify the array itself. Instead, it directly accesses the elements using these bounds.
   - This approach is flawed because the bounds `l` and `r` do not reflect the actual size of the array as elements are removed during processing.

2. **Incorrect Order of Operations:**
   - The program processes the commands in reverse order (`s[::-1]`), which means it should append the results in the correct order. However, the logic inside the loop is still based on the original order of commands, leading to incorrect results.

### Corrected Approach:

To correctly implement the problem, the program should:
1. Process the commands in the correct order.
2. Update the product `p` and the bounds `l` and `r` accordingly.
3. Append the results in the correct order.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        s = input()
        p = 1
        ans = []
        for k in s:
            if k == 'L':
                if l > 0:
                    p = (p * arr[l]) % m
                    l -= 1
            else:
                if r < n - 1:
                    p = (p * arr[r + 1]) % m
                    r += 1
            ans.append(p)
        print(*ans)
```

### Conclusion:

The given program has logical errors and does not correctly implement the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
