Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `p` is updated to the value of `p * arr[l] % m`, `ans` contains the updated value of `p`, `r` is increased by 1, `l` is decreased by 1**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `p` to `p * arr[l] % m`. Since `arr[l]` and `m` are not specified, `p` is updated accordingly. The values of `s`, `ans`, `r`, and `l` are also mentioned to show their changes or the actions taken on them.
