Output State: **`s` is an input string, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `p` is the product of `arr[l+1:r+1]` modulo `m`, `ans` is a list containing the products of `arr[l+1:r+1]` modulo `m` for each iteration, `strr` is the last character of the reversed string `s[::-1]` (not equal to 'R'), `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers formed by mapping `int` over the input split by spaces.**

The code `r = n - 1` updates the value of `r` to `n - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
