Based on the initial state provided:

- `s` is the initial string.
- `l` is either -1 or 0, depending on whether there were any 'L' characters in `s` from right to left.
- `r` is the length of `s` minus one.
- `p` is the product of `arr[l+1:r+1]` modulo `m`.
- `ans` is a list containing the products of `arr[l+1:r+1]` modulo `m` for each iteration.
- `strr` is the last character of the reversed string `s[::-1]`, which is not equal to 'R'.

The `print(*ans[::-1])` statement will print the elements of the list `ans` in reverse order.

To determine the exact values printed, let's break down the components:

1. **`l`**: This is either -1 or 0, depending on the presence of 'L' characters in `s` from right to left.
2. **`r`**: This is the length of `s` minus one.
3. **`arr`**: This is an array whose elements are not explicitly defined, but the product `p` is computed for the range `[l+1, r+1]` modulo `m`.
4. **`ans`**: This list contains the products of `arr[l+1:r+1]` modulo `m` for each iteration of the loop.
5. **`strr`**: This is the last character of the reversed string `s[::-1]`, which is not equal to 'R'.

Since the exact values of `arr`, `m`, and the string `s` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical values of the elements in `ans`. However, we know that `ans` contains the products of `arr[l+1:r+1]` modulo `m` for each iteration.

Therefore, the output will be the elements of `ans` in reverse order.

Output: **[product1, product2, ..., productN]** (where each `productX` is the product of `arr[l+1:r+1]` modulo `m` for each iteration, and the list is reversed).
