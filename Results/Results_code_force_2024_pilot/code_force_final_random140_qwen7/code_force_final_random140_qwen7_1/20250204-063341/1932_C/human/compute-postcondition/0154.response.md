Output State: **`ans` contains the updated value of `p`, `p` is updated based on the value of `strr` ('y'), `l` is decremented by 1, and `strr` remains 'y'. Specifically, `p` is `arr[1] % m`, and `ans` is a list containing this updated value of `p`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans.append(p)` appends the current value of `p` to the list `ans`. Given that `strr` is 'y', the condition `if strr is 'R'` does not apply, so `p` is updated to `arr[1] % m`. Additionally, `l` is decremented by 1, and `strr` remains 'y'. Therefore, `ans` now contains the updated value of `p`, which is `arr[1] % m`.
