Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `arr` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `s` is an empty string, `l` is equal to the length of the original string `s`, and `r` is `n - 1` if the last character in `s` was 'L', otherwise `r` is `n - \(\text{length of } s\)`; `p` is 1; `ans` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for strr in s[::-1]:
    if strr == 'R':
        r += 1
        p = p * arr[r] % m
    else:
        l -= 1
        p = p * arr[l] % m
    ans.append(p)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `s` is a non-empty string, `p` is updated based on the value of `strr`, `ans` now contains the updated value of `p`, `r` is increased by 1 if `strr` is 'R', otherwise `l` is decreased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `s` is a non-empty string, `p` is updated to either `p * arr[r] % m` or `p * arr[l] % m`, `ans` now contains the updated value of `p`, `r` is increased by 1, and `l` is adjusted by either remaining unchanged or being decreased by 1 based on the condition `strr == 'R'`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s` is a non-empty string, `p` is updated to either `p * arr[r] % m` or `p * arr[l] % m`, `ans` is a list containing the updated value of `p`, `r` is either `r + 1` or `len(s) - 2`, and `l` is either `l - 1` or adjusted based on the condition `strr == 'R'`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
