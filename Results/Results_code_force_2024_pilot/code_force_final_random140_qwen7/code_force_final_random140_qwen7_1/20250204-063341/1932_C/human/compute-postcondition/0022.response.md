Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `arr` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `s` is an empty string, `l` is equal to the length of the original string `s`, and `r` is `n - 1` if the last character in `s` was 'L', otherwise `r` is `n - \(\text{length of } s\)`**.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as there are characters in the string `s`. Each iteration of the loop either increments `l` if the character is 'L' or decrements `r` if the character is 'R'. After all iterations, `s` will be an empty string because all characters have been processed. The value of `l` will be equal to the length of the original string `s` since it is incremented for each 'L' and never decremented. The value of `r` will be adjusted based on the last character in `s`: if the last character is 'L', then `r` remains `n - 1`; otherwise, `r` is reduced by the length of `s`.
