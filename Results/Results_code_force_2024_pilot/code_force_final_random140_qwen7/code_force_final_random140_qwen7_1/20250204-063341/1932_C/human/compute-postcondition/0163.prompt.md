Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `k` is the last character of the string `s`, `l` is either `0` or `1` plus the number of 'L' commands executed, `r` is `n-1` minus the number of 'R' commands executed, `p` is `1`, `ans` is an empty list, `strr` is the last character of the reversed string `s[::-1]` (not equal to 'R'), the variables `n` and `m` remain unchanged, and `arr` is a list of integers formed by mapping `int` over the input split by spaces.
Code of the loop:
for strr in s[::-1]:
    if strr == 'R':
        r += 1
        p = p * arr[r] % m
    else:
        l -= 1
        p = p * arr[l] % m
    ans.append(p)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `p` is updated based on the value of `strr`; `ans` contains the updated value of `p`; `l` is decremented by 1; `strr` is the last character of the reversed string `s[::-1]`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ans` contains the updated value of `p`, `p` is updated based on the value of `strr` ('y'), `l` is decremented by 1, and `strr` remains 'y'. Specifically, `p` is `arr[1] % m`, and `ans` is a list containing this updated value of `p`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ans` contains the updated value of `p` based on the next character from `s`, `p` is `arr[1] * arr[r] % m` if `strr` is 'R', otherwise `p` is `p * arr[l] % m`. `l` is decremented by 1 in both cases, and `strr` remains 'y'. `ans` is appended with the new value of `p`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
