Output State: **`s` is the initial string, `l` is either 0 or -1, `r` is 3, `p` is `arr[2] * arr[3] % m`, `ans` is a list containing 0 and `arr[2]` or 0, `strr` is `next_strr` (not equal to 'R')**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `p` to be `p * arr[r] % m`. Given that `r` is 3, `p` is updated to `arr[2] * arr[3] % m`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
