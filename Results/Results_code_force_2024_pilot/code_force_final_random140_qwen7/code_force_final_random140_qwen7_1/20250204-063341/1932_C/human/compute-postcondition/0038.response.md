Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `p` will be updated based on the next value of `strr` (let's call it `next_strr`), `ans` will contain the updated value of `p`, `r` is increased by 1, `l` is decreased by 1**.

Explanation: The code `l -= 1` decreases the value of `l` by 1. The other variables (`s`, `p`, `ans`, and `r`) are not affected by this operation, so their states remain as described in the initial state.
