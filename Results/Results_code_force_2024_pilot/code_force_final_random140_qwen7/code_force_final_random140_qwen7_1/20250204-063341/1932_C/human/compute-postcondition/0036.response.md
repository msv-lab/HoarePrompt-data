Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `p` will be updated based on the next value of `strr` (let's call it `next_strr`), `ans` will contain the updated value of `p`, `r` is increased by 1, `l` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `r += 1` increments the value of `r` by 1. Since `s`, `p`, `ans`, and `l` are not affected by this operation, their states remain as described in the initial state.
