Postcondition: `p` is an integer, `strr` is the last character of the reversed string `s[::-1]`. If `strr` is 'R', then `p` is updated to `p * arr[1] % m` and `strr` remains 'R'. Otherwise, `p` is updated to `p * arr[l] % m`, `l` is decremented by 1, and `strr` is the last character of the reversed string `s[::-1]` and is not equal to 'R'.
