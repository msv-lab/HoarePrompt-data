Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `p` is updated to `p * arr[r] % m`, `ans` is equal to the updated value of `p`, `r` is `r + 1`, and `l` is adjusted based on the condition `strr == 'R'`**.

This means that the value of `p` has been updated to `p * arr[r] % m`, and `ans` now holds this updated value. The variable `r` has been incremented by 1. The adjustment of `l` depends on whether `strr` is equal to 'R', which remains unchanged from its previous state.
