Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `p` is updated to either `p * arr[r] % m` or `p * arr[l] % m`, `ans` now contains the updated value of `p`, `r` is `r + 1`, and `l` is adjusted based on the condition `strr == 'R'`**.

Explanation: The variable `r` is incremented by 1, so `r` is now `r + 1`. The values of `s`, `p`, `ans`, and `l` remain unchanged from their previous states.
