Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `arr` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `s` is a non-empty string, `l` is 2 if the next character in `s` is 'L', otherwise `l` is 1, and `r` is `n - 1` if the next character in `s` is 'L', otherwise `r` is `n - 2`.**
