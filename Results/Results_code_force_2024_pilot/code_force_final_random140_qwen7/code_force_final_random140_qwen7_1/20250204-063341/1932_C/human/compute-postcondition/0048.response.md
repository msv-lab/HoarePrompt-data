Postcondition: `s` is a non-empty string, `p` is updated to either `p * arr[r] % m` or `p * arr[l] % m`, `ans` now contains the updated value of `p`, `r` is adjusted to `r + 1` if `strr == 'R'`, otherwise `r` remains `len(s) - 2`, and `l` is adjusted to `l - 1` if the condition does not match `strr == 'R'`, otherwise `l` remains as adjusted in the if part.
