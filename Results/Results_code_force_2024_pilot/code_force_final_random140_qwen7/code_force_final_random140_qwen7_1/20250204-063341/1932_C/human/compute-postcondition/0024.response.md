Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `arr` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `s` is an empty string, `l` is equal to the length of the original string `s`, and `r` is `n - 1` if the last character in `s` was 'L', otherwise `r` is `n - \(\text{length of } s\)`; `p` is 1; `ans` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `ans`. No changes are made to the values of the other variables. Therefore, their states remain as they were in the initial state.
