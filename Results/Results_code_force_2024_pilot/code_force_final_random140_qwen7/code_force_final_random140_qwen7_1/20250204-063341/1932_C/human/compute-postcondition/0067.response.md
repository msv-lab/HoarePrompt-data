Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `s` is a non-empty string.
   - `k` is the first character of `s`.
   - If `k` is 'L', then `l` is 1.
   - If `k` is not 'L', then `r` is decreased by 1.

2. **Loop Head**:
   - The loop iterates over each character in the string `s` using the variable `k`.

3. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over each character in `s`, the variable `k` will change with each iteration.
   - The variable `s` remains the same as it is the input string.
   - We need to determine the new value of `k` for the next iteration.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the next iteration, `k` will be the next character in the string `s`.
   - If `k` was 'L' in the previous iteration, then `l` is 1.
   - If `k` was not 'L' in the previous iteration, then `r` is decreased by 1.

5. **New State**:
   - `s` remains the same.
   - `k` changes to the next character in `s`.
   - If the next character is 'L', then `l` will be 1.
   - If the next character is not 'L', then `r` will be decreased by 1.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `s` remains the same (non-empty string).
- `k` becomes the next character in `s`.
- If the next character is 'L', then `l` is 1.
- If the next character is not 'L', then `r` is decreased by 1.

Therefore, the updated state is:

**State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `k` is the next character in `s`, if `k` is 'L', then `l` is 1, if `k` is not 'L', then `r` is decreased by 1**.
