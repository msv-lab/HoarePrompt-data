Output State: **`ans` contains the updated value of `p` based on the next character from `s`, `p` is `arr[1] * arr[r] % m` if `strr` is 'R', otherwise `p` is `p * arr[l] % m`. `l` is decremented by 1 in both cases, and `strr` remains 'y'. `ans` is appended with the new value of `p`.**

This means that the value of `p` has been updated based on the next character from `s`, and this new value of `p` has been appended to the list `ans`. The variable `l` has been decremented by 1, and `strr` remains unchanged as 'y'.
