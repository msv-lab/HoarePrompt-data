Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `s` is an input string, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `p` is the product of `arr[l+1:r+1]` modulo `m`, `ans` is a list containing the products of `arr[l+1:r+1]` modulo `m` for each iteration, `strr` is the last character of the reversed string `s[::-1]` (not equal to 'R'), `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers formed by mapping `int` over the input split by spaces.
Code of the loop:
for k in s:
    if k == 'L':
        l += 1
    else:
        r -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `k` is the first character of the string `s`, `s` is an input string, `l` is either 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `p` is the product of `arr[l+1:r+1]` modulo `m`, `ans` is a list containing the products of `arr[l+1:r+1]` modulo `m` for each iteration, `strr` is the last character of the reversed string `s[::-1]` (not equal to 'R'), `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers formed by mapping `int` over the input split by spaces.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `k` is the second character of the string `s`, `s` is an input string, `l` is either `l + 1` or remains as `l` (either 0 or 1), `r` is either `n - 1` or `n - 2` (depending on the if condition), `p` is the product of `arr[l+1:r+1]` modulo `m`, `ans` is a list containing the products of `arr[l+1:r+1]` modulo `m` for each iteration, `strr` is the last character of the reversed string `s[::-1]` (not equal to 'R'), `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers formed by mapping `int` over the input split by spaces, and `r` is decreased by 1 if the else part is executed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `k` is the third character of the string `s`, `s` is an input string, `l` is either `l + 1` or remains as `l` (either 0 or 1), `r` is either `n - 1` or `n - 2` depending on the if condition, `p` is the product of `arr[l+1:r+1]` modulo `m`, `ans` is a list containing the products of `arr[l+1:r+1]` modulo `m` for each iteration, `strr` is the last character of the reversed string `s[::-1]` (not equal to 'R'), `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers formed by mapping `int` over the input split by spaces, and `r` is decreased by 1 if the else part is executed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
