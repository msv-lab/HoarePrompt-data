Postcondition: `p` is updated based on the character in `strr`. If `strr` is 'R', `r` is incremented by 2, `p` is updated to `arr[1] * arr[r] % m`, and `l` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `l` is decremented by 1, `p` is updated to `p * arr[l] % m`, and `ans` contains the updated value of `p` based on the next character from `s`.
