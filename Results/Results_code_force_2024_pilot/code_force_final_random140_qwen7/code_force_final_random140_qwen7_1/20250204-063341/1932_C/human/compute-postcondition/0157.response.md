Output State: **`r` is incremented by 2, `p` is `arr[1] * arr[r] % m`, `l` is decremented by 1, and `strr` remains 'y'**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `p` to be `p * arr[r] % m`. Given the initial state, `r` was incremented by 1, so now `r` is incremented by 2. The value of `p` is updated to `arr[1] * arr[r] % m`. The other variables (`l` and `strr`) remain unchanged.
