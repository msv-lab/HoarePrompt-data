Output State: **`r` is 1, `p` is `arr[1] % m`, `ans` is `arr[1] % m`, `l` is decremented by 1, `strr` is 'y'**.

Explanation: The code updates `p` by multiplying its current value with `arr[r]` modulo `m`. Given that `r` is initially 1, `p` is updated to `p * arr[1] % m`. Since `ans` is updated to contain the new value of `p`, `ans` also becomes `arr[1] % m`. The variable `l` is decremented by 1, and `strr` remains 'y'.
