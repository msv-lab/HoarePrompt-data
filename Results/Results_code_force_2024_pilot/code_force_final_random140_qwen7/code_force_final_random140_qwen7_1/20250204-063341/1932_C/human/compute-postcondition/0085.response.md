Output State: **`s` is the initial string, `l` is -1, `r` is 0, `p` is -1, `ans` is an empty list, and the string `strr` is not equal to 'R'**.

Explanation: The variable `p` is updated to `p * arr[l] % m`. Given that `l` is -1, `arr[-1]` would refer to the element at index -1 of the array `arr`, which is undefined in Python. However, since no specific `arr` is provided, we assume that the operation `p * arr[l] % m` results in `p` being set to -1 (assuming `arr[-1]` evaluates to -1 for the sake of this example). All other variables remain unchanged.
