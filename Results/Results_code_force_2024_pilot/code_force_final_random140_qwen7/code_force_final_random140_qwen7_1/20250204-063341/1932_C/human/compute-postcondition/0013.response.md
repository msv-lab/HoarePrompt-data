Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `arr` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `s` is a non-empty string. If the current value of `k` is 'L', then `l` is increased by 1, making `l` equal to 1 and `r` remains `n - 1`. If the current value of `k` is not 'L', then `l` remains 0 and `r` becomes `n - 2`.
