Output State: **`l` is 0, `n` is an integer input decremented by 3, `m` is an integer input, `s` is a non-empty string, `p` is the final product of the sequence of multiplications defined by the characters in `s` read from right to left, modulo `m`, `arr` is updated to a list of integers obtained from space-separated inputs, `r` is an index within the list `arr`, `ans` is a list containing all intermediate values of `p` after each iteration of the loop, and the input is decremented by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `l` is assigned the value 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Specifically, `n` is now decremented by 3 instead of 2, and the input used to decrement `n` and `ans` is decremented by 1.
