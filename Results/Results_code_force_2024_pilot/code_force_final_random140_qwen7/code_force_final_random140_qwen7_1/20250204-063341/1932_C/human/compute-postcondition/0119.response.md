Postcondition: `k` is the first character of the string `s`, `s` is an input string, `l` is either 1 or 0, `r` is either `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `p` is the product of `arr[l+1:r+1]` modulo `m`, `ans` is a list containing the products of `arr[l+1:r+1]` modulo `m` for each iteration, `strr` is the last character of the reversed string `s[::-1]` (not equal to 'R'), `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers formed by mapping `int` over the input split by spaces.
