Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4; a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4; s is a string of length n consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for k in s:
        if k == 'L':
            l += 1
        else:
            r -= 1
    p = 1
    ans = []
    for strr in s[::-1]:
        if strr == 'R':
            r += 1
            p = p * arr[r] % m
        else:
            l -= 1
            p = p * arr[l] % m
        ans.append(p)
    print(*ans[::-1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows: `s` is a non-empty string, `p` is the final product of the sequence of multiplications defined by the characters in `s` read from right to left, modulo `m`. Specifically, for each character `strr` in `s` from right to left, if `strr` is 'R', then `r` is increased by 1 and `p` is updated to `p * arr[r] % m`; otherwise, `l` is decreased by 1 and `p` is updated to `p * arr[l] % m`. The list `ans` contains all the intermediate values of `p` after each iteration of the loop, with the final value of `p` being the last element in `ans`.

In simpler terms, `p` is the result of multiplying together elements from the list `arr` based on the direction indicated by the characters in `s` (right for 'R', left for 'L'), and taking the result modulo `m` at each step. The list `ans` contains all these intermediate results.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `s` is the initial string, `l` is either -1 or 0, `r` is the length of `s` minus 1, `p` is the product of `arr[l+1:r+1]` modulo `m`, `ans` is a list containing the products of `arr[l+1:r+1]` modulo `m` for each iteration, and `strr` is the last character of the reversed string `s[::-1]` (not equal to 'R').

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `s` remains unchanged. The variable `l` will be -1 or 0 depending on whether there were any 'L' characters in `s` from right to left. The variable `r` will be the length of the string `s` minus one, as it increments for every 'L' character from right to left. The variable `p` will be the product of the elements in the list `arr` from index `l+1` to `r+1` taken modulo `m`. The list `ans` will contain all these products for each iteration of the loop. The variable `strr` will be the last character of the reversed string `s[::-1]`, which is not equal to 'R'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: All variables remain unchanged except `ans`, which contains the product of all `arr` values based on the loop conditions.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
