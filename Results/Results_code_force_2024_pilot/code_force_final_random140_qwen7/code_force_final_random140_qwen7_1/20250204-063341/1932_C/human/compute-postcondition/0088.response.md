Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `strr` and `s`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each character in the reversed string `s[::-1]`. This means that `strr` takes on the value of each character in `s` from the end to the beginning.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `s` is the initial string.
   - `l` is 0.
   - `r` is 1.
   - `p` is 0.
   - `ans` is a list containing 0.
   - `strr` is not equal to 'R'.

4. **Determine the next value of `strr`**: Since `strr` is iterating through the reversed string `s[::-1]`, the next value of `strr` would be the next character from the end of the string `s`.

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `s` remains the same as it is not being modified within the loop.
   - `l`, `r`, `p`, and `ans` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.
   - `strr` will now be the next character from the end of the string `s`.

Given that `strr` is not equal to 'R' at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `strr` will still not be 'R' unless it changes inside the loop body, but since no such change is mentioned, we assume it remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `s` is the initial string, `l` is 0, `r` is 1, `p` is 0, `ans` is a list containing 0, and `strr` is the next character from the end of the string `s` (not equal to 'R')**.
