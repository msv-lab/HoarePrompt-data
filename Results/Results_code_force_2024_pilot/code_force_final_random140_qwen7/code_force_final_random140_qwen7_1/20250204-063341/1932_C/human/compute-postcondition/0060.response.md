Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for k in s`. The variables involved here are `k` and `s`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `k` is the character being iterated over in the string `s`.
   - `s` is a non-empty string.

3. **Understand the loop behavior**:
   - The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`.
   - `k` takes on the value of each character in `s` during each iteration.
   - The loop modifies `p` based on the current character `k`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `s` is a non-empty string, it must contain at least one character for the loop to execute.
   - `k` will start as the first character of `s` in the first iteration.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `s` (to ensure it is a non-empty string) and `k` (to be the first character of `s`).

**State:**
- `s` is a non-empty string.
- `k` is the first character of `s`.

So, the final answer is:
**State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `k` is the first character of `s`**.
