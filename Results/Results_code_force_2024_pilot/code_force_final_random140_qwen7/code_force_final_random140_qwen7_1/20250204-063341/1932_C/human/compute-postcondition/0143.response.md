Output State: **`p` is updated to the value of `p * arr[l] % m`, `l` is decremented by 1, `strr` is the last character of the reversed string `s[::-1]` and `strr` is not equal to 'R'.**

This means that `p` has been updated to its value multiplied by `arr[l]` modulo `m`, `l` has been decremented by 1, and `strr` remains the last character of the reversed string `s[::-1]` and is not equal to 'R'.
