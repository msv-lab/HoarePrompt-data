Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for strr in s[::-1]:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `strr` and `s`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ans` contains the updated value of `p`.
   - `p` is updated based on the value of `strr` ('y').
   - `l` is decremented by 1.
   - `strr` remains 'y'.
   - `p` is `arr[1] % m`.
   - `ans` is a list containing this updated value of `p`.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**:
   - The loop iterates over `s[::-1]`, which means it iterates over the reversed string `s`.
   - The loop continues as long as there are characters left to iterate over in `s`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `strr` remains 'y' and the loop continues as long as there are characters left in `s`, the next character from the reversed string `s` will be processed.
   - Therefore, `strr` will be the next character from `s` (which is still 'y' if `s` has more characters).

5. **Update the states**:
   - `ans` will contain the updated value of `p` based on the next character from `s`.
   - `p` will be updated to `arr[1] % m` based on the next character from `s`.
   - `l` will be decremented by 1.

Given that `strr` is 'y' and `s` is reversed, the next character from `s` will be processed in the next iteration. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`ans` contains the updated value of `p` based on the next character from `s`, `p` is `arr[1] % m`, `l` is decremented by 1, and `strr` remains 'y'**.
