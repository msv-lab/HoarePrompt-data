Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `k` is the next character in `s`, `l` is 1 more than its original value, `r` is decreased by 1 if `k` was not 'L'**.

Explanation: The variable `l` is incremented by 1. The value of `k` determines whether `r` is decreased by 1. Since `k` is the next character in `s`, and if `k` is not 'L', then `r` is decreased by 1. The original state of `s` and `k` remains unchanged, but `l` is now 1 more than its original value.
