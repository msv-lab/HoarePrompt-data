Output State: **`s` is an input string, `l` is 0, `r` is the length of `s` minus 1, `p` is the product of `arr[l+1:r+1]` modulo `m`, `ans` is a list containing the products of `arr[l+1:r+1]` modulo `m` for each iteration, `strr` is the last character of the reversed string `s[::-1]` (not equal to 'R'), `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers formed by mapping `int` over the input split by spaces, `s` is updated to the new input string.**

Explanation: The line `l = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `l`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
