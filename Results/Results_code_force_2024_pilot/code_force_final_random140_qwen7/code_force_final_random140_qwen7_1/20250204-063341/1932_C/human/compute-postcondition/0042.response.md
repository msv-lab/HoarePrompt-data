Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `p` is updated to either `p * arr[r] % m` or `p * arr[l] % m`, `ans` now contains the updated value of `p`, `r` is increased by 1, and `l` is adjusted by either remaining unchanged or being decreased by 1 based on the condition `strr == 'R'`**.

Explanation: The code `ans.append(p)` appends the current value of `p` to the list `ans`. This does not change the values of `s`, `p`, `r`, or `l`, but it adds the updated value of `p` to `ans`. The conditions for updating `p` and adjusting `l` remain the same as before the code execution.
