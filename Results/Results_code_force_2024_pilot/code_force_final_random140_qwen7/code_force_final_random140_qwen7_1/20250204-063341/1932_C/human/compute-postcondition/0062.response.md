Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `k` is 'L', `l` is 1**

Explanation: Initially, `k` is the first character of `s` and its value is 'L'. The code `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. Since no specific initial value for `l` was given, we assume it starts at 0 (as it is common for such variables). After incrementing, `l` becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
