Output State: **`s` is the initial string, `l` is 0, `r` is 1, `p` is 0, `ans` is an empty list, the current value of `strr` is 'R'**.

Explanation: The initial value of `p` is 1. The code updates `p` to `p * arr[r] % m`. Since the value of `arr[r]` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `p` after the operation. However, given that `r` is 1, if `arr[1]` is 0 (which is a common scenario in such problems without additional context), then `p` would become `1 * 0 % m = 0`. All other variables remain unchanged.
