Output State: **`k` is the last character of the string `s`, `l` is either `0` or `1` plus the number of 'L' commands executed, `r` is `n-1` minus the number of 'R' commands executed, `p` is `1`, `ans` is an empty list, `strr` is the last character of the reversed string `s[::-1]` (not equal to 'R'), the variables `n` and `m` remain unchanged, and `arr` is a list of integers formed by mapping `int` over the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The line `ans = []` initializes an empty list named `ans`. This operation does not affect the values of any other variables. Therefore, the values of `k`, `l`, `r`, `p`, `strr`, `n`, `m`, and `arr` remain unchanged from their initial states.
