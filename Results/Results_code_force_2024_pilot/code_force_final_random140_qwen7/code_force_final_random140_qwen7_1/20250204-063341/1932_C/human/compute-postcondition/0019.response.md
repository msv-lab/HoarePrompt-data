Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `arr` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `s` is a non-empty string (with the first character removed), `l` is 3 if the next character in `s` is 'L', otherwise `l` is 2, and `r` is `n - 1` if the next character in `s` is 'L', otherwise `r` is `n - 2`.**

Explanation: The code `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. Since `l` was initially 2 if the next character in `s` is 'L', or 1 otherwise, after the increment, `l` becomes 3 if the next character in `s` is 'L', and 2 otherwise. All other variables remain unchanged.
