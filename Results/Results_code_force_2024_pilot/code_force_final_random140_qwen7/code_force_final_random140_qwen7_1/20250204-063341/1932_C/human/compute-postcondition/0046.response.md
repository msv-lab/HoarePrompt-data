Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `p` is updated to either `p * arr[r] % m` or `p * arr[l] % m`, `ans` now contains the updated value of `p`, `r` is `len(s) - 2`, `l` is `l - 1`, `strr` is unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `l -= 1` decrements the value of `l` by 1. All other variables remain in their previous states.
