Output State: **`s` is the initial string, `l` is either -1 or 0, `r` is either 1, 2, or 3, `p` is either `arr[2] * arr[-1] % m`, `arr[2] * arr[3] % m`, or 0, `ans` is a list containing 0, `arr[2]`, and `p`, `strr` is `next_strr` (not equal to 'R').**

Explanation: The code `ans.append(p)` appends the value of `p` to the list `ans`. Since `p` can be either `arr[2] * arr[-1] % m`, `arr[2] * arr[3] % m`, or 0, the updated list `ans` will contain 0 and `arr[2]` along with the new value of `p`. All other variables remain unchanged.
