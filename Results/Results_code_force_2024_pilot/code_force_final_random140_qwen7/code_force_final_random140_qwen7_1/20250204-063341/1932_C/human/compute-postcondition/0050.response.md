Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `p` is updated to either `p * arr[r] % m` or `p * arr[l] % m`, `ans` is a list containing the updated value of `p`, `r` is either `r + 1` or `len(s) - 2`, and `l` is either `l - 1` or adjusted based on the condition `strr == 'R'`**.

Explanation: The line `ans.append(p)` appends the current value of `p` to the list `ans`. This does not change the values of `s`, `p`, `r`, `l`, or `strr`. It only adds the current value of `p` to `ans`. Therefore, the updated value of `ans` is a list containing the updated value of `p`.
