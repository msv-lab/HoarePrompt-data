Output State: **`s` is not an empty string, `strr` is 'R', `r` is increased by 1, `p` is updated to the value of `p * arr[r] % m`**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `p` to the value of `p * arr[r] % m`. However, the initial values of `p`, `arr`, `r`, and `m` are not provided. We know that `r` is increased by 1, but without knowing the exact value of `r` before the increment, we cannot determine the exact new value of `p`. Therefore, we keep the updated state of `r` and the updated formula for `p`. The other variables (`s` and `strr`) remain unchanged.
