Output State: **`k` is the second character of the string `s`, `s` is an input string, `l` is either 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 2` or `n - 3`, `p` is the product of `arr[l+1:r+1]` modulo `m`, `ans` is a list containing the products of `arr[l+1:r+1]` modulo `m` for each iteration, `strr` is the last character of the reversed string `s[::-1]` (not equal to 'R'), `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers formed by mapping `int` over the input split by spaces, `r` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `r -= 1` decreases the value of `r` by 1. Initially, `r` was either `n - 1` or `n - 2`. After executing the code, `r` becomes `n - 2` or `n - 3` depending on its initial value. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
