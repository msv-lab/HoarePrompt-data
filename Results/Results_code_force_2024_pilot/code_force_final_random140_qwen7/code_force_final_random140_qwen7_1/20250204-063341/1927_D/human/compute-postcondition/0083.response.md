Output State: **`j` is either `j` or `i` depending on whether `x` is not equal to `p`.**

Explanation: The code assigns `j` to either `j` or `i` based on the condition `x != p`. If `x` is not equal to `p`, then `j` remains `j`; otherwise, `j` becomes `i`. The initial values of `i`, `x`, `p`, and `j` are not specified, so we express the final state of `j` in terms of these conditions.
