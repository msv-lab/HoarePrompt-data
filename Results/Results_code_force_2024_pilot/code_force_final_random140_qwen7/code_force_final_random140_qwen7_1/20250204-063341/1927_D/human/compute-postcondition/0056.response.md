Output State: **`t` is 0, `a` is [0, 0, (j, i), 2], `p` is `new_x`, `i` is 2, `j` is 2**

Explanation: The code `a += j,` means that the value of `j` is added to the last element of the list `a`. Initially, `a` is `[0, 0, (j, i)]`. After adding `j` to the last element, the list `a` becomes `[0, 0, (j, i), 2]`. All other variables (`t`, `p`, `i`, `j`) remain unchanged.
