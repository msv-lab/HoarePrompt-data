Let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `q` is a positive integer - 1. Since `q` is a positive integer minus 1, it must be 0.
   - `l` is a value returned by `R()`. The function `R()` is not specified, so we'll denote its return value as `l`.
   - `r` is a value returned by `R()`. Similarly, the function `R()` is not specified, so we'll denote its return value as `r`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(*((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l])
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Execution:**
   - First, we need to understand the expression `((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l]`.
   - The expression `a[r] < l` checks if the value at index `r` in the list `a` is less than `l`.
   - If `a[r] < l` is `True`, then the expression evaluates to `([-1] * 2)`, which is a list with two `-1`s.
   - If `a[r] < l` is `False`, then the expression evaluates to `((a[r], r))`, which is a tuple containing the value at index `r` in `a` and the index `r`.

4. **Printing the Result:**
   - The `*` operator is used to unpack the resulting list or tuple.
   - If `a[r] < l` is `True`, the unpacked result will be `-1, -1`.
   - If `a[r] < l` is `False`, the unpacked result will be `a[r], r`.

Given that `a` is not explicitly defined, we cannot determine the exact values of `a[r]` and `r`. However, based on the structure of the problem, we can describe the output:

Output: **-1, -1** if the value at index `r` in `a` is less than `l`, otherwise it will be **a[r], r**.
