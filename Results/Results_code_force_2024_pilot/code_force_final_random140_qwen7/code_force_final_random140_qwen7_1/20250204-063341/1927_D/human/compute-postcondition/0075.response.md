Output State: `t` is 0, `a` is [0, 0, (j, i), 2, (j, i)[new_x != p], (j, i)[new_x != p]], `p` is new_x, `i` is 4, `q` is 0, `j` is (j, i)[new_x != p], `l` is the last value returned by R(), `r` is the last value returned by R().

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `q` is non-zero. After each iteration, `q` is decremented by 1. Therefore, if the loop executes 3 times, it will continue to execute until `q` reaches 0. At that point, the loop terminates. The values of `l` and `r` will be set to the values returned by the last call to `R()` within the loop. All other variables (`t`, `a`, `p`, `i`, `j`, `q`) remain unchanged from their initial or previous states since they are not modified within the loop.
