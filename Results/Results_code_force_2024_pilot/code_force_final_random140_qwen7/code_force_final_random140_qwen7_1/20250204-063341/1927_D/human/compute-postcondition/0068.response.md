Output State: **`t` is 0, `a` is [0, 0, (j, i), 2, (j, i)[new_x != p], (j, i)[new_x != p]], `p` is new_x, `i` is 4, `q` is q - 1, `j` is (j, i)[new_x != p], `l` is a value from R(), `r` is a value from R(), `l` is assigned a value from R(), `r` is assigned a value from R()**

Explanation: The code `l, r = R()` assigns two values from the function `R()` to the variables `l` and `r` respectively. Since the function `R()` returns values from a random distribution, we cannot specify the exact values of `l` and `r`, but we know they are assigned new values. All other variables remain unchanged.
