Functionality: **The function processes a series of queries on an array `a`. It first reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads additional parameters and constructs an array `a` based on certain rules. Then, it processes `q` queries, each defined by two integers `l` and `r`. For each query, it checks if the element at index `r` in array `a` is greater than or equal to `l`. If so, it prints the element at index `r` and the index `r`. Otherwise, it prints `-1` twice. After processing all queries, the function outputs the results of these queries.**
