Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for x in R()`. The key variables here are `x` and `R()`.

2. **Understand the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
   - `a` is increased by `j`.
   - `j` is either `j` or `i` depending on whether `x` is not equal to `p`.
   - `x` is now equal to `p`.
   - `p` is equal to `x`.
   - `i` is increased by 1.

3. **Determine the changes needed for the next iteration**:
   - Since `x` is now equal to `p` and `p` is equal to `x`, the value of `x` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.
   - The variable `i` is increased by 1, so for the next iteration, `i` will be incremented again.
   - The variable `R()` is the iterator for the loop, and it will provide the next value of `x` in the next iteration.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `a` is increased by `j`, and since `j` is either `j` or `i` depending on the condition, `a` will be updated accordingly.
   - `i` will be increased by 1.
   - `x` will be the next value provided by `R()`.
   - `p` will be equal to `x` as it was in the previous iteration.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `a` is increased by `j` (the exact value depends on the condition).
- `i` is increased by 1.
- `x` is the next value provided by `R()`.
- `p` is equal to `x`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`a` is increased by `j`, `i` is increased by 1, `x` is the next value provided by `R()`, `p` is equal to `x`**.
