Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head**: The loop head is `while q:`. This means the loop continues as long as `q` is non-zero.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer - 1
   - `a` is a list containing elements 0, `j`, and `j` (or `i` if `x` was not equal to `p` during the first iteration)
   - `p` is the last `x` value generated by `R()`
   - `i` is the total number of iterations completed
   - `j` is either `j` or `i` from the last iteration depending on the condition `x != p`
   - `q` is `q - 1`
   - `l` is the value of the left boundary generated by `R()`
   - `r` is the value of the right boundary generated by `R()`

3. **Determine what needs to be adjusted**:
   - The only variable in the loop head is `q`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `q` is non-zero for the loop to continue.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `q` is `q - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `q` must be greater than 0. 

Given this, the state that needs to be adjusted is `q` must be greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer - 1, `a` is a list containing elements 0, `j`, and `j` (or `i` if `x` was not equal to `p` during the first iteration), `p` is the last `x` value generated by `R()`, `i` is the total number of iterations completed, `j` is either `j` or `i` from the last iteration depending on the condition `x != p`, `q` must be greater than 0, `l` is the value of the left boundary generated by `R()`, `r` is the value of the right boundary generated by `R()`**
