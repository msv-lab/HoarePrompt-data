Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list containing the sum of `j` for each iteration, `j` is either `j` or `i` depending on whether `x` is not equal to `p`, `p` is the last value returned by `R()`, `i` is equal to the number of iterations, `q` is the first value returned by `R()`, `j` is the value of `i` from the last iteration, `l` is the last value returned by `R()` after the loop finishes, and `r` remains the last value returned by `R()`
Code of the loop:
while q:
    q -= 1
    l, r = R()
    print(*((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `q` is decreased by 1, `a` is a list containing the sum of `j` for each iteration, `j` is the value of `i` from the last iteration, `l` is the last value returned by `R()`, `r` is the last value returned by `R()`, `p` is the last value returned by `R()` before the assignment, and `i` is equal to the number of iterations.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `q` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1; `l` is a value returned by R(); `r` is a value returned by R().
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `q` is a positive integer - 1; `l` is a value returned by `R()`, `r` is a value returned by `R()`


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
