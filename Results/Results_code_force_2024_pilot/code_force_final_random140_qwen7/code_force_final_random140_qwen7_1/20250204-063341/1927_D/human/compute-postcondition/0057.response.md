Output State: **`t` is 0, `a` is [0, 0, (j, i), 2], `p` is `new_x`, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `p` is `x`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `x` to `p`. Since no specific value for `x` is given, `p` now holds the value of `x`. All other variables (`t`, `a`, `p`, `i`, `j`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
