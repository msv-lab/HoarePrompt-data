Output State: **`t` is 0, `a` is [0, 0, (j, i)], `p` is `new_x`, `i` is 2, `j` is 2**

Explanation: 
- The initial state has `t` as 0, `a` as `[0, 0, (j, i)[False]]` which simplifies to `[0, 0, (j, i)]`, `p` as `new_x`, `i` as 2, and `j` as `(j, i)[p != p]` which simplifies to `i` (since `p != p` is False).
- The code `j = (j, i)[x != p]` updates `j` to be `i` because `x` is `new_x` and `p` is also `new_x`, making `x != p` False. Therefore, `j` remains as `i`, which is 2.
- All other variables (`t`, `a`, `p`, `i`) remain unchanged.
