Output State: **`a` is increased by `j`, `j` is either `j` or `i` depending on whether `x` is not equal to `p`; `p` is now equal to `x`.**

Explanation: The code `p = x` assigns the current value of `x` to `p`. This does not affect the values of `a` or `j`. The condition for `j` being either `j` or `i` based on whether `x` is not equal to `p` remains unchanged because `p` is now equal to `x`.
