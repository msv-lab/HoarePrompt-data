Let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is 0.
   - `a` is `[0, 0, (j, i), 2, (j, i)[new_x != p], (j, i)[new_x != p]]`.
   - `p` is `new_x`.
   - `i` is 4.
   - `q` is `q - 1` (though `q` is not used in the code).
   - `j` is `(j, i)[new_x != p]`.
   - `l` is a value from `R()`.
   - `r` is a value from `R()`.

2. **Understanding `a`:**
   - The third element of `a` is `(j, i)`.
   - The fifth and sixth elements of `a` are both `(j, i)[new_x != p]`.

3. **Simplifying `a[r]`:**
   - Since `r` is a value from `R()`, it will be either 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.
   - The possible values of `a[r]` are:
     - If `r = 0`, `a[r] = 0`.
     - If `r = 1`, `a[r] = 0`.
     - If `r = 2`, `a[r] = (j, i)`.
     - If `r = 3`, `a[r] = 2`.
     - If `r = 4` or `r = 5`, `a[r] = (j, i)[new_x != p]`.

4. **Condition `a[r] < l`:**
   - `l` is a random value from `R()`.
   - If `a[r]` is 0, then `a[r] < l` will be true if `l > 0`.
   - If `a[r]` is 2, then `a[r] < l` will be true if `l > 2`.
   - If `a[r]` is `(j, i)`, then `a[r] < l` depends on the value of `(j, i)`.
   - If `a[r]` is `(j, i)[new_x != p]`, then `a[r] < l` depends on the value of `(j, i)[new_x != p]`.

5. **Expression `(*((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l])`:**
   - This expression will evaluate to two elements: `(a[r], r)` if `a[r] < l`, otherwise `[-1, -1]`.
   - Since `r` is a random value from `R()`, let's consider the possible outcomes:
     - If `a[r]` is 0 and `l > 0`, then the result will be `(0, r)`.
     - If `a[r]` is 2 and `l > 2`, then the result will be `(2, r)`.
     - If `a[r]` is `(j, i)` and `(j, i) < l`, then the result will be `((j, i), r)`.
     - If `a[r]` is `(j, i)[new_x != p]` and `(j, i)[new_x != p] < l`, then the result will be `((j, i)[new_x != p], r)`.
     - Otherwise, the result will be `[-1, -1]`.

Given the randomness of `l` and `r`, we cannot determine the exact values without knowing their specific values. However, we can describe the possible outputs:

- If `a[r]` is 0 and `l > 0`, the output will be `(0, r)`.
- If `a[r]` is 2 and `l > 2`, the output will be `(2, r)`.
- If `a[r]` is `(j, i)` and `(j, i) < l`, the output will be `((j, i), r)`.
- If `a[r]` is `(j, i)[new_x != p]` and `(j, i)[new_x != p] < l`, the output will be `((j, i)[new_x != p], r)`.
- Otherwise, the output will be `[-1, -1]`.

Since the exact values of `l` and `r` are not specified, we can only describe the possible outcomes.

Output: **(a[r], r) if a[r] < l, otherwise [-1, -1]**
