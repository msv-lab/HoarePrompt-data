Output State: **`q` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1; `l` is a value returned by R(); `r` is a value returned by R().**

Explanation: The variable `q` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1. The code `l, r = R()` calls the function `R()` which returns two values, assigning them to `l` and `r`. Since the exact values returned by `R()` are not specified, they are represented as the values returned by `R()`. The precondition that `q` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1 remains valid after the code execution.
