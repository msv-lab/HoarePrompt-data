Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for x in R()`. The variables involved in the loop head are `x`.

2. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `t` is 0
   - `a` is `[0, 0, (j, i)[x != p]]`
   - `p` is `x`
   - `i` is 2
   - `j` is `(j, i)[x != p]`

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - The loop condition depends on the value of `x` from the set `R()`. For the loop to execute again, `x` must be the next value in the sequence defined by `R()`.
   - Since `p` is currently set to `x`, and `a` and `j` depend on the value of `x`, these values will change as `x` changes.
   - After the current iteration, `p` is now the value of `x` from the previous iteration.

4. **Update the State**:
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `p` will be updated to the new value of `x` for the next iteration.
   - `i` and `j` will be recalculated based on the new value of `x`.

Given the above reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the new value of `x` (which is `p` from the previous iteration) and the updated values of `a` and `j`.

**State:**
- `t` is 0 (unchanged)
- `a` is `[0, 0, (j, i)[p != p]]` (simplified to `[0, 0, (j, i)[False]]` which is `[0, 0, (j, i)]`)
- `p` is the new value of `x` (let's call it `new_x`)
- `i` is 2 (unchanged)
- `j` is `(j, i)[p != p]` which simplifies to `i` (since `p != p` is False)

So, the final state is:
State: **`t` is 0, `a` is [0, 0, 2], `p` is the new value of `x`, `i` is 2, `j` is 2**
