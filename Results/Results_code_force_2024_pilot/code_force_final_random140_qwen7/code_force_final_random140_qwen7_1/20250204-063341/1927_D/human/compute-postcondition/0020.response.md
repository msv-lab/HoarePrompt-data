Output State: **`a` is increased by `j` twice, `i` is increased by 2, `p` equals `x`, `x` is the next value provided by `R()`**.

Explanation: The code snippet `p = x` assigns the value of `x` to `p`. Since `x` is the next value provided by `R()`, `p` now holds that value. The other variables (`a`, `i`) are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
