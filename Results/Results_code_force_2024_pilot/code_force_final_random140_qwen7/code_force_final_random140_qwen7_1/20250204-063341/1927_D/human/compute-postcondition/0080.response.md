Output State: **`t` is non-zero - 1, `a` is [0], `p` is new_x, `i` is 4, `q` is 0, `j` is (j, i)[new_x != p], `l` is the last value returned by R(), `r` is the last value returned by R()**.

Explanation: The list `a` was initially `[0, 0, (j, i)[new_x != p], 2, (j, i)[new_x != p], (j, i)[new_x != p]]`. After executing `a = [0]`, the list `a` is now `[0]`. All other variables (`t`, `p`, `i`, `q`, `j`, `l`, `r`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
