Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Variables:**
   - `q` is decreased by 1. This means `q` was some initial value, but we don't need this for the print statement.
   - `a` is a list containing the sum of `j` for each iteration. Since `j` is the value of `i` from the last iteration, `a` contains the cumulative sum of `i` values from previous iterations.
   - `j` is the value of `i` from the last iteration. This implies that `j` is the last value of `i` after the loop completed.
   - `l` is the last value returned by `R()`. This is the result of the last call to the function `R()`.
   - `r` is the last value returned by `R()`. This is the same as `l` since `R()` is called twice with the same context.
   - `p` is the last value returned by `R()` before the assignment. This is also the same as `l` and `r`.
   - `i` is equal to the number of iterations. This means `i` is the total number of times the loop ran.

2. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The print statement is: `print(*((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l])`
   - First, evaluate the condition `a[r] < l`. Here, `r` is the last value returned by `R()`, which is the same as `l`.
   - Since `a[r]` is the sum of `j` for the last iteration (which is the same as `l`), the condition `a[r] < l` simplifies to `l < l`, which is `False`.
   - Therefore, the expression `((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l]` evaluates to `([-1] * 2)` because the condition is `False`.
   - The expression `[-1] * 2` creates a list `[ -1, -1 ]`.

3. **Final Output:**
   - The `*` operator unpacks the list `[ -1, -1 ]` into separate arguments for the `print` function.
   - Thus, the print statement will output `-1` followed by `-1`.

Output: **-1 -1**
