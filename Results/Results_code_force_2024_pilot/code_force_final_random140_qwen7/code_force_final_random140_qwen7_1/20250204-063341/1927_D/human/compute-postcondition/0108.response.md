The loop condition is `q`, which is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `q` must be non-zero (i.e., `q > 0`). Since `q` is a positive integer and was originally equal to its current value plus 1, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `q`.

Therefore, the state needs to be modified such that `q` is a positive integer.

State: **`q` is a positive integer**
