Output State: **`t` is a positive integer - 1**

Explanation: The function `R()` is called, but since no changes to variables are made within the function call itself (no assignment statements or other modifications to `t`), the value of `t` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state, which is `t` is a positive integer - 1.
