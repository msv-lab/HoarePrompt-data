Output State: **`a` is increased by `j` twice, `i` is increased by 3, `p` equals `x`, `x` is the next value provided by `R()`**.

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Since `i` was previously increased by 2, now `i` is increased by 3 in total. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
