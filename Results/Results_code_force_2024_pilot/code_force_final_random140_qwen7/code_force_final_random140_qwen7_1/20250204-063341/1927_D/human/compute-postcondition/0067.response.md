Output State: **`t` is 0, `a` is [0, 0, (j, i), 2, (j, i)[new_x != p], (j, i)[new_x != p]], `p` is new_x, `i` is 4, `q` is q - 1, `j` is (j, i)[new_x != p], `l` is a value from R(), `r` is a value from R()**

Explanation: The variable `q` is decremented by 1. Since `q` must be greater than or equal to 1 initially, `q` now becomes `q - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
