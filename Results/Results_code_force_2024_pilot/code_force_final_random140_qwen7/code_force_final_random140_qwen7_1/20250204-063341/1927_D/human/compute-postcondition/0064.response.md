Output State: **`t` is 0, `a` is [0, 0, (j, i), 2, (j, i)[new_x != p], (j, i)[new_x != p]], `p` is new_x, `i` is 4, `q` is q - 1, `j` is (j, i)[new_x != p], `l` is a value from R(), `r` is a value from R()**

The code `l, r = R()` assigns two values returned by the function `R()` to the variables `l` and `r`. Since the function `R()` is not defined, we cannot determine the exact values of `l` and `r`. However, we know that `l` and `r` are now assigned these values. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
