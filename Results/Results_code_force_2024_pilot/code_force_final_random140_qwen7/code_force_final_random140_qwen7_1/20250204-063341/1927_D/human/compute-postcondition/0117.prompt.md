You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer; n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; the array a is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^6]; q is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5; each query is represented by two integers l and r such that 1 <= l < r <= n.
def func():
    R = lambda : map(int, input().split())
    t, = R()
    while t:
        t -= 1
        
        R()
        
        a = [0]
        
        p = i = j = 0
        
        for x in R():
            j = (j, i)[x != p]
            a += j,
            p = x
            i += 1
        
        q, = R()
        
        while q:
            q -= 1
            l, r = R()
            print(*((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l])
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is 0, `a` is a list containing the sum of `j` for each iteration, where `j` is the value of `i` from the last iteration, `p` is the last value returned by `R()` before the assignment, `i` is equal to the total number of iterations, `q` is 0, `l` is the last value returned by `R()` during the final query, `r` is the last value returned by `R()` during the final query.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` will be decremented to 0 because the loop continues as long as `t` is greater than 0. The variable `q` will also be 0 since it is decremented by 1 after each query, and there are no more queries to process once `q` reaches 0. The variable `a` will contain the sum of `j` for each iteration, with `j` being the value of `i` from the last iteration, as this value is used to append to the list `a` in each iteration. The variable `p` will hold the last value returned by `R()` before the assignment, and `i` will be equal to the total number of iterations, which is the same as the final value of `i` after the loop completes. The values of `l` and `r` will be the last values returned by `R()` during the final query, as these values are updated each time through the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts four parameters: t (a positive integer), n (an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive), a (a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^6 inclusive), and q (an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive). For each query represented by two integers l and r (where 1 <= l < r <= n), the function returns a result based on the subarray a[l:r].

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
