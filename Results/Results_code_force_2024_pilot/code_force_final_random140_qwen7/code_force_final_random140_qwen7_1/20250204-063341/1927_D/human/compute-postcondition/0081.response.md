Output State: **`t` is non-zero - 1, `a` is [0], `p` is 0, `i` is 0, `q` is 0, `j` is 0, `l` is the last value returned by R(), `r` is the last value returned by R()**

Explanation:
- `p` is reassigned to 0.
- `i` is reassigned to 0.
- `j` is reassigned to 0 because `j = (j, i)[new_x != p]` and both `j` and `i` are now 0, making the expression `(0, 0)[new_x != p]` which evaluates to 0 regardless of the value of `new_x` since `p` is now 0.
- The values of `t`, `a`, `q`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
