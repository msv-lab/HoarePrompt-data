Output State: **`t` is 0, `a` is [0, 0, (j, i)[x != p]], `p` is the next value in the sequence generated by `R()`, `i` is 1, `j` is (j, i)[x != p]**.

Explanation: The code `a += j,` updates the list `a` by appending the value of `j`. The value of `j` is `(j, i)[x != p]`, which means `j` if `x` is not equal to `p`, otherwise `i`. Since `i` is 1, the updated list `a` will have one more element, which is `(j, i)[x != p]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
