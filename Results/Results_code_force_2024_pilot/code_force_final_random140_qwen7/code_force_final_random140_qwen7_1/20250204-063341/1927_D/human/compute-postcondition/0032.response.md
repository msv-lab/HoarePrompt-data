Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `t` is a positive integer - 1. This means `t` is 0.
   - `a` is a list containing elements 0, `j`, and `j` (or `i` if `x` was not equal to `p` during the first iteration).
   - `p` is the last `x` value generated by `R()`. Since `t` is 0, this implies that `p` is the last `x` value generated by `R()` in the previous iteration.
   - `i` is the total number of iterations completed. Since `t` is 0, it suggests that there was only one iteration.
   - `j` is either `j` or `i` from the last iteration depending on the condition `x != p`. Given `i` is the number of iterations, and since `t` is 0, `j` would be `i` (which is 0).
   - `q` is `q - 1`. Without knowing the initial value of `q`, we can't determine its exact value, but we know it has been decremented by 1.
   - `l` is the value of the left boundary generated by `R()`.
   - `r` is the value of the right boundary generated by `R()`.

2. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The print statement is `print(*((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l])`.
   - `a` is `[0, j, j]` where `j` is 0 (since `i` is 0).
   - `a[r]` refers to the `r`-th element in the list `a`.
   - If `a[r] < l`, then the expression evaluates to `[-1] * 2`, which is `[-1, -1]`.
   - Otherwise, it evaluates to `(a[r], r)`.

Given that `r` is the value of the right boundary generated by `R()`, let's assume `r` is a value generated by `R()`.

Since `a` is `[0, 0, 0]` and `r` is a value generated by `R()`, `a[r]` will be 0 (as `r` will point to one of the indices 0, 1, or 2).

Therefore, `a[r] < l` will always be `False` because `a[r]` is 0 and `l` is a random value generated by `R()` which is greater than 0.

So, the expression evaluates to `(a[r], r)` which is `(0, r)`.

Output: **(0, r)**
