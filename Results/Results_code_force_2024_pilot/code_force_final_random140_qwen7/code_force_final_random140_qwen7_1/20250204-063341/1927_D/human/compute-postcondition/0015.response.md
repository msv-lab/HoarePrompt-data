Output State: **`a` is increased by `j`, `i` is increased by 1, `x` is the next value provided by `R()`, `p` is equal to `x`**.

Explanation: The code `p = x` assigns the current value of `x` to `p`. Since `x` is the next value provided by `R()`, `p` now holds the same value as `x`. The values of `a`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged from their previous states.
