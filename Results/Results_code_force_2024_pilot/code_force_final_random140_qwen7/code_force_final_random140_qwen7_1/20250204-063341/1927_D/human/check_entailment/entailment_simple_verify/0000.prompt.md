You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of n integers, and q queries.

Each query is represented by two integers l and r (1 \le l \le r \le n ). Your
task is to find, for each query, two indices i and j (or determine that they
do not exist) such that:

  * l \le i \le r ; 
  * l \le j \le r ; 
  * a_i \ne a_j . 

In other words, for each query, you need to find a pair of different elements
among a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r , or report that such a pair does not exist.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of the array a .

The third line of each test case contains a single integer q (1 \le q \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of queries.

The next q lines contain two integers each, l and r (1 \le l < r \le n ) — the
boundaries of the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of the
values of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each query, output two integers separated by space: i and j (l \le i, j
\le r ), for which a_i \ne a_j . If such a pair does not exist, output i=-1
and j=-1 .

You may separate the outputs for the test cases with empty lines. This is not
a mandatory requirement.

    #State: Output State: `t` is 0, `a` is a list containing the sum of `j` for each iteration, where `j` is the value of `i` from the last iteration, `p` is the last value returned by `R()` before the assignment, `i` is equal to the total number of iterations, `q` is 0, `l` is the last value returned by `R()` during the final query, `r` is the last value returned by `R()` during the final query.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` will be decremented to 0 because the loop continues as long as `t` is greater than 0. The variable `q` will also be 0 since it is decremented by 1 after each query, and there are no more queries to process once `q` reaches 0. The variable `a` will contain the sum of `j` for each iteration, with `j` being the value of `i` from the last iteration, as this value is used to append to the list `a` in each iteration. The variable `p` will hold the last value returned by `R()` before the assignment, and `i` will be equal to the total number of iterations, which is the same as the final value of `i` after the loop completes. The values of `l` and `r` will be the last values returned by `R()` during the final query, as these values are updated each time through the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program fails to ensure that the indices \(i\) and \(j\) returned for each query satisfy \(l \le i \le r\) and \(l \le j \le r\). Additionally, the logic for finding different elements within the specified range is flawed.

Consider the following example:

**Input:**
```
5
5
1 1 2 1 1
3
1 5
1 2
1 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2 3
-1 -1
-1 -1
```

However, the provided program outputs:
```
2 3
-1 -1
1 3
```

This indicates that the program incorrectly returns `1 3` for the third query, which does not satisfy the condition \(1 \le i, j \le 3\). The program should return `-1 -1` for this query since no two different elements exist within the range `[1, 3]`.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases, leading to a correctness of **False**.
