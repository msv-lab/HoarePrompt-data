Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Finding Different Elements**:
   - The logic in the program uses `a` to store indices where elements differ, but it doesn't properly handle the queries for subarrays.
   - Specifically, the line `a += (j,)` is appending the index `j` to the list `a`, which is not the correct approach for finding different elements within a range `[l, r]`.

2. **Handling Queries**:
   - The program attempts to print the result directly from the stored `a` list without checking if there are different elements within the queried range `[l, r]`.
   - The logic `a[r] < l` is incorrect and does not check for the existence of different elements; instead, it checks if the last stored index is less than `l`, which is not relevant.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The program should output pairs of indices `i` and `j` for each query, or `-1 -1` if no such pair exists. The current implementation does not correctly format the output for each query.

### Corrected Program:
Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def func():
    R = lambda : map(int, input().split)
    
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t -= 1
        n = int(input())
        a = list(R())
        
        # Create a dictionary to store the last occurrence of each element
        last_occurrence = defaultdict(lambda: -1)
        for i, x in enumerate(a):
            last_occurrence[x] = i
        
        q = int(input())
        for _ in range(q):
            l, r = R()
            l -= 1  # Adjusting 1-based indexing to 0-based indexing
            r -= 1  # Adjusting 1-based indexing to 0-based indexing
            
            # Find the first occurrence of an element after l
            for j in range(l + 1, r + 1):
                if last_occurrence[a[j]] > l:
                    print(j + 1, last_occurrence[a[j]] + 1)
                    break
            else:
                print(-1, -1)
        
        if t > 0:
            print()  # Print an empty line between test cases

func()
```

This corrected program:
- Uses a dictionary to track the last occurrence of each element.
- For each query, it finds the first occurrence of an element after `l` that has already appeared before `l`, ensuring that `i` and `j` are within the range `[l, r]`.
- Outputs the indices in the correct format.
