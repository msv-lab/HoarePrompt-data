Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding a pair of different elements within a specified range `[l, r]` for each query.
2. The provided code constructs an array `a` where `a[i]` is the last occurrence of the value `p` before index `i`.
3. For each query, the code checks if the element at index `r` in array `a` is greater than or equal to `l`. If true, it prints the element at index `r` and `r`. Otherwise, it prints `-1` twice.
4. However, this approach does not correctly identify pairs of different elements within the range `[l, r]`. Instead, it checks if the last occurrence of the current element before index `r` is within the range `[l, r]`.
5. This logic fails to ensure that `i` and `j` are distinct indices within the range `[l, r]`.

Given the above reasoning, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as stated. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
