Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program fails to ensure that the indices \(i\) and \(j\) returned for each query satisfy \(l \le i \le r\) and \(l \le j \le r\). Additionally, the logic for finding different elements within the specified range is flawed.

Consider the following example:

**Input:**
```
5
5
1 1 2 1 1
3
1 5
1 2
1 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2 3
-1 -1
-1 -1
```

However, the provided program outputs:
```
2 3
-1 -1
1 3
```

This indicates that the program incorrectly returns `1 3` for the third query, which does not satisfy the condition \(1 \le i, j \le 3\). The program should return `-1 -1` for this query since no two different elements exist within the range `[1, 3]`.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases, leading to a correctness of **False**.
