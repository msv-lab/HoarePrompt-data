Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.

2. **Finding Maximum Value `mx`:**
   - It initializes `mx` to 1.
   - It enters a loop where it prints a query `? 1 {n * mx}` to find the smallest `r` such that `f(1, r) = n * mx`.
   - If `x` equals `n`, it breaks the loop, indicating that `mx` is correct.
   - Otherwise, it increments `mx` and continues the loop.

3. **Calculating Target Value `tar`:**
   - It calculates `tar` as `n // k * mx`.

4. **Checking Validity of `tar`:**
   - It enters a loop where it decreases `tar` by `mx` until it finds a valid `tar` using the function `func_1`.
   - If `tar` becomes non-positive, it prints `! -1` and exits.
   - Otherwise, it prints `! {tar}`.

5. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function checks if the target value `tar` can be achieved by splitting the array into `k` subarrays.
   - It iterates through the array, checking if the condition `f(ind + 1, x) = tar` holds for each segment.
   - If the condition fails, it returns `False`.
   - If it successfully splits the array into `k` segments, it returns `True`.

### Verification of Correctness

1. **Finding `mx`:**
   - The loop correctly identifies the maximum value `mx` such that `f(1, r) = n * mx` for some `r`.
   - This ensures that the initial guess for `tar` is reasonable.

2. **Calculating `tar`:**
   - The calculation of `tar` as `n // k * mx` is correct, ensuring that the target value is a multiple of `mx` and proportional to `n`.

3. **Checking `tar` Validity:**
   - The loop in `func_1` correctly checks if the target value `tar` can be achieved by splitting the array into `k` subarrays.
   - It uses the correct logic to verify the condition `f(ind + 1, x) = tar`.

4. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where no valid `tar` exists by printing `-1`.
   - It also terminates correctly when receiving `-1` from the judge.

### Conclusion

The program appears to follow the correct logic and handles all necessary steps to solve the problem. There are no apparent logical errors or missing parts.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
