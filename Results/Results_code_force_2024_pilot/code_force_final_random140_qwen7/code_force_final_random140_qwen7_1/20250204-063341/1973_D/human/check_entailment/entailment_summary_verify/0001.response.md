### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies the key components of the program and their correctness. However, let's delve deeper into the implementation details to ensure everything aligns perfectly with the problem requirements.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly formats and sends a query to the judge and reads the response. The assertion ensures the response is non-negative, which is necessary to avoid invalid responses.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function correctly formats and sends the final answer to the judge and reads the response. The assertion ensures the response is `1`, indicating the answer is correct.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - **Initialization and Input Reading**:
     - The function correctly reads `n` and `k`.
   - **Finding `max_val`**:
     - The logic iterates from `i = n` down to `1` to find the largest possible `max_val` such that `f(1, r) = i * n` holds true for some `r`. This is a valid approach.
   - **Checking for valid `m`**:
     - The function iterates from `i = n // k` down to `1` to find a valid `m` such that the array can be split into `k` subarrays with the required property. This is a logical and correct approach.
     - The fallback logic to set `m` to `-1` if no valid `m` is found is correct.

4. **Function `func_4`**:
   - This function correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases `t` and calling `func_3` for each test case.

### Detailed Evaluation

- **Initialization and Input Reading**:
  - The functions correctly read `n` and `k` for each test case.
  - The logic for finding `max_val` is sound and ensures the largest possible value is considered first.

- **Finding `max_val`**:
  - The logic iterates from the largest possible value down to 1, which is a good strategy to find the largest possible `max_val`.
  - The assertion `assert r == n` ensures that the found `r` is within bounds, which is crucial for the correctness of the algorithm.

- **Finding Valid `m`**:
  - The logic for checking if a valid `m` can be found is correct. It iterates from the largest possible value down to 1, setting `m` to `i * max_val` and checking if the subarrays can be formed with the required property.
  - The fallback logic to set `m` to `-1` if no valid `m` is found is correct.

- **Output Handling**:
  - The functions correctly handle the output and assertions as per the problem statement.

### Conclusion

After a thorough review, the program appears to be correct and follows the problem specification accurately. The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
