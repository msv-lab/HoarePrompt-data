### Reasoning

Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description and the annotated code.

#### Function `func_1`
- **Purpose**: Queries the smallest `r` such that `f(l, r) = x`.
- **Implementation**: Correctly prints the query and reads the response, ensuring the response is non-negative.
- **Correctness**: The function is correctly implemented according to the problem statement.

#### Function `func_2`
- **Purpose**: Submits the final answer and checks if it is accepted.
- **Implementation**: Prints the answer and reads the response, asserting that the response is `1`.
- **Correctness**: The function is correctly implemented according to the problem statement.

#### Function `func_3`
- **Purpose**: Determines the largest value `m` such that the array can be split into `k` subarrays with the specified property.
- **Initialization**:
  - Reads `n` and `k`.
  - Initializes `max_val` to `0`.
- **Finding `max_val`**:
  - Iterates from `i = n` down to `1`.
  - Calls `func_1(1, i * n)` to find the smallest `r` such that `f(1, r) = i * n`.
  - If `r` is within bounds (`r <= n`), it sets `max_val` to `i` and breaks the loop.
- **Checking for valid `m`**:
  - Iterates from `i = n // k` down to `1`.
  - Sets `m` to `i * max_val`.
  - For each subarray, calls `func_1(p + 1, m)` to find the smallest `r` such that `f(p + 1, r) = m`.
  - If `p` exceeds `n`, it breaks the loop.
  - If `p` equals `n`, it calls `func_2(m)` to submit the answer.
- **Fallback**:
  - If no valid `m` is found, calls `func_2(-1)`.

#### Function `func_4`
- **Purpose**: Handles multiple test cases.
- **Implementation**: Reads the number of test cases `t` and calls `func_3` for each test case.
- **Correctness**: The function correctly handles multiple test cases.

### Detailed Analysis

1. **Initialization and Input Reading**:
   - The functions correctly read `n` and `k` for each test case.
   - The logic for finding `max_val` seems correct. It iterates from the largest possible value down to 1, which is a good strategy to find the largest possible `max_val`.

2. **Finding `max_val`**:
   - The logic for finding `max_val` is correct. It checks if the calculated `r` is within bounds and updates `max_val` accordingly.

3. **Finding Valid `m`**:
   - The logic for checking if a valid `m` can be found is correct. It iterates from the largest possible value down to 1, setting `m` to `i * max_val` and checking if the subarrays can be formed with the required property.
   - The fallback logic to set `m` to `-1` if no valid `m` is found is correct.

4. **Output Handling**:
   - The functions correctly handle the output and assertions as per the problem statement.

### Conclusion

Based on the detailed analysis, the provided program appears to be correct and follows the problem specification accurately. The program correctly implements the logic to find the largest value `m` such that the array can be split into `k` subarrays with the specified property.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **True**

The program is correct.
