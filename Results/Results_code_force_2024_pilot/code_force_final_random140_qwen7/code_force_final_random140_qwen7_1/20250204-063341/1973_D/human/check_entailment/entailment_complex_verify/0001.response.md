### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description and the annotated code.

#### Function `func_1`:
- This function correctly prints a query in the required format and reads the response.
- It ensures the response is non-negative and returns the response value.
- This function is correctly implemented according to the problem statement.

#### Function `func_2`:
- This function correctly prints the final answer in the required format and reads the response.
- It asserts that the response is `1`, indicating the answer is correct.
- This function is correctly implemented according to the problem statement.

#### Function `func_3`:
- This function determines the largest value `m` such that the array can be split into `k` subarrays with the specified property.
- **Initialization**:
  - Reads `n` and `k`.
  - Initializes `max_val` to `0`.
- **Finding `max_val`**:
  - Iterates from `i = n` down to `1`.
  - Calls `func_1(1, i * n)` to find the smallest `r` such that `f(1, r) = i * n`.
  - If `r` is within bounds (`r <= n`), it sets `max_val` to `i` and breaks the loop.
- **Checking for valid `m`**:
  - Iterates from `i = n // k` down to `1`.
  - Sets `m` to `i * max_val`.
  - For each subarray, calls `func_1(p + 1, m)` to find the smallest `r` such that `f(p + 1, r) = m`.
  - If `p` exceeds `n`, it breaks the loop.
  - If `p` equals `n`, it calls `func_2(m)` to submit the answer.
- **Fallback**:
  - If no valid `m` is found, calls `func_2(-1)`.

#### Function `func_4`:
- This function handles multiple test cases.
- Reads the number of test cases `t`.
- Calls `func_3` for each test case.

### Correctness Analysis:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading**:
   - The functions correctly read `n` and `k` for each test case.
   - The logic for finding `max_val` seems correct. It iterates from the largest possible value down to 1, which is a good strategy to find the largest possible `max_val`.

2. **Finding `max_val`**:
   - The logic for finding `max_val` is correct. It checks if the calculated `r` is within bounds and updates `max_val` accordingly.

3. **Finding Valid `m`**:
   - The logic for checking if a valid `m` can be found is correct. It iterates from the largest possible value down to 1, setting `m` to `i * max_val` and checking if the subarrays can be formed with the required property.
   - The fallback logic to set `m` to `-1` if no valid `m` is found is correct.

4. **Output Handling**:
   - The functions correctly handle the output and assertions as per the problem statement.

### Specific Points to Validate:

1. **Finding `max_val`**:
   - The loop `for i in range(n, 0, -1):` ensures that the largest possible `max_val` is found first. This is crucial for determining the largest possible value `m`.

2. **Checking for valid `m`**:
   - The loop `for i in range(n // k, 0, -1):` ensures that the largest possible `m` is checked first. This is important because if a larger `m` can be found, it should be used.

3. **Fallback Logic**:
   - The fallback logic to set `m` to `-1` if no valid `m` is found is correct and necessary to ensure that the program handles the case where no valid split exists.

### Conclusion:

Based on the detailed analysis, the provided program appears to be correct and follows the problem specification accurately. The original assessment was thorough and accurate.
