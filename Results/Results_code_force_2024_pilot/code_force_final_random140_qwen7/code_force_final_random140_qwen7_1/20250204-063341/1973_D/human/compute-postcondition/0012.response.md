Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n - 1`, `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, (n-1) * n)`, and `r` is also assigned to `func_1(1, i * n)`, `max_val` is `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified in the code snippet, the `break` statement does not change the values of the variables. The values of `n`, `i`, `r`, and `max_val` remain unchanged, and the `break` statement indicates that we exit the most internal loop or conditional block we were in.
