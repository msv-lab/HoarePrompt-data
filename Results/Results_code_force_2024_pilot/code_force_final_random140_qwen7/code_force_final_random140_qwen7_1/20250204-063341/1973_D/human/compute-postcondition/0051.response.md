Output State: **`j` is 1, `k` is a positive integer, `p` is the return value of `func_1(p + 1, m)`**.

Explanation: The code `p = func_1(p + 1, m)` updates the value of `p` to be the return value of the function `func_1` with arguments `p + 1` and `m`. Since the exact behavior of `func_1` is not specified, we can only state that `p` now holds the return value of this function call. The values of `j` and `k` remain unchanged.
