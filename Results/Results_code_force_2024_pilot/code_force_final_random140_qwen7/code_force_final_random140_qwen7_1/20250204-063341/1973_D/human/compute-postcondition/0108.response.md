Output State: **`func_2(m)` has been called once with `m` being `max_val * 1`, `p` is `n`, `j` is the total number of iterations performed across all loop executions, `i` is 1, `m` is `max_val * 1`, `k` is at least 3, and `func_2(-1)` has been executed.**

Explanation:
- The code `func_2(-1)` is executed, which calls the function `func_2` with the argument `-1`.
- This call does not affect the values of `i`, `m`, `p`, `j`, `k`, `n`, or `max_val` from the previous state.
- Therefore, the values of these variables remain as described in the initial state, except that `func_2(m)` has been called once with `m` being `max_val * 1` (since `i` was 1 when the loop broke).
