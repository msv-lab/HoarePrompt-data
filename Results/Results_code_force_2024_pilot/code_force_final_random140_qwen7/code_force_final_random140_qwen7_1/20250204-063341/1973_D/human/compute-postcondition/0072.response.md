Output State: **`j` is `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `p` is the return value of `func_1(p + 1, m)`, `i` is `n // k - k`, `m` is `(n // k - k) * max_val**.

Explanation: The code assigns `m` the value of `i` multiplied by `max_val`. Since `i` is defined as `n // k - k`, `m` becomes `(n // k - k) * max_val`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
