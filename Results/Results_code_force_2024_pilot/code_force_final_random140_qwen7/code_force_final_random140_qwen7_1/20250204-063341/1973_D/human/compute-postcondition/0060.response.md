Postcondition: `j` is 2, `k` is a positive integer, `p` is the return value of `func_1(p + 1, m)` and `p` is updated to the return value of `func_1(p + 1, m)`. If `p >= n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains as described in the if part.
