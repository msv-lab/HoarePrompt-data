Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the given for loop are `j` and `k`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = k + 1`. This means that at the start of each iteration, `j` is incremented by 1.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `j` is 1.
   - `k` is a positive integer.
   - `p` is the return value of `func_1(p + 1, m)`.
   - There is a postcondition that if `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, we break out of the loop.

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts from 1 and increments by 1 at each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be 2.
   - The value of `k` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - The value of `p` remains the same as it is determined before the loop starts and does not change during the loop execution.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `j` will be 2.
   - `k` remains the same (a positive integer).
   - `p` remains the same (the return value of `func_1(p + 1, m)`).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`j` is 2, `k` is a positive integer, `p` is the return value of `func_1(p + 1, m)`**
