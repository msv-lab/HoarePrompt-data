Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `j`, which ranges from `1` to `k + 1`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is 2.
   - `k` is a positive integer.
   - The postcondition states that if `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains unchanged for the case when `p` is less than `n`.

3. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `j` starts from `1` and increments by `1` each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `2`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to `3`.
   - The value of `k` remains the same as it was at the start of the current iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`j` is 3, `k` is a positive integer**.
