Output State: **`j` is equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is `n // k`, `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, n)`, `max_val` is 0, `m` is 0, `p` is equal to `n`, `func_2(m)` has been called.**

Explanation: The function `func_2(m)` is called with `m` being 0. However, the function itself does not modify any of the given variables (`j`, `k`, `i`, `r`, `max_val`, `m`, `p`). Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged. The only action taken is the call to `func_2(m)`.
