Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n-2`, `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, (n-1) * n)`, and `max_val` is `n-2`.**

Explanation: The line `max_val = i` simply assigns the current value of `i` to `max_val`. Since `i` is already defined as `n-2`, `max_val` is also set to `n-2`. The function calls and other variables remain unchanged.
