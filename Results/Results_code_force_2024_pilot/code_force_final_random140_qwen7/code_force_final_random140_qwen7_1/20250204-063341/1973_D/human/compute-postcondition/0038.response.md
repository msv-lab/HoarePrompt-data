Output State: **`j` is 3, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is `n // k`, `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, n)`, `max_val` is 0, `m` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `j`, `k`, `i`, `r`, `max_val`, and `m`. It only indicates that the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was inside.
