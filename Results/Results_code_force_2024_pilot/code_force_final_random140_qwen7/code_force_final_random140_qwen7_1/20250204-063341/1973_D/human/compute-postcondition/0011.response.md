Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n - 1`, `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, (n-1) * n)`, and `r` is also assigned to `func_1(1, i * n)`, `max_val` is `i`.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the value of `i` to `max_val`. Since `i` is already defined as `n - 1`, `max_val` now holds the same value as `i`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
