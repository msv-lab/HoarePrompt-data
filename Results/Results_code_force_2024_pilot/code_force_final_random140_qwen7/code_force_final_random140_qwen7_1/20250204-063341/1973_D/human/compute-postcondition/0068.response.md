Output State: **j is k, k is a positive integer, p is the return value of func_1(p + 1, m), the loop has executed k times, and the current value of p is equal to n, and func_2(m) has been called.**

The function `func_2(m)` is called, but since no return value is mentioned for this function call, the values of the variables `j`, `k`, `p`, and `n` remain unchanged. The loop that has executed `k` times also remains unchanged.
