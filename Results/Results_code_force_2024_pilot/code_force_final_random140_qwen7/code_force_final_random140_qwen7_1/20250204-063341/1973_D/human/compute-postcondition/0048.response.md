Output State: **`j` is equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is (n // k) - 1, `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, n)`, `max_val` is 0, `m` is 0 *i* multiplied by `max_val`, and `p` is not equal to `n`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `i * max_val` to `m`. Given that `i` is `(n // k) - 1` and `max_val` is 0, the value of `m` becomes `(n // k - 1) * 0`, which is 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
