You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: (n, k) are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^4.
def func_3():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    max_val = 0
    for i in range(n, 0, -1):
        r = func_1(1, i * n)
        
        if r <= n:
            assert r == n
            max_val = i
            break
        
    #State: The loop has executed all its iterations. The variable `n` remains as the initial positive integer value. The variable `i` is now 1 because the loop decremented `i` from `n` to 1. The variable `max_val` is set to the highest value of `i` that satisfied the condition `r <= n` during any iteration of the loop. The variable `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, (i-1) * n)` which, when `i` reaches 1, would be `func_1(1, 0)`.
    for i in range(n // k, 0, -1):
        m = i * max_val
        
        p = 0
        
        for j in range(1, k + 1):
            if p >= n:
                p = 0
                break
            p = func_1(p + 1, m)
        
        if p == n:
            func_2(m)
            return
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be 1 because the loop decrements `i` from `n` to 1. The variable `m` will be `max_val * 1` since `i` reaches 1 and `m` is calculated as `i * max_val`. The variable `p` will be the final value obtained by repeatedly calling `func_1(p + 1, m)` until `p` is no longer less than `n`, at which point `p` will be set to 0. Since the loop breaks when `p >= n`, `p` will be equal to `n`. The variable `j` will reflect the total number of iterations performed across all loop executions, and `k` must still be at least 3. The function `func_2(m)` will have been called once with `m` being `max_val * 1` when `p` equals `n`.
    func_2(-1)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters, and either does not return any value or returns `None`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program does not return any value

Case_2: The program returns None

Case_3: The program does not return any value


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
