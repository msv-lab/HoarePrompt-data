Output State: **`j` is 2, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is `n // k`, `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, n)`, `max_val` is 0, `m` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block immediately surrounding the `break` statement in the given code snippet, the `break` statement does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `j`, `k`, `i`, `r`, `max_val`, and `m` remain unchanged, and we simply note that the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
