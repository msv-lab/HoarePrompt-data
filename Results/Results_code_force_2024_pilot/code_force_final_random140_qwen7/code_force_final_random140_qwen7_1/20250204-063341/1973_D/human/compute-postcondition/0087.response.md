Output State: **`j` is 3, `k` is a positive integer, `p` is the result of `func_1(p + 1, m)`**

Explanation: The code `p = func_1(p + 1, m)` assigns the return value of the function `func_1` with arguments `p + 1` and `m` to the variable `p`. Since the exact behavior of `func_1` is not defined, we cannot specify the exact value of `p`. However, we know that `p` now holds the result of calling `func_1` with the specified arguments. The values of `j` and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
