Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `j` is equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, n)`, `max_val` is the largest `i` such that `r` is less than or equal to `i * n`, `m` is `i * max_val`, and `p` is not equal to `n`.**

In this final state, the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `i` has been decremented until it reaches 0. The value of `max_val` is determined as the largest `i` for which `r` is less than or equal to `i * n`. The variable `m` is calculated as `i * max_val`. The variable `p` retains its last computed value, which is not equal to `n` based on the loop's condition.
