Output State: **`j` is 3, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is `n // k`, `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, n)`, `max_val` is 0, `m` is 0, `p` is the return value of `func_1(p + 1, m)`**.

The code `p = func_1(p + 1, m)` updates the value of `p` to be the return value of the function `func_1` called with arguments `p + 1` and `m`. However, since the actual return value of `func_1` is not specified, we can only say that `p` now holds whatever value `func_1(p + 1, m)` returns. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
