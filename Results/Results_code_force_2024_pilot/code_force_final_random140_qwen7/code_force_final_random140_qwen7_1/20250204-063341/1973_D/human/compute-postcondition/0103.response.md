Output State: **`i` is `i - 2`, `m` is `i * max_val`, `n` remains the same, `max_val` remains the same, `p` is equal to `n`, `j` is 3, `k` must still be at least 3, and the function `func_2(m)` has been called.**

Explanation: The function `func_2(m)` is called, which does not affect the values of the other variables. The only change is that `p` is now equal to `n` because the loop has been broken out of due to the condition `p >= n`, and since `p == n` is met, the current value of `p` is equal to `n`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
