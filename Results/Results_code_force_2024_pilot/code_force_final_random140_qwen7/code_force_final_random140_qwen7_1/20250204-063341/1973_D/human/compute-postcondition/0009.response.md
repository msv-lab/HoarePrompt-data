Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns nothing.**

Given the function definition `def func_4():`, it does not accept any parameters. Since there are no parameters mentioned, the only thing we can conclude about its functionality is that it does not take any inputs. The provided output cases do not provide any additional information since they refer to parameters (`number`) which are not present in the function signature. Therefore, the function simply has no parameters and does not return anything.
