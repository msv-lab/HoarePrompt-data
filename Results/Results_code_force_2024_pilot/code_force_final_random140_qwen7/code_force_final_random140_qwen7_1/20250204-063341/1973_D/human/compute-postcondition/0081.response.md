Output State: **`j` is 2, `k` is a positive integer, `p` is the return value of `func_1(p + 1, m)`**

Explanation: The variable `p` is reassigned to the return value of the function `func_1(p + 1, m)`. Since the initial value of `p` was the return value of `func_1(p + 1, m)`, and now `p` is being reassigned to the same function call, the value of `p` remains unchanged from its previous state. The other variables (`j` and `k`) are not affected by the code snippet.
