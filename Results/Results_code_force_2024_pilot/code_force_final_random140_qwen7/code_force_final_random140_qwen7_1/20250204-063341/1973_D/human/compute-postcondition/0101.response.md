Output State: `i` is `i - 2`, `m` is `i * max_val`, `n` is the same, `max_val` is the same, `p` is `func_1(p + 1, m)`, `p` is not equal to `n`, `j` is 3, `k` must be at least 3, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Natural Language Description:** After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be `i - 2`, `m` will be `i * max_val`, `n` remains unchanged, `max_val` remains unchanged, `p` will be the result of applying the function `func_1` to `p + 1` and `m`, `p` is not equal to `n`, `j` will be 3, `k` must still be at least 3, and the loop has been broken out of due to the condition `p >= n`.
