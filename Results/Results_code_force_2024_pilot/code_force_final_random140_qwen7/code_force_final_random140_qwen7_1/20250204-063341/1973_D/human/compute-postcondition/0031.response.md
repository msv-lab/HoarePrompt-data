Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `j` is 1
   - `k` is a positive integer
   - `i` is `n // k`
   - `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, n)`
   - `max_val` is 0
   - `m` is 0
   - If `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for j in range(1, k + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The only variable in the loop head is `j`.

4. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `j` is within the range defined by `range(1, k + 1)`.

5. **Current Value of `j`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1.

6. **Next Value of `j`:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented from 1 to 2 (since the range is `1` to `k + 1`).

7. **Other Variables:**
   - `k` remains unchanged.
   - `i`, `r`, `max_val`, `m`, and `p` are not part of the loop head and their values do not change based on the loop condition.

8. **Updated States:**
   - `j` will be 2.
   - `k` remains the same.
   - `i`, `r`, `max_val`, `m`, and `p` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the updated states at the start of the next iteration of the loop are:

State: **`j` is 2, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is `n // k`, `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, n)`, `max_val` is 0, `m` is 0, and if `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
