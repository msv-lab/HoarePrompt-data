Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be 1 because the loop decrements `i` from `n` to 1. The variable `m` will be `max_val * 1` since `i` reaches 1 and `m` is calculated as `i * max_val`. The variable `p` will be the final value obtained by repeatedly calling `func_1(p + 1, m)` until `p` is no longer less than `n`, at which point `p` will be set to 0. Since the loop breaks when `p >= n`, `p` will be equal to `n`. The variable `j` will reflect the total number of iterations performed across all loop executions, and `k` must still be at least 3. The function `func_2(m)` will have been called once with `m` being `max_val * 1` when `p` equals `n`.
