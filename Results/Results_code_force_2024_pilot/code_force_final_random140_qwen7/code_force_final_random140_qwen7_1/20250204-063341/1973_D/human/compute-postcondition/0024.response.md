Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n // k`, `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, n)`, `max_val` is 0, `m` is 0, `p` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `p = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `p`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `n`, `i`, `r`, `max_val`, and `m` remain unchanged.
