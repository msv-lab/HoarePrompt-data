Output State: **`j` is 1, `k` must be a positive integer, `p` is the return value of `func_1(p + 1, m)`**

Explanation: The code `p = func_1(p + 1, m)` updates the value of `p` to be the return value of the function `func_1` with arguments `p + 1` and `m`. The variables `j` and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
