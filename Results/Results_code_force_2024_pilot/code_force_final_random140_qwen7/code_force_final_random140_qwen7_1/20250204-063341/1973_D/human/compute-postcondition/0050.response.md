Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head defines the variables that are being used in the loop. In this case, the loop is defined as:
   ```python
   for j in range(1, k + 1):
   ```
   The variable `j` is the iterator, and `k` is the upper bound of the range.

2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables:**
   - `j` is initialized to 1 (the start of the range).
   - `k` is a positive integer, as stated in the initial state.

3. **Adjust the States of the Variables:**
   - `j` should be set to 1 because the loop starts with `j = 1`.
   - `k` should remain as a positive integer since it is already given as such.

4. **Consider Other Variables:**
   - `i`, `r`, `max_val`, `m`, and `p` are not part of the loop head and do not affect whether the loop can execute. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted.

Based on the above reasoning, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- `j` should be 1.
- `k` should be a positive integer.

Thus, the final state is:

**State: **`j` is 1, `k` is a positive integer**
