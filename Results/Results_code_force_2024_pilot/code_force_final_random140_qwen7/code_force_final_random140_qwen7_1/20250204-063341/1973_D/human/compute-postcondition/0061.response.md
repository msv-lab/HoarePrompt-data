Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `k`.

2. **Determine the initial state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
   - `j` is 2
   - `k` is a positive integer
   - `p` is the return value of `func_1(p + 1, m)`
   - `p` is updated to the return value of `func_1(p + 1, m)`
   - If `p >= n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `j` in the range from 1 to `k + 1`.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must be less than `k + 1`.
   - Therefore, `j` will be incremented by 1, making it 3.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `j` will be 3.
   - `k` remains the same (a positive integer).
   - The value of `p` remains unchanged because the loop body is omitted and the state of `p` is not modified within the loop itself.

6. **Final state for the next iteration**:
   - `j` is 3
   - `k` is a positive integer
   - `p` is the return value of `func_1(p + 1, m)` and `p` is updated to the return value of `func_1(p + 1, m)`

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`j` is 3, `k` is a positive integer, `p` is the return value of `func_1(p + 1, m)` and `p` is updated to the return value of `func_1(p + 1, m)`**
