Postcondition: **`i` is `i - 2`, `m` is `i * max_val`, `n` remains the same, `max_val` remains the same, `p` is the result of applying the function `func_1` to `p + 1` and `m`, `p` is not equal to `n`, `j` is 3, `k` must still be at least 3, and the loop has been broken out of due to the condition `p >= n`.**
