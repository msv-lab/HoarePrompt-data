Output State: **`j` is 3, `k` is a positive integer, `p` is the return value of `func_1(p + 1, m)` and `p` is updated to the return value of `func_1(p + 1, m)`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `p` to the return value of the function `func_1(p + 1, m)`. Since `p` was already the return value of `func_1(p + 1, m)` before this line, `p` is now updated to this same return value again. The values of `j` and `k` remain unchanged.
