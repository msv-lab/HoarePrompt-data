Output State: **`j` is 3, `k` is a positive integer, `p` is the return value of `func_1(p + 1, m)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is executed, which means we exit the innermost loop or conditional block. The values of `j`, `k`, and `p` remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states. The function call `func_1(p + 1, m)` is made, and its return value is assigned to `p`. The states of other variables are not affected.
