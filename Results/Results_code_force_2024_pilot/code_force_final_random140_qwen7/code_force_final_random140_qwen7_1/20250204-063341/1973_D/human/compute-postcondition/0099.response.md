Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and performs a series of calculations involving `n` and `k`. It iterates through values to find a specific condition where `func_1` returns a value less than or equal to `n`. If such a condition is met, it calls `func_2` with a calculated value `m`. Otherwise, it calls `func_2` with `-1`. The function returns either nothing, `None`, or the value of `p` which is the result of `func_1(k * (p + 1), m)` based on the conditions met during its execution.**
