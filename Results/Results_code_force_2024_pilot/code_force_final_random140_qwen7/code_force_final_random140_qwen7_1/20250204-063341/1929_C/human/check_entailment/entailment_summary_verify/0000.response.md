### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and compare it with the problem description and the provided function summary.

#### Problem Description and Requirements:
- Sasha needs to ensure he can achieve any number of coins \(n\) given the rules of the casino.
- The program should check if Sasha can achieve this goal based on the initial number of coins \(a\), the multiplier \(k\), and the maximum number of consecutive losses \(x\).

#### Given Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (k, x, a) = map(int, input().split())
        s = 1
        for i in range(x):
            s += s // (k - 1) + 1
        print('YES' if a >= s else 'NO')
```

#### Function Summary:
- The function processes multiple inputs, each consisting of integers \(k\), \(x\), and \(a\).
- It calculates a value \(s\) starting from 1 and updating it \(x\) times using the formula \(s += s // (k - 1) + 1\).
- Finally, it prints 'YES' if \(a \geq s\), otherwise it prints 'NO'.

#### Analysis:
1. **Calculation of \(s\)**:
   - The variable \(s\) is initialized to 1.
   - It is updated \(x\) times using the formula \(s += s // (k - 1) + 1\).
   - This formula is intended to simulate the effect of consecutive losses on Sasha's betting strategy.

2. **Strategy Simulation**:
   - The formula \(s += s // (k - 1) + 1\) is designed to simulate the worst-case scenario where Sasha loses \(x\) times in a row.
   - Each time Sasha loses, the next bet size is calculated as \(s // (k - 1) + 1\).
   - This ensures that even in the worst-case scenario (consecutive losses), Sasha's remaining coins are tracked.

3. **Comparison with Initial Coins**:
   - The program checks if \(a \geq s\) and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.
   - If \(a \geq s\), it means Sasha can potentially achieve any number of coins \(n\) because he can afford to lose up to \(x\) times in a row without running out of coins.

#### Test Case Analysis:
- **Test Case 1**: \(k = 2\), \(x = 1\), \(a = 7\)
  - \(s = 1 + 1 // (2 - 1) + 1 = 3\)
  - Since \(7 \geq 3\), the program prints 'YES'.
  - This is correct because Sasha can afford to lose once and still have enough coins left to continue betting.

- **Test Case 2**: \(k = 2\), \(x = 1\), \(a = 1\)
  - \(s = 1 + 1 // (2 - 1) + 1 = 3\)
  - Since \(1 < 3\), the program prints 'NO'.
  - This is correct because Sasha cannot afford to lose once and still have enough coins left to continue betting.

- **Test Case 3**: \(k = 2\), \(x = 3\), \(a = 15\)
  - \(s = 1 + 1 // (2 - 1) + 1 = 3\)
  - \(s = 3 + 3 // (2 - 1) + 1 = 7\)
  - \(s = 7 + 7 // (2 - 1) + 1 = 15\)
  - Since \(15 \geq 15\), the program prints 'YES'.
  - This is correct because Sasha can afford to lose up to 3 times in a row and still have enough coins left to continue betting.

Based on the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine if Sasha can achieve any number of coins \(n\). The provided test cases and the function summary support this conclusion.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
