Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(x)`. The only variables involved here are `i` and `x`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `k` is set to the first integer entered.
   - `a` is set to the third integer entered.
   - `s` is `1 + 1 + 1 = 3`.
   - `x` must be a positive integer.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop is controlled by `x`, the value of `x` will determine if the loop can continue.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `x` must be a positive integer.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be greater than 0.

Given that `x` must be a positive integer for the loop to execute, and assuming it was a positive integer at the end of the previous iteration, the next iteration requires `x` to still be a positive integer.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `t` remains a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `k` remains the first integer entered.
- `a` remains the third integer entered.
- `s` remains `3`.
- `x` must still be a positive integer.

However, since we need to specify the exact state for the next iteration, we assume `x` is reduced by 1 (as each iteration decrements `x` by 1).

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `k` is the first integer entered, `a` is the third integer entered, `s` is 3, `x` is a positive integer and \(x > 0\)**.
