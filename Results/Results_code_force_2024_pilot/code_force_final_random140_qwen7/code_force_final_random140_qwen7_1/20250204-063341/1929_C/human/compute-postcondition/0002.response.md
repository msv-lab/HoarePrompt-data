Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is set to the first integer entered, `x` is set to the second integer entered, `a` is set to the third integer entered, `s` is 1.**

The code `s = 1` simply assigns the value 1 to the variable `s`. Since `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a` were not affected by this assignment, their values remain unchanged.
