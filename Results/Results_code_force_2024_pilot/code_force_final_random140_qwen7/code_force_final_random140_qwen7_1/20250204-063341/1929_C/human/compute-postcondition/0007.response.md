Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `k` is the first integer entered, `a` is the third integer entered, `s` is 4, `x` is a positive integer and \(x > 0\)**

Explanation: The value of `s` is updated by adding `s // (k - 1) + 1` to its current value. Given that `s` was initially 3, the new value of `s` is calculated as `3 + 3 // (k - 1) + 1`. Since `k` is an integer and `k - 1` is a positive integer (because \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\) and `k` is an integer), `3 // (k - 1)` will be 1 if `k` is 2, and 0 otherwise. Thus, `s` becomes 4. All other variables remain unchanged.
