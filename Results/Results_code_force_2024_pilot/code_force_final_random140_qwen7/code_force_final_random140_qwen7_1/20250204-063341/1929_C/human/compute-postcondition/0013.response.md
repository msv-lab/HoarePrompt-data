Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `k` is the first integer entered.
   - `a` is the third integer entered.
   - `s` is 6.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `x` is a positive integer and \(x > 2\).

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The value of `s` increases by `s // (k - 1) + 1` after each iteration.
   - Starting with `s = 1`, after the first iteration, `s` becomes 3.
   - After the second iteration, `s` becomes 4.
   - After the third iteration, `s` becomes 5.
   - Following the pattern, after the fourth iteration, `s` will become 6.
   - The variable `i` increments with each iteration, so after 3 iterations, `i` will be 2.
   - Since the loop runs `x` times and `x > 2`, it will execute at least 3 times and continue for one more iteration, making `i` eventually equal to 4.

3. **Final Values**:
   - After the loop, `s` will be 6.
   - `i` will be 4.
   - `a` remains the third integer entered.
   - `k` remains the first integer entered.

4. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement checks if `a` is greater than or equal to `s` (`a >= s`).
   - Given that `s` is 6, the condition `a >= s` will evaluate to `a >= 6`.

Since the exact value of `a` is not provided, we need to consider the general case where `a` is compared to 6.

**Output**: **YES** if `a` is greater than or equal to 6, otherwise **NO**.
