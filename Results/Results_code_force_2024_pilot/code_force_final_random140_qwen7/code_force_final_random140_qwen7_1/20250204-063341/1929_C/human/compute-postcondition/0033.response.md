Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(x)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `x`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 4
   - `x` must be greater than or equal to 0
   - `k` is an input integer (not involved in the loop head)
   - `s` is 2 (not involved in the loop head)
   - `a` is an input integer (not involved in the loop head)

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < x`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 4.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `i = 5`.
   - The value of `x` must remain the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 5, `x` must be greater than or equal to 5**
