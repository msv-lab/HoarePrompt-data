Output State: **`i` is 5, `x` must be greater than or equal to 5, `s` is `s + s // (k - 1) + 1`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `s` by adding `s // (k - 1) + 1` to it. However, the initial values or expressions for `s` and `k` are not provided. Since `s` is updated based on its current value and `k`, the updated value of `s` is expressed as `s + s // (k - 1) + 1`. The variables `i` and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states.
