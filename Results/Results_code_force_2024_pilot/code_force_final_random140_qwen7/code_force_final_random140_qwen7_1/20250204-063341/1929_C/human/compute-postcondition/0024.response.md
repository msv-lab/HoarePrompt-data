Output State: The value of `s` will be 8, and `i` will be 3.

Explanation: Given the pattern from the provided outputs, each iteration of the loop doubles the previous value of `s` and increments `i` by 1. After the first iteration, `s` becomes `s // (k - 1) + 1`. After the second iteration, `s` becomes `2 * (s // (k - 1) + 1)`. Following this pattern, after the third iteration, `s` becomes `4 * (s // (k - 1) + 1) = 4`, as given. Continuing this pattern, after all iterations, `s` would be `8 * (s // (k - 1) + 1) = 8`, and `i` would be incremented to 3.
