Output State: **`s` is equal to 4, `i` is 1**

Explanation: Initially, `s` is equal to `2 * (s // (k - 1) + 1)`. Given that `s` is defined in terms of itself, let's assume the initial value of `s` is calculated as follows: if `k` is 2 (a common simple case), then `s // (k - 1) + 1` would be `s // 1 + 1`, which simplifies to `s + 1`. So, `s` would be `2 * (s + 1)`. Solving this equation, we get `s = 2 * s + 2`, which simplifies to `-s = 2` or `s = -2`. However, since `s` is typically a positive integer in such contexts, let's consider `k` to be 3 for simplicity, making `s // (k - 1) + 1` equal to `s // 2 + 1`. This would mean `s` is initially set to `2 * (s // 2 + 1)`, which simplifies to `s = 2 * (s // 2 + 1)`. If `s` is 2, then `s // 2 + 1` is 2, and `s` becomes 4. After the code executes `s += s // (k - 1) + 1`, if `k` is 3, then `s // (k - 1) + 1` is 2, and `s` becomes `4 + 2`, which is 6. However, given the initial condition and typical problem constraints, `s` is likely to be 4 after the first assignment and increment. Therefore, the final state is `s` is equal to 4, and `i` remains 1.
