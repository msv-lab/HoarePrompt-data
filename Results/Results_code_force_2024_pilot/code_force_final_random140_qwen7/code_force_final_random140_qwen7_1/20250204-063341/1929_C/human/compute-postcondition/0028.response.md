Output State: **`s` is 16, `i` is 4, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer**

The code `k, x, a = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `k`, `x`, and `a`. Since the input values are not specified, they are represented as `input integer`. The initial values of `s` and `i` remain unchanged.
