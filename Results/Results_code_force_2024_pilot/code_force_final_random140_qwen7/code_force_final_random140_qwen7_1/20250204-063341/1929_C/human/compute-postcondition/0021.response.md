Output State: **`s` is equal to `2 * (s // (k - 1) + 1)`, `i` is 0**

Explanation: Initially, `s` is set to `s // (k - 1) + 1`. After executing `s += s // (k - 1) + 1`, `s` is updated to its current value plus `s // (k - 1) + 1`. Given that `s` was initially `s // (k - 1) + 1`, adding `s // (k - 1) + 1` to `s` results in `2 * (s // (k - 1) + 1)`. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 0.
