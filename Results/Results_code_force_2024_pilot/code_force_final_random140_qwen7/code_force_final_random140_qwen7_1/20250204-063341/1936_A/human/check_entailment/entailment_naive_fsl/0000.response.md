Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program does not handle the interaction part properly and does not guarantee that it will find the indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized within the allowed number of queries.

Here's why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Query Handling**: The program uses `func_1` to compare the results of bitwise OR operations but does not correctly process the responses to determine the optimal indices. The program assumes that after finding the initial candidate (`ans1`), it can directly find the maximum XOR pair from the remaining elements. However, this approach does not guarantee that the maximum XOR pair is found within the constraints.

2. **Incomplete Logic**: The program does not ensure that it explores all possible pairs of indices to find the maximum XOR. It only considers a subset of indices and does not systematically check all pairs, which is necessary to guarantee finding the maximum XOR.

3. **Potential Missed Cases**: The program might miss the optimal pair if it does not explore all possible combinations of indices. For example, consider a permutation where the maximum XOR is achieved by indices that are not part of the initial set of candidates.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and thus is incorrect.
