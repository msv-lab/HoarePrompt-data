Postcondition: `num_iterations` is the user input minus 1, `b` is a list containing the element `lit[i]` if the last element of `a` is less than `lit[i]`, otherwise it remains unchanged, `s` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` followed by `lit[i]` if the last element of `a` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, otherwise it is a list containing only the first element of `lit`, `lit` is a list of integers created from user input, `cp` is 0, and `i` is `i + 1`.
