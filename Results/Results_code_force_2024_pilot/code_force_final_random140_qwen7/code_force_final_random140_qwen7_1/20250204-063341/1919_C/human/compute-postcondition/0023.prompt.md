Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `n` is the integer input between 1 and \(10^4\), `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit`, `b` is an empty list, `cp` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if a[-1] < lit[i]:
        b.append(lit[i])
    else:
        a.append(lit[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers, and `b` is a list with one additional element. If the last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i` in the list `lit`, then the additional element in `b` is equal to `lit[i]`. If the last element of `a` is equal to `lit[i]`, then the additional element in `b` is also equal to `lit[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a list of integers. If the last element of `a` is less than `lit[2]`, then `b` is a list with one additional element containing the integer at index 2 of list `a`. Otherwise, `a` is a list with the element from `lit[2]` appended to it, and `b` is a list with one additional element.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 3. If the last element of array `a` is less than `lit[3]`, then `b` contains the element `lit[3]`. Otherwise, `a` contains the element `lit[3]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
