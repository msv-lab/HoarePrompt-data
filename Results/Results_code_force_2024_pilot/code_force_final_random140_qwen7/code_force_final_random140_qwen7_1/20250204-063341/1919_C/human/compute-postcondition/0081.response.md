Output State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `num_iterations` remains the user input minus 1, `b` is a list containing all elements from `lit` that are greater than the last element of `a`, `s` is still 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` contains the first element of `lit` and any subsequent elements from `lit` that are greater than or equal to the last element of `a`, `lit` is a list of integers created from user input, `cp` is 0, and `i` is `n`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `b` will contain all the elements from `lit` that were found to be greater than the last element added to list `a` during each iteration. The list `a` will contain the initial element of `lit` and any additional elements from `lit` that were greater than or equal to the last element in `a`. The variable `num_iterations` will still be the user input minus one, `s` will remain 0, `n` will be greater than 1, `lit` will be unchanged, `cp` will still be 0, and `i` will be equal to `n` (since the loop increments `i` until it reaches `n`).
