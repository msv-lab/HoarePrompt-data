Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is `len(b) - 1`
   - `len(b)` is a valid integer greater than or equal to 1
   - If `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `s` remains unchanged.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(1, len(b)):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop starts with `i = 1` and increments `i` by 1 until `i` is less than `len(b)`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `len(b) - 1`.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be set to `1` (the starting value of the loop).
   - Since `i` was `len(b) - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` should be `1`.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `i` needs to be set to `1`.
   - `len(b)` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.
   - The postcondition about `s` being incremented or not based on the comparison `b[i] > b[i - 1]` does not affect the loop head directly.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

**State: **`i` is 1, `len(b)` is a valid integer greater than or equal to 1**
