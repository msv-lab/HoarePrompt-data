Output State: **`i` is 2; `n` is greater than or equal to 2; `a` is a list of integers; `b` is a list with one additional element containing the integer at index 2 of list `a`.**

Explanation: The code appends the element at index `i` (which is 2) of list `a` to list `b`. Since `i` is 2, `b` gains an additional element which is the third element of list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial state.
