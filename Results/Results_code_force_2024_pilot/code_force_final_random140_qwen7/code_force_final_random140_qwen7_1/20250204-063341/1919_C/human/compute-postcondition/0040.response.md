Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `a` will contain the elements of `lit` in non-decreasing order, `b` will contain all elements from `lit` that are strictly greater than the last element of `a`, and `s` will be the count of elements in `a` where each element is greater than its predecessor.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, the variable `i` will have the value of the total number of elements in the list `a`. The list `a` will be sorted in non-decreasing order. The list `b` will include all elements from the original list `lit` that are strictly greater than the last element in the sorted list `a`. The variable `s` will hold the count of elements in `a` that are greater than their preceding elements.
