Output State: **`i` is 3; `a` contains the element `lit[3]`**

Explanation: The code `a.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `a`. Given that `i` is 3, `a` will contain the element `lit[3]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and the condition that `n` is greater than or equal to 2 is still valid but not affected by the code.
