Output State: **`lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `n` is the integer input between 1 and \(10^4\), `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit`, `b` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes two lists, `a` and `b`. `a` is set to contain the first element of the list `lit` (which is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers), and `b` is initialized as an empty list. The values of `lit` and `n` remain unchanged.
