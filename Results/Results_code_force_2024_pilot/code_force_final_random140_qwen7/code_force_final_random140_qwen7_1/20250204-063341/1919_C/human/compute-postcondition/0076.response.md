Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values at the start of the loop**:
   - `i` starts from 1 (since the loop is defined as `for i in range(1, n)`).
   - `n` is greater than 1.

3. **Analyze the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `num_iterations` is the user input minus 1.
   - `b` is a list containing elements based on a condition involving `a[-1]` and `lit[i]`.
   - `s` is 0.
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `a` is a list based on conditions involving `a[-1]` and `lit[i]`.
   - `lit` is a list of integers created from user input.
   - `cp` is 0.
   - `i` is `i + 1` (implying `i` was incremented in the previous iteration).

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented in the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must still be less than `n`.

Given these points, let's update the states:

- `i` will be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.
- `n` remains the same as it was not modified in the loop body.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`num_iterations` is the user input minus 1, `b` is a list containing the element `lit[i]` if `a[-1]` is less than `lit[i]`, `s` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` followed by `lit[i]` if the last element of `a` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, otherwise it is a list containing only the first element of `lit`, `lit` is a list of integers created from user input, `cp` is 0, and `i` is `i + 2`**.
