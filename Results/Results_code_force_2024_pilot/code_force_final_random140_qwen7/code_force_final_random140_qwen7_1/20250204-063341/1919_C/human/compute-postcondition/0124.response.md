Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, and the last element of `a` is now greater than or equal to `lit[1]`; `a` has an additional element which is `lit[1]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `lit[i]` to the list `a`. Given that `i` is 1, `a` now has its last element as `lit[1]`. The conditions for `i`, `n`, and the relationship between the last element of `a` and `lit[i]` remain unchanged.
