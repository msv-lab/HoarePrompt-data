Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 2
   - `a` is a list of integers
   - The postcondition states that if the last element of `a` is less than `lit[2]`, then `b` is a list with one additional element containing the integer at index 2 of list `a`. Otherwise, `a` is a list with the element from `lit[2]` appended to it, and `b` is a list with one additional element.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1`.

3. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 3.

4. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.
   - Since `n` is greater than or equal to 2, and `i` will become 3, the condition `i < n` will depend on the value of `n`.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - We need to adjust the state of `i` to reflect its new value after the increment.
   - We do not need to adjust the state of `n` because the problem does not indicate that `n` changes within the loop.
   - The state of `a` and `b` remains unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is:

**State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 2**
