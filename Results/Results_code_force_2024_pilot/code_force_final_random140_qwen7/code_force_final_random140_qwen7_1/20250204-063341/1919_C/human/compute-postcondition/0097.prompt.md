Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `num_iterations` remains the user input minus 1, `b` is a list containing all elements from `lit` that are greater than the last element of `a`, `s` is still 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` contains the first element of `lit` and any subsequent elements from `lit` that are greater than or equal to the last element of `a`, `lit` is a list of integers created from user input, `cp` is 0, and `i` is `n`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(a)):
    if a[i] > a[i - 1]:
        s += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `total` is 0, `b` is a list containing all elements from `lit` that are greater than the last element of `a`, `s` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `a` contains the first element of `lit` and any subsequent elements from `lit` that are greater than or equal to the last element of `a`, `lit` is a list of integers created from user input, `cp` is 0, and `i` is `n`. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`, then `s` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the values remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `total` is 0, `b` is a list containing all elements from `lit` that are greater than the last element of `a`, `s` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `a` contains the first element of `lit` and any subsequent elements from `lit` that are greater than or equal to the last element of `a`, `lit` is a list of integers created from user input, `cp` is 0, and `i` is `n + 1`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `total` is 0, `b` is a list containing all elements from `lit` that are greater than the last element of `a`, `s` is 3, `n` is greater than 1, `a` contains the first element of `lit` and any subsequent elements from `lit` that are greater than or equal to the last element of `a`, `lit` is a list of integers created from user input, `cp` is 0, and `i` is `n + 2`. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`, then `s` is set to 3. Otherwise, no change is made to the variables.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
