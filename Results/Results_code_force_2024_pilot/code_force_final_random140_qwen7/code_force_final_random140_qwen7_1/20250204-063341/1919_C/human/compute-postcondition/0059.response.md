Output State: **`num_iterations` is the user input - 1, `b` is a list containing elements from `lit` that are strictly greater than the last element of `a`, `s` is the count of elements in `b` where each element is greater than the previous one, `n` is an input integer, `lit` is a list of integers created from user input.**

Explanation: The code `lit = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes user input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in the list `lit`. The other variables (`num_iterations`, `b`, `s`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
