Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `num_iterations` is the user input minus 1.
   - `b` is either an empty list or a list containing the element `lit[i]`.
   - `s` is 0.
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` followed by `lit[i]` if the last element of `a` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, otherwise it is a list containing only the first element of `lit`.
   - `lit` is a list of integers created from user input.
   - `cp` is 0.
   - The last element of `a` is either less than or greater than or equal to `lit[i]`.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop condition is `i < n`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become `i + 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` becomes `i + 1`.
   - `n` remains the same (greater than 1).

6. **Other States Remain Unchanged**: The other states (`num_iterations`, `b`, `s`, `a`, `lit`, `cp`) do not change based on the loop head variables alone.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`num_iterations` is the user input minus 1, `b` is either an empty list or a list containing the element `lit[i]`, `s` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` followed by `lit[i]` if the last element of `a` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, otherwise it is a list containing only the first element of `lit`, `lit` is a list of integers created from user input, `cp` is 0, and `i` is `i + 1`**.
