Output State: **`i` is 0, `s` is 0, `b` contains at least two elements, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `lit = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual strings based on spaces, converts each of these strings to integers, and stores them in a list called `lit`. The variables `i` and `s` remain unchanged with their initial values of 0, and `b` is mentioned to contain at least two elements, which remains true unless otherwise modified.
