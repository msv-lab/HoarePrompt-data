Output State: **`i` is 3; `b` contains the element `lit[3]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the element at index `i` of list `lit` to list `b`. Given that `i` is 3, `b` will now contain the element at index 3 of `lit`. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and the condition that `n` is greater than or equal to 2 is still valid.
