Postcondition: `num_iterations` is the user input - 1, `b` is either a list containing the element `lit[i]` or an empty list, `s` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` followed by `lit[i]` if the last element of `a` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, otherwise `b` contains the element `lit[i]`, and `cp` is 0.
