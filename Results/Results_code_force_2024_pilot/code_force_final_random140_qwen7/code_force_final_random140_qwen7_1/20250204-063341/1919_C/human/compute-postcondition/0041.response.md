Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `len(b)`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i` and `len(b)`**:
   - From the problem statement, after the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`.
   - The loop starts with `i` set to 1 (since the loop runs from `1` to `len(b)`).
   - Therefore, `i` must start at 1 for the loop to begin executing.

3. **Determine the State of `b`**:
   - `b` contains all elements from `lit` that are strictly greater than the last element of `a`.
   - For the loop to execute, `b` must have at least one element because the loop runs from `1` to `len(b)`. If `b` is empty, the loop will not execute.

4. **Combine the Conditions**:
   - `i` must start at 1.
   - `b` must have at least one element.

Given these conditions, the state before the loop starts should be:

State: **`i` is 1, `b` must have at least one element**
