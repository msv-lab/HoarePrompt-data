Output State: **`i` is 2; `b` contains the element `lit[2]`.**

Explanation: The code `b.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `b`. Given that `i` is 2, `b` will contain the element `lit[2]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 2, and the condition that `n` must be greater than 1 is still valid but not directly affected by the code.
