Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers, and `b` is a list with one additional element. If the last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i` in the list `lit`, then the additional element in `b` is equal to `lit[i]`. If the last element of `a` is equal to `lit[i]`, then the additional element in `b` is also equal to `lit[i]`.
