Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: The initial state given is `i` is 0.

3. **Determine the Condition for the Loop to Execute**: The loop `for i in range(1, n)` will start when `i` is 1 and continue as long as `i < n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `i` must be 1 or more, and `n` must be greater than 1.

4. **Adjust the State**: Since `i` starts at 0, it needs to be adjusted to 1 for the loop to start executing. Additionally, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to proceed.

5. **Consider Other Variables**: The other variables (`s`, `b`, `a`, and `cp`) are not part of the loop head and do not affect the condition for the loop to execute.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
