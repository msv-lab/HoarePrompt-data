Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, len(b))`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `s` is increased by 1.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for values of `i` starting from 1 up to but not including `len(b)`.

4. **Check if the loop can execute again**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `len(b)`.
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 2, and `len(b)` must be greater than 2.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` needs to be 2.
   - `s` is increased by 1, so it remains as it was in the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 2, `s` is increased by 1**.
