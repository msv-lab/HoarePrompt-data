Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case contains an integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    lit = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a, b = [lit[0]], []
    cp = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        if a[-1] < lit[i]:
            b.append(lit[i])
        else:
            a.append(lit[i])
    s = 0
    for i in range(1, len(a)):
        if a[i] > a[i - 1]:
            s += 1
    for i in range(1, len(b)):
        if b[i] > b[i - 1]:
            s += 1
    print(s)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be equal to the length of `b`, `b` will contain all elements from `lit` that are strictly greater than the last element of `a`, and `s` will be the count of elements in `b` where each element is greater than its predecessor.

In natural language: The final state of the loop will have `i` equal to the length of `b`, indicating that the loop has iterated through all elements of `b`. The list `b` will consist of all elements from `lit` that are strictly greater than the last element of `a`. The variable `s` will hold the count of elements in `b` where each element is greater than the previous one.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is equal to the length of `b`, `s` is incremented each time `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]` for every iteration of the loop, and `b` contains at least two elements.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `len(b) - 1`, `s` is the total count of indices `i` (from 1 to `len(b) - 1`) where `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
