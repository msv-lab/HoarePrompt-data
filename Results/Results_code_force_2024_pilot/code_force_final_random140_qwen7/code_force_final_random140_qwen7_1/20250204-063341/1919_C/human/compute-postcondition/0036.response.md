Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and the list `a`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `len(a) - 1` because `i` starts at `1` and increments by `1` each iteration.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**: 
   - `i` is `2`.
   - `a` is a list with at least one element.
   - `s` is `1`.

4. **Determine the Next Value of `i`**: Since `i` starts at `1` and increments by `1` each iteration, if `i` is currently `2`, it will increment to `3` in the next iteration.

5. **Check the List Condition**: For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `len(a)`. Since `i` is `2` now, the loop will continue as long as `len(a)` is greater than `2`.

6. **Adjust the State**: We need to update the value of `i` to `3` and ensure that `a` still has at least one element (which it does, as stated in the postcondition). The value of `s` remains unchanged as there is no modification to `s` within the loop body based on the given conditions.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 3, `a` is a list with at least one element, `s` is 1**
