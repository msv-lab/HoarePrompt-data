Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers where the last element is less than the second element of `lit`, `b` is a list containing the element `lit[1]`.**

Explanation: The code appends `lit[i]` to the list `b`. Given that `i` is 1, `b` will contain `lit[1]`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
