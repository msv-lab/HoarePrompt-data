Output State: **`num_iterations` is the user input - 1, `b` is an empty list, `s` is the count of elements in `b` where each element is greater than the previous one (which is 0 since `b` is empty), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit`, `lit` is a list of integers created from user input.**

Explanation:
- `a` is initialized as a list containing the first element of `lit`.
- `b` is initialized as an empty list.
- `s` remains unchanged as it is based on the condition that each element in `b` is greater than the previous one, which is true only if `b` is empty, hence `s` is 0.
- `num_iterations` and `n` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet.
