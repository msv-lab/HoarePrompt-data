Output State: **`num_iterations` is the user input - 1, `b` is a list containing elements from `lit` that are strictly greater than the last element of `a`, `s` is the count of elements in `b` where each element is greater than the previous one, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the user's input (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. The values of `num_iterations`, `b`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial state.
