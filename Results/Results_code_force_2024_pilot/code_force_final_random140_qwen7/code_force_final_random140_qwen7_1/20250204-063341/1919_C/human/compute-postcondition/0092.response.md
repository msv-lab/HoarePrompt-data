Postcondition: **`total` is 0, `b` is a list containing all elements from `lit` that are greater than the last element of `a`, `s` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `a` contains the first element of `lit` and any subsequent elements from `lit` that are greater than or equal to the last element of `a`, `lit` is a list of integers created from user input, `cp` is 0, and `i` is `n + 1`**.

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the if-else block executes. Since the else part is not provided, it is assumed that the if condition is always true, leading to the postcondition of the if part.
