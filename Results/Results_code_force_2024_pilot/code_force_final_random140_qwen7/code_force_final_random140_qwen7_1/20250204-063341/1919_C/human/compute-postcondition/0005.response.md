Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(1, n):`.
   - The variables involved in this loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values:**
   - `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.
   - `n` is an integer input between 1 and \(10^4\).
   - `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit`.
   - `b` is an empty list.
   - `cp` is 0.

3. **Analyze the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.
   - Initially, `i` is set to 1 (since `range(1, n)` starts from 1).

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since the loop starts with `i = 1`, we need to ensure that `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute.
   - The values of `lit`, `a`, `b`, and `cp` do not affect the loop condition directly and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be 1.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**
