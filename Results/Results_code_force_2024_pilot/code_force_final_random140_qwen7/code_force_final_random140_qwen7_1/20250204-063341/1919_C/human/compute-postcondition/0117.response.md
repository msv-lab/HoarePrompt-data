Output State: **`i` is 0, `s` is 0, `b` is a list with at least one element, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit`, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `b` is an empty list.**

Explanation: 
- The initial state had `i` as 0, `s` as 0, `b` as a list with at least two elements, and `lit` as a list of integers.
- The code assigns the first element of `lit` to `a` and an empty list to `b`.
- Therefore, `a` now contains the first element of `lit`, and `b` is now an empty list. The values of `i` and `s` remain unchanged.
