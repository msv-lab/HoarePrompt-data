Postcondition: `i` is 2, `a` is a list with at least one element, and `s` is 1. If `a[2]` is greater than `a[1]`, then the postcondition remains the same. If `a[2]` is not greater than `a[1]`, then the postcondition also remains the same since there is no else part that changes the values of the variables.
