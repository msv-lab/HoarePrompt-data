Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is greater than 1, `a` contains all elements from `lit` that are greater than or equal to the last element of `a`, and `b` contains all elements from `lit` that are strictly greater than the last element of `a`**.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop increments `i` from 1 to `n-1`. The list `a` will contain all elements from the list `lit` that are greater than or equal to the last element added to `a` during the loop's execution. Similarly, the list `b` will contain all elements from `lit` that are strictly greater than the last element added to `a` during the loop's execution.
