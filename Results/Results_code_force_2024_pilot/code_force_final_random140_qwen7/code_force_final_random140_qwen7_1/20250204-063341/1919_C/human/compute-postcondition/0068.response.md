Output State: **`num_iterations` is the user input - 1, `b` is an empty list, `s` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` followed by `lit[i]`, `lit` is a list of integers created from user input, `cp` is 0, and the last element of `a` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `a.append(lit[i])` appends the value of `lit[i]` to the list `a`. Initially, `a` contains only the first element of `lit`. After appending `lit[i]`, `a` now contains the first element of `lit` followed by `lit[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
