Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `b`.

2. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is within the range defined by `range(1, len(b))`. This means `i` should be less than `len(b)`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `b` must have at least one element
   - If `b[i]` (which is `b[1]`) is greater than `b[i - 1]` (which is `b[0]`), then `s` is 1. Otherwise, the values of `i`, `b`, and `s` remain unchanged.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, the next value of `i` will be 2 (because the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration).
   - For the loop to continue, `b` must still have at least one element, but since `b` is a list, having at least one element is already satisfied by the current state.
   - We need to check the condition `b[i] > b[i - 1]` to determine the value of `s`. At the end of the previous iteration, `b[1]` (the current value of `b[i]`) was compared with `b[0]` (the current value of `b[i - 1]`). If this condition was true, `s` would be 1; otherwise, it remains unchanged.

Since the exact values of `b` and `s` are not specified, we assume the worst-case scenario where the condition `b[i] > b[i - 1]` is not met (to ensure the loop continues based on the given conditions).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `i` is 2
- `b` must have at least one element
- `s` remains unchanged

Given that `s` remains unchanged, we do not have a specific value for `s` unless it was explicitly set to 1 in the previous iteration. However, since the problem does not provide the initial value or the result of the comparison, we can only state that `s` remains unchanged.

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is 2, `b` must have at least one element, and `s` remains unchanged**.
