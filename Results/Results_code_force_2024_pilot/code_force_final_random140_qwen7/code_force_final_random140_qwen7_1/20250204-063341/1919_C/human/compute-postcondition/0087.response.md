Postcondition: `total` is 0, `b` is a list containing all elements from `lit` that are greater than the last element of `a`, `s` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `a` contains the first element of `lit` and any subsequent elements from `lit` that are greater than or equal to the last element of `a`, `lit` is a list of integers created from user input, `cp` is 0, and `i` is `n`. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`, then `s` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the values remain as they were before the if-else block executes.
