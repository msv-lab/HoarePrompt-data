Output State: **`i` is 0, `s` is 0, `b` is an empty list, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit`, `cp` is 0**.

Explanation: The code initializes `cp` to 0. Since `i`, `s`, `b`, and `a` were already defined before this line, their values remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` is still 0, `s` is still 0, `b` remains an empty list, `a` contains the first element of `lit`, and `cp` is now set to 0.
