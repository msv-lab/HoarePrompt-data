Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Postcondition: `total` is 0, `b` is a list containing all elements from `lit` that are greater than the last element of `a`, `s` is equal to the length of `a` - 1, `n` is greater than 1, `a` contains the first element of `lit` and any subsequent elements from `lit` that are greater than or equal to the last element of `a`, `lit` is a list of integers created from user input, `cp` is 0, and `i` is the length of `a`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(b)):
    if b[i] > b[i - 1]:
        s += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `b` must contain at least 2 elements, and either `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]` in which case `s` is 1, or there is no else part since the list does not provide an alternative condition.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `b` contains at least 2 elements, if `b[2]` is greater than `b[1]`, then `s` is 1. If `b[2]` is not greater than `b[1]`, `s` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 3, `b` contains at least 2 elements, and `s` is 1 if `b[3]` is greater than `b[2]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
