### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Storage**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `a`.
   - These values are stored in a list of dictionaries called `test_cases`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` processes each test case:
     - It initializes a frequency dictionary `freq` to keep track of the occurrences of `(mod_x, mod_y)` pairs.
     - It iterates through each element `num` in the array `a` and calculates its modulus with respect to `x` and `y`.
     - It then calculates the required modulus values (`required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y`) that would make the pair beautiful.
     - If the required modulus pair exists in the frequency dictionary, it adds the count of such pairs to `beautiful_count`.
     - It updates the frequency dictionary with the current `(mod_x, mod_y)` pair.
   - After processing all elements in the array, it appends the `beautiful_count` to the results list.

3. **Modulus Calculations**:
   - The program correctly calculates `mod_x` as `num % x` and `mod_y` as `num % y`.
   - The required modulus `required_mod_x` is calculated as `(x - mod_x) % x`, which ensures that `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x`.
   - The required modulus `required_mod_y` remains `mod_y`, ensuring that `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`.

4. **Frequency Dictionary**:
   - The frequency dictionary `freq` is used to count the occurrences of each `(mod_x, mod_y)` pair.
   - This helps in efficiently determining how many pairs satisfy the conditions for being beautiful.

5. **Final Results**:
   - The program correctly computes the number of beautiful pairs for each test case and stores the results in the `results` list.
   - The results are printed in the correct order corresponding to each test case.

### Conclusion:
Based on the detailed analysis of the code and the annotated version, the program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array. The original assessment accurately describes the functionality and correctness of the program.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
