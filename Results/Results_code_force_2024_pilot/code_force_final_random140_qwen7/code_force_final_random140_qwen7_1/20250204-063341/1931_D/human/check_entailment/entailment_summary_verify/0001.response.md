### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input and Storing Test Cases:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `x`, and `y`, and the array `a`.
   - It stores these values in a list of dictionaries called `test_cases`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The function `func_1` processes each test case:
     - It initializes a frequency dictionary `freq` to keep track of the occurrences of `(mod_x, mod_y)` pairs.
     - It iterates through each element `num` in the array `a` and calculates its modulus with respect to `x` and `y`.
     - It then calculates the required modulus values (`required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y`) that would make the pair beautiful.
     - If the required modulus pair exists in the frequency dictionary, it adds the count of such pairs to `beautiful_count`.
     - It updates the frequency dictionary with the current `(mod_x, mod_y)` pair.

3. **Correctness of Modulus Calculations:**
   - The calculation of `required_mod_x` is correct: `(x - mod_x) % x`. This ensures that `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x`.
   - The calculation of `required_mod_y` is correct: `mod_y`. This ensures that `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`.

4. **Updating Frequency Dictionary:**
   - The frequency dictionary `freq` is updated correctly with each `(mod_x, mod_y)` pair encountered in the array.

5. **Counting Beautiful Pairs:**
   - The count of beautiful pairs is incremented correctly when the required modulus pair is found in the frequency dictionary.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the results for each test case as expected.

Given the logic and the implementation, the program appears to correctly implement the solution for finding beautiful pairs in the array. The original assessment was accurate.
