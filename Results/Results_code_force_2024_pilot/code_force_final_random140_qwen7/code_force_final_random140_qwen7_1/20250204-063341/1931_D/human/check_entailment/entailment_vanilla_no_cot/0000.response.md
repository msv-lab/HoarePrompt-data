Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array based on the given problem description. The function `func_1` iterates through each test case, calculates the necessary modular values, and uses a frequency dictionary to count the number of beautiful pairs efficiently. The logic for determining beautiful pairs is correctly implemented, and the overall structure of the program matches the requirements of the problem.
