Reasoning:
1. The program correctly defines the problem and processes each test case individually.
2. It uses a dictionary (`defaultdict`) to keep track of the frequency of elements based on their modulus with `x` and `y`.
3. For each element in the array, it calculates the required modulus values and checks if those values exist in the frequency dictionary. If they do, it increments the count of beautiful pairs.
4. The logic for calculating the required modulus values is correct:
   - `required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x`
   - `required_mod_y = mod_y`
5. The program iterates through each test case, calculates the number of beautiful pairs, and appends the result to the `results` list.
6. Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correct according to the problem description and the execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
