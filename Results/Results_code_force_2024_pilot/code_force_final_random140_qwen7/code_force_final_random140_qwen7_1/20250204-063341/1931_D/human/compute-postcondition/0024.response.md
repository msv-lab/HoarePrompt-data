Output State: **`freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1, and `beautiful_count` is updated to `beautiful_count + freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`, where `mod_y` is `num % y`, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, and `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`.**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` by 1. It also updates `beautiful_count` by adding `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` to its current value. The values of `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, and `required_mod_y` are defined based on the initial conditions provided. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
