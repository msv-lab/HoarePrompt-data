Output State: **`freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1, `mod_y` is num % y, `mod_x` is num % x, `beautiful_count` remains unchanged, `required_mod_x` is (x - mod_x) % x.**

Explanation: The code calculates `required_mod_x` as `(x - mod_x) % x`. Since `mod_x` is already defined as `num % x`, `required_mod_x` is now computed based on the current value of `mod_x`. The other variables remain unchanged.
