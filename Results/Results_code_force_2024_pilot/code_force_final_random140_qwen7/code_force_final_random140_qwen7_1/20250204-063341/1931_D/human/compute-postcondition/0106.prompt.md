Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for case in test_cases:
    n, x, y = case['params']
    a = case['array']
    freq = defaultdict(int)
    beautiful_count = 0
    for num in a:
        mod_x = num % x
        mod_y = num % y
        required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x
        required_mod_y = mod_y
        if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq:
            beautiful_count += freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]
        freq[mod_x, mod_y] += 1
    results.append(beautiful_count)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `results` now contains the current value of `beautiful_count`, `test_cases` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `x` remains unchanged, `y` remains unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, `freq` remains unchanged, and `beautiful_count` is updated to the latest count.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `beautiful_count` is the sum of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` for every pair `(mod_x, mod_y)` encountered in the list `a`, and `results` is appended with `beautiful_count`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `beautiful_count` is the sum of all increments it received during each iteration; `results` contains the count of iterations (which is `n`); `n` is `case['params'][0]`; `x` is `case['params'][1]`; `y` is `case['params'][2]`; `a` is the original list of numbers; `freq` is a defaultdict with default factory `int` containing counts of `(mod_x, mod_y)` pairs encountered throughout the loop; `mod_x` and `mod_y` are the last calculated modulus values for the last number processed in `a`; `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`; `required_mod_y` is the last calculated modulus value for `mod_y`; `results.append(beautiful_count)` has been executed, meaning `beautiful_count` is now added to the `results` list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
