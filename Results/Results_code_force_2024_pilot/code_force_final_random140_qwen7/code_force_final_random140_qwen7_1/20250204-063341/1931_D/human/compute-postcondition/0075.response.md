Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `num` and `a`.
2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `num` is the variable that will iterate over each element in the list `a`.
   - `a` is the list itself, which is given as `case['array']`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute for each element in the list `a`. Therefore, the list `a` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `num` is an iterator over `a`, it will start from the first element of `a` in the first iteration.
   - For the loop to execute, `a` must have at least one element.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `a` must have at least one element.
- `num` will start from the first element of `a`.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`beautiful_count` is 0, `results` is appended with the previous `beautiful_count`, `n` is `case['params'][0]`, `x` is `case['params'][1]`, `y` is `case['params'][2]`, `a` is a non-empty list, `freq` is a defaultdict with default factory `int` initialized**.
