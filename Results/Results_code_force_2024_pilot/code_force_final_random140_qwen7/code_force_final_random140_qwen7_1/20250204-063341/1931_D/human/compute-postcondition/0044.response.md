Output State: **`mod_x` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`; `mod_y` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`; `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `required_mod_x` as `(x - mod_x) % x`. This means that `required_mod_x` is the result of subtracting `mod_x` from `x` and then taking the modulus with `x`. The values of `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `num`, and `x` remain unchanged from the initial state.
