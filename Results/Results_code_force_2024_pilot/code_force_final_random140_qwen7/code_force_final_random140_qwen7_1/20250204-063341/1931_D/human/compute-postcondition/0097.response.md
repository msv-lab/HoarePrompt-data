Output State: **`num` is the next element in `a`, `mod_x` is updated to `num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`.**

Explanation: The line `required_mod_y = mod_y` simply assigns the value of `mod_y` to `required_mod_y`. No other changes occur to the variables. Therefore, the values of `num`, `mod_x`, and `mod_y` remain unchanged from their initial states, and `required_mod_y` now holds the same value as `mod_y`.
