Output State: **`beautiful_count` is 0, `test_cases` remains unchanged, `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]`, `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]`, `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]`, `a` is now `case['array']`, `freq` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`, `beautiful_count` is updated to the latest count, `case` is the next element in `test_cases`.**

Explanation: The code simply initializes `beautiful_count` to 0. This does not affect any other variables or their states. The values of `test_cases`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `freq`, and `beautiful_count` (which was already updated to the latest count) remain as they were in the initial state. The variable `case` is also expected to point to the next element in `test_cases`.
