Output State: **`freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1, `beautiful_count` is `beautiful_count + freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`**.

Explanation: The code increments `beautiful_count` by the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`. The values of `mod_y`, `mod_x`, `required_mod_x`, and `required_mod_y` remain unchanged from their initial values. The frequency count `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1.
