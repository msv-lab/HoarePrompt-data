Output State: **`results` now contains the current value of `beautiful_count`, `test_cases` remains unchanged, `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]`, `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]`, `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]`, `a` is now `case['array']`, `freq` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`, `beautiful_count` is updated to the latest count, `case` is the next element in `test_cases`.**

Explanation: The line `freq = defaultdict(int)` initializes a new dictionary-like object called `freq` where the default factory for missing keys is `int`. This means that if a key is accessed that does not exist in `freq`, it will automatically be created with a default value of `0`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
