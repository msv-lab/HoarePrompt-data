Output State: **`beautiful_count` is increased by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`, `mod_x` is updated to `num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`.**

Explanation: The code increments `beautiful_count` by the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`. The values of `mod_x`, `mod_y`, and `required_mod_y` remain unchanged from their previous states.
