Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `test_cases` is a non-empty list, `n` is `case['params'][0]`, `x` is `case['params'][1]`, `y` is `case['params'][2]`, `a` is `case['array']`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `case['array']` to the variable `a`. The values of `results`, `test_cases`, `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. Therefore, `results` is still an empty list, `test_cases` is a non-empty list, `n` is equal to `case['params'][0]`, `x` is equal to `case['params'][1]`, `y` is equal to `case['params'][2]`, and `a` is now assigned to `case['array']`.
