Output State: **`beautiful_count` is incremented by `freq[(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)] + 1`, `results` is appended with 0, `n` is `case['params'][0]`, `x` is `case['params'][1]`, `mod_x` is updated to `num % x`, `y` is `case['params'][2]`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `a` is a non-empty list, `freq` is a defaultdict with default factory `int` initialized, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`, `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1, `num` is the next element in `a`, `mod_y` is updated to `num % y`, `required_mod_y` is updated to `mod_y`, `beautiful_count` is incremented by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` if `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in `freq`, `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The line `freq[mod_x, mod_y] += 1` increments the value of `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
