Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for num in a:`. The objects involved here are `num` and `a`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `num`: This variable will take on each value from the list `a` during each iteration of the loop.
   - `a`: This is the list from which `num` will be taken.

3. **Understand the initial state before the loop**:
   - `beautiful_count` is 0.
   - `test_cases` remains unchanged.
   - `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]`.
   - `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]`.
   - `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]`.
   - `a` is now `case['array']`.
   - `freq` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`.
   - `beautiful_count` is updated to the latest count.
   - `case` is the next element in `test_cases`.

4. **Adjust the states for the loop to execute**:
   - Since `num` will take on each value from `a` during each iteration, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `a`. The loop can only execute if `a` is a non-empty list (i.e., it contains at least one element).
   - The other variables (`beautiful_count`, `test_cases`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `freq`, and `case`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `a` being a non-empty list.

**State:**
**`a` is a non-empty list**
