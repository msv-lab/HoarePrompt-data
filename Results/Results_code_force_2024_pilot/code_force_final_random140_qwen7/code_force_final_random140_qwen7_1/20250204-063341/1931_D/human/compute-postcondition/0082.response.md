Postcondition: **`beautiful_count` is incremented by `freq[(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)]`, `results` is appended with 0, `n` is `case['params'][0]`, `x` is `case['params'][1]`, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `y` is `case['params'][2]`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `a` is a non-empty list, `freq` is a defaultdict with default factory `int` initialized, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`, and if the pair `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` exists in `freq`, `beautiful_count` is updated accordingly.**
