Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop iterates over the elements in the list `a`. Therefore, the variables in the loop head are `num`, `a`, and the loop control variable `num`.

2. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `beautiful_count` is incremented by `freq[(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)] + 1`.
   - `results` is appended with 0.
   - `n` is `case['params'][0]`.
   - `x` is `case['params'][1]`.
   - `mod_x` is updated to `num % x`.
   - `y` is `case['params'][2]`.
   - `mod_y` is `num % y`.
   - `a` is a non-empty list.
   - `freq` is a defaultdict with default factory `int` initialized.
   - `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`.
   - `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`.
   - `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1.
   - `num` is the next element in `a`.
   - `mod_y` is updated to `num % y`.
   - `required_mod_y` is updated to `mod_y`.
   - `beautiful_count` is incremented by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` if `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in `freq`.
   - `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1.

3. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration:**
   - `num` will be the next element in `a`.
   - `mod_x` will be updated to `num % x`.
   - `mod_y` will be updated to `num % y`.
   - `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` will be incremented by 1.
   - `beautiful_count` will be incremented by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` if `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in `freq`.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the next iteration are:
- `num` will be the next element in `a`.
- `mod_x` will be updated to `num % x`.
- `mod_y` will be updated to `num % y`.
- `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` will be incremented by 1.
- `beautiful_count` will be incremented by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` if `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in `freq`.

However, since we are only asked to adjust the states based on the loop head, we focus on `num`, `mod_x`, and `mod_y`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`beautiful_count` is incremented by `freq[(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)] + 1`, `results` is appended with 0, `n` is `case['params'][0]`, `x` is `case['params'][1]`, `mod_x` is updated to `num % x`, `y` is `case['params'][2]`, `mod_y` is updated to `num % y`, `a` is a non-empty list, `freq` is a defaultdict with default factory `int` initialized, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`, `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1, `num` is the next element in `a`, `mod_y` is updated to `num % y`, `required_mod_y` is updated to `mod_y`, `beautiful_count` is incremented by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` if `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in `freq`, `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1.**

Since the question asks to focus only on the loop head variables, the relevant adjustments are:
- `num` is the next element in `a`.
- `mod_x` is updated to `num % x`.
- `mod_y` is updated to `num % y`.

Therefore, the final state adjustment for the next iteration is:
State: **`num` is the next element in `a`, `mod_x` is updated to `num % x`, `mod_y` is updated to `num % y`**.
