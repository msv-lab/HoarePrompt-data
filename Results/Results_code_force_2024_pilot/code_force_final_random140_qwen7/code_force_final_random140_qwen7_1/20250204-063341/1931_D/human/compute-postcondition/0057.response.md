Postcondition: **`num` is the next element from the list `a`, `beautiful_count` is increased by the size of the set `freq` that contains the tuple (`required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`), `mod_x` is `num % x`, `mod_y` is `required_mod_y`, `freq[mod_x, required_mod_y]` is incremented by 1, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `beautiful_count` is increased by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` if `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in `freq`.**
