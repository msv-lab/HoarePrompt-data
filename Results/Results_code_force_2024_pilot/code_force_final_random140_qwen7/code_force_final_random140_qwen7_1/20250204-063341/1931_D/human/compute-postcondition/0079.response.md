Output State: **`beautiful_count` is 0, `results` is appended with 0, `n` is `case['params'][0]`, `x` is `case['params'][1]`, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `y` is `case['params'][2]`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `a` is a non-empty list, `freq` is a defaultdict with default factory `int` initialized, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y**.

The code simply assigns the existing value of `mod_y` to `required_mod_y`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
