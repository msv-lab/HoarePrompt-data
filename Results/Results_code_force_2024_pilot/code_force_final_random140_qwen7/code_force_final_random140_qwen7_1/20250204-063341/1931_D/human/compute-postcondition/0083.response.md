Output State: **`beautiful_count` is incremented by `freq[(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)] + 1`, `results` is appended with 0, `n` is `case['params'][0]`, `x` is `case['params'][1]`, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `y` is `case['params'][2]`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `a` is a non-empty list, `freq` is a defaultdict with default factory `int` initialized, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`, and `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code increments the count of the key `(mod_x, mod_y)` in the dictionary `freq` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `beautiful_count` is updated by adding 1 to its previous value plus the value of `freq[(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)]`.
