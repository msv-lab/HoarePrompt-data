Output State: **`case` is the next element from `test_cases`, `beautiful_count` is the sum of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` for every pair `(mod_x, mod_y)` encountered in the list `a`, `results` is appended with `beautiful_count`, `n` is `case['params'][0]`, `x` is `case['params'][1]`, `y` is `case['params'][2]`, `a` is the value of `case['array']`, `freq` is a defaultdict with default factory `int` initialized.**

Explanation: The code initializes a `defaultdict` named `freq` with an integer default factory. This means that `freq` is now a dictionary that automatically assigns an integer value (0) to any key that does not yet exist when accessed. The values of other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
