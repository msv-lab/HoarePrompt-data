Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is the variable `case` from the `test_cases` list.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in `test_cases`.

3. **Determine the state adjustments needed**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `beautiful_count` is the sum of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` for every pair `(mod_x, mod_y)` encountered in the list `a`, and `results` is appended with `beautiful_count`.
   - For the next iteration, the loop will take the next element from `test_cases` and repeat the process.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `beautiful_count` will be recalculated based on the new `case` from `test_cases`.
   - `results` will be updated with the new `beautiful_count` value.
   - `case` will be the next element from `test_cases`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should include:
- `case` as the next element from `test_cases`.
- `beautiful_count` reset or recalculated based on the new `case`.
- `results` updated with the new `beautiful_count`.

Since we don't have specific values for `test_cases`, `a`, `freq`, `required_mod_x`, and `required_mod_y`, we'll keep the description general.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`case` is the next element from `test_cases`, `beautiful_count` is the sum of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` for every pair `(mod_x, mod_y)` encountered in the list `a`, and `results` is appended with `beautiful_count`**.
