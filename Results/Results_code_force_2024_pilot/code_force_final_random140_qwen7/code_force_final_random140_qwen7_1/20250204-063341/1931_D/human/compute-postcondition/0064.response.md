Output State: **`num` is the first element from the list `a`, `beautiful_count` is increased by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`**.

Explanation:
- The code increments `beautiful_count` by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`. Since `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x` and `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`, and `mod_x` is `num % x`, these values remain unchanged from their previous states.
- The value of `beautiful_count` is increased by the frequency of the tuple `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` in the dictionary `freq`.
- The values of `mod_x`, `required_mod_x`, and `required_mod_y` stay the same as they were before the execution of the code.
