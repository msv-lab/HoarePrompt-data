Output State: **`num` is the first element from the list `a`, `beautiful_count` is reset, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `mod_y` is now `num % y`, `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is 1, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `beautiful_count` is increased by `freq[required_mod_x, mod_y]` if `(required_mod_x, mod_y)` is in `freq`, `mod_x` is updated to `num % x, required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x**.

Explanation: The code calculates `required_mod_x` as `(x - mod_x) % x`. Since `mod_x` is already defined as `num % x`, `required_mod_x` is now `(x - (num % x)) % x`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
