Output State: **`num` is the first element from the list `a`, `beautiful_count` is reset, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `mod_y` is `required_mod_y`, `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is 1, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `beautiful_count` is increased by `freq[required_mod_x, mod_y]` if `(required_mod_x, mod_y)` is in `freq`, `mod_x` is updated to `num % x**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `mod_x` to be `num % x`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
