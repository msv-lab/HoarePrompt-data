Output State: **`case` is the next element from `test_cases`, `beautiful_count` is the sum of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` for every pair `(mod_x, mod_y)` encountered in the list `a`, `results` is appended with `beautiful_count`, `n` is `case['params'][0]`, `x` is `case['params'][1]`, `y` is `case['params'][2]`**.

This means that the variables `n`, `x`, and `y` have been assigned the values from `case['params']`, while the other variables (`case`, `beautiful_count`, `freq`, `required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`, `a`, and `results`) retain their previous states.
