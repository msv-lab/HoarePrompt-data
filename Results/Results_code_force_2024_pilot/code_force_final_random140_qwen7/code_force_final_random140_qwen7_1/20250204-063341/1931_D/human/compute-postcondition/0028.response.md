Output State: **`mod_y` is `num % y`, `freq[mod_y, mod_x]` is incremented by 1, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, and `beautiful_count` is updated to `beautiful_count + freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`.**

Explanation:
- The code calculates `required_mod_x` as `(x - mod_x) % x`.
- Since `mod_x` is `num % x`, `required_mod_x` is derived from `mod_x`.
- The values of `mod_y`, `freq[mod_y, mod_x]`, and `beautiful_count` remain unchanged from their initial states.
- The new state includes the calculation of `required_mod_x` based on the given formula.
