Output State: **`num` is the first element from the list `a`, `beautiful_count` is reset, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `mod_y` is now `num % y`, `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is 1, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `beautiful_count` is increased by `freq[required_mod_x, mod_y]` if `(required_mod_x, mod_y)` is in `freq`, `mod_x` is updated to `num % x`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y**.

Explanation: The line `required_mod_y = mod_y` simply assigns the current value of `mod_y` to `required_mod_y`. This does not change any other variables or their relationships. Therefore, the values of `num`, `beautiful_count`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `freq[mod_x, mod_y]`, `required_mod_x`, and `beautiful_count` remain unchanged, and `required_mod_y` is now just an alias for `mod_y`.
