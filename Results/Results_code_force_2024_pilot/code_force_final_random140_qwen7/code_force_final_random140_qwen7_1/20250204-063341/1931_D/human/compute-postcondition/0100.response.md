Postcondition: `num` is the next element in `a`, `mod_x` is updated to `num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`. If `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in `freq`, then `beautiful_count` is increased by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`. Otherwise, the values remain unchanged.
