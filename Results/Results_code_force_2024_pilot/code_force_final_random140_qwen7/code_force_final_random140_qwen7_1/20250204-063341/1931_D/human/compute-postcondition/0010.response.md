Output State: **`a` must contain at least one element; `mod_x` is calculated as `num % x`; `mod_y` is calculated as `num % y`; `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`; `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`**.

Explanation: The code simply assigns the value of `mod_y` to `required_mod_y`. No other variables are affected. The initial conditions for `mod_x`, `mod_y`, and `required_mod_x` remain unchanged.
