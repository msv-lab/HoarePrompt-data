Output State: **`num` is the first element from the list `a`, `beautiful_count` is reset, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `mod_y` is now `num % y`, `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is 1, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `beautiful_count` is increased by `freq[required_mod_x, mod_y]` if `(required_mod_x, mod_y)` is in `freq`, `mod_x` is updated to `num % x**.

Explanation: The code updates `mod_y` to `num % y`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. `mod_x` is already updated to `num % x` before this line of code is executed.
