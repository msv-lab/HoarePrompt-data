Output State: `results` is a list containing the `beautiful_count` value for each case in `test_cases` after all iterations of the loop have finished. Each element in `results` corresponds to the accumulated `beautiful_count` from one iteration of the loop over the respective `case['array']`. The variables `n`, `x`, `y`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial or last values before the loop started. The `freq` dictionary contains the counts of `(mod_x, mod_y)` pairs encountered throughout all iterations of the loop. The `beautiful_count` variable holds the final count of "beautiful" numbers across all arrays processed by the loop.
