Postcondition: `mod_y` is `num % y`, `freq[mod_y, mod_x]` is incremented by 1, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `beautiful_count` is updated to `beautiful_count + freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`. If the tuple `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is found in the dictionary `freq`, then `beautiful_count` is incremented by the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`.
