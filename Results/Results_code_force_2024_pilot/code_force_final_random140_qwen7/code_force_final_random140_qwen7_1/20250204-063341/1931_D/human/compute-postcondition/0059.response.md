Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `num` from the list `a`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in the list `a` to iterate over.

3. **Determine the state changes**:
   - `num` is the next element from the list `a`.
   - `beautiful_count` is updated based on the size of the set `freq` containing the tuple (`required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`).
   - `mod_x` is calculated as `num % x`.
   - `mod_y` is given as `required_mod_y`.
   - `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1.
   - `required_mod_x` is calculated as `(x - mod_x) % x`.
   - `beautiful_count` is further updated by adding `freq[required_mod_x, mod_y]` if `(required_mod_x, mod_y)` is in `freq`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `num` is the next element from the list `a`, it will be the first element of the list `a` for the next iteration.
   - All other states (like `beautiful_count`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, and `freq`) will be reset or updated based on the new `num`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `num` will be the first element of the list `a` for the next iteration.
   - `beautiful_count`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, and `freq` will be reset or updated based on the new `num`.

Given the above steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`num` is the first element from the list `a`, `beautiful_count` is reset, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `mod_y` is `required_mod_y`, `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is 1, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `beautiful_count` is increased by `freq[required_mod_x, mod_y]` if `(required_mod_x, mod_y)` is in `freq`**.
