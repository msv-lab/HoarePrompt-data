Output State: **`mod_y` is `num % y`, `freq[mod_y, mod_x]` is incremented by 1, and `beautiful_count` is updated to `beautiful_count + freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`, where `mod_x` is `num % x`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, and `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`**.

Explanation: The code calculates `mod_y` as `num % y`. This does not affect `mod_x`, `freq`, or `beautiful_count` directly, but it updates the state such that `mod_y` now holds the value of `num % y`. The other conditions and values remain unchanged from the initial state.
