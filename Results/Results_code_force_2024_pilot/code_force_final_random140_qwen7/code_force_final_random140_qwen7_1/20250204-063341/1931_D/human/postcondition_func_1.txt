The function reads input data from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` to compute results for these test cases. It then prints the results for each test case. The function does not return any explicit output but modifies internal states such as `test_cases` and `results`. The final state includes `results` containing computed values for at least three test cases.
