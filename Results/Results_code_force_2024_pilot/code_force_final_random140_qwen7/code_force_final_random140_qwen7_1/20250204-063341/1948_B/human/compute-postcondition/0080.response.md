Output State: **`i` is 1; `len(a)` is greater than 0; `c` contains the element `a[1]`; `n` is 1**

Explanation: The code `n = n + 1` increments the value of `n` by 1. Since `n` was not initialized before, it is assumed to be 0 initially. After executing the code, `n` becomes 1. All other variables (`i`, `len(a)`, and `c`) remain unchanged.
