Output State: **`i` is 1; `x` is an integer value which is the last digit of `a[1]`; `y` is 0; `c` is a list containing the elements 0 and `x`.**

The code `c.append(x)` adds the value of `x` to the list `c`. Initially, `c` contains only the element 0. After appending `x`, `c` now contains 0 and `x`. All other variables remain unchanged.
