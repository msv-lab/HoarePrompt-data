Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is an integer value which is the remainder of `a[1]` divided by 10, `y` is `a[1]` divided by 10 and converted to an integer, `c` is a list containing the value of `y` and `x`.**

Explanation: The code `c.append(x)` appends the value of `x` to the list `c`. Initially, `c` contains only the value of `y`. After appending `x`, `c` now contains both `y` and `x`. All other variables remain unchanged.
