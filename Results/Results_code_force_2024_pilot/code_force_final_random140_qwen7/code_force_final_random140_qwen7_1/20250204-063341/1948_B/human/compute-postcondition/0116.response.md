Output State: **`i` is equal to `len(a)`, `c` is a list containing elements processed from the list `a` according to the rules defined in the loop, `d` is a sorted version of `c`.**

Explanation: The code `d = sorted(c)` sorts the list `c` in ascending order and assigns the sorted list to `d`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the sorting operation. The list `c` retains its original elements but is now sorted, and `d` holds the sorted version of `c`.
