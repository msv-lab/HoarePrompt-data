Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is an integer value which is the last digit of `a[1]`, `y` is 0, `c` is a list containing the elements 0 and `x`, `n` is `n + 2`.**

Explanation: The code `n = n + 2` increments the value of `n` by 2. However, since the initial value of `n` is not specified, we only know that `n` is now `n + 2`. All other variables (`i`, `x`, `y`, and `c`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
