Postcondition: `i` is 1, `c` is a list containing either `a[1]` or both `a[1]` divided by 10 (integer division result) and the remainder of `a[1]` divided by 10, `n` is increased by either 2 or 1 depending on whether the integer division result is less than or equal to the remainder, and `len(a)` is greater than 0.
