Output State: **`i` is 0, `len(a)` is greater than 0, `a[i]` is greater than 10, and `x` is the last digit of `a[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `x = int(a[i] % 10)` calculates the last digit of `a[i]` and assigns it to `x`. Since `a[i]` is greater than 10, its last digit (which is stored in `x`) will be an integer between 0 and 9. The other variables remain unchanged.
