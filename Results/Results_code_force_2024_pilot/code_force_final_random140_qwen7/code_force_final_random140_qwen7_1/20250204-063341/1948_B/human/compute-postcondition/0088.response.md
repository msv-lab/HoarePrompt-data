Output State: **`i` is 2; `x` is an integer value equal to `a[2] % 10`; `y` is an integer value equal to `int(a[2] / 10)`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `a[i] / 10` to `y`, where `i` is 2. Therefore, `y` is the integer division result of `a[2]` by 10. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
