Output State: **`i` is 2; `x` is an integer value equal to `a[2] % 10`; `y` is an integer value equal to `int(a[2] / 10)'; `c` is a list with the element `a[2]`.**

Explanation: The code `c.append(a[i])` appends the value of `a[i]` to the list `c`. Given that `i` is 2, `a[i]` refers to `a[2]`. The values of `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. Therefore, `c` now contains the element `a[2]`.
