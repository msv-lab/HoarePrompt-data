Output State: **`i` is 2; `x` is an integer value equal to `a[2] % 10`; `y` is an integer value equal to `int(a[2] / 10)`, and `c` contains the values `[y, x]`.**

Explanation: The code `c.append(x)` appends the value of `x` to the list `c`. Initially, `c` contains the value of `y`. After appending `x`, `c` now contains both `y` and `x`. The values of `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
