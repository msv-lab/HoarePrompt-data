Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is an integer value which is the remainder of `a[1]` divided by 10, `y` is `a[1]` divided by 10 and converted to an integer, `c` is a list containing the element `a[i]`, `n` is `n + 1`.**

In this case, the code `n = n + 1` increments the value of `n` by 1. Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `n`, it is represented as `n` is `n + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
