Output State: **`i` is 1; `x` is an integer value which is the remainder of `a[1]` divided by 10.**

Explanation: The code assigns the remainder of `a[i]` divided by 10 to `x`. Since `i` is initially 1, `x` will be the remainder of `a[1]` divided by 10. The length of `a` being greater than 0 is still true, and `i` remains unchanged at 1.
