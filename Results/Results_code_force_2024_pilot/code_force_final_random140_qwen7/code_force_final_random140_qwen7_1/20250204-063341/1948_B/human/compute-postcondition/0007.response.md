Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `range(len(a))`. This means the loop will iterate over the indices of the list `a`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: For the loop to start executing, the variable `i` must be initialized to the starting index of the range, which is `0`.

3. **Determine the Condition for the Loop to Execute**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(a)`. Therefore, `i` must be less than the length of the list `a`.

4. **Adjust the States**: We need to ensure that `i` is set to `0` and `i` is less than `len(a)`.

Given these points, let's adjust the states accordingly:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `k` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each part to an integer.
- `x` is `0`.
- `y` is `0`.
- `n` is `0`.
- `c` is an empty list.

The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the condition `len(a)`, so we need to adjust `i` to `0` and ensure that `i < len(a)`.

**State:**
- `i` is `0`
- `len(a)` is greater than `0`

So, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is `0`, `len(a)` is greater than `0`**
