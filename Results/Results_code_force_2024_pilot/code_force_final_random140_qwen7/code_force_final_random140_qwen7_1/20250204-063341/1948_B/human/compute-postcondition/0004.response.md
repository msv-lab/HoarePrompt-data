Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each part to an integer, `x` is 0, `y` is 0**.

The code simply assigns the value `0` to the variable `y`. Since `t`, `k`, `a`, and `x` are not affected by this line of code, their states remain unchanged.
