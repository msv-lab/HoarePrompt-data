Output State: **`i` is 0, `len(a)` is greater than 0, `a[i]` is greater than 10, `x` is the last digit of `a[i]`, `y` is the integer part of `a[i]` divided by 10, and `y` is greater than `x`, `c` is a list containing the element `a[i]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the element `a[i]` to the list `c`. Since `a[i]` is greater than 10, its last digit (assigned to `x`) and the integer part when divided by 10 (assigned to `y`) remain unchanged. The condition that `y` is greater than `x` also remains valid. The length of `a` and the values of `i`, `x`, and `y` stay the same, but now `c` contains the element `a[i]`.
