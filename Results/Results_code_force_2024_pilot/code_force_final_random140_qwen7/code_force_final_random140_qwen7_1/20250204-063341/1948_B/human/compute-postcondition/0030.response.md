Postcondition: `i` is 0, `len(a)` is greater than 0, the first element of `a` is greater than 10, `y` is the first element of `a` divided by 10 and converted to an integer, the remainder of the first element of `a` divided by 10 is equal to `x`, and `n` is either 2 (if `y` is less than or equal to `x`) or `n + 1` (if `y` is greater than `x`). Additionally, `c` is appended with the first element of `a`.
