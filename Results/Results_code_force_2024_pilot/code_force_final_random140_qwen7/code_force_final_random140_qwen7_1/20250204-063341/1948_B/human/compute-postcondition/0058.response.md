Output State: **`i` is 1; `x` is an integer value which is the last digit of `a[1]`; `y` is 0**.

Explanation: The code `y = int(a[i] / 10)` divides the element at index `i` of list `a` by 10 and converts the result to an integer. Since `i` is 1, `a[i]` refers to `a[1]`. Dividing `a[1]` by 10 and converting it to an integer results in 0 because the last digit of `a[1]` (which `x` represents) is discarded in this operation, leaving only the integer part of the division, which is 0. The values of `i` and `x` remain unchanged.
