Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^3, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each part to an integer**.

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, a.split()))` splits the string `a` into parts based on spaces and then converts each part into an integer, storing the result in a list. The values of `t` and `k` remain unchanged.
