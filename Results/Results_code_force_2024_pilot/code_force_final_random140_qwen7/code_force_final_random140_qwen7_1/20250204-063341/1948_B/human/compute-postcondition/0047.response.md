Postcondition: `i` is 0, `len(a)` is greater than 0, `a[i]` is greater than 10, `x` is the last digit of `a[i]`, `y` is the integer part of `a[i]` divided by 10, and either `y` is less than or equal to `x`, in which case `c` is a list containing `y` and `x`, and `n` is 2; or `y` is greater than `x`, in which case `c` is a list containing `a[i]`, and `n` is 1.
