Output State: **`i` is 1; `x` is an integer value which is the last digit of `a[1]`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the last digit of the second element in list `a` (since `i` is 1, it refers to the first index) to the variable `x`. Since `len(a)` is greater than 0, `a` contains at least one element. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 1, and `x` is set to the integer value of the last digit of `a[1]`.
