Output State: **`i` is 1; `x` is an integer value which is the last digit of `a[1]`; `y` is 0; `c` is a list with the element `a[1]`.**

The code snippet `c.append(a[i])` appends the element `a[i]` to the list `c`. Given that `i` is 1, `c` now contains the element `a[1]`. The values of `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
