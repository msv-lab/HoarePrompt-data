Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is `n + 1`, the first element of `a` is greater than 10, `y` is the first element of `a` divided by 10 and converted to an integer, and the remainder of the first element of `a` divided by 10 is equal to `x`, and `y` is less than `c[n - 1]`; `c` is appended with the first element of `a`.**

Explanation: The variable `n` is incremented by 1, making `n` equal to `n + 1`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
