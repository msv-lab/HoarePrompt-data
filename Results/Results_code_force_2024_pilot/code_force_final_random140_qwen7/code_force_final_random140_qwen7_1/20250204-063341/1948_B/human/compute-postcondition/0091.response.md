Output State: **`i` is 2; `x` is an integer value equal to `a[2] % 10`; `y` is an integer value equal to `int(a[2] / 10)`, and `c` contains the values `[y, x]; n is n + 2**.

Explanation: The code `n = n + 2` increments the value of `n` by 2. Since the initial state of `n` is not specified, we only know that `n` is now `n + 2`. The values of `i`, `x`, `y`, and `c` remain unchanged from their initial states.
