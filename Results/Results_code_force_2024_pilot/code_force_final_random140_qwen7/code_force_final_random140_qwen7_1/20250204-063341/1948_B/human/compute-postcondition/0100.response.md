Output State: **`i` is 2; `x` is an integer value equal to `a[2] % 10`; `len(a)` is greater than 0**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `a[i] % 10` to `x`, where `i` is 2. Since `a[i]` is an element of list `a` at index 2, `x` becomes the last digit of `a[2]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and the condition `len(a) > 0` is still true.
