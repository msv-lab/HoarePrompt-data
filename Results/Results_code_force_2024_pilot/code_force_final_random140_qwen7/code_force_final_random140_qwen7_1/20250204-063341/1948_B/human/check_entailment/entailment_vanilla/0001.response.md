Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input and Initializing Variables:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `m`.
   - It initializes an empty list `b` to store the result for each test case.
   
2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1()` but does not use the return value of `func_1()`. This is incorrect because `func_1()` performs the necessary operations to check if the array can be sorted.

3. **Function `func_1()`:**
   - Reads the size of the array `k`.
   - Reads the array elements as a string and converts them to integers.
   - Initializes variables `x`, `y`, `n`, and `c` to manage the digits of the numbers.
   - Iterates through the array to process each element:
     - If the element is greater than 10 and not the first element, it splits the number into its last digit (`x`) and the rest (`y`).
     - Checks if the rest of the number (`y`) is greater than or equal to the last processed number in the list `c`.
       - If so, it appends `y` and `x` to `c` if `y` is less than or equal to `x`, otherwise it appends the original number.
       - If not, it directly appends the original number.
   - After processing all elements, it sorts the list `c` and checks if `c` is sorted.
   - Appends `1` to `b` if `c` is sorted, otherwise appends `0`.

4. **Outputting Results:**
   - After processing all test cases, it prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the values in `b`.

### Issues Identified:
- The main issue is that the program does not call `func_1()` correctly. Instead of calling `func_1()` and storing the results in `b`, it just initializes `b` and then prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on `b[i]` without updating `b` during the loop.

### Corrected Program:
To fix this, the program should properly call `func_1()` and update `b` with the results.

```python
m = int(input())
b = []
for i in range(m):
    b.append(func_1())

for i in range(m):
    if b[i] == 1:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')

def func_1():
    k = int(input())
    a = input().strip()
    a = list(map(int, a.split()))
    x = 0
    y = 0
    n = 0
    c = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if a[i] > 10 and i > 0:
            x = int(a[i] % 10)
            y = int(a[i] // 10)
            if y >= c[n - 1]:
                if y <= x:
                    c.append(y)
                    c.append(x)
                    n = n + 2
                else:
                    c.append(a[i])
                    n = n + 1
            else:
                c.append(a[i])
                n = n + 1
        elif i == 0 and a[i] > 10:
            x = int(a[i] % 10)
            y = int(a[i] // 10)
            if y <= x:
                c.append(y)
                c.append(x)
                n = n + 2
            else:
                c.append(a[i])
                n = n + 1
        else:
            c.append(a[i])
            n = n + 1
    d = sorted(c)
    if c == d:
        return 1
    else:
        return 0
```

### Conclusion:
The corrected program now correctly processes each test case and updates the results in `b`. Therefore, the original program is incorrect due to the improper handling of `func_1()` and `b`.

**Correctness: False**
