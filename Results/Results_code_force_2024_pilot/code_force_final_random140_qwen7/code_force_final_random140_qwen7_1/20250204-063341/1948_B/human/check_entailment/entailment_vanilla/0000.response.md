Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads `m` (number of test cases) from the input.
   - It initializes an empty list `b` to store results for each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - The program iterates over each test case `i` from `0` to `m-1`.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1()` but does not pass any arguments to it. This is incorrect because `func_1()` expects input values.

3. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - Reads `k` (length of the array) and a space-separated string of integers.
   - Converts the string into a list of integers `a`.
   - Initializes variables `x`, `y`, `n`, and `c` (to store the transformed array).
   - Iterates through each element in `a`:
     - If the element is greater than 10 and not the first element, it splits the number into its digits and checks if the new digits can be inserted in the correct order.
     - If the element is the first element or less than or equal to 10, it simply appends the element to `c`.
   - Sorts the list `c` and checks if it matches the original list `a`.
   - Appends `1` to `b` if the sorted list matches the original list, otherwise appends `0`.

4. **Output Handling**:
   - After processing all test cases, it prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the values stored in `b`.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Call to `func_1()`**:
   - The program calls `func_1()` without passing any arguments, which is incorrect. `func_1()` should be called with the necessary inputs.

2. **Logic for Transforming Digits**:
   - The logic in `func_1()` for splitting digits and checking their order is correct, but the transformation process needs to ensure that the resulting array is always sorted.

3. **Sorting and Comparison**:
   - The program sorts the list `c` and compares it with the original list `a`. However, the original list `a` should be sorted before comparison, and the function should return the correct result based on the sorted state.

### Corrected Program:
```python
m = int(input())
b = []

for i in range(m):
    k = int(input())
    a = input().split()
    a = list(map(int, a))
    
    # Transform the array according to the rules
    c = []
    for num in a:
        if num > 10:
            digits = [int(d) for d in str(num)]
            if len(digits) == 2:
                x, y = digits
                if y >= c[-1] and y <= x:
                    c.extend([y, x])
                else:
                    c.append(num)
            else:
                c.append(num)
        else:
            c.append(num)
    
    # Check if the transformed array is sorted
    if c == sorted(c):
        b.append(1)
    else:
        b.append(0)

# Output the results
for res in b:
    if res == 1:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
```

### Conclusion:
The given program has logical errors due to incorrect function calls and improper handling of the transformation process. After fixing these issues, the program should correctly determine if it is possible to sort the array using the specified operations.

**Correctness: False**
