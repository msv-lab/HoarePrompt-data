Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `m` and processes each test case individually. However, the variable `b` is initialized outside the loop that processes the test cases, which means `b` will not be cleared between test cases. This could lead to incorrect results if the previous test case's state affects the current one.

2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1()` is defined to process each test case. It reads the value of `n` and the array `a`, then processes the array according to the specified rules. After processing, it checks if the modified array `c` is sorted and appends 1 to `b` if it is, or 0 otherwise.

3. **Sorting Check**: The sorting check is performed correctly. The array `c` is sorted, and the result is stored in `d`. If `c` is equal to `d`, it means the array is sorted, and 1 is appended to `b`; otherwise, 0 is appended.

4. **Output Handling**: The program prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the values in `b`. However, since `b` is not reset between test cases, the results from previous test cases might affect the current ones, leading to incorrect outputs.

Given these points, the main issue is that the variable `b` is not reset between test cases, which violates the assumption of independent test cases. Therefore, the program will produce incorrect results for multiple test cases.

Correctness: **False**
