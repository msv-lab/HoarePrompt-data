### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to verify its correctness.

#### Input Handling and Function Call:
- The program reads the number of test cases `m`.
- It initializes an empty list `b` to store the results.
- It iterates over each test case, calling `func_1()` for each one.
- After processing all test cases, it prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the values stored in `b`.

#### Function `func_1`:
- It reads the number of elements `k` and the list of integers `a`.
- It processes the list `a` by splitting multi-digit numbers into their individual digits.
- It checks if the resulting list `c` is sorted and appends `1` or `0` to `b` accordingly.

#### Key Points to Verify:
1. **Handling Single-Digit Numbers**: The program should handle single-digit numbers without splitting them.
2. **Splitting Multi-Digit Numbers**: The program should correctly split multi-digit numbers and ensure the resulting list is sorted.
3. **Sorting Check**: The program should correctly check if the processed list `c` is sorted.

#### Detailed Analysis:
1. **Single-Digit Numbers**:
   - The program does not explicitly handle single-digit numbers. When a number is less than 10, it simply appends it to the list `c` without any further processing.
   - This is correct because single-digit numbers do not need to be split.

2. **Splitting Multi-Digit Numbers**:
   - The program correctly splits multi-digit numbers into their individual digits.
   - It ensures that the digits are appended in the correct order and checks if the resulting list `c` is sorted.

3. **Sorting Check**:
   - The program sorts the list `c` and checks if it is equal to the original list `c`. If they are equal, it means the list is already sorted, and the result is `1`. Otherwise, the result is `0`.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly handles both single-digit and multi-digit numbers. It ensures that the resulting list is sorted after processing. The original assessment incorrectly pointed out that the program does not handle single-digit numbers, but this is not true. The program correctly processes single-digit numbers by not splitting them.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is inaccurate. The program correctly implements the logic to check if the array can be sorted using the specified operation.

**Final: True**
