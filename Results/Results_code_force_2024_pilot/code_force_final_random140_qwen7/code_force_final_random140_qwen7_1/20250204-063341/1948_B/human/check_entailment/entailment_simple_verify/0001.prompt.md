You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input and Initializing Variables:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `m`.
   - It initializes an empty list `b` to store the result for each test case.
   
2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1()` but does not use the return value of `func_1()`. This is incorrect because `func_1()` performs the necessary operations to check if the array can be sorted.

3. **Function `func_1()`:**
   - Reads the size of the array `k`.
   - Reads the array elements as a string and converts them to integers.
   - Initializes variables `x`, `y`, `n`, and `c` to manage the digits of the numbers.
   - Iterates through the array to process each element:
     - If the element is greater than 10 and not the first element, it splits the number into its last digit (`x`) and the rest (`y`).
     - Checks if the rest of the number (`y`) is greater than or equal to the last processed number in the list `c`.
       - If so, it appends `y` and `x` to `c` if `y` is less than or equal to `x`, otherwise it appends the original number.
       - If not, it directly appends the original number.
   - After processing all elements, it sorts the list `c` and checks if `c` is sorted.
   - Appends `1` to `b` if `c` is sorted, otherwise appends `0`.

4. **Outputting Results:**
   - After processing all test cases, it prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the values in `b`.

### Issues Identified:
- The main issue is that the program does not call `func_1()` correctly. Instead of calling `func_1()` and storing the results in `b`, it just initializes `b` and then prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on `b[i]` without updating `b` during the loop.

### Corrected Program:
To fix this, the program should properly call `func_1()` and update `b` with the results.

```python
m = int(input())
b = []
for i in range(m):
    b.append(func_1())

for i in range(m):
    if b[i] == 1:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')

def func_1():
    k = int(input())
    a = input().strip()
    a = list(map(int, a.split()))
    x = 0
    y = 0
    n = 0
    c = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if a[i] > 10 and i > 0:
            x = int(a[i] % 10)
            y = int(a[i] // 10)
            if y >= c[n - 1]:
                if y <= x:
                    c.append(y)
                    c.append(x)
                    n = n + 2
                else:
                    c.append(a[i])
                    n = n + 1
            else:
                c.append(a[i])
                n = n + 1
        elif i == 0 and a[i] > 10:
            x = int(a[i] % 10)
            y = int(a[i] // 10)
            if y <= x:
                c.append(y)
                c.append(x)
                n = n + 2
            else:
                c.append(a[i])
                n = n + 1
        else:
            c.append(a[i])
            n = n + 1
    d = sorted(c)
    if c == d:
        return 1
    else:
        return 0
```

### Conclusion:
The corrected program now correctly processes each test case and updates the results in `b`. Therefore, the original program is incorrect due to the improper handling of `func_1()` and `b`.
