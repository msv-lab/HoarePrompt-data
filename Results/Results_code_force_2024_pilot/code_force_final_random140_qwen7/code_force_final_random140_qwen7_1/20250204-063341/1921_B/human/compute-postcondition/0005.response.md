Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is not explicitly initialized in the loop head; it will be set to 0 by default when the loop starts.
   - `n` is a variable that determines the number of iterations of the loop.

3. **Understand the conditions for loop execution**: For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1 because `range(n)` will generate numbers from 0 to `n-1`. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the states of the relevant variables**:
   - Since `i` will be set to 0 by default, there is no need to explicitly adjust its value.
   - We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

5. **Consider other variables**: The variables `t`, `s`, and `a` (`b`) are not part of the loop head and do not affect the loop's execution condition. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted.

Based on the above reasoning, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `n` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the final answer is:

**State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
