Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and both s and f are strings of length n consisting of '0' and '1'. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    t = input()
    a = b = 0
    for i in range(n):
        a += s[i] > t[i]
        b += s[i] < t[i]
    print(max(a, b))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `a` is the count of indices where the character in `s` is greater than the corresponding character in `t`, and `b` is the count of indices where the character in `s` is less than the corresponding character in `t`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `a` will hold the total number of positions where the characters in string `s` are greater than those in string `t`, and `b` will hold the total number of positions where the characters in string `s` are less than those in string `t`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `a` will be the count of how many times `s[i]` is greater than `t[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `b` will be the count of how many times `s[i]` is less than `t[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `n` will be the total number of iterations the loop executed, `i` will be `n`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `a` will hold the total number of indices where the value in list `s` is greater than the corresponding value in list `t`, `b` will hold the total number of indices where the value in list `s` is less than the corresponding value in list `t`, `n` will be the length of the lists `s` and `t`, and `i` will be equal to `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `a` will be the count of indices where `s[i]` is greater than `t[i]`, and `b` will be the count of indices where `s[i]` is less than `t[i]`. The variable `i` will be equal to `n`, and `n` will be the original input integer plus 1. The variable `t` will remain as the string input by the user and will not change.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `a` will hold the total number of positions where the characters in string `s` are greater than the corresponding characters in string `t`, and `b` will hold the total number of positions where the characters in string `s` are less than the corresponding characters in string `t`. The variable `i` will be set to `n`, which is one more than the original input integer, and `t` will still be the string provided by the user.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
