Output State: **`b` is incremented by 1 if `s[i+1]` is less than `t[i+1]`, otherwise it remains unchanged, `i` is `i + 1`, `a` is `a + (s[i] > t[i])`, and `b` is `b + 1` if `s[i] < t[i]` and unchanged otherwise.**

Explanation: The code `b += s[i] < t[i]` increments `b` by 1 if the condition `s[i] < t[i]` is true, and leaves `b` unchanged if the condition is false. The other variables `i` and `a` are also updated as per their respective conditions in the initial state.
