Postcondition: `i` is less than `n - 1`, `n` must be a positive integer, `hd` is 2, `t` is greater than 0, `res` is the absolute difference between the count of '1's in `s1` and `s2`, and `res` is incremented by 1 if `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]`.

This means that after the if-else block executes, `i` remains less than `n - 1`, `n` is still a positive integer, `hd` is set to 2, `t` is still greater than 0, `res` is the absolute difference between the count of '1's in `s1` and `s2`, and if `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]`, `res` is incremented by 1.
