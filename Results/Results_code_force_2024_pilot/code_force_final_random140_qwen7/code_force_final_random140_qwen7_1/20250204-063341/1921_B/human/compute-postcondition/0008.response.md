Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `b` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is less than `t[i]`, otherwise it remains unchanged.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 at each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The value of `b` will remain the same unless `s[i+1]` is less than `t[i+1]`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - The variable `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The variable `b` will remain unchanged from the previous iteration unless the condition `s[i+1] < t[i+1]` is met.

Given the information, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`b` is incremented by 1 if `s[i+1]` is less than `t[i+1]`, otherwise it remains unchanged, `i` is `i + 1`**.
