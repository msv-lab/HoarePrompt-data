You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and both s and f are strings of length n consisting of '0' and '1'. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        s = input()
        
        t = input()
        
        a = b = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            a += s[i] > t[i]
            b += s[i] < t[i]
        
        print(max(a, b))
        
    #State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `a` will hold the total count of indices where the character in `s` is greater than the corresponding character in `t`, and `b` will hold the total count of indices where the character in `s` is less than the corresponding character in `t`. The variable `i` will be equal to `n`, and `n` will be the total number of iterations the loop executed, which is the sum of `n` from all test cases. The variable `t` will remain as the string input by the user and will not change.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases where for each test case, it accepts three inputs: t (a positive integer between 1 and 10^4), n (a positive integer between 1 and 10^5), and two strings s and f of length n consisting of '0' and '1'. It returns different outputs based on the conditions specified for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
