Output State: **`a` is 1 if `s[2]` is greater than `t[2]` else 0, `b` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2**

Explanation: The value of `b` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is less than `t[i]`. Given that `i` is 2, the condition checks `s[2] < t[2]`. Since the initial value of `b` is 1, if `s[2] < t[2]` is true, `b` becomes 2; otherwise, it remains 1. The other variables (`a`, `n`, and `i`) are not affected by this operation.
