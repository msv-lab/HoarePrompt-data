Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s1 = input()
    s2 = input()
    hd = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if s1[i] != s2[i]:
            hd += 1
    res = abs(s1.count('1') - s2.count('1'))
    print(res + abs(hd - res) // 2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `hd` is equal to `n`, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be an input integer, `i` is equal to `n-1`, and `res` is the absolute difference between the count of '1's in `s1` and `s2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `hd` is equal to `n`, `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n + 1`, `res` is the absolute difference between the count of '1's in `s1` and `s2`, `s2` is a newly input string, and `n` is greater than 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is less than or equal to `n`, `n` must be a positive integer, `hd` is the count of positions where `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]`, `t` is greater than 0, `res` is the absolute difference between the count of '1's in `s1` and `s2`, and `res` is incremented by 1 if `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]` for each iteration, `res` is now the absolute difference between the count of '1's in `s1` and `s2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
