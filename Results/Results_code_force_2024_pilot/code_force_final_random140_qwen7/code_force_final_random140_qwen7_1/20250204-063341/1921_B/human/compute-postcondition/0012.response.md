Output State: **`b` is either the same or incremented by 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `a` is incremented by 1 if the character at index `i` of `s` is greater than the character at index `i` of `t`, otherwise `a` remains the same.**

Explanation: The code `a += s[i] > t[i]` checks if the character at index `i` of string `s` is greater than the character at index `i` of string `t`. If true, `a` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `a` remains unchanged. The values of `b` and `i` are not affected by this operation, so they remain as either the same or incremented by 1, and `i` is updated to `i + 1`, respectively.
