Output State: **`b` is incremented by 1 if `s[i+1]` is less than `t[i+1]`, otherwise it remains unchanged, `i` is `i + 1`, `a` is `a + (s[i] > t[i])`**

Explanation: The code `a += s[i] > t[i]` increments `a` by 1 if the condition `s[i] > t[i]` is true, otherwise it does not change `a`. The values of `b` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state.
