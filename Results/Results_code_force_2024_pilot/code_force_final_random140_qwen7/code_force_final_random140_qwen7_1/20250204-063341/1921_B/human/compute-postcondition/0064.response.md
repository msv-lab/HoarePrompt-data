Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is less than or equal to `n`, `n` must be a positive integer, `hd` is the count of positions where `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]`, `t` is greater than 0, `res` is the absolute difference between the count of '1's in `s1` and `s2`, and `res` is incremented by 1 if `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]` for each iteration.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be one more than the last index `n` that was checked (so it will be `n`), `hd` will hold the total count of positions where `s1` and `s2` differ, `t` will still be greater than 0, `res` will be the initial absolute difference between the count of '1's in `s1` and `s2`, plus the number of differing positions found during the loop execution.
