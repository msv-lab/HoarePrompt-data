Output State: `a` is the count of indices where the character in `s` is greater than the corresponding character in `t`, and `b` is the count of indices where the character in `s` is less than the corresponding character in `t`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `a` will hold the total number of positions where the characters in string `s` are greater than those in string `t`, and `b` will hold the total number of positions where the characters in string `s` are less than those in string `t`.
