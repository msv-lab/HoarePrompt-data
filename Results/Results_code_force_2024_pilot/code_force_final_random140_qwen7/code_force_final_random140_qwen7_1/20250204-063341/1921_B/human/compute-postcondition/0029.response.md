Output State: **`a` is 1 if `s[3]` is greater than `t[3]` else 0; `b` is 2; `n` must be greater than 0; `i` is 3**

Explanation: The code `a += s[i] > t[i]` updates the value of `a` by adding 1 if the condition `s[i] > t[i]` is true, otherwise it does nothing. Initially, `i` is 3, so the condition checks `s[3] > t[3]`. If this condition is true, `a` becomes 1 (since it was initially 1 if `s[2]` is greater than `t[2]` else 0, and now it is incremented by 1). If the condition is false, `a` remains unchanged. The values of `b`, `n`, and `i` remain the same.
