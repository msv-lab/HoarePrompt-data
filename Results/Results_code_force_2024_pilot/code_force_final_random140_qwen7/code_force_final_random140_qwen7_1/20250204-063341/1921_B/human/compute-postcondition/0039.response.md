Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values**:
   - `a` is 0.
   - `b` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer plus 1.
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `t` is a string input by the user.

3. **Check the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. However, since `i` is set to `n + 1`, the loop will not start executing because `i` will always be greater than `n`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` is `n + 1`, the loop will not execute regardless of the value of `n`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 1 so that `i` can eventually become less than or equal to `n` during the loop iterations.
   - We don't need to change the values of `a`, `b`, `t`, or `i` because they are not part of the loop head conditions.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` must be greater than 0.

**Final State**:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
