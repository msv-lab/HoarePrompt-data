Output State: **`b` is increased by 1 if `s[i]` is less than `t[i]`, otherwise `b` remains unchanged**.

This means that the variable `b` is incremented by 1 only if the condition `s[i] < t[i]` evaluates to `True`. Otherwise, `b` stays the same as its previous value. The initial condition that `a` is increased by 1 if `s[i]` is greater than `t[i]` is not affected by this line of code, so it remains unchanged in the output state.
