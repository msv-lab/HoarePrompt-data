Output State: **`b` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is less than `t[i]`, otherwise it remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `b += s[i] < t[i]` checks if the value of `s[i]` is less than `t[i]`. If true, `b` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `b` remains unchanged. The initial state of `a` being incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is greater than `t[i]` is not affected by this code snippet, so it remains as part of the precondition.
