Output State: **`t` is an input string, `s` is an input string**.

Explanation: The initial state had `t` as a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and `s` as an input string. The code snippet updates `t` to be the value of the input provided, which is now a string. Therefore, `t` is now a string, while `s` remains unchanged as an input string.
