Output State: **`b` is increased by 1 if `s[i]` is less than `t[i]`, otherwise `b` remains the same; `a` is `a + (s[i] > t[i])`; `i` is `i + 1`; `n` must be greater than `i + 1`**.

In this output state, the value of `b` is updated based on the condition `s[i] < t[i]`. If the condition is true, `b` is increased by 1; otherwise, it remains the same. The value of `a` is updated by adding the boolean result of `s[i] > t[i]` to its current value. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and the precondition that `n` must be greater than `i + 1` is still valid.
