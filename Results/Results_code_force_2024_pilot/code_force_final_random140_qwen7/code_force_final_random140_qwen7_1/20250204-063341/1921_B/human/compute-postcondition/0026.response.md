Output State: **`a` is 1 if `s[2]` is greater than `t[2]` else 0, `b` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `a` by checking if `s[i]` (which is `s[2]` since `i` is 2) is greater than `t[i]` (which is `t[2]`). If `s[2]` is greater than `t[2]`, `a` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `a` remains unchanged. The values of `b`, `n`, and `i` remain the same as they were in the initial state.
