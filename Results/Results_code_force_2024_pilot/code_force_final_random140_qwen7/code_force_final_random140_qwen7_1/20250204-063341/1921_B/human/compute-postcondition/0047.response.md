Output State: **`b` is increased by 1 if `s[i]` is less than `t[i]`, otherwise `b` remains the same; `a` is `a + (s[i] > t[i])`; `i` is `i + 1`; `n` must be greater than `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `b += s[i] < t[i]` checks if `s[i]` is less than `t[i]`. If true, `b` is increased by 1; otherwise, `b` remains the same. The other variables (`a`, `i`, and `n`) are not directly affected by this line of code, so their states remain unchanged. The precondition that `n` must be greater than `i + 1` is also still valid.
