Output State: **`a` is 1 if `s[3]` is greater than `t[3]` else 0; `b` is 3; `n` must be greater than 0; `i` is 3**

Explanation: The value of `b` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is less than `t[i]`. Given that `i` is 3, the condition `s[i] < t[i]` checks if `s[3]` is less than `t[3]`. Since the initial value of `b` is 2, if `s[3]` is less than `t[3]`, `b` becomes 3. If `s[3]` is not less than `t[3]`, `b` remains 2. However, since the problem does not specify the values of `s[3]` and `t[3]`, we can only say that `b` is incremented by 1 if the condition is true, making `b` equal to 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
