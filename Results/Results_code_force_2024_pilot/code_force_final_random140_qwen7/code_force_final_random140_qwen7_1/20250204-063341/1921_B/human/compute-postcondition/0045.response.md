Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in this case is `i`, and the condition for the loop to continue is based on the value of `i` relative to `n`.

2. **Understand the loop body**: The loop body increments `b` by 1 if `s[i]` is less than `t[i]`, otherwise `b` remains the same.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `b` is increased by 1 if `s[i]` is less than `t[i]`, otherwise `b` remains the same.
   - This means `b` could either be incremented or remain the same depending on the comparison between `s[i]` and `t[i]`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is the loop variable, it will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `i < n`.
   - Therefore, `i` will be `i + 1` in the next iteration.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `b` will remain the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration because the loop body does not change `b` outside of the conditional check.

Given the above steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`b` is increased by 1 if `s[i]` is less than `t[i]`, otherwise `b` remains the same, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`**.
