State: **`a` is 0, `b` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variable `i` and `n`.
2. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0 because `range(n)` will generate numbers from 0 to `n-1`. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.
3. The initial value of `i` within the loop will be 0 when the loop starts its first iteration.
4. Variables `a` and `b` are not involved in the loop condition and their values do not affect whether the loop can execute. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted.

Thus, the required state adjustments are `n` must be greater than 0 and `i` must be 0.
