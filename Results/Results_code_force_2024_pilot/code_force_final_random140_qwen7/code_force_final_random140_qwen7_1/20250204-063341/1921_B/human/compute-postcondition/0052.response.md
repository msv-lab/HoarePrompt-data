Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases where for each test case, it accepts three inputs: t (a positive integer between 1 and 10^4), n (a positive integer between 1 and 10^5), and two strings s and f of length n consisting of '0' and '1'. It returns different outputs based on the conditions specified for each test case.**
