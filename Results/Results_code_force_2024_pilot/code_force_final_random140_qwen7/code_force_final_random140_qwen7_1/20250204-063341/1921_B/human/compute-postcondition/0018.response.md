Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is the count of indices where the character in `s` is greater than the corresponding character in `t`, and `b` is the count of indices where the character in `s` is less than the corresponding character in `t`.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, storing it in the variable `n`. The initial counts of `a` and `b` (which are based on the comparison of characters in strings `s` and `t`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated variable `n` along with the unchanged variables `a` and `b`.
