Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads three inputs: a positive integer \( t \), a positive integer \( n \), and two strings \( s \) and \( f \) of length \( n \) consisting of '0' and '1'. It then compares the characters of \( s \) and \( f \) at each position, counting how many times a character in \( s \) is greater than or less than the corresponding character in \( f \). Finally, it prints the maximum of these two counts.**
