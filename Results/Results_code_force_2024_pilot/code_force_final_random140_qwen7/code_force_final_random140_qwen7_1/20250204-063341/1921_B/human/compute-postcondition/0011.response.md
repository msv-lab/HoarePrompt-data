Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `b` is incremented by 1 if `s[i+1]` is less than `t[i+1]`, otherwise it remains unchanged.
- `i` is `i + 1`.
- `a` is `a + (s[i] > t[i])`.
- `b` is `b + 1` if `s[i] < t[i]` and unchanged otherwise.

### Loop Head
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Variable `i`:**
   - The loop increments `i` by 1 at each iteration.
   - Therefore, `i` will be `i + 1` at the start of the next iteration.

2. **Variable `b`:**
   - `b` is incremented by 1 if `s[i] < t[i]`.
   - Otherwise, `b` remains unchanged.
   - Since we don't know the exact condition at the end of the previous iteration, we cannot determine the exact value of `b` for the next iteration. However, we know that `b` will be either the same or incremented by 1.

3. **Variable `a`:**
   - `a` is incremented by 1 if `s[i] > t[i]`.
   - Otherwise, `a` remains unchanged.
   - Again, since we don't know the exact condition at the end of the previous iteration, we cannot determine the exact value of `a` for the next iteration. However, we know that `a` will be either the same or incremented by 1.

### Conclusion
Given the loop head `for i in range(n)`, the only variables that can be adjusted are `i`, `b`, and `a`.

- `i` will be `i + 1`.
- `b` will be either the same or incremented by 1.
- `a` will be either the same or incremented by 1.

Since we don't have specific values for `b` and `a` from the previous iteration, we can only state that they will either remain the same or change based on the conditions provided.

### Final State
State: **`b` is either the same or incremented by 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `a` is either the same or incremented by 1**
