Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for checking if a subarray is interesting. Specifically, the program fails to handle the case where the subarray length is less than 3. According to the problem description, a subarray needs to be divided into \(k > 1\) parts, which means the subarray must have at least 3 elements. However, the program does not enforce this condition, leading to incorrect results for subarrays with fewer than 3 elements.

For example, consider the following input:
- Array: `[1, 1]`
- Query: `1 2`

The subarray `[1, 1]` should not be considered interesting because it cannot be divided into more than one part. However, the current implementation will incorrectly return "YES" for this query.

To fix this, the program should add a check at the beginning of the function to ensure the subarray has at least 3 elements before proceeding with the rest of the logic.
