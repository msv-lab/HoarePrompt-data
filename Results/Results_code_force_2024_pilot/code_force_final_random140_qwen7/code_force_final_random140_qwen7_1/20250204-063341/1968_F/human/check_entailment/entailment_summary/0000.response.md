Reasoning:
1. The problem requires checking if a subarray can be divided into \(k > 1\) parts where the bitwise XOR of each part is equal.
2. The solution involves preprocessing the array to compute the cumulative XOR up to each index.
3. For each query, it checks if the cumulative XOR at the start and end of the query range is the same, indicating the subarray can be divided into parts with equal XOR.
4. It also uses binary search to find the smallest valid starting point for the subarray within the query range.
5. The implementation correctly handles the preprocessing and query processing steps as described in the problem statement.

Given the execution summaries and the logic implemented in `func_3`, the program appears to correctly implement the required functionality.

Correctness: **True**
