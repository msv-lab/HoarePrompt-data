### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definitions**:
   - `func_1`: This function takes a cast function as an argument and applies it to each element in the input string split by spaces. It returns a map object, which needs to be converted to a list or tuple.
   - `func_2`: This function performs a binary search to find the first index where the predicate is true. If no such index exists, it returns `None`.

2. **Main Function (`func_3`)**:
   - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case:
     - Reads `n` and `q`, the size of the array and the number of queries.
     - Reads the array `a` and computes the prefix XOR array `x`.
     - Uses a dictionary `inds` to store indices of each unique prefix XOR value.
     - For each query, checks if the prefix XOR from `l-1` to `r` is zero, which would mean the subarray is interesting.
     - If not, uses binary search to find the appropriate indices for splitting the subarray to check if it can be divided into parts with equal XOR values.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic for checking if a subarray is interesting is sound. The use of prefix XOR and binary search is appropriate for finding the required splits.
   - However, there are some issues with the implementation:
     - The `func_2` function is not correctly implemented. It should return the index of the smallest element that satisfies the predicate, but it currently returns the index of the largest element that does not satisfy the predicate.
     - The binary search in `func_2` is not correctly used to find the appropriate split points. Specifically, the `lower` and `upper` variables are not correctly set to ensure the subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR values.
     - The logic for determining the split points using `inds` is flawed. The indices stored in `inds` do not necessarily correspond to valid split points for the subarray.

4. **Examples Analysis**:
   - The annotated code provides a detailed breakdown of the state of the program at key points, which helps in understanding the intended logic.
   - However, the actual implementation does not align with the intended logic. For example, in the first test case, the program incorrectly identifies the subarray `[1, 1, 2, 3, 0]` as interesting, even though it is not.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if a subarray is interesting. The binary search and the use of `inds` are not correctly implemented, leading to incorrect results.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final:
**False**
