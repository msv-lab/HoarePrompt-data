### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and then casts each element using the provided `cast` function.
   - It correctly processes the input and returns a map object, which is later converted to a list.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function performs a binary search to find the smallest index where the predicate is true.
   - However, the logic seems flawed. The binary search is intended to find the smallest index where the predicate is not satisfied, but the implementation does not correctly handle this.
   - The function should return the index of the smallest element that satisfies the predicate, but the current implementation does not achieve this correctly.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - This function reads the size of the array `n` and the number of queries `q`.
   - It computes the cumulative XOR values and stores them in the dictionary `inds`.
   - The main logic checks if the subarray is interesting by comparing the cumulative XOR values at the specified indices.
   - The logic for determining if the subarray is interesting is correct, but it relies on the results of `func_2`, which is flawed.

### Analysis of `func_2`:
- The binary search in `func_2` is not implemented correctly. It should find the smallest index where the predicate is true, but instead, it finds the largest index where the predicate is false.
- The logic for setting `l` and `r` is incorrect, leading to incorrect results.

### Conclusion:
Given the flawed implementation of `func_2`, the overall correctness of the program is compromised. Therefore, the program will not always produce the correct results.

### Correctness:
**False**
