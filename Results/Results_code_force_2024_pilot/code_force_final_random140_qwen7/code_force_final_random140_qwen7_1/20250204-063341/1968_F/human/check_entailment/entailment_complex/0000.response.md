Reasoning:
1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function correctly reads a line of input, splits it into elements, and converts them using the provided `cast` function. This is consistent with the problem's requirements for reading input.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function performs a binary search to find the smallest index where the predicate is true. However, the logic in the function is flawed. The purpose of the binary search here seems to be to find the smallest index where the predicate is false, but the implementation does not correctly handle this. Specifically, the condition `if predicate(arr[l]) : return l` should be `if predicate(arr[mid]) : r = mid` and the return value should be `r` instead of `l`. The current implementation will always return `None` unless the predicate is true at some point during the search.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**: This function correctly constructs the cumulative XOR array `x` and uses a dictionary `inds` to store the indices where each cumulative XOR value occurs. It then processes each query to determine if the subarray is interesting. The logic for checking if the subarray is interesting is correct, but it relies on the correctness of `func_2`, which is flawed.

Given the issues in `func_2`, the overall correctness of the program cannot be guaranteed. Therefore, the program as written is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
