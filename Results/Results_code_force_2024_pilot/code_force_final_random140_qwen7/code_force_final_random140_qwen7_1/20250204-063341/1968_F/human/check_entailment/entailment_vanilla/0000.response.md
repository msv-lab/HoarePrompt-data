### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definitions**:
   - `func_1`: This function takes a cast function as an argument and applies it to each element in the input string split by spaces. It returns a map object, which needs to be converted to a list or tuple.
   - `func_2`: This function performs a binary search to find the first index where the predicate is true. If no such index exists, it returns `None`.

2. **Main Function (`func_3`)**:
   - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case:
     - Reads `n` and `q`, the size of the array and the number of queries.
     - Reads the array `a` and computes the prefix XOR array `x`.
     - Uses a dictionary `inds` to store indices of each unique prefix XOR value.
     - For each query, checks if the prefix XOR from `l-1` to `r` is zero, which would mean the subarray is interesting.
     - If not, uses binary search to find the appropriate indices for splitting the subarray to check if it can be divided into parts with equal XOR values.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic for checking if a subarray is interesting is sound. The use of prefix XOR and binary search is appropriate for finding the required splits.
   - The code correctly handles the constraints and examples provided.
