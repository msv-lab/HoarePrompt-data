Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Function Definitions**:
   - The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are defined but not used in the main logic of the program. The function `func_3` is supposed to handle the main logic, but it relies on these undefined functions.

2. **Predicate Logic in `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` is intended to perform binary search, but its implementation is flawed. It checks if `predicate(arr[mid])` is true and then adjusts the search range accordingly. However, the purpose of this function is unclear, and it is not used in the context of the problem.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic of the program is supposed to check if a subarray is interesting. This involves calculating the prefix XOR values and using them to determine if the subarray can be divided into parts with equal XOR values.
   - The program uses a dictionary `inds` to store indices of prefix XOR values. However, the logic to check if a subarray is interesting is not correctly implemented. Specifically, the conditions to determine if the subarray is interesting are not properly handled.

4. **Query Handling**:
   - The program reads the input and processes each query. However, the logic to check if a subarray is interesting is not fully implemented. The conditions to determine if the subarray can be divided into parts with equal XOR values are not correctly checked.

To fix these issues, the program needs to be restructured to correctly implement the logic for checking if a subarray is interesting. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def is_interesting_subarray(a, l, r):
    prefix_xor = [0] * (r - l + 1)
    prefix_xor[0] = a[l-1]
    for i in range(1, r - l + 1):
        prefix_xor[i] = prefix_xor[i-1] ^ a[l+i-1]
    
    xor_value = prefix_xor[-1]
    count = defaultdict(int)
    count[0] = 1
    for val in prefix_xor[:-1]:
        if count[xor_value ^ val] > 0:
            return True
        count[val] += 1
    
    return False

def process_queries(n, q, a):
    for i in range(q):
        l, r = map(int, input().split())
        if is_interesting_subarray(a, l, r):
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, q = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        process_queries(n, q, a)
```

This corrected version defines a function `is_interesting_subarray` to check if a subarray is interesting and uses it within the `process_queries` function to handle the queries.
