Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `q` is a positive integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is a list of integers where each element a_i is in the range 0 <= a_i < 2^30.**

The code `a = list(func_1(int))` assigns the result of `func_1(int)` to the variable `a`. Since the exact values returned by `func_1(int)` are not specified, we cannot determine the specific values of the elements in `a`. However, we know that `a` is now a list of integers, and each element in the list satisfies the condition 0 <= a_i < 2^30. The values of `n` and `q` remain unchanged from their initial state.
