Output State: **`i` is 1, `q` is `n`, `l` is the return value of `func_1(int)`, `r` is the second return value of `func_1(int)`**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since there is no loop context provided, the values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the same values as the initial state.
