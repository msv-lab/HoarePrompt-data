Output State: **`i` is 2, `q` is `n`, `l` is the return value of `func_1(int)`, `r` is the second return value of `func_1(int)`, `upper` is `inds[x[l - 1]][upper]`, `lower` is `inds[x[r]][lower + 1]`**

Explanation: The code `l, r = func_1(int)` assigns the return values of the function `func_1(int)` to the variables `l` and `r`. Since the exact return values of `func_1(int)` are not specified, we keep them as the return values of the function. The other variables remain unchanged.
