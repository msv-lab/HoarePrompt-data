Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `q` is `n`, `l` is the return value of `func_1(int)`, `r` is the second return value of `func_1(int)`, `upper` is `inds[x[l - 1]][upper]`, `lower` is `inds[x[r]][lower + 1]`. If `upper` is greater than `lower` and both `l` and `lower` are within the range defined by `l` and `r`, then the conditions remain unchanged. Otherwise, the conditions also remain unchanged.**
