Output State: **`i` is 0, `q` is `n`, `l` is the first return value of `func_1(int)`, `r` is the second return value of `func_1(int)`. The loop or block of code continues.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since there is no loop or block of code specified in the given context, the `continue` statement does not change the values of the variables. It simply indicates that the loop or block of code continues from the beginning of the next iteration. Therefore, the values of `i`, `q`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged, and the loop continues.
