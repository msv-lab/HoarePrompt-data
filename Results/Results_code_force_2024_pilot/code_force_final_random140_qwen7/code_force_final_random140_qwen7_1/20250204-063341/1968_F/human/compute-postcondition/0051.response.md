Output State: **`i` is 2, `q` is `n`, `l` is the return value of `func_1(int)`, `r` is the second return value of `func_1(int)`, `upper` is `inds[x[l - 1]][upper]`, `lower` is the result of `func_2(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l)` or -1 if the condition is not met.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `lower` to be the result of calling `func_2` with `inds[x[r]]` as the first argument and a lambda function as the second argument. The lambda function checks if the argument is less than `l`. If `x[l - 1]` equals `x[r]`, the loop continues without updating `lower`. Otherwise, `lower` is set to the result of `func_2` or -1 if the condition is not met. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
