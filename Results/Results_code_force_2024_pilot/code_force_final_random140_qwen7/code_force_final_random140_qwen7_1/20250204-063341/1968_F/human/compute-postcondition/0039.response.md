Output State: **`i` is 1, `q` is `n`, `l` is the return value of `func_1(int)`, `r` is the second return value of `func_1(int)`, `upper` is the result of `func_2(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)` or -1.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `upper` by calling `func_2` with `inds[x[l - 1]]` as the first argument and a lambda function as the second argument. The lambda function checks if the argument is less than or equal to `r`. Since the values of `inds`, `x`, `l`, and `r` are not specified, `upper` is determined by the result of `func_2` with these inputs. The other variables (`i`, `q`, `l`, `r`, and `lower`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
