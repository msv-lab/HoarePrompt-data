Postcondition: `i` is 0, `q` is `n`, `l` is the first return value of `func_1(int)`, `r` is the second return value of `func_1(int)`, `upper` is `inds[x[l - 1]][upper]`, `lower` is `inds[x[r]][lower + 1]`. If `upper > lower` and `l` is less than or equal to `upper` which is less than or equal to `r`, and `l` is less than or equal to `lower` which is less than or equal to `r`, then these conditions hold. Otherwise, either `upper` is less than or equal to `lower`, or `l` is greater than `upper`, or `upper` is greater than `r`, or `lower` is greater than `r`.
