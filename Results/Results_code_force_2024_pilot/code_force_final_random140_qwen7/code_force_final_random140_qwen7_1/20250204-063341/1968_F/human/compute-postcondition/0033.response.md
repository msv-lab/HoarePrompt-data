Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `q`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the start of the loop**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `q` is `n`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `q`.

4. **Analyze the given postconditions**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `q` is `n`.
   - `l` is the first return value of `func_1(int)`.
   - `r` is the second return value of `func_1(int)`.
   - `upper` is `inds[x[l - 1]][upper]`.
   - `lower` is `inds[x[r]][lower + 1]`.
   - Additional conditions involving `upper`, `lower`, `l`, and `r` are provided.

5. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, so at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1.
   - The value of `q` remains unchanged, so `q` is still `n`.

6. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` changes from 0 to 1.
   - `q` remains `n`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `q` is `n`**.
