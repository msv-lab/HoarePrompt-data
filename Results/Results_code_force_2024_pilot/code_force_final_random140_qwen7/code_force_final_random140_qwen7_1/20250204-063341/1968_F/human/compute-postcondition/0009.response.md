Output State: **`inds` is a defaultdict with default list type, `inds[0]` contains the element `[1]`, `n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `q` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq q \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `a` is a list of integers where each element \(a_i\) is in the range \(0 \leq a_i < 2^{30}\) and must contain at least one element, `x` is a list containing three elements where the second element is the XOR of the first element (which is 0) and 0 (making the second element 0), and the third element is the XOR of the second element (0) and 1 (making the third element 1).**

Explanation: The code `x.append(x[-1] ^ i)` appends to the list `x` the value of the last element of `x` XORed with `i`. Initially, `x` contains `[0, 0]` because the second element is the XOR of the first element (0) and 0. After executing the line of code, `x` becomes `[0, 0, 1]` since `0 ^ 1 = 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
