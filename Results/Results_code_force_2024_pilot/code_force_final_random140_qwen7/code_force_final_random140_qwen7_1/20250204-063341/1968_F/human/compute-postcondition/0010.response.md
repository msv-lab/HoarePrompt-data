Output State: **`inds[0]` now contains the element `[1, 2]`, `x` is a list containing three elements where the second element is 0 and the third element is 1.**

Explanation: The code appends the index `len(x) - 1` to the list `inds[x[-1]]`. Initially, `inds[0]` contains `[1]` and `x` is `[0, 0, 1]`. The length of `x` is 3, so `len(x) - 1` is 2. Since `x[-1]` is 1, the code appends 2 to `inds[1]`, but since `inds[0]` was the target, it appends 2 to `inds[0]`. Thus, `inds[0]` now contains `[1, 2]`. The values of `n`, `q`, and `a` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet.
