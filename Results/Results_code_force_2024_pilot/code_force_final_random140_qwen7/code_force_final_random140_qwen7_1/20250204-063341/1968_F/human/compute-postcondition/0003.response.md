Output State: **`inds` is a defaultdict with default list type, `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `q` is a positive integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is a list of integers where each element a_i is in the range 0 <= a_i < 2^30; `x` is a list containing a single element 0.**

The code initializes a `defaultdict` named `inds` with a default list type. This means that `inds` is now a dictionary where any key that does not exist will automatically create a new list when accessed. The values of `n`, `q`, `a`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states.
