Output State: **`i` is 2, `q` is `n`, `l` is the return value of `func_1(int)`, `r` is the second return value of `func_1(int)`, `upper` is the result of `func_2(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)`, `lower` is the result of `inds[x[r]][inds[x[r]][lower + 1]]` or -1 if the condition is not met.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `lower` by accessing `inds[x[r]][lower + 1]`. Since the initial state of `lower` is the result of `func_2(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l)` or -1 if the condition is not met, the new value of `lower` is now `inds[x[r]][inds[x[r]][lower + 1]]` or -1 if the condition is not met. The other variables remain unchanged.
