Output State: `inds[0]` contains the list of indices from 1 to n, `x` is a list of length n+1 where the first element is 0 and each subsequent element is the cumulative XOR of all elements in the list `a` up to that point.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, the list `x` will have a length of `n + 1` because we start with `x` containing a single element 0 and append to it `n` times. The value of `x[-1]` will be the cumulative XOR of all elements in `a`. For each iteration, `x.append(x[-1] ^ i)` ensures that the last element of `x` is updated to the current cumulative XOR. Simultaneously, `inds[x[-1]].append(len(x) - 1)` appends the index of the current element in `x` to the list corresponding to the value of `x[-1]` in `inds`. Since `inds[0]` starts with the index 1 and each new index is appended sequentially, `inds[0]` will contain all indices from 1 to `n` after `n` iterations.
