Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 0.
- `q` is `n`.
- `l` is the first return value of `func_1(int)`.
- `r` is the second return value of `func_1(int)`.
- `upper` is `inds[x[l - 1]][upper]`.
- `lower` is `inds[x[r]][lower + 1]`.

And the conditions given are:
- Either `upper <= lower` or `l > upper` or `upper > r` or `lower > r`.

Given these conditions, the print statement `print('No')` will execute regardless of the specific values of `upper` and `lower` because one of the conditions must be true according to the problem statement.

Output: **No**
