Output State: **`i` is 0, `q` is `n`, `l` is the first return value of `func_1(int)`, `r` is the second return value of `func_1(int)`, `upper` is `inds[x[l - 1]][upper]`, `lower` is `inds[x[r]][lower + 1]`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `upper` by accessing the element in the list `inds` at the index `x[l - 1][upper]`. The other variables (`i`, `q`, `l`, `r`, `lower`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
