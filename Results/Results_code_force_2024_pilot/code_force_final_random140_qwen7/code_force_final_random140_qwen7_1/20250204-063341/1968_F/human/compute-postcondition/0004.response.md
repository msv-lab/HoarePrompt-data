Output State: **`inds` is a defaultdict with default list type, `inds[0]` contains the element `[0]`, `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `q` is a positive integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is a list of integers where each element a_i is in the range 0 <= a_i < 2^30; `x` is a list containing a single element 0.**

Explanation: The code appends the value `0` to the list `inds[0]`. Initially, `inds[0]` is an empty list. After appending `0`, `inds[0]` now contains `[0]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
