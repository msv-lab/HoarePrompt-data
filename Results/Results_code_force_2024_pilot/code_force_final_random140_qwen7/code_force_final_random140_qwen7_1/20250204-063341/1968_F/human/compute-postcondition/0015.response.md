Output State: `inds[0]` now contains the element from index 1 to the total length of `x`, `x` is a list where the first element is 0, and each subsequent element is the cumulative XOR of all previous elements in `a`.

In more detail, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `inds[0]` will contain a list of indices starting from 1 up to the length of `x`. This is because every time the loop runs, it appends the current index (which is the length of `x` minus one) to `inds[0]`. The list `x` will contain `n` elements, where the first element is 0, and each subsequent element is the cumulative XOR of all previously seen elements in the list `a`.
