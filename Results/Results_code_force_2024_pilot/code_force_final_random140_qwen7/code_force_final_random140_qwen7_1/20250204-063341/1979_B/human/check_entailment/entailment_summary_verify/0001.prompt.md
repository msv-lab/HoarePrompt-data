You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two distinct non-negative integers x and y . Consider two
infinite sequences a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots and b_1, b_2, b_3, \ldots , where

  * a_n = n \oplus x ; 
  * b_n = n \oplus y . 

Here, x \oplus y denotes the [bitwise
XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) operation of
integers x and y .

For example, with x = 6 , the first 8 elements of sequence a will look as
follows: [7, 4, 5, 2, 3, 0, 1, 14, \ldots] . Note that the indices of elements
start with 1 .

Your task is to find the length of the longest common subsegment^\dagger of
sequences a and b . In other words, find the maximum integer m such that a_i =
b_j, a_{i + 1} = b_{j + 1}, \ldots, a_{i + m - 1} = b_{j + m - 1} for some i,
j \ge 1 .

^\dagger A subsegment of sequence p is a sequence p_l,p_{l+1},\ldots,p_r ,
where 1 \le l \le r .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0 \le x, y \le
10^9, x \neq y ) — the parameters of the sequences.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the length of the longest common
subsegment.

Example

Input

    4
    
    0 1
    
    12 4
    
    57 37
    
    316560849 14570961

Output

    1
    8
    4
    33554432
    
Note

In the first test case, the first 7 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,\ldots]

b = [0, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6,\ldots]

It can be shown that there isn't a positive integer k such that the sequence
[k, k + 1] occurs in b as a subsegment. So the answer is 1 .

In the third test case, the first 20 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [56, 59, 58, 61, 60, 63, 62, 49, 48, 51, 50, 53, 52, 55, 54, \textbf{41,
40, 43, 42}, 45, \ldots]

b = [36, 39, 38, 33, 32, 35, 34, 45, 44, 47, 46, \textbf{41, 40, 43, 42}, 53,
52, 55, 54, 49, \ldots]

It can be shown that one of the longest common subsegments is the subsegment
[41, 40, 43, 42] with a length of 4 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        (l1, l2) = ([], [])
        while x:
            l1.append(x % 2)
            x //= 2
        while y:
            l2.append(y % 2)
            y //= 2
        if len(l2) < len(l1):
            l2.append(0)
        elif len(l1) < len(l2):
            l1.append(0)
        n = len(l1)
        if len(l2) < len(l1):
            n = len(l2)
        cnt = 0
        for i in range(n):
            if l1[i] == l2[i]:
                cnt += 1
            else:
                break
        print(2 ** cnt)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) and two distinct non-negative integers `x` and `y` (0 <= x, y <= 10^9). For each test case, it calculates the maximum number of leading matching bits between the binary representations of `x` and `y`, and prints 2 raised to the power of this count. After processing all test cases, it returns nothing.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to find the length of the longest common subsegment between two sequences \(a\) and \(b\), where \(a_n = n \oplus x\) and \(b_n = n \oplus y\).

2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`.
   - It converts `x` and `y` into their binary representations and stores them in lists `l1` and `l2`, respectively.
   - It ensures both lists have the same length by appending zeros to the shorter list.
   - It then iterates through the lists to count the number of matching bits.
   - Finally, it prints \(2^{\text{cnt}}\), where `cnt` is the number of matching bits.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The approach of converting `x` and `y` to binary and comparing their bit sequences is conceptually correct because the XOR operation can be understood through its binary representation.
   - However, the implementation has a critical flaw: it only considers the binary representations of `x` and `y` without considering the infinite nature of the sequences \(a\) and \(b\).
   - The program should focus on finding the longest common subsequence in the context of the sequences generated by the XOR operation, not just the binary representations of `x` and `y`.

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the example test cases, the program's logic does not align with the problem's requirements. It incorrectly calculates the result based on the binary representations rather than the sequences generated by the XOR operation.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic to find the longest common subsegment of the sequences \(a\) and \(b\). Instead, it compares the binary representations of `x` and `y`, which is not the intended solution.

Correctness: **False**
