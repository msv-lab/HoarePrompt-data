Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `x` is now `t // 8`, `y` is now `y // 2` and must be odd and non-zero, `l1` is a list containing the values of `x % 2` for each iteration of the loop, `l2` is a list containing `y % 2` with an additional element `y % 2`, and `y` is halved.**

Explanation: The code `y //= 2` divides `y` by 2 and assigns the result back to `y`. Since `y` was previously described as being odd and non-zero, it remains odd and non-zero after being halved (assuming the division results in an integer). The lists `l1` and `l2` remain unchanged as the code does not affect them.
