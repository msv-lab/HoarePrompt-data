Output State: **`x` is 0, `y` is an input integer divided by 2 and must be non-zero, `cnt` is the count of indices where `l1[i]` is equal to `l2[i]`, `i` is equal to `n`, `l1` is a list of binary digits representing the original value of `x` in reverse order, `l2` now contains another element which is `y % 2`, and `y` must be non-zero.**

The code `l2.append(y % 2)` appends the remainder of `y` divided by 2 to the list `l2`. Since `y` is an input integer divided by 2 and must be non-zero, `y % 2` will be either 0 or 1. However, without the specific value of `y`, we cannot determine the exact value that will be appended. The other variables remain unchanged.
