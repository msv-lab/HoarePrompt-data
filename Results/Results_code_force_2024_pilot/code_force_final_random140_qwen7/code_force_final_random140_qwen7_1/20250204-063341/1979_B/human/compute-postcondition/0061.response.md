Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` must be at least 3, so `n >= 3`.
- `i` is 2, so `i = 2`.
- `cnt` will be either 2 or 3 depending on whether `l1[2]` is equal to `l2[2]`.

To determine the value of `cnt`, we need to know the values of `l1[2]` and `l2[2]`. Since these values are not explicitly given, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `cnt`. However, we know it will be either 2 or 3.

Given this, the expression `2 ** cnt` will be evaluated as follows:
- If `cnt` is 2, then `2 ** cnt` is `2 ** 2` which equals 4.
- If `cnt` is 3, then `2 ** cnt` is `2 ** 3` which equals 8.

Since we do not have the exact value of `cnt`, we can only describe the possible outputs.

Output: **4 or 8 (depending on whether l1[2] is equal to l2[2])**
