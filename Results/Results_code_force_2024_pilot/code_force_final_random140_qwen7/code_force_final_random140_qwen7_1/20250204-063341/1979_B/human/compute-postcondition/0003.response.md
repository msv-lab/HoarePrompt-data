Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` is an integer from the input split, `y` is an integer from the input split, `l1` is an empty list, `l2` is an empty list.**

The code initializes two empty lists `l1` and `l2`. The values of `t`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged from their initial state.
