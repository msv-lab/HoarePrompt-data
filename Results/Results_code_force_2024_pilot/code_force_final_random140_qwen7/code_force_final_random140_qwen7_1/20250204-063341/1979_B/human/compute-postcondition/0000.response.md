Output State: **`t` is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specified that `t` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^4, this condition is preserved, and `t` now holds the specific value input by the user. All other variables (`x` and `y`) remain unchanged and are still distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9.
