Output State: `n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `t` is at least 3, `x` is now `x // 2 ** (n-1)`, `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `x` in reverse order, `y` is halved `n-1` times.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations (which is `n-1` times based on the given information), `x` will be reduced to `x // 2 ** (n-1)`. The list `l2` will contain the binary digits of the original value of `x` in reverse order, as each iteration appends the remainder of `y % 2` to `l2`. Since the loop runs `n-1` times, `y` will be halved `n-1` times.
