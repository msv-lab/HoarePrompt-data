Output State: **`x` is 0, `y` is an input integer divided by 2 and must be non-zero, `cnt` will be the count of indices where `l1[i]` is equal to `l2[i]`, and `i` will be equal to `n`; `l1` is a list of binary digits representing the original value of `x` in reverse order, and `l2` is a list containing the least significant bit of `y`.**

The code `y //= 2` divides `y` by 2 and floors the result to the nearest whole number. Since `y` was originally an input integer and must be non-zero, after the operation, `y` is now an integer that is half of its original value (floored). All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
