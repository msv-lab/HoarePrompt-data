Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `i` is initially set to 3.
   - `n` is the length of `l2`.

3. **Check if the loop can execute based on the initial state**:
   - The loop `for i in range(n):` will execute as long as `n` is at least 1 (since `range(n)` generates numbers from 0 to `n-1`).
   - Given that `i` is initially set to 3, the loop will start executing when `i` is within the range defined by `n`.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - Since `i` is already set to 3, we don't need to change its value.
   - We need to ensure that `n` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `n` must be at least 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` must be at least 1**
