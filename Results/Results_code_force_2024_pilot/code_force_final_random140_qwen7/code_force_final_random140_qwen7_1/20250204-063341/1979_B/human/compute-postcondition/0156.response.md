Output State: **`x` is 0, `y` is 0, `cnt` is the count of indices where `l1[i]` is equal to `l2[i]`, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is the length of `l2`**.

Explanation: The code `n = len(l2)` assigns the length of list `l2` to the variable `n`. The other variables (`x`, `y`, `cnt`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `n` is now set to the length of `l2`, which is less than the length of `l1` according to the initial state.
