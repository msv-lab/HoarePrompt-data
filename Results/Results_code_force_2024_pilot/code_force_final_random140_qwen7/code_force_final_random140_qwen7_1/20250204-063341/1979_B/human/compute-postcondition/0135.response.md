Output State: `x` is now `0`, `y` is an input integer, `cnt` will be the count of indices where `l1[i]` is equal to `l2[i]`, and `i` will be equal to `n`; `l1` is a list of binary digits representing the original value of `x` in reverse order, and `l2` is an empty list.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `x` is non-zero. Each iteration appends the remainder of `x` divided by 2 (which gives the least significant bit of `x`) to the list `l1`. Then, `x` is updated to its integer division by 2 (effectively shifting it right by one bit). This process repeats until `x` becomes 0. At that point, `l1` contains the binary representation of the original value of `x` in reverse order, since each bit was added from the least significant to the most significant.
