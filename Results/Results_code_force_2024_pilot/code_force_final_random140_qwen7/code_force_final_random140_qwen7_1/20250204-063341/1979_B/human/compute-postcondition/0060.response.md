Output State: **Postcondition: `n` must be at least 3, `i` is 2. `cnt` will be either 2 or 3 depending on whether `l1[2]` is equal to `l2[2]`.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations (up to the third iteration as per the given conditions), the value of `i` will be 2 since the loop increments `i` from 0 to `n-1`. The variable `n` remains at least 3 because the loop continues as long as there is no mismatch between `l1[i]` and `l2[i]`. The variable `cnt` will be incremented by 1 for each matching pair of `l1[i]` and `l2[i]` up to the point where they differ or the end of the loop is reached. Therefore, `cnt` will be either 2 or 3, depending on the values of `l1[2]` and `l2[2]`.
