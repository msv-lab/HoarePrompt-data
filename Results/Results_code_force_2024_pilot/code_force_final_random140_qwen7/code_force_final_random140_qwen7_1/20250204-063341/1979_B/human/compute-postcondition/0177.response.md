Output State: `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `cnt` is the number of consecutive matching elements from the start of `l1` and `l2`, `i` is `n`, and `n` is the minimum length of `l1` and `l2`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `cnt` will be the count of consecutive elements from the start of both lists `l1` and `l2` that match. The variable `i` will be equal to `n`, which is the minimum length of `l1` and `l2`. The variables `x` and `y` remain unchanged at 0 since they were not modified within the loop. The loop breaks as soon as it encounters a mismatch between `l1[i]` and `l2[i]`, but since we are considering the scenario where the loop completes all iterations (which means no mismatches occurred until the end), `cnt` will be the length of the longest prefix of `l1` and `l2` that are identical.
