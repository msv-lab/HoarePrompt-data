Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` must be at least 1.
   - `i` is 0.
   - The loop increments `cnt` if `l1[i]` is equal to `l2[i]`.
   - The loop exits if `l1[i]` is not equal to `l2[i]`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`.

3. **Current Values:**
   - `i` is currently 0.
   - Since `i` is 0, the condition `i < n` must hold true for the loop to continue.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 1.
   - Therefore, the new value of `i` should be 1.
   - The condition `i < n` must still hold true, meaning `n` must be at least 2 (since `i` is now 1).

5. **Adjusting the State:**
   - `i` changes from 0 to 1.
   - `n` must be at least 2 to allow the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 1**
