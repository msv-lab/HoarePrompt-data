Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `cnt` will be the count of indices where `l1[i]` is equal to `l2[i]`, and `i` will be equal to `n`; `l1` and `l2` are empty lists.**

Explanation: The code initializes two empty lists, `l1` and `l2`. The values of `x`, `y`, `cnt`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
