Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` is now `t // (2 ** 3)`, `y` is an integer from the input split, `l1` is a list containing the values of `x % 2` for each iteration of the loop, `l2` is an empty list.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `x` will be equal to the original value of `t` divided by \(2^3\) (since the loop runs 3 times), which simplifies to `t // 8`. The list `l1` will contain the results of `x % 2` for each iteration of the loop, meaning it will have 3 elements corresponding to the binary representation of `t` starting from the least significant bit.
Code of the loop:
while y:
    l2.append(y % 2)
    y //= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` is now `t // 8`, `y` is now `y // 2`, `l1` is a list containing the values of `x % 2` for each iteration of the loop, `l2` is a list containing `y % 2`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `x` is now `t // 8`, `y` is `y // 2`, `l1` is a list containing the values of `x % 2` for each iteration of the loop, `l2` is a list containing `y % 2`, and `l2` has one additional element which is `y % 2`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `x` is now `t // 8`, `y` is now `y // 2` and must be odd and non-zero, `l1` is a list containing the values of `x % 2` for each iteration of the loop, `l2` is a list containing `y % 2` with an additional element `y % 2`, and `y` is halved.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
