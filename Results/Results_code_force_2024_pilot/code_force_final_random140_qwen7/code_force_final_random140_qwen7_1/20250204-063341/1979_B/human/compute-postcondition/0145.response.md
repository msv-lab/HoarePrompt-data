Output State: **`x` is 0, `y` is 0, `cnt` will be the count of indices where `l1[i]` is equal to `l2[i]`, and `i` will be equal to `n`; `l1` is a list of binary digits representing the original value of `x` in reverse order, and `l2` is a list of binary digits representing the value of `y` in reverse order.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `x` will eventually become 0 because the loop continues to divide `x` by 2 until it reaches 0. At that point, `y` will also be 0 because it is continuously halved within the loop. The variable `cnt` will hold the count of positions where the binary digits of `x` (in reverse) match those of `y` (also in reverse), and `i` will be equal to `n` (though `n` is not defined in the given context, it likely refers to the length of the binary representation of `x` or `y`). Both `l1` and `l2` will contain the binary representations of `x` and `y` respectively, but in reverse order, as they were built up through the loop.
