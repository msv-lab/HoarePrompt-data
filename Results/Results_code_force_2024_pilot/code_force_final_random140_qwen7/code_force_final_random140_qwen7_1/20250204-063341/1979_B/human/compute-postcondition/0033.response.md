Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `x` is now `t // 8`, `y` is now `1`, `l1` is a list containing the values of `x % 2` for each iteration of the loop with an additional `0` appended, and `l2` is a list containing the values of `y % 2` for each iteration of the loop with 3 elements all of which are `1`.
