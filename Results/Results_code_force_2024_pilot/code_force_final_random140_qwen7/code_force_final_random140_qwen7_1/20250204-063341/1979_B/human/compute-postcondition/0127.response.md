Output State: **`x` is now `x // 2`, `y` is an input integer, `cnt` will be the count of indices where `l1[i]` is equal to `l2[i]`, and `i` will be equal to `n`; `l1` is `[x % 2]`, and `l2` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code `x //= 2` divides `x` by 2 and assigns the result back to `x`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `x` is updated to its new value, which is `x // 2`, while `y`, `cnt`, `i`, `l1`, and `l2` retain their original states.
