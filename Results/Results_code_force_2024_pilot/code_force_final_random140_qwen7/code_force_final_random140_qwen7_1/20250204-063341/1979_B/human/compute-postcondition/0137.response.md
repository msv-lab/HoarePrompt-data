Output State: **`x` is 0, `y` is an input integer and must be non-zero, `cnt` will be the count of indices where `l1[i]` is equal to `l2[i]`, and `i` will be equal to `n`; `l1` is a list of binary digits representing the original value of `x` in reverse order, and `l2` is a list containing the least significant bit of `y`.**

Explanation: The code appends the least significant bit (rightmost bit) of `y` to the list `l2`. Since `y` is an input integer and must be non-zero, its least significant bit will be either 0 or 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
