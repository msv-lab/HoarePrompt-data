Output State: **`x` must be non-zero, `y` is an input integer, `cnt` will be the count of indices where `l1[i]` is equal to `l2[i]`, and `i` will be equal to `n`; `l1` is `[x % 2]`, and `l2` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code appends `x % 2` to the list `l1`. Since `x` is non-zero, `x % 2` will be either 0 or 1, depending on whether `x` is even or odd. The other variables (`y`, `cnt`, `i`, `l2`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
