Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, `i` is `i + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified, the `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `n` and `i`. It only indicates that we would exit the most internal loop or if statement we were inside. The precondition that `n` must be at least 1 and `i` is `i + 1` remains unchanged.
