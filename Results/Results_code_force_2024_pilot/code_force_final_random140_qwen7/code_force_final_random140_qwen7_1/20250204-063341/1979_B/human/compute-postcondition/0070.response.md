Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `t` is at least 3, `x` must be non-zero after `x = x // 2`, `y` is an integer obtained from input split, and `l1` contains the value of `x % 2`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `x % 2` to the list `l1`. Since `x` must be non-zero after `x = x // 2`, the value of `x % 2` will be either 0 or 1. However, without knowing the exact value of `x`, we cannot specify the exact value of `x % 2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
