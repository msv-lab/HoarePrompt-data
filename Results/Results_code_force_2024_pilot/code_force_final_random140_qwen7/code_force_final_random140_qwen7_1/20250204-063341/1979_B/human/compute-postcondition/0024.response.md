Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `x` is now `t // 8`, `y` is now `1` (since `y` must be halved until it becomes 1 or less, and given the constraints, it will become 1), `l1` is a list containing the values of `x % 2` for each iteration of the loop (which will have 3 elements), `l2` is a list containing the values of `y % 2` for each iteration of the loop (which will also have 3 elements).

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `x` will be `t // 8`, as it is simplified from `t // (2 ** 3)`. The variable `y` starts as an integer from the input and is halved in each iteration of the loop. Given that the loop runs 3 times and `y` must be halved until it becomes 1 or less, `y` will be 1 after the loop completes. The list `l1` will contain the results of `x % 2` for each of the 3 iterations, and `l2` will contain the results of `y % 2` for each of the 3 iterations, which will be `[1, 0, 1]` if `y` started as an odd number, or `[0, 0, 0]` if `y` started as an even number.
