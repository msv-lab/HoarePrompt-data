Output State: **`x` is 0, `y` is 0, `cnt` is either 1 or 0, `i` is incremented by 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the loop or the most internal if statement directly. Since the initial state includes that `i` is less than `n`, and `i` is incremented by 1, the value of `i` is updated. However, the values of `x`, `y`, `cnt`, and the condition related to `l1` and `l2` remain unchanged because the `break` statement does not modify these variables.
