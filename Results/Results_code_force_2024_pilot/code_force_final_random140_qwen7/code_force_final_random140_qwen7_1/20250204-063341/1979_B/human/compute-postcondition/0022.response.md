Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `x` is now `t // 8`, `y` is `y // 2` and must be odd and non-zero, `l1` is a list containing the values of `x % 2` for each iteration of the loop, `l2` is a list containing `y % 2` with an additional element `y % 2`.**

Explanation: The code snippet appends the value of `y % 2` to the list `l2`. Since `y` is already defined and its value is odd and non-zero, `y % 2` will be 1 (because any odd number modulo 2 equals 1). Therefore, `l2` gains an additional element, which is 1. All other variables and their states remain unchanged.
