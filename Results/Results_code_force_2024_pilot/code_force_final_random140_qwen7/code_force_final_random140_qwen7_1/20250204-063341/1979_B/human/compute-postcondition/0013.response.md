Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` is now `t // (2 ** 3)`, `y` is an integer from the input split, `l1` is a list containing the values of `x % 2` for each iteration, `l2` is an empty list.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `x` will be reduced to `t // (2 ** 3)` because it is divided by 2 in each iteration. The list `l1` will contain the results of `x % 2` for each iteration, which means it will have 3 elements corresponding to the three iterations mentioned. The variable `y` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop, and `l2` remains an empty list as it was not modified within the loop.
