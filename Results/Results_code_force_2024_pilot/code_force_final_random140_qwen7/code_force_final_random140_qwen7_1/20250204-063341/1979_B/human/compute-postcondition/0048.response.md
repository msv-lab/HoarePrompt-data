Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, `i` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `n` and `i`. It only breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such block is specified in the code, we assume it breaks out of an implicit loop or conditional structure implied by the context. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged, and the break statement indicates that we exit the loop or conditional.
