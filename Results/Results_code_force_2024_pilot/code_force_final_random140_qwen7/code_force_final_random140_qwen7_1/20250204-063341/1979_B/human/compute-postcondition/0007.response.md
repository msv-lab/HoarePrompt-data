The loop condition is `x`. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be non-zero. At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is `x // 2`. Therefore, for the loop to continue, `x` must be a positive integer.

Given that `x` was `x // 2` at the end of the previous iteration, it means `x` was a positive integer before the division. To ensure the loop can execute again, `x` must be non-zero after the division, which implies it must be at least 1 (since `x` is a positive integer).

Thus, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `x` itself. It must be non-zero for the loop to continue.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` must be non-zero, `y` is an integer from the input split, `l1` is a list containing the value of `x % 2`, `l2` is an empty list**
