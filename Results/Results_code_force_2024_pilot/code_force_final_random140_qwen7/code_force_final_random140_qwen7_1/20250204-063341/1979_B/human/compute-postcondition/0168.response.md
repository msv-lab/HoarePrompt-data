Output State: **`x` is 0, `y` is 0, `cnt` is 2, `i` is less than `n`, `n` is the minimum length of `l1` and `l2`, and if `l1[i]` is equal to `l2[i]`, `cnt` is set to 1; otherwise, `cnt` remains 0, `i` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. Since `cnt` was initially either 1 or 0, after executing this line, `cnt` will be 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
