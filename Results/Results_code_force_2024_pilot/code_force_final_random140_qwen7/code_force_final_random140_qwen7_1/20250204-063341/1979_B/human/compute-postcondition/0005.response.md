Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` must be non-zero, `y` is an integer from the input split, `l1` is a list containing the value of `x % 2`, `l2` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `x % 2` to the list `l1`. Since `x % 2` will be either 0 or 1 (as `x` is non-zero), `l1` now contains this single value. The other variables remain unchanged according to their initial state.
