Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) and two distinct non-negative integers `x` and `y` (0 <= x, y <= 10^9). For each test case, it calculates the maximum number of leading matching bits between the binary representations of `x` and `y`, and prints 2 raised to the power of this count. After processing all test cases, it returns nothing.**
