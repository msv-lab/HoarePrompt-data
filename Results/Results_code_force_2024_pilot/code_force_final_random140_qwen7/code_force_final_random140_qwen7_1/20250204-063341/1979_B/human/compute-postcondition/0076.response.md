Output State: `n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `t` is at least 3, `x` is now `x // 2 ** n-1` (since the loop runs `n-1` times), `y` is an integer obtained from input split, and `l1` contains the binary representation of the original value of `x` as a list of integers.

Explanation: The loop continues to divide `x` by 2 and append the remainder (`x % 2`) to `l1` until `x` becomes 0. Since the loop runs `n-1` times, `x` will be reduced to `x // 2 ** (n-1)`. The list `l1` will contain the binary digits of the original `x` in reverse order, which can be read correctly by reversing the list if needed.
