Output State: **`cnt` is 1, `i` is 0, and the current value of `l1[i]` is equal to the current value of `l2[i]`.**

Explanation: The variable `cnt` is incremented by 1, starting from an initial value that is at least 0 (since it is not specified otherwise, we assume it starts at 0). The variable `i` remains unchanged at 0, and the condition that the current value of `l1[i]` is equal to the current value of `l2[i]` is still valid.
