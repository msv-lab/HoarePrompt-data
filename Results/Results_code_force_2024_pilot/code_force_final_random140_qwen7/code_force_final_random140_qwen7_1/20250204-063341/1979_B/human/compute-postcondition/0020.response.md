Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `x` is now `t // 8`, `y` is `y // 2`, `l1` is a list containing the values of `x % 2` for each iteration of the loop, `l2` is a list containing `y % 2`, and `l2` has one additional element which is `y % 2`.**

Explanation: The code `y //= 2` divides `y` by 2 and assigns the quotient back to `y`. Since `y` must be at least 2, the new value of `y` is `y // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
