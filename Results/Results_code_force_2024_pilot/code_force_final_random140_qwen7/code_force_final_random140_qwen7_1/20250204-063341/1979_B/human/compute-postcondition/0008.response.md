Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` must be non-zero, `y` is an integer from the input split, `l1` is a list containing the value of `x % 2` appended, `l2` is an empty list**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `x % 2` to the list `l1`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `l1` now contains the value of `x % 2`, while `l2` remains an empty list.
