Output State: **`x` must be non-zero; `l1` is a list containing the value of `x % 2`.**

Explanation: The code appends the remainder of `x` divided by 2 (`x % 2`) to the list `l1`. Since `x` must be non-zero, `x % 2` will either be 0 (if `x` is even) or 1 (if `x` is odd). The initial condition that `x` must be non-zero is preserved, and `l1` now contains the result of `x % 2`.
