Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `t` is at least 3, `x` is now `x // 2`, `l2` is a list with three elements where the first element is `y % 2` and the second and third elements are also `y % 2`, `y` must be at least 2**.

Explanation: The code appends `y % 2` to the list `l2`. Initially, `l2` contains two elements, both equal to `y % 2`. After appending, `l2` will have three elements, with the first two being `y % 2` and the third one also being `y % 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
