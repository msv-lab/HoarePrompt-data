Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `t` is at least 3, `x` and `y` are integers obtained from input split, `l1` is an empty list, `l2` is an empty list.**

The code initializes two empty lists `l1` and `l2`. The values of `n`, `i`, `t`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged from their initial states.
