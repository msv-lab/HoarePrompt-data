Postcondition: `n` must be at least 1. If the elements at index `i` of `l1` and `l2` are equal, then `cnt` is increased by 1 and the elements at each index of `l1` remain equal to the corresponding elements at the same index in `l2`. If the elements at index `i` of `l1` and `l2` are not equal, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
