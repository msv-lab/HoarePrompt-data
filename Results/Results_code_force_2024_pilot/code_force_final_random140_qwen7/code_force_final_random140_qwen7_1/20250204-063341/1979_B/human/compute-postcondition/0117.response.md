Output State: **`cnt` is 1, `i` is `i + 1`**

Explanation: The variable `cnt` is incremented by 1, starting from an unspecified initial value (at least 1), making `cnt` equal to 1. The value of `i` remains as `i + 1` because no operation changes its form, only its potential value if it was assigned a specific number before. The precondition that `n` must be at least 1 remains unchanged.
