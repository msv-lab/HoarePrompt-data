Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `y`.
2. **Understand the Loop Body**: The loop body divides `x` by 2 and appends the remainder (`x % 2`) to `l1` until `x` becomes 0.
3. **Determine the Initial State**: 
   - `n` is at least 3.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `t` is at least 3.
   - `x` is now `x // 2 ** (n-1)`.
   - `y` is an integer obtained from input split.
   - `l1` contains the binary representation of the original value of `x` as a list of integers.

4. **Loop Execution Condition**: For the loop to execute the first time, `y` must be non-zero.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is at least 3.
- `i` is 3.
- `t` is at least 3.
- `x` is now `x // 2 ** (n-1)`.
- `y` is an integer obtained from input split.
- `l1` contains the binary representation of the original value of `x` as a list of integers.

To ensure the loop executes the first time, `y` must be non-zero. Therefore, we need to ensure that `y` is not zero.

**Adjusted State**:
State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `t` is at least 3, `x` is now `x // 2 ** (n-1)`, `y` is a non-zero integer obtained from input split, and `l1` contains the binary representation of the original value of `x` as a list of integers.**

This ensures that the loop condition `y` is satisfied for the first iteration.
