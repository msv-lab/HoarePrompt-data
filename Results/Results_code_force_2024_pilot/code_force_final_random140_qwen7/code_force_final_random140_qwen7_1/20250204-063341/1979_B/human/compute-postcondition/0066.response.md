Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `t` is at least 3, `x` and `y` are integers obtained from input split, and `x` must be non-zero; `l1` contains the value of `x % 2`.**

Explanation: The code appends the remainder of `x` divided by 2 (`x % 2`) to the list `l1`. Since `x` is an integer obtained from input, `x % 2` will be either 0 or 1. However, the exact value of `x % 2` is not specified, so we only know that it is either 0 or 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
