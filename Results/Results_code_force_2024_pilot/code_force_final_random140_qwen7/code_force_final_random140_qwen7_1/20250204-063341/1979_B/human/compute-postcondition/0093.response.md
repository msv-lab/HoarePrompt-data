Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `t` is at least 3, `x` is now `x // 2`, `l1` has a length of one more than its original length and contains the element 0.**

Explanation: The code `l1.append(0)` adds the element `0` to the list `l1`. Since `l1` originally had a length less than the length of `l2`, and no other changes were made to `l1`, `l1` now has a length of one more than its original length. The values of `n`, `i`, `t`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states.
