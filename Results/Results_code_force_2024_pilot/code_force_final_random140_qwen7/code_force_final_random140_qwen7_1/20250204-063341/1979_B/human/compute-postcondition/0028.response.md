Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `x` is now `t // 8`, `y` is now `1`, `l1` is a list containing the values of `x % 2` for each iteration of the loop, `l2` is a list containing the values of `y % 2` for each iteration of the loop, `l2` will have 4 elements (with the last element being `0`), and the length of `l2` is less than the length of `l1`.**

Explanation: The code appends `0` to the list `l2`. Since `l2` originally had 3 elements, all of which were `1`, appending `0` increases the length of `l2` to 4. The other variables and their lists remain unchanged according to the initial state.
