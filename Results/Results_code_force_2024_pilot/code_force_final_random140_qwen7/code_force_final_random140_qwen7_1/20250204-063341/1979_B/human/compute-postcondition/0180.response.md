Output State: **All inputs `x` and `y` have been processed, `cnt` contains the maximum number of leading matching bits between their binary representations, `i` equals `n`, which is the length of the longer list between `l1` and `l2`, and `n` is the minimum length of `l1` and `l2` if they were equal in length initially.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `cnt` will hold the number of leading matching bits between the binary representations of `x` and `y`, `i` will be equal to `n`, and `n` will be the length of the shorter list between `l1` and `l2`. The values of `x` and `y` will both be 0 since they are continuously divided by 2 until they become 0.
