Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head includes the variable `i` and the variable `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State**:
   - `cnt` is 0.
   - `n` is the length of `l1`.
   - `x` is `t // 8`.
   - `y` is 1.
   - `l1` is a list containing the values of `x % 2` for each iteration of the loop.
   - `l2` is a list containing the values of `y % 2` for each iteration of the loop.
   - If the length of `l2` is less than the length of `l1`, then `n` remains 4.

3. **Check Conditions for the Loop to Execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1 because `range(n)` will not generate any iterations if `n` is 0.
   - The initial value of `i` will be 0 since `range(n)` starts from 0.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - We need to ensure that `n` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.
   - The initial value of `i` is 0.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` and `i`.

Therefore, the final state should be:

**State: **`n` must be at least 1, `i` is 0**
