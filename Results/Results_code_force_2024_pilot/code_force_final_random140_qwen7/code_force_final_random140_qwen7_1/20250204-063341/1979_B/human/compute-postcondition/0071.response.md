Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `t` is at least 3, `x` is half of its original value (non-zero), `y` is an integer obtained from input split, and `l1` contains the value of `x % 2`.**

Explanation: The code `x //= 2` divides `x` by 2 and assigns the floor division result back to `x`. Since `x` must be non-zero after this operation, `x` is now half of its original value. All other variables (`n`, `i`, `t`, `y`, and `l1`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
