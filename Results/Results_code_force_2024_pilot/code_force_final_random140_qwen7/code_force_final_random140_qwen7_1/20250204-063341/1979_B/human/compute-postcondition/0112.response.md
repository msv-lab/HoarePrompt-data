Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `n` must be at least 1.
   - The loop body is omitted, but based on the postcondition, it checks elements of `l1` and `l2` at index `i` and updates `cnt` and the elements of `l1` accordingly.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop condition is `i < n`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1 (assuming the loop body did its job).
   - Therefore, `i` should be incremented by 1 again for the next iteration.
   - `n` remains unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, but since no such modification is mentioned, `n` stays the same.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value.
   - `n` remains unchanged because there is no indication that `n` is being modified within the loop body.

Given the above reasoning, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`n` must be at least 1, `i` is `i + 1`**.
