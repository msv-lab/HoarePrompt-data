Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `while x:`. This means the loop continues as long as `x` is non-zero.

2. **Current State**: 
   - `n` is at least 3.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `t` is at least 3.
   - `x` is now `x // 2`.
   - `y` is an integer obtained from input split.
   - `x` must be non-zero.
   - `l1` contains the value of `x % 2`.

3. **Adjusting the State**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `x` is non-zero. Since `x` is now `x // 2`, the only way for the loop to continue is if `x` is still non-zero after the division.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `x` remains non-zero after the division.

Given these points, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `x` itself. We need to ensure that `x` is non-zero after the division.

**State**: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `t` is at least 3, `x` must be non-zero (after `x = x // 2`), `y` is an integer obtained from input split, and `l1` contains the value of `x % 2`**
