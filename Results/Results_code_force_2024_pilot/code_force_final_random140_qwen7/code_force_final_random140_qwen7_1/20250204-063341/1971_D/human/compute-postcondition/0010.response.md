Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
   - `a` is a non-empty string.
   - `cut` is 1.
   - `i` is 0.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over the range from 0 to `len(a) - 2`.

3. **Loop Body:**
   - The loop body is omitted, but we know it checks if the character at index `i` in string `a` is '1' and the character at index `i + 1` is '0'. If this condition is met, `cut` is set to 1.

4. **Current Values:**
   - `i` is currently 0.
   - `cut` is 1.

5. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become 1.
   - The loop will check the characters at indices `i` (which is now 1) and `i + 1` (which is now 2).

6. **Adjusting the State:**
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
   - `a` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the loop.
   - `cut` remains 1 unless the condition in the loop body is met, but since the condition is not specified to change `cut` in the given information, `cut` stays 1.
   - `i` is incremented to 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `a` is a non-empty string, `cut` is 1, `i` is 1**.
