Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the `for i in range(len(a) - 1):` statement. The variables involved here are `i`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `0` to `len(a) - 2` (inclusive). This means `i` starts at `0` and increments by `1` until it reaches `len(a) - 2`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `cut` is 2
   - `i` is `len(a) - 1`
   - `t` is `t - 1`
   - The condition for processing characters `'1'` and `'0'` is checked if the character at index `i` in string `a` is `'1'` and the character at index `i + 1` is `'0'`.

4. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently `len(a) - 1`, the next value of `i` would be `len(a) - 2`.
   - We need to ensure that the loop can continue, which means `i` should be within the valid range for the loop, i.e., `0` to `len(a) - 2`.

5. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be set to `len(a) - 2`.
   - `cut` remains unchanged.
   - `t` will be decremented by `1` again.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`cut` is 2, `i` is `len(a) - 2`, `t` is `t - 2`**
