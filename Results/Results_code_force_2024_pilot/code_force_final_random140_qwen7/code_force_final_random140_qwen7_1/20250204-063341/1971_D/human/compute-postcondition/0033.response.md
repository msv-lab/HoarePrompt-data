Postcondition: `cut` is 2, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `t` is `t - 1`, and if the character at index `i` in string `a` is '1' and the character at index `i + 1` is '0', then these two characters are processed accordingly. If the condition is not met, the variables retain their values as specified in the precondition.
