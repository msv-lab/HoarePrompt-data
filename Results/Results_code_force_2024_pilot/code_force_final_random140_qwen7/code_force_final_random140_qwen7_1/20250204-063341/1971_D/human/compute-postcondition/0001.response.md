Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and the variable `t`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is given as a positive integer between 1 and 500, the loop will always execute at least once.

3. **Adjust the State**: The only state that needs to be adjusted is `t`, because it directly controls the number of iterations of the loop. The initial value of `t` being a positive integer ensures that the loop will execute at least once.

4. **Formulate the Final State**: We need to ensure that `t` is a positive integer within the specified range (1 to 500), but since it is already stated that `t` is a positive integer, we just need to confirm its value.

Given these steps, the final state to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500**
