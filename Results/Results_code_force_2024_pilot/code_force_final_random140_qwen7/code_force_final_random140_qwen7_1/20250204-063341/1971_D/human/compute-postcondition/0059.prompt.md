Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    a = input()
    cut = 0
    for i in range(len(a) - 1):
        if a[i] == '1' and a[i + 1] == '0':
            cut += 1
    print(cut + 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: The loop will continue to execute as long as there are consecutive characters '1' followed by '0' in the string `a`. After all iterations, the variable `cut` will hold the total count of such occurrences, `i` will be equal to `len(a) - 2` (since the loop runs from `i = 0` to `len(a) - 2`), and `t` will remain a positive integer between 1 and 500, unchanged by the loop.

In simpler terms, after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, `cut` will contain the total number of times '1' is immediately followed by '0' in the string `a`, `i` will be one less than the length of `a` because the loop increments `i` until it reaches the second last character, and `t` will still be any value between 1 and 500, as it was not altered by the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The final value of `cut` is equal to the number of occurrences where `a[i]` is '1' and `a[i + 1]` is '0' for all `i` in the range of `len(a) - 1`. The value of `i` is `len(a) - 1` after the loop completes. The value of `t` is `t - 3` since it decreases by 1 for each iteration of the loop. The string `a` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `a` is a newly input string, `cut` is equal to the total number of occurrences where `a[i]` is '1' and `a[i + 1]` is '0' for all valid `i` in the range of `len(a) - 1`, `i` is incremented until it is no longer less than `len(a) - 1`, and `t` is 2 or greater.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `cut` will hold the total count of adjacent pairs in the string `a` where the first character is '1' and the second character is '0'. The variable `i` will be incremented until it is no longer within the bounds of the string, and `t` will remain unchanged as it was initially set to 2 or greater.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
