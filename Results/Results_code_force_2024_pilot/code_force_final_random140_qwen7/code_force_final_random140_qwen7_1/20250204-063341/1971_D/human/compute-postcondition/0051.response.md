Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `len(a) - 1`.

2. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(a) - 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is a newly input string (its value remains unchanged).
   - `cut` is 2 (unchanged).
   - `i` is incremented by 1 and is less than `len(a) - 1`.
   - `t` is 2 or greater (unchanged).

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1, let's denote the new value of `i` as `i + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i + 1` must still be less than `len(a) - 1`.

Given that `i` was less than `len(a) - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` will be `i + 1`. Therefore, `i + 1` must be less than `len(a) - 1`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `a` remains the same.
   - `cut` remains 2.
   - `i` becomes `i + 1`.
   - `t` remains 2 or greater.

So, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`a` is a newly input string, `cut` is 2, `i` is incremented by 1 and is less than `len(a) - 1`, and `t` is 2 or greater**.
