Output State: **`cut` is 2, `i` is 1**

Explanation: The code `cut += 1` increments the value of `cut` by 1. Given that `cut` was initially 1, after executing this line, `cut` becomes 2. The value of `i` is incremented to 1, but since `i` was not specified to have a particular initial value, we only know that it is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
