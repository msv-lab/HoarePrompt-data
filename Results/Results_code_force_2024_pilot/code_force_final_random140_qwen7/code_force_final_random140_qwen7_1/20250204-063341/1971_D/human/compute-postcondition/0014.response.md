Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `cut` remains 1.
   - `i` is 1.
   - The postcondition is that if `a[i]` is '1' and `a[i + 1]` is '0', then `cut` becomes 2.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `range(len(a) - 1)`.
   - This means the loop will run from `i = 0` to `i = len(a) - 2`.

3. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 2.
   - The loop will check the condition `a[i]` and `a[i + 1]` for `i = 2`.

5. **Adjusting States:**
   - We need to update the value of `i` to 2.
   - The value of `cut` remains unchanged as per the postcondition (it did not change in the previous iteration).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`cut` remains 1, `i` is 2**
