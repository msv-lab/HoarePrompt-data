Postcondition: `a` is a newly input string, `cut` is 1, `i` is less than `len(a) - 1`, `t` is 2 or greater, and if the current value of `a[i]` is '1' and the current value of `a[i + 1]` is '0', the function does not change these values. If the condition `a[i] == '1' and a[i + 1] == '0'` is not met, the values of `a[i]` and `a[i + 1]` remain unchanged.
