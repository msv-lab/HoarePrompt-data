Postcondition: ***`s` is a binary string of length 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `a` is an input string with length at least 2, `i` is 1. If the first character of `a` is '1' and the second character of `a` is '0', and the third character of `a` (i.e., `a[i]`) is '1' and the fourth character (i.e., `a[i + 1]`) is '0', then `cut` is 2. Otherwise, `cut` is 1.***
