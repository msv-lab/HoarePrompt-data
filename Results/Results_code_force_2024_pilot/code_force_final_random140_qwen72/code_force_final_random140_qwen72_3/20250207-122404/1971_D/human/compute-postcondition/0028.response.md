Postcondition: ***`s` is a binary string of length 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `a` is an input string with length greater than 2, `i` is 2. If `a[i]` is '1' and `a[i + 1]` is '0', and the first character of `a` is '1' and the second character of `a` is '0', then `cut` is 3. Otherwise, `cut` is 0.***
