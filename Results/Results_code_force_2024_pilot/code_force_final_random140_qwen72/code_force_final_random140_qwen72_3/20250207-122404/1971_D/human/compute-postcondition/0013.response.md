Postcondition: ***`s` is a binary string of length 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `a` is an input string with length greater than 2, and `i` is 2. If the second character of `a` is '1' and the third character of `a` is '0', then `cut` is 3. Otherwise, `cut` remains 1.***
