Postcondition: ***`s` is a binary string of length 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `a` is an input string with length at least 3, `i` is 2. If the first character of `a` is '1', the second character is '0', the third character is '1', and the fourth character is '0', then `cut` is 3. Otherwise, `cut` is 2.***
