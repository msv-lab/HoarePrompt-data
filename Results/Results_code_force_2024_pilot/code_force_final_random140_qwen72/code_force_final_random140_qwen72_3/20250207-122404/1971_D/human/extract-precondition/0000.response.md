Precondition: **The function `func` is expected to take a binary string `s` as input, where `s` consists only of characters '0' and '1', and its length is within the range 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500.** 

However, the provided function definition does not include any parameters. The correct function definition should be:

```python
def func(s):
```

With the corrected function definition, the precondition would be:

Precondition: **s is a binary string consisting only of characters '0' and '1', and its length is within the range 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500.**
