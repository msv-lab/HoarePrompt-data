The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `t` from the user input, ensuring that `1 <= t <= 50`. It then calls the function `func_1` exactly `t` times. After the function completes, `t` remains the integer input by the user, and `func_1` has been executed `t` times. The function does not return any value.
