Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 1.
- `i` is 2.
- `n` must be at least 2.
- `s` is the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'.
- `ans` is the first `(n // 2)` letters of `s`, each repeated twice.
- `x` is `n // 2`.
- `j` is `(n // 2) - 1`.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print('YES')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:
Output: **YES**
