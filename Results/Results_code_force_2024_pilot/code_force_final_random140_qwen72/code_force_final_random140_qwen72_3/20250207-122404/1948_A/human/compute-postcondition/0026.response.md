The code snippet `res += letter[i % 26] * 2` appends two characters from the string `letter` to the string `res`. The character selected is determined by the index `i % 26`, which in this case is `2 % 26 = 2`. The character at index 2 in `letter` is 'C'. Therefore, 'CC' is appended to `res`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive)
- `letter` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
- `i` is 2
- If `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is 'AABB'. If `n` is less than 2, `res` is 'AAB'

Since `n` is between 2 and 50, `res` is initially 'AABB'. After appending 'CC' to `res`, the new value of `res` is 'AABBCC'.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `letter` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `i` is 2, `res` is 'AABBCC'**
