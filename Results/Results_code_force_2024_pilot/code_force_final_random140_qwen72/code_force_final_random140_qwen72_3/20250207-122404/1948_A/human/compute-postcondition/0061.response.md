Functionality: ** The function `func` clears the console screen and then processes a series of test cases. It reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads another integer `n`. If `n` is odd, it prints 'NO'. If `n` is even, it constructs a string `ans` consisting of the first `(n // 2)` uppercase letters of the alphabet, each repeated twice, and prints 'YES' followed by the constructed string. After processing all test cases, the function terminates. **
