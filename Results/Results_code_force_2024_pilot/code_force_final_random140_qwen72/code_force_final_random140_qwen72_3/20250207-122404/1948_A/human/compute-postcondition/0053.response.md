The code snippet `ans += s[x] * 2` appends the character at index `x` in the string `s` repeated twice to the string `ans`.

- Initial value of `ans` is 'AABB'.
- The value of `x` is 2.
- The string `s` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'.
- The character at index 2 in `s` is 'C'.

Therefore, `s[x] * 2` results in 'CC', and appending this to `ans` gives 'AABBCC'.

The values of other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `s`, `x`, `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` must be at least 5, `s` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `ans` is 'AABBCC', `x` is 2, `j` is 2**.
