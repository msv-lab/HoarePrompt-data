The code snippet `res += letter[i % 26] * 2` updates the value of `res` by appending twice the character at the position `i % 26` in the string `letter`. Given the initial state:

- `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive).
- `letter` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'.
- `i` is 1.
- `res` is 'AA' if `n` is greater than or equal to 2, otherwise `res` is 'A'.

Since `n` is between 2 and 50, `res` is initially 'AA'. The value of `i % 26` is `1 % 26`, which is 1. The character at index 1 in `letter` is 'B'. Therefore, `res` will be updated to 'AABB' because 'B' is appended twice.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `letter` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `i` is 1, `res` is 'AABB'.**
