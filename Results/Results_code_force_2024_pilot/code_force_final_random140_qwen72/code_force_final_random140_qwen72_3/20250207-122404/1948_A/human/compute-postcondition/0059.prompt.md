Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 50, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= 50 for each test case, `s` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', and the console screen is cleared.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    if n % 2 == 1:
        print('NO')
    else:
        ans, x = '', 0
        x = 0
        for j in range(n // 2):
            ans += s[x] * 2
            x += 1
        print('YES')
        print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `s` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', and the console screen is cleared. If `n` is odd, `n` remains unchanged. If `n` is even, `ans` is set to 'AABBCC...YZ' (where the string is composed of each letter from 'A' to the (n/2)-th letter repeated twice), `x` is set to n/2, and `j` is set to n/2 - 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer between 1 and 50, and `s` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'. If `n` is odd, `n` remains unchanged. If `n` is even, `ans` is set to 'AABBCC...YZ' (where the string is composed of each letter from 'A' to the (n/2)-th letter repeated twice), `x` is set to n/2, and `j` is set to n/2 - 1. The console screen is cleared.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer between 1 and 50, `s` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'. If `n` is odd, no changes are made to the variables. If `n` is even, `ans` is the first (n // 2) letters of `s`, each repeated twice, `x` is n // 2, and `j` is (n // 2) - 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
