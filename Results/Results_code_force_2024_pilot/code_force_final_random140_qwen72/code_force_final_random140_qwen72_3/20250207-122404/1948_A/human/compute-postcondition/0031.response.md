The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing from 2 to 3. The values of `n`, `letter`, and `res` remain unchanged. Since `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `res` is 'AABBCC'. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `letter` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `i` is 3, `res` is 'AABBCC'.**
