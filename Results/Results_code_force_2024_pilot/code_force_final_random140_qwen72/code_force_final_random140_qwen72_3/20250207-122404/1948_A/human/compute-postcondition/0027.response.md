Output State: **`n` is an integer between 0 and 48 (inclusive), `letter` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `i` is 2, `res` is 'AABBCC'**

Explanation: The value of `n` is decreased by 2, so if `n` was initially between 2 and 50, it is now between 0 and 48. The other variables (`letter`, `i`, and `res`) remain unchanged.
