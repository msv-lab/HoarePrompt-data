The code snippet `ans += s[x] * 2` updates the variable `ans` by appending twice the character at index `x` of the string `s`. Given the initial state:

- `t` is greater than 1
- `i` is 2
- `n` must be at least 2
- `s` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
- `ans` is an empty string
- `x` is 0
- `j` is 0

The character at index `x` (which is 0) of the string `s` is 'A'. Therefore, `ans` will become 'AA'.

The updated state is:
- `t` is greater than 1
- `i` is 2
- `n` must be at least 2
- `s` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
- `ans` is 'AA'
- `x` is 0
- `j` is 0

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, `s` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `ans` is 'AA', `x` is 0, `j` is 0**
