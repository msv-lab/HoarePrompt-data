The function `solve` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case is defined by an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), representing the number of special characters required in the string. The function should generate a string of uppercase Latin letters with exactly n special characters, where a special character is defined as a character that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. The output string should not exceed 200 characters in length.
