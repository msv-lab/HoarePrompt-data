You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No input parameters are required for the function `func_1`. The function reads an integer `n` from standard input, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    if (n <= 1) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    else :

                n -= 1
            
            i += 1
            
        #State: `n` is 0, `letter` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `i` is `initial_n // 2`, and `res` is a string where each pair of consecutive letters from 'A' to the letter corresponding to `i % 26` is repeated twice, except for the last letter which may appear only once if `initial_n` is odd.
        print(res)
        #This is printed: AA
    #State: *`n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive). If `n` is 1 or less, the current value of `n` is 1 or less. Otherwise, `n` is greater than 1, `letter` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `i` is `initial_n // 2`, and `res` is a string where each pair of consecutive letters from 'A' to the letter corresponding to `i % 26` is repeated twice, except for the last letter which may appear only once if `initial_n` is odd.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `n` from standard input, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50. If `n` is 1 or less, it prints 'NO'. If `n` is greater than 1, it prints 'YES' followed by a string `res` constructed by repeating pairs of consecutive letters from 'A' to the letter corresponding to `i % 26` (where `i` is incremented starting from 0), with each pair repeated twice, except for the last letter which may appear only once if `n` is odd. After the function concludes, `n` is 0, and the string `res` is printed.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
        
    #State: `t` is an integer input by the user within the range 1 to 50, and the loop has completed all `t` iterations. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not affect the loop's execution.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `t` from the user input, ensuring that `1 <= t <= 50`. It then calls the function `func_1` exactly `t` times. After the function completes, `t` remains the integer input by the user, and `func_1` has been executed `t` times. The function does not return any value.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to generate a string with exactly `n` special characters.
   - A special character is defined as a character that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
   - The string should have a maximum length of 200 characters.

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - Reads an integer `n` from input.
     - Checks if `n` is less than or equal to 1. If so, it prints "NO" because it's impossible to have exactly 1 special character (since a special character needs both a left and right neighbor).
     - If `n` is greater than 1, it prints "YES".
     - It then constructs a string `res` by appending pairs of the same character until `n` is reduced to 0.
     - The character used is cycled through the alphabet using `letter[i % 26]`.

3. **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
   - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1`.

4. **Validation:**
   - **Edge Cases:**
     - For `n = 1`, the function correctly prints "NO".
     - For `n = 2`, the function correctly prints "YES" followed by a string like "AA".
     - For larger `n`, the function constructs a string with the required number of special characters.
   - **String Length:**
     - The constructed string will have a length of at most `2 * n` because it appends pairs of characters.
     - Since `n` is at most 50, the maximum length of the string is `2 * 50 = 100`, which is within the limit of 200.

5. **Special Character Condition:**
   - Each pair of characters (e.g., "AA") ensures that the first character in the pair is a special character.
   - The last character in the string, if `n` is odd, will not be a special character, but this does not affect the correctness since the requirement is met for the first `n` characters.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all edge cases and constructs a valid string for valid inputs. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
