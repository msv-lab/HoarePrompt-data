Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
- The function `func_1` does not handle the case where `n == 1` correctly. According to the problem statement, a string with exactly one special character cannot be constructed because a special character must be equal to exactly one of its neighbors, which implies it needs at least two occurrences.
- The function `func_1` prints 'NO' for `n <= 1`, but it should specifically return 'NO' for `n == 1` and 'YES' for `n == 0` (though `n == 0` is not within the input constraints).
- The function `func_1` constructs the string correctly for `n > 1`, but it does not ensure that the string length is at most 200. However, since the maximum value of `n` is 50, the constructed string will always be within the limit.

To fix these issues, the function `func_1` should be modified to handle the case `n == 1` correctly and ensure that the output is formatted as required by the problem statement. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    if n == 1:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        letter = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
        i = 0
        res = ''
        while n > 0:
            if n >= 2:
                res += letter[i % 26] * 2
                n -= 2
            else:
                res += letter[i % 26]
                n -= 1
            i += 1
        print(res)

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
```

With these changes, the program should correctly handle all test cases as specified in the problem statement.
