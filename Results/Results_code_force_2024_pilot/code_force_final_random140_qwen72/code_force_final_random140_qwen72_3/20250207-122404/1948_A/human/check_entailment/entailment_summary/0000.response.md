### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to generate a string of uppercase Latin letters with exactly `n` special characters, where a special character is defined as a character that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
   - For each test case, we need to either print "NO" if no such string exists or "YES" followed by a valid string if it does.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1`**:
     - Reads an integer `n` from input.
     - If `n` is 1 or less, it prints "NO" because it's impossible to have a string with exactly 1 special character (as a special character requires at least one neighbor).
     - If `n` is greater than 1, it prints "YES" and constructs a string `res` by repeating pairs of consecutive letters from 'A' to 'Z' (cycling through the alphabet using `i % 26`).
     - The string `res` is constructed by adding pairs of the same letter until `n` is reduced to 0. If `n` is odd, the last character will be added only once.
     - This approach ensures that each character in the string is a special character, as each character is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

   - **`func_2`**:
     - Reads an integer `t` from input, representing the number of test cases.
     - Calls `func_1` exactly `t` times, handling each test case independently.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Handling of Edge Cases**:
     - For `n = 1`, the function correctly prints "NO" because it's impossible to have a string with exactly 1 special character.
     - For `n > 1`, the function correctly constructs a string with exactly `n` special characters by repeating pairs of letters.
   - **String Length**:
     - The constructed string `res` will have a length of at most 200, which meets the problem's requirement.
   - **Multiple Test Cases**:
     - `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the problem requirements and edge cases. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
