Reasoning:  
- The program structure is clear and follows the problem statement closely.
- `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case, calling `func_1` for each.
- `func_1` reads an integer `n` and checks if `n` is 1 or less. If so, it prints 'NO' because it's impossible to have a string with exactly one special character (as defined in the problem).
- If `n` is greater than 1, it constructs a string `res` by repeating pairs of consecutive letters from 'A' to 'Z', ensuring that each pair contributes exactly two special characters. This approach guarantees that the string will have exactly `n` special characters.
- The string construction logic ensures that the string length does not exceed 200, as required by the problem constraints.
- The output format matches the problem requirements: 'NO' for invalid `n`, and 'YES' followed by the constructed string for valid `n`.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the solution for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
