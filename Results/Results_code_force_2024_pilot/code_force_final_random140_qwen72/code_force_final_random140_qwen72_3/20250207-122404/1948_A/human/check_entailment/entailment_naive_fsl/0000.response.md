Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when `n` is 1 correctly. According to the problem description, if `n` is 1, there should be no suitable string, and the program should print "NO". However, the current implementation will print "YES" followed by a single character, which is incorrect. For example, if the input is `1`, the program will output:

```
YES
A
```

This is incorrect because there cannot be a string with exactly one special character according to the problem's definition. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
