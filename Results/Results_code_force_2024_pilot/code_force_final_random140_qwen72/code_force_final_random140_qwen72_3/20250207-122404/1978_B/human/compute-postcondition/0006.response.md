Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is equal to the first integer in the list `x`, `a` is equal to the second integer in the list `x`, `b` is equal to the third integer in the list `x`, `x` is a list of integers read from input, `profit` is equal to `n * a`.**

Explanation: The variable `profit` is calculated as the product of `n` and `a`, where `n` is the first integer in the list `x` and `a` is the second integer in the list `x`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `x`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
