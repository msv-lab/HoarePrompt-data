The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is non-zero, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an input integer between 0 and 10^4 - 2 and must be non-zero. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be non-zero.

State: **`t` is an input integer between 0 and 10^4 - 2 and must be non-zero, `x` is a new list of integers read from the input, `n` is the first integer in the new list `x`, `a` is the second integer in the new list `x`, `b` is the third integer in the new list `x`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, `profit` is equal to `n * a`. Otherwise, `profit` is equal to `n * a + (b - a) * (k + 1) - k * (k + 1) / 2`, where `k` is the minimum of `n - 1` and `b - a`.**
