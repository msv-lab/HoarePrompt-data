The code snippet `x = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` reads a space-separated list of integers from the input and assigns it to the variable `x`. This updates the value of `x` and, consequently, the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` which are derived from `x`.

Let's break down the impact:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `t` is an input integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1 and must be non-zero.
   - `n` is the first integer in the list `x`.
   - `a` is the second integer in the list `x`.
   - `b` is the third integer in the list `x`.
   - `x` is a list of integers read from input.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The new list `x` is read from the input and replaces the old value of `x`.
   - `n` is now the first integer in the new list `x`.
   - `a` is now the second integer in the new list `x`.
   - `b` is now the third integer in the new list `x`.

3. **Output State**:
   - `t` remains an input integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1 and must be non-zero.
   - `x` is now the new list of integers read from the input.
   - `n` is the first integer in the new list `x`.
   - `a` is the second integer in the new list `x`.
   - `b` is the third integer in the new list `x`.
   - `profit` remains unchanged because the code snippet does not modify it.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1 and must be non-zero, `x` is a new list of integers read from the input, `n` is the first integer in the new list `x`, `a` is the second integer in the new list `x`, `b` is the third integer in the new list `x`, and `profit` remains unchanged.**
