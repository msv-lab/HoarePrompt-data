Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 0 and 10^4 - 2 and must be non-zero, `x` is a new list of integers read from the input, `n` is the first integer in the new list `x`, `a` is the second integer in the new list `x`, `b` is the third integer in the new list `x`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `a = x[1]` assigns the second element of the list `x` to the variable `a`. Since `a` was already defined as the second integer in the new list `x`, this assignment does not change the value of `a`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
