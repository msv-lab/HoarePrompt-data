Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 0 and 10^4 - 2 and must be non-zero, `x` is a new list of integers read from the input, `n` is the first integer in the new list `x`, `a` is the second integer in the new list `x`, `b` is the third integer in the new list `x`, `profit` is equal to `n * a`, `k` is equal to `b - a`.** 

The value of `k` is calculated as the difference between `b` and `a`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
