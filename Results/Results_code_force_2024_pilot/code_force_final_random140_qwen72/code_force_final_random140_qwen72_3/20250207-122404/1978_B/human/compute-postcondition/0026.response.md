To determine what will be printed by the `print(int(profit))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the formula used to calculate `profit`.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1 and must be non-zero.
- `x` is a new list of integers read from the input.
- `n` is the first integer in the new list `x`.
- `a` is the second integer in the new list `x`.
- `b` is the third integer in the new list `x`.
- `k` is now equal to `min(n - 1, b - a)`.
- `profit` is now equal to `n * a + (b - a) * (k + 1) - k * (k + 1) / 2`.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Determine `k`:**
   - `k = min(n - 1, b - a)`
   - This means `k` is the minimum value between `n - 1` and `b - a`.

2. **Calculate `profit`:**
   - `profit = n * a + (b - a) * (k + 1) - k * (k + 1) / 2`
   - Let's break this down further:
     - `n * a` is the product of `n` and `a`.
     - `(b - a) * (k + 1)` is the product of the difference between `b` and `a` and `k + 1`.
     - `k * (k + 1) / 2` is the sum of the first `k` natural numbers (which is a triangular number).

3. **Combine the parts:**
   - `profit = n * a + (b - a) * (k + 1) - k * (k + 1) / 2`

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume some example values to illustrate the calculation:
- Suppose `x = [5, 3, 7]` (so `n = 5`, `a = 3`, `b = 7`).
- Calculate `k`:
  - `k = min(5 - 1, 7 - 3) = min(4, 4) = 4`
- Calculate `profit`:
  - `profit = 5 * 3 + (7 - 3) * (4 + 1) - 4 * (4 + 1) / 2`
  - `profit = 15 + 4 * 5 - 4 * 5 / 2`
  - `profit = 15 + 20 - 10`
  - `profit = 25`

### Final Output:
The `print(int(profit))` statement will print the integer value of `profit` calculated using the given formula.

Output: **25 (where 25 is the integer value of profit calculated using the formula `n * a + (b - a) * (k + 1) - k * (k + 1) / 2` with `k = min(n - 1, b - a)`)**
