Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 0 and 10^4 - 2 and must be non-zero, `x` is a new list of integers read from the input, `n` is the first integer in the new list `x`, `a` is the second integer in the new list `x`, `b` is the third integer in the new list `x`, `profit` is equal to `n * a`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `profit` is calculated as `n * a`, where `n` is the first integer in the list `x` and `a` is the second integer in the list `x`.
- All other variables (`t`, `x`, `n`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
