Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is equal to the first integer in the list `x`, `a` is equal to the second integer in the list `x`, `b` is equal to the third integer in the list `x`, `x` is a list of integers read from input, `profit` is equal to `n * a`, `a` is less than `b`, `k` is equal to the minimum of `n - 1` and `b - a`.** 

Explanation: The value of `k` is updated to the minimum of `n - 1` and the original value of `k` (which was `b - a`). All other variables remain unchanged.
