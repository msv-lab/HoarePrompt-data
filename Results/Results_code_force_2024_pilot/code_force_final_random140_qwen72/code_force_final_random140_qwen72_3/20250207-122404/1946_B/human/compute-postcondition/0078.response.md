The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. It accepts no direct parameters but expects input in a structured form where:

- `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) indicating the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - `n` and `k` are integers (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 · 10^5), where `n` represents the length of the array `a`, and `k` represents the number of operations.
  - `a` is a list of `n` integers (-10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the array.

The function processes each test case according to the given `n`, `k`, and `a`, and returns the result of the operations performed on the array `a` for each test case. The sum of the values of `n` and `k` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n` and `k`, and a list of integers `a`. It returns the result of performing `k` operations on the array `a` for each test case.**
