Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers with values input by the user, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `maxi` is the maximum sum of consecutive non-negative integers encountered before any negative integer whose absolute value is greater than or equal to the current sum, and `c` is the sum of the last sequence of consecutive non-negative integers that did not trigger a reset due to encountering a negative integer with an absolute value greater than or equal to the current sum.**

In natural language, this means:
- The variable `i` remains 0 as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variables `n` and `k` retain their initial values as they are not affected by the loop.
- The list `l` remains unchanged as it is only iterated over and not modified.
- The variable `maxi` holds the maximum sum of consecutive non-negative integers found in the list before encountering a negative integer whose absolute value is greater than or equal to the current sum of those non-negative integers.
- The variable `c` holds the sum of the last sequence of consecutive non-negative integers that did not cause a reset due to encountering such a negative integer. If no such sequence exists (i.e., the loop ends with a reset), `c` will be 0.
