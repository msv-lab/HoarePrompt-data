Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers with values input by the user, `l` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 1 element, `maxi` is 0, `ele` is the first element in the list `l`. If `ele` is negative and `c` is 0, then `c` remains 0. Otherwise, `c` is set to the value of `ele`.***
