Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` and `k` are integers input by the user, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `maxi` is the maximum value between the previous `maxi` and the current `c`, `c` is the sum of all non-negative elements in the list `l` plus any positive contributions from negative elements that did not trigger a reset.**

Explanation:
- The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `l`.
- The initial state variables `i`, `n`, `k`, `maxi`, and `c` remain unchanged.
- The new value of `l` is a list of integers provided by the user.
