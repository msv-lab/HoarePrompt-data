Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` and `k` are integers input by the user, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `maxi` is 0, `c` is 0.**

Explanation: The code snippet sets `maxi` to 0, overriding its previous value (which was the maximum value between the previous `maxi` and the current `c`). The other variables (`i`, `n`, `k`, `l`, and `c`) remain unchanged.
