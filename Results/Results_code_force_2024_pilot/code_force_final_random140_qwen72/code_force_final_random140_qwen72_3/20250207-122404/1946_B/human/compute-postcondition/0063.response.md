Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` and `k` are integers input by the user, `l` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `maxi` is 0, `ele` is the first element in the list `l`. If `ele` is a negative integer and `c` (which is 0) is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `c` remains 0. Otherwise, if `ele` is non-negative or `c` is greater than the absolute value of `ele`, then `c` is updated to `c + ele`.***
