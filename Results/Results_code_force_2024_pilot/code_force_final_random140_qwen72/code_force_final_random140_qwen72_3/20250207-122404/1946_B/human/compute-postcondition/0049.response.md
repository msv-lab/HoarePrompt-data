The code snippet `maxi = max(c, maxi)` updates the value of `maxi` to be the maximum of the current values of `c` and `maxi`.

- `i` remains 1.
- `n` and `k` remain as integers with values input by the user.
- `l` remains a list of integers input by the user.
- `maxi` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the value of `c`.
- `c` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`i` is 1, `n` and `k` are integers with values input by the user, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `maxi` is the maximum of the current values of `c` and `maxi`, and `c` is the sum of all non-negative elements in the list `l` plus any positive contributions from negative elements that did not trigger a reset.**
