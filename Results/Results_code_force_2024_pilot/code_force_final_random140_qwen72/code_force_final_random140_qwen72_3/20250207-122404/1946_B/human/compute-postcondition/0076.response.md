Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `i` is 2.
- `n` and `k` are integers input by the user.
- `l` is a list of integers with at least as many elements as the number of iterations.
- `maxi` is the maximum of the current `c` and the previous `maxi`.
- `c` is the sum of the positive elements in the list `l` since the last negative number encountered, or 0 if no positive elements were added since the last reset.

### Print Statement:
```python
print((2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `maxi` and `c`:**
   - `maxi` is the maximum value between the current `c` and the previous `maxi`.
   - `c` is the sum of positive elements in `l` since the last negative number encountered, or 0 if no positive elements were added since the last reset.

2. **Calculating the Expression:**
   - `2 ** k * maxi`: This part calculates `2` raised to the power of `k` and then multiplies it by `maxi`.
   - `- maxi`: This subtracts `maxi` from the result of the previous multiplication.
   - `+ sum(l)`: This adds the sum of all elements in the list `l` to the result.
   - `% 1000000007`: This takes the result modulo `1000000007`.

### Final Output:
Given the initial state and the expression, the output will be the result of the expression `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007`.

Since the exact values of `n`, `k`, and the list `l` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value. However, we can describe the output in terms of the given variables.

Output: **(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007 (where k is the user-input integer, maxi is the maximum of the current c and the previous maxi, and l is the list of integers)**
