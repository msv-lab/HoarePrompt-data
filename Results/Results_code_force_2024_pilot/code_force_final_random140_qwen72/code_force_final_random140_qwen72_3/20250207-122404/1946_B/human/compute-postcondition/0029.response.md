Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` and `k` are integers with values input by the user, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `maxi` is 0, `c` is 0.**

Explanation: The code snippet sets `maxi` to 0. Since `maxi` was previously defined as the maximum value between `c` and the previous `maxi`, and `c` is 0, setting `maxi` to 0 does not change its value. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `k`, `l`, and `c`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
