Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` and `k` are integers with values input by the user, `l` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 1 element, `maxi` is 0, `c` is `c + ele`, `ele` is the first element in the list `l`. Either `ele` is non-negative, or `c` is greater than the absolute value of `ele`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `c` is updated to `c + ele`.
- All other variables (`i`, `n`, `k`, `l`, `maxi`, and `ele`) remain unchanged.
- The condition that either `ele` is non-negative, or `c` is greater than the absolute value of `ele` still holds true.
