Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` and `k` are integers with values input by the user, `l` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `maxi` is 0, `ele` is the second element in the list `l`. If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `c` is 0. Otherwise, `c` is increased by the second element in the list `l`.***
