Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers with values input by the user, `l` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and 0, `ele` is the second element in the list `l`, `c` is 0.** 

The variable `c` is set to 0, which matches the initial state where `c` was implicitly 0 (since `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and 0). All other variables remain unchanged.
