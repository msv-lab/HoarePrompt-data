Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` is `t-1`, `n` and `k` are integers with values input by the user for the last test case, `l` is a list of integers input by the user for the last test case, `maxi` is the maximum value between the current `c` and the previous `maxi` for the last test case, and `c` is the sum of the positive elements in the list `l` since the last negative number encountered, or 0 if no positive elements were added since the last reset.**

### Explanation:
- **`i` is `t-1`:** The loop runs from `0` to `t-1`, so after all iterations, `i` will be `t-1`.
- **`n` and `k` are integers with values input by the user for the last test case:** These values are specific to the last test case processed.
- **`l` is a list of integers input by the user for the last test case:** This list corresponds to the array `a` for the last test case.
- **`maxi` is the maximum value between the current `c` and the previous `maxi` for the last test case:** `maxi` keeps track of the maximum sum of consecutive non-negative elements encountered during the last test case.
- **`c` is the sum of the positive elements in the list `l` since the last negative number encountered, or 0 if no positive elements were added since the last reset:** `c` is updated based on the current elements being processed in the last test case. If a negative element causes a reset, `c` is set to 0. Otherwise, it accumulates the sum of positive elements.
