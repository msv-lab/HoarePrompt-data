The code snippet `maxi = max(c, maxi)` updates the value of `maxi` to the maximum of `c` and the current value of `maxi`. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `c`, we cannot determine its exact value. However, we know that `maxi` was initially 0, and it will now be updated to the maximum of `c` and 0.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`i` is 1, `n` and `k` are integers with values input by the user, `l` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 3 elements, `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and 0, `ele` is the third element in the list `l`.**
