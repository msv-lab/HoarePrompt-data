Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` and `k` are integers input by the user, `l` is a list of integers with at least as many elements as the number of iterations, `maxi` is the maximum value of `c` before it was reset to 0 due to encountering a negative number, and `c` is the sum of the positive elements in the list `l` since the last negative number encountered, or 0 if no positive elements were added since the last reset.**

In natural language, this means:
- The variable `i` remains 2.
- The variables `n` and `k` retain their original values as they are not modified within the loop.
- The list `l` contains at least as many elements as the number of iterations the loop has executed.
- The variable `maxi` holds the highest value that `c` reached before being reset to 0 when a negative number was encountered.
- The variable `c` is the sum of all positive elements in the list `l` since the last negative number was encountered, or 0 if no positive elements were added since the last reset.
