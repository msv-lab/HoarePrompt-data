Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` and `k` are integers with values input by the user, `l` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 3 elements, `ele` is the third element in the list `l`. If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and 0, and `c` is 0. Otherwise, `maxi` remains 0, and `c` is updated to `c + l[2]`.***
