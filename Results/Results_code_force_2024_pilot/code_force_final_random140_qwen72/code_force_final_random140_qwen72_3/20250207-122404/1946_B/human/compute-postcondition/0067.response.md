The value of `c` is incremented by the value of `ele`. Since `ele` is the second element in the list `l`, `c` is now equal to the second element of `l`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` and `k` are integers input by the user, `l` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `maxi` is 0, `ele` is the second element in the list `l`, `c` is the second element in the list `l`.**
