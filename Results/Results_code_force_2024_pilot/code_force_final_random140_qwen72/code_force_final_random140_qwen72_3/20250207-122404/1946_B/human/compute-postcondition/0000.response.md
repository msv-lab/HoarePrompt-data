To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given state and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - `n` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the length of the array `a` and the number of operations, respectively.
  - `a` is a list of `n` integers where -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the array `a`.
  - The sum of the values of `n` and `k` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop will execute based on the value of `int(input())`, which is expected to be the number of test cases `t`.
- The loop variable `i` will start from 0 and increment by 1 for each iteration.
- For the loop to execute at least once, `int(input())` must be greater than 0.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and the condition for the loop to execute is that `int(input())` must be greater than 0.
- Since `t` is already defined as an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, it ensures that `int(input())` will be at least 1, making the loop execute at least once.

### Final State:
- `i` starts at 0.
- `int(input())` must be greater than 0, which is ensured by the given constraint on `t`.

State: **`i` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0 (ensured by `t` being at least 1)**
