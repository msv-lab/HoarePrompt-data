To determine what will be printed by the given Python code snippet, let's break down the initial state and the operations involved:

### Initial State:
- `i` is 1.
- `n` and `k` are integers input by the user.
- `l` is a list of integers input by the user.
- `maxi` is the maximum value between the previous `maxi` and the current `c`.
- `c` is the sum of all non-negative elements in the list `l` plus any positive contributions from negative elements that did not trigger a reset.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print((2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `c`**:
   - `c` is the sum of all non-negative elements in the list `l` plus any positive contributions from negative elements that did not trigger a reset. This means `c` is a computed value based on the elements of `l`.

2. **Understanding `maxi`**:
   - `maxi` is the maximum value between the previous `maxi` and the current `c`. Since `c` is computed from the list `l`, `maxi` will be the maximum value of `c` encountered so far.

3. **Expression Breakdown**:
   - `2 ** k * maxi`: This computes \(2^k\) multiplied by `maxi`.
   - `- maxi`: This subtracts `maxi` from the result of the previous step.
   - `+ sum(l)`: This adds the sum of all elements in the list `l` to the result of the previous step.
   - `% 1000000007`: This takes the result modulo 1000000007 to ensure the result fits within a certain range.

### Final Output:
The final output will be the result of the expression \((2^k \times \text{maxi} - \text{maxi} + \sum(\text{l})) \mod 1000000007\).

### Explanation:
- `2 ** k` is the power of 2 raised to the integer `k`.
- `maxi` is the maximum value between the previous `maxi` and the current `c`, where `c` is the sum of non-negative elements and positive contributions from negative elements in `l`.
- `sum(l)` is the sum of all elements in the list `l`.
- The entire expression is then taken modulo 1000000007 to ensure the result is within a specific range.

### Output:
Output: **(2^k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007 (where k is the user-input integer, maxi is the maximum value between the previous maxi and the current c, and l is the list of integers input by the user)**
