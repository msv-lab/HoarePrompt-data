The value of `maxi` is updated to the maximum of `c` and `maxi`. Given that `c` is 0 and `maxi` is also 0, the value of `maxi` remains 0. The other variables are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` and `k` are integers input by the user, `l` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `maxi` is 0, `c` is 0, `ele` is the first element in the list `l`, and `ele` is a negative integer such that `c` (which is 0) is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`.**
