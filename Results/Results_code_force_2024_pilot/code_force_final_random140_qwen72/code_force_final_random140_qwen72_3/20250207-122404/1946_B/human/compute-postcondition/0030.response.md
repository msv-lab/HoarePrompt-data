To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `ele` and `l`.

- The variable `ele` will take the value of each element in the list `l` during each iteration of the loop.
- For the loop to execute, the list `l` must contain at least one element.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 1 (not relevant to the loop head)
- `n` and `k` are integers with values input by the user (not relevant to the loop head)
- `l` is a list of integers input by the user
- `maxi` is 0 (not relevant to the loop head)
- `c` is 0 (not relevant to the loop head)

For the loop to execute, the list `l` must have at least one element. The variable `ele` will be the first element of the list `l` at the start of the first iteration.

State: **`i` is 1, `n` and `k` are integers with values input by the user, `l` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 1 element, `maxi` is 0, `c` is 0, `ele` is the first element in the list `l`**
