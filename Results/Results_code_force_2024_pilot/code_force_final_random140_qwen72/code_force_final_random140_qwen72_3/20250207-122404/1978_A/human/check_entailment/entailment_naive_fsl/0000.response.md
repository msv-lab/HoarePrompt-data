Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program always takes the last element of the list and the largest element of the remaining list, which does not necessarily result in the maximum sum of the highest pages in two piles. 

A counterexample to illustrate this issue:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  4
  4 1 2 3
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  7
  ```
- Actual Output from the Program:
  ```
  6
  ```

In this case, the optimal division would be to place the books with 4 and 3 pages in one pile and the books with 2 and 1 pages in another pile. This way, Alice reads the books with 4 and 3 pages, totaling 7 pages. However, the program incorrectly outputs 6 because it only considers the last element and the largest of the remaining elements, leading to a suboptimal solution.
