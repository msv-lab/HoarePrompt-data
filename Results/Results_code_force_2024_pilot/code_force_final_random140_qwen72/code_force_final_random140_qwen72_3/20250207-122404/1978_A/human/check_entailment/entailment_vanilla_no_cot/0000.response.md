Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem as described. The goal is to maximize the sum of the largest page counts from two non-empty piles. However, the current implementation simply takes the last element of the list and the largest element of the remaining list, which does not necessarily result in the optimal division of books into two piles.

To solve this problem correctly, you should:
1. Sort the list of page counts.
2. Take the two largest elements from the sorted list, as these will be the maximum possible values for the two piles.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input().strip())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        ls = list(map(int, input().split()))
        ls.sort()
        # The two largest elements will give the maximum sum when divided into two piles
        print(ls[-1] + ls[-2])
```

This version ensures that the two largest page counts are used, which maximizes the total number of pages Alice can read.
