The code `ls = input().split()` reads a line of input from the user and splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace. This list is then stored in the variable `ls`. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, and `a`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `ls` is a list of strings obtained from the input.**
