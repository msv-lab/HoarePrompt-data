The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), which ensures that the loop will execute if `t` is within this range. The variable `i` should start at 0 for the loop to begin.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9**
