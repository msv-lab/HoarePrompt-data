Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `ls` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `last` is the integer value of the last element removed from `ls`, `other` is the integer value of the largest element in the sorted `ls`.**

Explanation:
- The code `ls = input().split()` reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings.
- The variable `ls` is updated to this new list of strings.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `a`, `last`, `other`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
