To determine what will be printed by the `print(last + other)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the operations involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive).
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100.
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
   - `ls` is a list of strings obtained from the input with one less element.
   - `last` is the integer value of the last element removed from `ls`.
   - `other` is the integer value of the largest element in the sorted `ls`.

2. **Steps to Determine the Output:**
   - `ls` is a list of strings, and the last element is removed and converted to an integer to get `last`.
   - The remaining elements in `ls` are then sorted, and the largest element is converted to an integer to get `other`.
   - The sum of `last` and `other` is then printed.

3. **Explanation:**
   - `last` is the integer value of the last element removed from `ls`.
   - `other` is the integer value of the largest element in the sorted `ls` after the last element has been removed.
   - The `print(last + other)` statement will print the sum of these two integer values.

Given the initial state and the operations described, the output will be the sum of the integer value of the last element removed from `ls` and the integer value of the largest element in the sorted `ls`.

Output: **last + other (where last is the integer value of the last element removed from ls and other is the integer value of the largest element in the sorted ls)**
