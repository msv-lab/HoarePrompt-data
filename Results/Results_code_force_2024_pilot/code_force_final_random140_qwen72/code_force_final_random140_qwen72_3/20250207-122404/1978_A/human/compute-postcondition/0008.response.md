Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `ls` is a list of strings obtained from the input with one less element, `last` is the integer value of the last element removed from `ls`, `other` is the integer value of the largest element in the sorted `ls`.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input().strip())` updates the value of `n` to a new input integer. The new value of `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100. All other variables (`t`, `i`, `a`, `ls`, `last`, `other`) remain unchanged.
