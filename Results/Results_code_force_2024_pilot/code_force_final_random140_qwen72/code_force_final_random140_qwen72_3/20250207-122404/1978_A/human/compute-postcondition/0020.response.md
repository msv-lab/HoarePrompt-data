The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the given parameter constraints, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts the following parameters:

- `t`: An integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, representing the number of test cases.
- `n`: An integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, representing the number of books for each test case.
- `a`: A list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the number of pages in each book.

Given these parameters, the function processes each test case and returns some output based on the number of pages in the books. Since the specific output is not detailed, I'll describe the general functionality based on the provided information.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t` (an integer representing the number of test cases), `n` (an integer representing the number of books for each test case), and `a` (a list of integers representing the number of pages in each book). The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the number of pages in the books.**
