The code snippet `other = int(sorted(ls).pop())` sorts the list `ls`, removes and returns the last element of the sorted list, and assigns the integer value of this element to the variable `other`.

- The list `ls` is sorted, which does not change the original list `ls` because the `sorted()` function returns a new list.
- The last element of the sorted list is removed using `.pop()`, and its integer value is assigned to `other`.
- The variable `other` now holds the integer value of the largest element in the sorted `ls`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive).
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100.
- `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
- `ls` is a list of strings obtained from the input with one element removed.
- `last` is the integer value of the last element removed from `ls`.
- `other` is the integer value of the largest element in the sorted `ls`.

After executing the code snippet, the updated state is:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive).
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100.
- `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
- `ls` is a list of strings obtained from the input with one element removed.
- `last` is the integer value of the last element removed from `ls`.
- `other` is the integer value of the largest element in the sorted `ls`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `ls` is a list of strings obtained from the input with one element removed, `last` is the integer value of the last element removed from `ls`, `other` is the integer value of the largest element in the sorted `ls`.**
