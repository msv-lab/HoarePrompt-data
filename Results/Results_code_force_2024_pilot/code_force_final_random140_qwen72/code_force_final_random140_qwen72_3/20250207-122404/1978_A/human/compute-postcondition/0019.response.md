Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `i` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `ls` is a list of strings obtained from the input with one element removed, `last` is the integer value of the last element removed from `ls`, `other` is the integer value of the largest element in the sorted `ls`.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: The total number of test cases remains the same, as it is defined before the loop starts and does not change within the loop.
- **`i`**: After all iterations, `i` will be equal to `t-1` because the loop runs from `0` to `t-1`.
- **`n`**: For each iteration, `n` is read from the input, and it represents the number of books for that specific test case. Since the loop iterates `t` times, `n` will be the value of the last test case.
- **`a`**: This variable is not directly modified within the loop, so it remains a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and \(10^9\).
- **`ls`**: In each iteration, `ls` is a list of strings obtained from the input, and the last element is removed. After the final iteration, `ls` will still be a list of strings with one element removed.
- **`last`**: This is the integer value of the last element removed from `ls` during the final iteration.
- **`other`**: This is the integer value of the largest element in the sorted `ls` during the final iteration.
