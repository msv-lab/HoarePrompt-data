The code `last = int(ls.pop())` removes the last element from the list `ls` and assigns its integer value to the variable `last`. The length of `ls` is reduced by 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `ls` is a list of strings obtained from the input with one less element, `last` is the integer value of the last element removed from `ls`.**
