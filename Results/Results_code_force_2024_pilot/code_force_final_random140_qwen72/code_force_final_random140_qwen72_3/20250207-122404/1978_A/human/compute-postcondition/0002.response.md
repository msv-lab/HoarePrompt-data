The value of `n` is updated to the integer value obtained from the input. The other variables (`t`, `i`, and `a`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9**
