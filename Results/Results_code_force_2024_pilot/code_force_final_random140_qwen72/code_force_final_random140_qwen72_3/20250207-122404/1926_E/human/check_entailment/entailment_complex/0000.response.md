Reasoning:  
The program aims to solve the problem by determining the k-th card laid down by Vladislav according to the specified rules. The logic involves calculating the position of the k-th card by considering the sequence of laying down odd-numbered cards, followed by multiples of these odd numbers.

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**: The function starts by reading the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.

2. **Initial Setup**: 
   - `n_back` stores the original value of `n`.
   - `s` is initialized to `(n + 1) // 2`, which represents the count of odd-numbered cards.
   - `n` is also set to `(n + 1) // 2`, which is the same as `s` initially.
   - `m` is initialized to 1, representing the multiplier for the current sequence of cards being laid down.

3. **Loop to Find the Correct Sequence**:
   - The loop continues until `s` (the cumulative count of cards laid down) is less than `k`.
   - Inside the loop, if `n` becomes 0, it means there are no more cards in the current sequence, so it resets `s` to `n_back` and sets `n` to 1 to break out of the loop.
   - Otherwise, it multiplies `m` by 2 and divides `n` by 2 to move to the next sequence of cards (e.g., from odd to double odd, etc.).
   - `s` is updated by adding the new value of `n` to it.

4. **Final Calculation**:
   - The final position of the k-th card is calculated using the formula `(2 * (k - (s - n)) - 1) * m`.
   - This formula correctly identifies the k-th card by adjusting the position within the current sequence and applying the appropriate multiplier.

5. **Output**:
   - The result is printed for each test case.

The program correctly handles the sequence of laying down cards and calculates the k-th card accurately based on the given rules. The logic and calculations align with the problem statement and the expected output.

Correctness: **True**
