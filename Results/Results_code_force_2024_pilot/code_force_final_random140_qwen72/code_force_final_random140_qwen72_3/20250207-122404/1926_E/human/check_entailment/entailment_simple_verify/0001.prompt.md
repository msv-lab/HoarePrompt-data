You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n cards numbered 1, 2, \dots, n . He wants to lay them down in a
row as follows:

  * First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 2 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 3 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 4 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 4 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * And so on, until all cards are laid down. 

What is the k -th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a
card down, he cannot use that card again.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n
\leq 10^9 ) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you
need to output.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the k -th card Vladislav lays
down.

Note

In the first seven test cases, n=7 . Vladislav lays down the cards as follows:

  * First — all the odd-numbered cards in the order 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . 
  * Next — all cards that are twice an odd number in the order 2 , 6 . 
  * Next, there are no remaining cards that are 3 times an odd number. (Vladislav has only one of each card.) 
  * Next — all cards that are 4 times an odd number, and there is only one such card: 4 . 
  * There are no more cards left, so Vladislav stops. 

Thus the order of cards is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 2 , 6 , 4 .

    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `t` is 0, `_` is `t - 1`, `n` is 1 if it became 0 at any point during the loop, otherwise it is the result of repeatedly halving the initial `n` until it is less than `k`, `n_back` remains the original `n` for each iteration, `s` is `n_back` if `n` became 0 at any point, otherwise it is the sum of the initial `s` and all the values of `n` added during the loop, `m` is \(2^{\text{number of iterations}}\) for each test case, and the final printed value for each test case is \((2 * (k - (s - n)) - 1) * m\).



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves laying down cards in a specific sequence: first the odd numbers, then the numbers that are twice an odd number, then three times an odd number, and so on.
   - We need to find the k-th card laid down in this sequence.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`.
   - It initializes `n_back` with the value of `n` to keep track of the original number of cards.
   - It calculates `s` as `(n + 1) // 2`, which represents the number of odd-numbered cards.
   - It sets `n` to `s` and initializes `m` to 1.
   - The program enters a loop where it checks if `s` (the current count of cards laid down) is less than `k`.
     - If `n` (the current count of cards in the current group) is zero, it resets `s` to `n_back` and `n` to 1, breaking the loop.
     - Otherwise, it multiplies `m` by 2 (to move to the next group of cards) and divides `n` by 2 (to update the count of cards in the current group).
     - It adds `n` to `s` to update the total count of cards laid down.
   - Finally, it prints the k-th card using the formula `(2 * (k - (s - n)) - 1) * m`.

3. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly handles the initial placement of odd-numbered cards.
   - It correctly moves to the next group of cards (twice an odd number, three times an odd number, etc.) by updating `m` and `n`.
   - The formula `(2 * (k - (s - n)) - 1) * m` correctly calculates the k-th card in the sequence.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases such as when `n` is 1 or when `k` is equal to `n`.
   - It also correctly handles large values of `n` and `k` up to \(10^9\).

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles the sequence of laying down cards and correctly identifies the k-th card in the sequence.
