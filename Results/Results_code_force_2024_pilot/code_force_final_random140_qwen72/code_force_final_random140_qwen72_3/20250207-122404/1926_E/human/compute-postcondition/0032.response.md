Output State: **`g` is updated to `g + (h + 1) // 2`, `i` must be at least 4, if `i = 4`, then `i - 1 = 3`, and `p = 3` will satisfy the condition `p <= i - 1`.** 

Explanation: The value of `g` is incremented by the integer division of `(h + 1)` by 2. The conditions regarding `i` and `p` remain unchanged.
