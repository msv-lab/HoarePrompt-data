Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `s` is 0, `i` is 0, `d` is `n`, `h` is `n`.**

Explanation: The variable `h` is assigned the value of `n`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `s`, `i`, `d`) remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions plus the new assignment of `h` to `n`.
