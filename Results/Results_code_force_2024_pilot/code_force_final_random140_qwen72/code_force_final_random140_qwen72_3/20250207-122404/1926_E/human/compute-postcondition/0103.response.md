Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`. It then calculates and prints a specific value based on these inputs. The function does not return any value but outputs the calculated result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes its execution, and the state of the program reflects that all test cases have been processed and the corresponding results have been printed. **
