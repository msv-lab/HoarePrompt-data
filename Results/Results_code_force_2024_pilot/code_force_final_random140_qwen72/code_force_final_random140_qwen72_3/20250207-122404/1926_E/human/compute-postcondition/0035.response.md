Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `s` is equal to `k` (or the maximum value it can reach without exceeding `k`), `i` is the total number of iterations the loop ran, `d` is 0 or a small positive integer (depending on the exact values of `n` and `k`), `h` is reduced to 0 or a very small positive integer, `p` is equal to `i`, `g` is the sum of the series \(\sum_{j=0}^{i-1} \left\lfloor \frac{n + 1}{2^j} \right\rfloor\), and `k` is still greater than \(\frac{n + 1}{2}\).**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains an integer within the specified range.
- **`n` and `k`**: Remain integers within their specified ranges, with `k` still greater than \(\frac{n + 1}{2}\).
- **`s`**: Remains equal to `k` or the maximum value it can reach without exceeding `k`.
- **`i`**: The total number of iterations the loop ran.
- **`d`**: Remains 0 or a small positive integer depending on the values of `n` and `k`.
- **`h`**: After each iteration, `h` is reduced by \(\left\lfloor \frac{h + 1}{2} \right\rfloor\). After `i` iterations, `h` will be reduced to 0 or a very small positive integer.
- **`p`**: Incremented by 1 in each iteration, so after `i` iterations, `p` will be equal to `i`.
- **`g`**: Updated in each iteration by adding \(\left\lfloor \frac{h + 1}{2} \right\rfloor\) to `g`. The final value of `g` will be the sum of the series \(\sum_{j=0}^{i-1} \left\lfloor \frac{n + 1}{2^j} \right\rfloor\).

This output state reflects the final values of the variables after the loop has completed all its iterations.
