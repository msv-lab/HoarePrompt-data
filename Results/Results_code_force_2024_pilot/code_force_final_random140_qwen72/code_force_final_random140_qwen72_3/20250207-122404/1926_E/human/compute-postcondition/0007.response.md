Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `s` is 0, `i` is 0, `d` is `n`, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0.** 

The variable `g` is initialized to 0, while the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `s`, `i`, `d`, `h`, `p`) retain their initial values.
