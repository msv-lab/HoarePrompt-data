Output State: **`s` is 0, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are updated to the values provided by the input, `i` is 0, `d` is now equal to `n`, `h` is now equal to `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, `k` is still greater than \(\frac{n + 1}{2}\) if `k` > \((n + 1) // 2\), otherwise `k` is less than or equal to \((n + 1) // 2\), `f` is equal to `k - g`, and `y` is equal to \(2^{(i - 1)} \times (k - g)\) if `k` > \((n + 1) // 2\), otherwise `f` is 0 and `y` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The variable `g` is set to 0.
- All other variables (`s`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `i`, `d`, `h`, `p`, `f`, and `y`) retain their initial values or conditions.
- The condition for `k` being greater than or less than \((n + 1) // 2\) remains unchanged.
- The value of `f` is recalculated as `k - g`, which simplifies to `k - 0` or just `k`.
- The value of `y` is recalculated based on the new value of `f` and the condition for `k`. If `k` is greater than \((n + 1) // 2\), then `y` is \(2^{(i - 1)} \times k\). Otherwise, `f` is 0 and `y` is 0.
