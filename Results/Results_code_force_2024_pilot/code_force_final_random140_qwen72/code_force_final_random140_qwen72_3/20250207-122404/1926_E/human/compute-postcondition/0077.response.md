Output State: **After all iterations, `s` is `k`, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are updated to the values provided by the input, `i` is the number of iterations required to reach `s = k`, `d` is 0, `h` is 0, `p` is `i`, `g` is `n`, `f` is `k - n`, and `y` is \(2^{(i - 1)} \times (k - n)\).**

Explanation:
- The code `y = 2 ** (i - 1) * f` updates the value of `y`.
- `f` is defined as `k - n`.
- Therefore, `y` is calculated as \(2^{(i - 1)} \times (k - n)\).
- All other variables (`s`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `i`, `d`, `h`, `p`, `g`, `f`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
