Output State: **`s` is \((n + 1) // 2 + (n + 1) // 4\), `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than \((n + 1) // 2\), `i` is 2, `d` is \(\frac{n - 1}{2} - \left\lfloor \frac{n + 1}{4} \right\rfloor\), `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, `f` is `k - g`, `y` is \(2^{(i - 1)} \times (k - g)\)**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing from 1 to 2.
- All other variables (`s`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `d`, `h`, `p`, `g`, `f`, `y`) remain unchanged.
- The value of `y` is calculated as \(2^{(i - 1)} \times (k - g)\). Since `i` is now 2, `y` becomes \(2^{(2 - 1)} \times (k - g) = 2 \times (k - g)\). However, since `g` is 0, `y` simplifies to \(2 \times k\).
