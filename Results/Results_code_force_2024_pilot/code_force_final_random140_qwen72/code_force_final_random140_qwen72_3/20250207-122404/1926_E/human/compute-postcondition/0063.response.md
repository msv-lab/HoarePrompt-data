To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute at least once, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head: `p <= i - 1`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The variables in the loop head are `p` and `i`.
2. **Initial Values**:
   - `p` is 1.
   - `i` is the number of iterations required to reach `s = k`.

3. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will execute if `p <= i - 1`.
   - Substituting the initial values, the condition becomes `1 <= i - 1`.

4. **Simplify the Condition**:
   - `1 <= i - 1` simplifies to `2 <= i`.

5. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be at least 2.

### Conclusion:
The only adjustment needed is to ensure that `i` is at least 2. All other states remain unchanged.

### Final State:
State: **`s` is `k`, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are updated to the values provided by the input, `i` is the number of iterations required to reach `s = k` and must be at least 2, `d` is 0, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, `f` is `k - g`, and `y` is \(2^{(i - 1)} \times (k - g)\) if `k` > \((n + 1) // 2\), otherwise `f` is 0 and `y` is 0.**
