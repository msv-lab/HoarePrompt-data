The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is the loop counter, and the expression `int(input())` determines the number of iterations. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The initial state of `t`, `n`, and `k` does not directly affect the loop's ability to execute, but they must still meet their given constraints.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the input value for the loop is at least 1, and the other variables (`t`, `n`, and `k`) should remain within their specified ranges.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and the input value for the loop (int(input())) must be greater than 0**
