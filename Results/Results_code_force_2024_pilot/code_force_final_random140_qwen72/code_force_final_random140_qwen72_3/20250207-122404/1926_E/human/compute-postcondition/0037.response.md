Output State: **`t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `s` is equal to `k` (or the maximum value it can reach without exceeding `k`), `i` is the total number of iterations the loop ran, `d` is 0 or a small positive integer, `h` is reduced to 0 or a very small positive integer, `p` is equal to `i`, `g` is the sum of the series \(\sum_{j=0}^{i-1} \left\lfloor \frac{n + 1}{2^j} \right\rfloor\), `k` is still greater than \(\frac{n + 1}{2}\), `f` is equal to `k - g`, `y` is equal to \(2^{(i - 1)} \times (k - g)\).**
