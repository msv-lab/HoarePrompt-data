Output State: **`s` is \((n + 1) // 2 + (n + 1) // 4 + (d + 1) // 2\), `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than \((n + 1) // 2\), `i` is 2, `d` is \(\frac{n - 1}{2} - \left\lfloor \frac{n + 1}{4} \right\rfloor\), `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, `f` is `k - g`, `y` is \(2^{(i - 1)} \times (k - g)\)**

Explanation:
- The value of `s` is updated by adding \((d + 1) // 2\) to its current value.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `i`, `d`, `h`, `p`, `g`, `f`, `y`) remain unchanged from their initial values.
