To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions in the loop head: `s < k` and `d > 0`.

### Current State:
- `s` is \((n + 1) // 2\)
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4
- `n` and `k` are updated to the values provided by the input
- `i` is 1
- `d` is \(\frac{n - 1}{2}\)
- `h` is `n`
- `p` is 1
- `g` is 0
- `k` is still greater than \(\frac{n + 1}{2}\) if `k` > \((n + 1) // 2\), otherwise `k` is less than or equal to \((n + 1) // 2\)
- `f` is `k - g`
- `y` is \(2^{(i - 1)} \times (k - g)\) if `k` > \((n + 1) // 2\), otherwise `f` is 0 and `y` is 0

### Loop Condition Analysis:
1. **Condition 1: `s < k`**
   - `s` is \((n + 1) // 2\)
   - `k` is greater than \(\frac{n + 1}{2}\) if `k` > \((n + 1) // 2\), otherwise `k` is less than or equal to \((n + 1) // 2\)
   - For the loop to execute again, `s` must be less than `k`. Given that `s` is \((n + 1) // 2\), `k` must be greater than \((n + 1) // 2\).

2. **Condition 2: `d > 0`**
   - `d` is \(\frac{n - 1}{2}\)
   - For the loop to execute again, `d` must be greater than 0. Given that `d` is \(\frac{n - 1}{2}\), `n` must be greater than 1.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **For `s < k`:** `k` must be greater than \((n + 1) // 2\).
- **For `d > 0`:** `n` must be greater than 1.

Since `n` and `k` are provided by the input and are not directly adjustable, we need to ensure that the conditions are met based on the given values.

### Final State:
- `s` is \((n + 1) // 2\)
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4
- `n` is greater than 1
- `k` is greater than \((n + 1) // 2\)
- `i` is 1
- `d` is \(\frac{n - 1}{2}\)
- `h` is `n`
- `p` is 1
- `g` is 0
- `f` is `k - g`
- `y` is \(2^{(i - 1)} \times (k - g)\)

State: **`s` is \((n + 1) // 2\), `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than \((n + 1) // 2\), `i` is 1, `d` is \(\frac{n - 1}{2}\), `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, `f` is `k - g`, `y` is \(2^{(i - 1)} \times (k - g)\)**
