Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `s` is `(d + 1) // 2`, `i` is 0, `d` is `(n - (n + 1) // 2)`, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, and `k` is greater than `(n + 1) // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `d` is updated to `d - (d + 1) // 2`.
- Since `d` was initially `n`, the new value of `d` is `n - (n + 1) // 2`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
