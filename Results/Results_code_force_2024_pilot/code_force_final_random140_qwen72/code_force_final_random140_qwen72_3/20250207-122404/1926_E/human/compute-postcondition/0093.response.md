Output State: **`n` and `k` are updated to the values provided by the input, `s` is `(n + 1) // 2`, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `i` is 1, `d` is `n - (n + 1) // 2`, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, `f` is 0 or `k - n`, `y` is 0 or \(2^{(i - 1)} \times (k - n)\). `k` must be greater than 0 and `n` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing from 0 to 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
