The code snippet `f = k - g` updates the value of `f` to be the difference between `k` and `g`. Given the initial state, `g` is already defined as `n`, and `f` was previously defined as `k - g`. Since `g` is `n`, the new value of `f` remains `k - n`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **After all iterations, `s` is `k`, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are updated to the values provided by the input, `i` is the number of iterations required to reach `s = k`, `d` is 0, `h` is 0, `p` is `i`, `g` is `n`, `f` is `k - n`, and `y` is \(2^{(i - 1)} \times (k - n)\) if `k` > \((n + 1) // 2\), otherwise `f` is 0 and `y` is 0.**
