The code snippet `d -= (d + 1) // 2` updates the value of `d` by subtracting the integer division of `(d + 1)` by 2 from `d`. Let's break down the impact of this code:

- Initially, `d` is set to `n`.
- The expression `(d + 1) // 2` calculates the integer division of `d + 1` by 2.
- This result is then subtracted from `d`.

Let's calculate the new value of `d`:

1. **Initial Value of `d`:** `d` is `n`.
2. **Expression Calculation:** `(d + 1) // 2` is equivalent to `(n + 1) // 2`.
3. **Subtraction:** `d -= (d + 1) // 2` becomes `d -= (n + 1) // 2`.

So, the new value of `d` is:
\[ d = n - \left( \frac{n + 1}{2} \right) \]

Simplifying this:
\[ d = n - \left( \frac{n + 1}{2} \right) = \frac{2n - (n + 1)}{2} = \frac{2n - n - 1}{2} = \frac{n - 1}{2} \]

Therefore, the new value of `d` is \(\frac{n - 1}{2}\).

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is \((n + 1) // 2\), `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are updated to the values provided by the input, `i` is 0, `d` is \(\frac{n - 1}{2}\), `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, `k` is still greater than \(\frac{n + 1}{2}\) if `k` > \((n + 1) // 2\), otherwise `k` is less than or equal to \((n + 1) // 2\), `f` is `k - g`, and `y` is \(2^{(i - 1)} \times (k - g)\) if `k` > \((n + 1) // 2\), otherwise `f` is 0 and `y` is 0.**
