The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided code snippet, but based on the parameter constraints and relationships given, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts at least two parameters: `n` and `k`, and possibly an additional parameter `t` representing the number of test cases. Each of these parameters has specific constraints: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, and for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9.

However, since the exact output of the function is not specified in the problem statement, I will describe the functionality based on the typical structure of such functions:

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `k`, where `t` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4), and for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9). The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the values of `n` and `k`.**
