To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition:

```python
while p <= i - 1:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

The loop condition checks if `p` is less than or equal to `i - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, this condition must be true.

### Current State:
- `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4
- `n` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9
- `s` is equal to `k` (or the maximum value it can reach without exceeding `k`)
- `i` must be at least 2
- `d` is 0 or a small positive integer (depending on the exact values of `n` and `k`)
- `h` is now \(\frac{n - 1}{2}\)
- `p` is now 2
- `g` is now \(\frac{n + 1}{2}\)
- `k` is still greater than \(\frac{n + 1}{2}\)

### Analysis:
- The loop condition is `p <= i - 1`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `p` is 2.
- `i` must be at least 2, so `i - 1` must be at least 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `p` must be less than or equal to `i - 1`. Since `p` is 2, `i - 1` must be at least 2, which means `i` must be at least 3.

### Adjusted State:
- `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4
- `n` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9
- `s` is equal to `k` (or the maximum value it can reach without exceeding `k`)
- `i` must be at least 3
- `d` is 0 or a small positive integer (depending on the exact values of `n` and `k`)
- `h` is now \(\frac{n - 1}{2}\)
- `p` is now 2
- `g` is now \(\frac{n + 1}{2}\)
- `k` is still greater than \(\frac{n + 1}{2}\)

State: **`t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `s` is equal to `k` (or the maximum value it can reach without exceeding `k`), `i` must be at least 3, `d` is 0 or a small positive integer (depending on the exact values of `n` and `k`), `h` is now \(\frac{n - 1}{2}\), `p` is now 2, `g` is now \(\frac{n + 1}{2}\), and `k` is still greater than \(\frac{n + 1}{2}\)**
