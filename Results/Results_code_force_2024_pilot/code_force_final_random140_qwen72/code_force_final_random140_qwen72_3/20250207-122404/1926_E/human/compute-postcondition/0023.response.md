To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop condition:

### Given State:
- `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4
- `n` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9
- `s` is equal to `k` (or the maximum value it can reach without exceeding `k`)
- `i` is the number of iterations the loop ran
- `d` is 0 or a small positive integer (depending on the exact values of `n` and `k`)
- `h` remains `n`
- `p` remains 1
- `g` remains 0
- `k` is still greater than `(n + 1) // 2`

### Loop Condition:
```
while p <= i - 1:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop condition is `p <= i - 1`.
- For the loop to execute at least once, `p` must be less than or equal to `i - 1`.

### Current Values:
- `p` is 1.
- `i` is the number of iterations the loop ran.

### Adjustments Needed:
- For the loop to execute the first time, `p` must be less than or equal to `i - 1`.
- Since `p` is 1, `i - 1` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.
- Therefore, `i` must be at least 2.

### Conclusion:
- The only variable that needs to be adjusted is `i`. It must be at least 2 for the loop to execute the first time.

### Final State:
State: **`t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `s` is equal to `k` (or the maximum value it can reach without exceeding `k`), `i` must be at least 2, `d` is 0 or a small positive integer (depending on the exact values of `n` and `k`), `h` remains `n`, `p` remains 1, `g` remains 0, and `k` is still greater than `(n + 1) // 2`**
