Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 2, `_` is 2, `m` is \(2^{\text{number of iterations}}\), `s` is `n_back` if `n` became 0 at any point, otherwise it is the sum of the initial `s` and all the values of `n` added during the loop, `n` is 1 if it became 0 at any point, otherwise it is the result of repeatedly halving the initial `n` until it is less than `k`, `n_back` remains the first input integer.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`_`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`m`**: Doubles with each iteration of the loop. After `i` iterations, `m` will be \(2^i\).
- **`s`**: Initially, `s` is \((n + 1) // 2\). In each iteration, `n` is halved and added to `s`. If `n` becomes 0, `s` is reset to `n_back` and `n` is set to 1, breaking the loop.
- **`n`**: Halves with each iteration. If it becomes 0, it is reset to 1 and the loop breaks. Otherwise, it continues to halve until it is less than `k`.
- **`n_back`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
