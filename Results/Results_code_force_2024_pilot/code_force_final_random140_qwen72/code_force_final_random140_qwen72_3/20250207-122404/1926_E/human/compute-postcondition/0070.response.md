The value of `p` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is `k`, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are updated to the values provided by the input, `i` is the number of iterations required to reach `s = k` and must be at least 2, `d` is 0, `h` is \(\left\lfloor \frac{n - \left\lfloor \frac{n + 1}{2} \right\rfloor + 1}{2} \right\rfloor\), `p` is 3, `g` is \(\left\lfloor \frac{n - \left\lfloor \frac{n + 1}{2} \right\rfloor + 1}{2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{h + 1}{2} \right\rfloor\), `f` is `k - g`, `y` is \(2^{(i - 1)} \times (k - g)\) if `k` > \(\left\lfloor \frac{n + 1}{2} \right\rfloor\), otherwise `f` is 0 and `y` is 0.**
