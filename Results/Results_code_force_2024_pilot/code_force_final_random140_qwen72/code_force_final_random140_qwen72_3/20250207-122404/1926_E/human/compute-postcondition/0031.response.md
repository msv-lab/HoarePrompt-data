To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition:

```python
while p <= i - 1:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Condition:**
   - The variables in the loop head are `p` and `i`.

2. **Current State of These Variables:**
   - `p` is now 3.
   - `i` must be at least 3.

3. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop will execute if `p` is less than or equal to `i - 1`.

4. **Evaluate the Current Condition:**
   - Given `p = 3` and `i` must be at least 3, the smallest possible value for `i` is 3.
   - If `i = 3`, then `i - 1 = 2`.
   - Therefore, `p = 3` is not less than or equal to `i - 1 = 2`, so the loop will not execute.

5. **Adjust the State:**
   - To ensure the loop executes one more time, `i` must be at least 4.
   - If `i = 4`, then `i - 1 = 3`, and `p = 3` will satisfy the condition `p <= i - 1`.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop executes one more time, `i` must be at least 4.

### Final State:
State: **`t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `s` is equal to `k` (or the maximum value it can reach without exceeding `k`), `i` must be at least 4, `d` is 0 or a small positive integer (depending on the exact values of `n` and `k`), `h` is now \(\frac{n - 1}{4}\), `p` is now 3, `g` is now \(\frac{n + 1}{2} + \left(\frac{\frac{n - 1}{2} + 1}{2}\right)\), and `k` is still greater than \(\frac{n + 1}{2}\)**.
