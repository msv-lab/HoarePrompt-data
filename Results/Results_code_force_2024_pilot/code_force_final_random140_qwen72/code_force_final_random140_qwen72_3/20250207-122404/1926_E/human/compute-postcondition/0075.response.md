Output State: **After all iterations, `s` is `k`, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are updated to the values provided by the input, `i` is the number of iterations required to reach `s = k`, `d` is 0, `h` is 0, `p` is `i`, `g` is `n`, `f` is `k - g`, and `y` is \(2^{(i - 1)} \times (k - g)\) if `k` > \((n + 1) // 2\), otherwise `f` is 0 and `y` is 0.**

### Explanation:
- **`s`**: Remains `k` as it is not modified in the loop.
- **`t`**: Remains an integer within the specified range as it is not modified in the loop.
- **`n` and `k`**: Remain the values provided by the input as they are not modified in the loop.
- **`i`**: The number of iterations required to reach `s = k`.
- **`d`**: Remains 0 as it is not modified in the loop.
- **`h`**: After each iteration, `h` is reduced by \(\left\lfloor \frac{h + 1}{2} \right\rfloor\). After `i` iterations, `h` will be 0 because it is repeatedly halved and rounded down.
- **`p`**: Starts at 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration. After `i` iterations, `p` will be `i`.
- **`g`**: Initially 0, `g` is incremented by \(\left\lfloor \frac{h + 1}{2} \right\rfloor\) in each iteration. Since `h` starts at `n` and is halved and rounded down in each iteration, `g` will sum up to `n` after `i` iterations.
- **`f`**: After `i` iterations, `g` will be `n`, so `f` will be `k - n`.
- **`y`**: If `k` is greater than \((n + 1) // 2\), `y` will be \(2^{(i - 1)} \times (k - n)\). Otherwise, `f` and `y` will both be 0.
