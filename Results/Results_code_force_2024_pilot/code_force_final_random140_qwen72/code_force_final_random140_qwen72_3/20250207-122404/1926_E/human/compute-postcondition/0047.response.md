Output State: **`s` is 0, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are updated to the values provided by the input, `i` is 0, `d` is now equal to `n`, `h` is now equal to `n`, `p` is equal to `i`, `g` is the sum of the series \(\sum_{j=0}^{i-1} \left\lfloor \frac{n + 1}{2^j} \right\rfloor\), `k` is still greater than \(\frac{n + 1}{2}\) if `k` > \((n + 1) // 2\), otherwise `k` is less than or equal to \((n + 1) // 2\), `f` is equal to `k - g`, and `y` is equal to \(2^{(i - 1)} \times (k - g)\) if `k` > \((n + 1) // 2\), otherwise `f` is 0 and `y` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `h = n` updates the value of `h` to be equal to `n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
