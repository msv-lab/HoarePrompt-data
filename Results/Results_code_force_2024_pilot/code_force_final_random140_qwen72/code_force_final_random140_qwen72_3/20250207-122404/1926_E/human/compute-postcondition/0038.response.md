To determine what will be printed by the `print(y)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant variables step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\).
   - `n` and `k` are integers where \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^9\).
   - `s` is equal to `k` (or the maximum value it can reach without exceeding `k`).
   - `i` is the total number of iterations the loop ran.
   - `d` is 0 or a small positive integer.
   - `h` is reduced to 0 or a very small positive integer.
   - `p` is equal to `i`.
   - `g` is the sum of the series \(\sum_{j=0}^{i-1} \left\lfloor \frac{n + 1}{2^j} \right\rfloor\).
   - `k` is still greater than \(\frac{n + 1}{2}\).
   - `f` is equal to `k - g`.
   - `y` is equal to \(2^{(i - 1)} \times (k - g)\).

2. **Calculating `y`:**
   - `y` is defined as \(2^{(i - 1)} \times (k - g)\).
   - `i` is the total number of iterations the loop ran.
   - `g` is the sum of the series \(\sum_{j=0}^{i-1} \left\lfloor \frac{n + 1}{2^j} \right\rfloor\).
   - `k` is still greater than \(\frac{n + 1}{2}\).
   - `f` is equal to `k - g`.

Given these definitions, we need to determine the value of `y`:

- `i` is the number of iterations, which is a positive integer.
- `g` is the sum of the series \(\sum_{j=0}^{i-1} \left\lfloor \frac{n + 1}{2^j} \right\rfloor\), which is a specific value based on `n` and `i`.
- `k` is greater than \(\frac{n + 1}{2}\), so `k - g` is a positive integer or zero.
- `y` is then calculated as \(2^{(i - 1)} \times (k - g)\).

Since the exact values of `n`, `k`, and `i` are not provided, we can only describe `y` in terms of these variables.

Output: **\(2^{(i - 1)} \times (k - g)\) (where \(i\) is the total number of iterations the loop ran, \(g\) is the sum of the series \(\sum_{j=0}^{i-1} \left\lfloor \frac{n + 1}{2^j} \right\rfloor\), and \(k\) is greater than \(\frac{n + 1}{2}\))**
