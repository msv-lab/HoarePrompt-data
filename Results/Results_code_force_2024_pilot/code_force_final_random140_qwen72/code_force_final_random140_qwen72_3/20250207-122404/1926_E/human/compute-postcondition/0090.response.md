To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the conditions in the `while` loop head:

```python
while s < k and d > 0:
```

### Variables in the Loop Head:
- `s`: The loop will execute if `s` is less than `k`.
- `d`: The loop will execute if `d` is greater than 0.

### Initial State:
- `s` is 0.
- `d` is `n`.

### Conditions for the First Iteration:
1. **Condition 1: `s < k`**
   - Since `s` is 0, this condition will always be true as long as `k` is greater than 0.
   
2. **Condition 2: `d > 0`**
   - Since `d` is `n`, this condition will be true as long as `n` is greater than 0.

### Adjustments Needed:
- For the loop to execute, `k` must be greater than 0.
- For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0.

### Conclusion:
Given the initial state, the loop will execute if `k` is greater than 0 and `n` is greater than 0. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the initial state provided that these conditions are met.

### Final State:
State: **`n` and `k` are updated to the values provided by the input, `s` is 0, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `i` is 0, `d` is `n`, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, `f` is 0 or `k - n`, `y` is 0 or \(2^{(i - 1)} \times (k - n)\). `k` must be greater than 0 and `n` must be greater than 0.**
