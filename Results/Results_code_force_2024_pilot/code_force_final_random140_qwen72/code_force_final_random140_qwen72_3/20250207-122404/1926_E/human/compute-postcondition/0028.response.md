Output State: **`t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `s` is equal to `k` (or the maximum value it can reach without exceeding `k`), `i` must be at least 3, `d` is 0 or a small positive integer (depending on the exact values of `n` and `k`), `h` is now \(\frac{n - 1}{2}\), `p` is now 2, `g` is now \(\frac{n + 1}{2} + \left(\frac{\frac{n - 1}{2} + 1}{2}\right)\), and `k` is still greater than \(\frac{n + 1}{2}\).**

Explanation:
- The value of `g` is updated by adding \((h + 1) // 2\) to its current value.
- The current value of `g` is \(\frac{n + 1}{2}\).
- The value of `h` is \(\frac{n - 1}{2}\).
- Therefore, \((h + 1) // 2\) is \(\left(\frac{n - 1}{2} + 1\right) // 2\), which simplifies to \(\left(\frac{n + 1}{2}\right) // 2\).
- Adding this to the current value of `g` results in \(g = \frac{n + 1}{2} + \left(\frac{\frac{n - 1}{2} + 1}{2}\right)\).

All other variables remain unchanged.
