To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions in the loop head: `s < k` and `d > 0`.

### Current State:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4
- `n` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9
- `s` is `(d + 1) // 2`
- `i` is 1
- `d` is `(n - (n + 1) // 2)`
- `h` is `n`
- `p` is 1
- `g` is 0
- `k` is greater than `(n + 1) // 2`

### Loop Condition Analysis:
1. **Condition 1: `s < k`**
   - `s` is calculated as `(d + 1) // 2`.
   - For the loop to continue, `s` must be less than `k`.
   - Given that `k` is greater than `(n + 1) // 2`, we need to ensure that `s` remains less than `k`.

2. **Condition 2: `d > 0`**
   - `d` is calculated as `(n - (n + 1) // 2)`.
   - For the loop to continue, `d` must be greater than 0.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`s` and `d` are the only variables that can be adjusted in the loop head.**
- **`s` must remain less than `k`** for the loop to execute again.
- **`d` must remain greater than 0** for the loop to execute again.

### Current Values:
- `s` is `(d + 1) // 2`
- `d` is `(n - (n + 1) // 2)`

### Ensuring the Loop Continues:
- To ensure `s < k`, `d` must be such that `(d + 1) // 2` is less than `k`.
- To ensure `d > 0`, `d` must be positive.

Given the current values:
- `d` is `(n - (n + 1) // 2)`, which simplifies to `n - (n // 2 + 1) = n - n // 2 - 1`.
- For `d` to be positive, `n` must be greater than `n // 2 + 1`.

Since `k` is greater than `(n + 1) // 2`, and `s` is `(d + 1) // 2`, we need to ensure that `d` is such that `(d + 1) // 2` is less than `k`.

### Conclusion:
- The current state already satisfies the conditions for the loop to execute one more time, as `d` is positive and `s` is less than `k`.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `s` is `(d + 1) // 2`, `i` is 1, `d` is `(n - (n + 1) // 2)`, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, and `k` is greater than `(n + 1) // 2`**
