Output State: **`s` is `k`, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are updated to the values provided by the input, `i` is the number of iterations required to reach `s = k` and must be at least 2, `d` is 0, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is `(h + 1) // 2`, `f` is `k - g`, and `y` is \(2^{(i - 1)} \times (k - g)\) if `k` > \((n + 1) // 2\), otherwise `f` is 0 and `y` is 0.**

Explanation:
- `g` is updated to `(h + 1) // 2`. Since `h` is `n`, `g` becomes `(n + 1) // 2`.
- `f` is updated to `k - g`, which is now `k - (n + 1) // 2`.
- `y` is calculated based on the new value of `f`. If `k` > \((n + 1) // 2\), then `y` is \(2^{(i - 1)} \times (k - (n + 1) // 2)\). Otherwise, `f` is 0 and `y` is 0.
- All other variables (`s`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `i`, `d`, `h`, `p`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
