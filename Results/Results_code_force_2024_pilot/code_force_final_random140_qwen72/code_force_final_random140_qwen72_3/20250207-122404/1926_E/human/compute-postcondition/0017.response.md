Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `s` is `(d + 1) // 2 + (d + 1) // 2`, `i` is 2, `d` is `(n - (n + 1) // 2) - ((n - (n + 1) // 2) + 1) // 2`, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, and `k` is greater than `(n + 1) // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing from 1 to 2.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `s`, `d`, `h`, `p`, `g`) remain unchanged.
- The conditions and expressions for `t`, `n`, `k`, `s`, `d`, `h`, `p`, and `g` remain valid as they were in the initial state.
