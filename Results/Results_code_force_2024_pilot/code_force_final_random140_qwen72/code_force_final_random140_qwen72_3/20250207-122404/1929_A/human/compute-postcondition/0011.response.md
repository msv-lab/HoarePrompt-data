Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `_` is a placeholder (not used in the code).
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
- `n` is an input integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 100\).
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\).
- `ar` is a sorted list of integers read from the input.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(sum([(ar[i] - ar[i - 1]) for i in range(1, n)]))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `ar`**:
   - `ar` is a sorted list of integers. This means that for any index \(i\), `ar[i]` is greater than or equal to `ar[i - 1]`.

2. **List Comprehension**:
   - The list comprehension `[(ar[i] - ar[i - 1]) for i in range(1, n)]` generates a list of differences between consecutive elements in `ar`.
   - For example, if `ar = [1, 3, 6, 10]`, the list comprehension will generate `[2, 3, 4]` because:
     - \(ar[1] - ar[0] = 3 - 1 = 2\)
     - \(ar[2] - ar[1] = 6 - 3 = 3\)
     - \(ar[3] - ar[2] = 10 - 6 = 4\)

3. **Summing the Differences**:
   - The `sum` function then adds up all the elements in the list generated by the list comprehension.
   - Continuing with the example, `sum([2, 3, 4])` would be \(2 + 3 + 4 = 9\).

4. **Final Output**:
   - The `print` statement will output the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list `ar`.

### Conclusion:
The code prints the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list `ar`.

Output: **sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list `ar`**

For example, if `ar = [1, 3, 6, 10]`, the output will be **9**.
