Output State: **The loop has completed all its iterations as determined by the initial input value `t`. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not retain any specific value. For each of the `t` test cases, `n` was an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `a` was a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. After sorting, `ar` was a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ ar_i ≤ 10^9. The loop printed the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in `ar` for each test case.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the initial input value `t` has been fully processed, and for each of the `t` test cases, the loop has read the integer `n`, the list of integers `a`, sorted `a` into `ar`, and printed the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in `ar`. The variables `n`, `a`, and `ar` are updated for each iteration based on the input provided for that specific test case.
