To determine what will be printed by the given Python code snippet, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

### Initial State:
- `_` is a placeholder (not used in the code).
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
- `n` is an input integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 100\).
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\).
- `ar` is a sorted list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq ar_i \leq 10^9\).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(sum([(ar[i] - ar[i - 1]) for i in range(1, n)]))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **List Comprehension**: The expression inside the `sum` function is a list comprehension that iterates over the indices from 1 to `n-1` (since `range(1, n)` generates indices from 1 to `n-1`).
2. **Difference Calculation**: For each index `i` in the range, it calculates the difference between the current element `ar[i]` and the previous element `ar[i - 1]`.
3. **Summation**: The `sum` function then adds up all these differences.

### Explanation:
- Since `ar` is a sorted list, the differences `ar[i] - ar[i - 1]` represent the gaps between consecutive elements in the sorted list.
- Summing these differences gives the total difference between the last element and the first element of the list `ar`.

### Mathematical Insight:
- The sum of the differences between consecutive elements in a sorted list is equivalent to the difference between the last element and the first element of the list.
- Mathematically, this can be expressed as:
  \[
  \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (ar[i] - ar[i-1]) = ar[n-1] - ar[0]
  \]

### Final Output:
The code will print the difference between the last element and the first element of the sorted list `ar`.

Output: **ar[n-1] - ar[0] (where ar[n-1] is the last element of the sorted list `ar` and ar[0] is the first element of the sorted list `ar`)**
