The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, sorts the resulting list, and assigns it to the variable `ar`.

- The variable `ar` is now a sorted list of integers derived from the input.
- The length of `ar` is equal to `n`, as specified in the initial state.
- The values in `ar` are between 1 and \(10^9\), as specified for the elements of `a`.
- The other variables (`_`, `t`, `n`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, the input value (which determines the number of iterations) must be at least 1, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and `ar` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ ar_i ≤ 10^9.**
