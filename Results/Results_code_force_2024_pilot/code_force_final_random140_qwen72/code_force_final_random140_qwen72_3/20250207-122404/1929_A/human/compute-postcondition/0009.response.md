Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, the input value (which determines the number of iterations) must be at least 2, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and `ar` is a sorted list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ ar_i ≤ 10^9 (updated from user input).** 

Explanation: The code snippet `n = int(input())` updates the value of `n` to the integer value provided by the user. The new value of `n` is within the range 2 to 100, as specified in the initial state. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
