You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(sorted(list(map(int, input().split()))))
        print(sum([ar[i] - ar[i - 1] for i in range(1, n)]))



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases from standard input. Each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by a list of `n` integers. For each test case, the function sorts the list of integers and prints the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to standard output. After processing all test cases, the function completes its execution.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the array elements are all the same. According to the problem description, the beauty of the array should be 0 if all elements are the same, but the current implementation will still attempt to sort the array and calculate the sum of differences, which will incorrectly result in 0 only because the differences between identical elements are 0. However, the issue is more about the logic of rearranging, which is unnecessary in this specific case. A more critical issue is that the program does not consider the possibility of maximizing the beauty by arranging the array in descending order, which would maximize the positive differences between consecutive elements. For example, for the input `[3, 3, 1, 2]`, the program will output `2` (after sorting to `[1, 2, 3, 3]`), but the maximum beauty can be achieved by arranging the array as `[3, 3, 2, 1]`, resulting in a beauty of `3`. Therefore, the program does not always produce the correct maximum beauty for all inputs.
