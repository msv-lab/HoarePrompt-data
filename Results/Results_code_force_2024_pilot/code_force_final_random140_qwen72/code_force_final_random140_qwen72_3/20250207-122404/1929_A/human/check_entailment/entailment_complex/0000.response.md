Reasoning:  
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It processes multiple test cases, each with an array of integers. For each test case, it sorts the array and calculates the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array. This approach ensures that the differences are maximized because the largest possible difference between consecutive elements is achieved when the array is sorted in ascending order.

The program adheres to the constraints and requirements specified in the problem statement:
- It handles the input format correctly, reading the number of test cases and the arrays.
- It sorts the array, which is necessary to maximize the beauty of the array.
- It calculates the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array, which is the definition of the array's beauty.
- It outputs the result for each test case as required.

Given these points, the program is correct according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
