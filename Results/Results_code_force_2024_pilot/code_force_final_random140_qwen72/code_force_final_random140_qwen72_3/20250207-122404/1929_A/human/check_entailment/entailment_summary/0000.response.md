Reasoning:  
The problem requires finding the maximum possible "beauty" of an array, defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array. The key insight here is that to maximize this sum, the array should be sorted in ascending order. This is because the difference between consecutive elements in a sorted array will always be non-negative and as small as possible, which maximizes the overall sum when considering the entire array.

The provided program correctly implements this logic:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array itself.
3. It sorts the array.
4. It calculates the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.
5. It prints the result for each test case.

Given the problem constraints and the nature of the solution, the program appears to be logically correct and should produce the expected output for valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
