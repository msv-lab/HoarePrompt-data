The function reads multiple test cases from standard input. Each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by a list of `n` integers. For each test case, the function sorts the list of integers and prints the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to standard output. After processing all test cases, the function completes its execution.
