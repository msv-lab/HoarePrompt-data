Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 3 and `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the new first integer from the input, `x` is the new second integer from the input and must be at least 1, `y` is the new third integer from the input, `arr` is now a sorted list of the first `x` elements converted to integers with `n + arr[0]` appended to it, `i` is 3. If the difference between the second element (`arr[1]`) and the first element (`arr[0]`) in the list `arr` is 2, then `ans` is `x + 1`. Otherwise, `ans` is `x - 1`.***
