Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `x` must be at least 3, `y` is the third integer from the input, `arr` is a sorted list of the first `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, with an additional element `n + 1` appended to it, `i` is 3, and `ans` is `x` if the difference between `arr[1]` and `arr[0]` is 2 and the difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i - 1]` is 2; otherwise, `ans` is `x - 1` if the difference between `arr[1]` and `arr[0]` is 2; otherwise, `ans` is `x - 2`.***
