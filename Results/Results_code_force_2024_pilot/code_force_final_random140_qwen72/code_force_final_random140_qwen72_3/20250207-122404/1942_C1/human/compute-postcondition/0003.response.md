The value of `t` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. After decrementing, the new value of `t` is `t - 1`. The values of `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. The second line of each test case still contains `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; for each test case, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5), and `y` = 0; the second line of each test case contains `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.**
