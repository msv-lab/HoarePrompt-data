The code snippet `arr.sort()` sorts the list `arr` in ascending order. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `i`, or `ans`. The only change is in the order of elements within `arr`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 2 and `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the new first integer from the input, `x` is the new second integer from the input, `y` is the new third integer from the input, `arr` is a sorted list of the first `x` elements of the original `arr` converted to integers, `i` is `x + 1`, and `ans` is the initial value `x - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in the original `arr` is 2.**
