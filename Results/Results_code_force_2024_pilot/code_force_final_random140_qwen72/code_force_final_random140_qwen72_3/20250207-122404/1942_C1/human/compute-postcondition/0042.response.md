Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an input integer where \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 2\) and `t` must be greater than 0.
2. `n` is the new first integer from the input.
3. `x` is the new second integer from the input and must be at least 1.
4. `y` is the new third integer from the input.
5. `arr` is a sorted list of the first `x` elements of the original `arr` converted to integers with `n + arr[0]` appended to it.
6. `i` is `x + 1`.
7. `ans` is the initial value of `x - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `arr` (from index 1 to `x`) is exactly 2.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(ans)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `arr`**:
   - `arr` is initially a sorted list of the first `x` elements of the original `arr`.
   - After sorting, `n + arr[0]` is appended to `arr`.

2. **Understanding `ans`**:
   - `ans` starts with the value `x - 2`.
   - We then add to `ans` the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `arr` (from index 1 to `x`) is exactly 2.

3. **Calculating `ans`**:
   - Let's denote the sorted list of the first `x` elements of `arr` as `arr[:x]`.
   - After appending `n + arr[0]` to `arr`, the list becomes `arr = arr[:x] + [n + arr[0]]`.
   - We need to count the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `arr` (from index 1 to `x`) is exactly 2.

4. **Example Calculation**:
   - Suppose `arr[:x] = [1, 3, 5]` and `n = 2`.
   - After appending `n + arr[0]`, `arr` becomes `[1, 3, 5, 3]`.
   - We now check the differences between consecutive elements from index 1 to `x` (which is 3 in this case):
     - `arr[1] - arr[0] = 3 - 1 = 2` (count: 1)
     - `arr[2] - arr[1] = 5 - 3 = 2` (count: 2)
     - `arr[3] - arr[2] = 3 - 5 = -2` (not counted)
   - The number of times the difference is exactly 2 is 2.
   - Therefore, `ans = (x - 2) + 2 = (3 - 2) + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3`.

### Final Output:
The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is the initial value of `x - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `arr` (from index 1 to `x`) is exactly 2.

Output: **ans (where ans is the initial value of x - 2 plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in arr (from index 1 to x) is exactly 2)**
