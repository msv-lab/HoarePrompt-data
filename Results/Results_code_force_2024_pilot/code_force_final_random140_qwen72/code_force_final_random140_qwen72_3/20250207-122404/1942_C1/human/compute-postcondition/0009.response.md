Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the first integer from the input; `x` is the second integer from the input; `y` is the third integer from the input; `arr` is a sorted list of the first `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, with an additional element `n + 1` appended to it; `ans` is `x - 2`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans = x - 2` assigns the value of `x - 2` to the variable `ans`. The values of `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` remain unchanged. The new value of `ans` is `x - 2`.
