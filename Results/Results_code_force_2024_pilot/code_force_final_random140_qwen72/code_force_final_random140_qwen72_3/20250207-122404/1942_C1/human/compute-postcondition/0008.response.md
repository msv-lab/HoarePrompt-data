The code appends the value `n + arr[0]` to the list `arr`. Since `arr` is a sorted list of the first `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, the first element `arr[0]` is 1 (assuming the list starts from 1). Therefore, the value being appended is `n + 1`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the first integer from the input; `x` is the second integer from the input; `y` is the third integer from the input; `arr` is a sorted list of the first `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, with an additional element `n + 1` appended to it.**
