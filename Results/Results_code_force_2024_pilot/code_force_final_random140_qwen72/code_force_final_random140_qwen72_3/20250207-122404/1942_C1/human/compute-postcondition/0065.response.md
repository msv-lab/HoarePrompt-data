Postcondition: ***If the program is executed as the main module, `t` is 0, `n` is the last input integer from the last iteration, `x` is the last second integer from the last iteration, `y` is the last third integer from the last iteration, `arr` is a sorted list of the last `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, with an additional element `n + arr[0]` appended to it, `i` is `x + 1`, and `ans` is the initial value `x - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `arr` is 2 for the last iteration. If the program is not executed as the main module, the variables remain unchanged.***
