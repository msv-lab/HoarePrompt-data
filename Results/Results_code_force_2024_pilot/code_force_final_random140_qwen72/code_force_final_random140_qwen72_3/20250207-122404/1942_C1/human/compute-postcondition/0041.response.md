Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 2 and `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the new first integer from the input, `x` is the new second integer from the input and must be at least 1, `y` is the new third integer from the input, `arr` is a sorted list of the first `x` elements of the original `arr` converted to integers with `n + arr[0]` appended to it, `i` is `x + 1`, and `ans` is the initial value of `x - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `arr` (from index 1 to `x`) is exactly 2.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`n`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`x`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`y`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`arr`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be `x + 1` because the loop iterates from 1 to `x` inclusive.
- **`ans`**: Initially set to `x - 2`. For each iteration of the loop, if the difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i - 1]` is 2, `ans` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the final value of `ans` will be the initial value of `x - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `arr` (from index 1 to `x`) is exactly 2.
