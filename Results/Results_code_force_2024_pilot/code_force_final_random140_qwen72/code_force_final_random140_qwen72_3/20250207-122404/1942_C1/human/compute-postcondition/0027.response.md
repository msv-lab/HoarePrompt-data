The code snippet `arr = [int(arr[i]) for i in range(x)]` changes the `arr` list by converting the first `x` elements of the original `arr` (which are strings) into integers.

Let's break down the impact:

- `arr` is updated to contain the first `x` elements of the original `arr`, converted to integers.
- The length of the new `arr` is now `x`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `i`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 2 and `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the new first integer from the input, `x` is the new second integer from the input, `y` is the new third integer from the input, `arr` is a list of the first `x` elements of the original `arr` converted to integers, `i` is `x + 1`, and `ans` is the initial value `x - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in the original `arr` is 2.**
