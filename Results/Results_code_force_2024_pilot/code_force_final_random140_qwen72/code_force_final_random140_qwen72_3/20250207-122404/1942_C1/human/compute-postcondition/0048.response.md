The code snippet `arr = [int(arr[i]) for i in range(x)]` converts the first `x` elements of the list `arr` from strings to integers and assigns the result back to `arr`.

Let's break down the impact:

- `arr` is updated to contain the first `x` elements converted to integers.
- The length of `arr` is now `x`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `i`, `ans`) remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 3 and `t` must be greater than 0.
- `n` is the new first integer from the input.
- `x` is the new second integer from the input and must be at least 1.
- `y` is the new third integer from the input.
- `arr` is now a list of strings from the new input.
- `i` is `x + 1`.
- `ans` is the initial value of `x - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in the original `arr` (from index 1 to `x`) is exactly 2.

After executing the code snippet, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 3 and `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the new first integer from the input, `x` is the new second integer from the input and must be at least 1, `y` is the new third integer from the input, `arr` is now a list of the first `x` elements converted to integers, `i` is `x + 1`, and `ans` is the initial value of `x - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in the original `arr` (from index 1 to `x`) is exactly 2.**
