Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 2 and `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the new first integer from the input, `x` is the new second integer from the input and must be at least 1, `y` is the new third integer from the input, `arr` is a sorted list of the first `x` elements of the original `arr` converted to integers with `n + arr[0]` appended to it, `i` is 1, and `ans` is `x - 2`. Additionally, the difference between the second element (`arr[1]`) and the first element (`arr[0]`) of the list `arr` is 2.**
