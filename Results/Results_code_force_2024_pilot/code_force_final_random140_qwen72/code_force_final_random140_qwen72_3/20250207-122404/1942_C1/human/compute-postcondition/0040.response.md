Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 2 and `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the new first integer from the input, `x` is the new second integer from the input and must be at least 3, `y` is the new third integer from the input, `arr` is a sorted list of the first `x` elements of the original `arr` converted to integers with `n + arr[0]` appended to it, `i` is 3, and `ans` is `x - 1` if the difference between `arr[1]` and `arr[0]` is 2 or if the difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i - 1]` is 2; otherwise, `ans` is `x - 2`.***
