Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but operates under the constraints that `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5), and y is always 0. Additionally, each test case includes a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing vertices chosen by Bessie. The function returns a result for each test case based on these inputs.**
