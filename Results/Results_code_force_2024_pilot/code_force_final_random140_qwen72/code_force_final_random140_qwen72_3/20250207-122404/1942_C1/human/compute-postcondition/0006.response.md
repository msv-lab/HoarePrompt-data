The code snippet converts the elements of the list `arr` (which initially contains strings) into integers up to the index `x`. This means that each element in `arr` up to the `x`-th position is now an integer.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the first integer from the input; `x` is the second integer from the input; `y` is the third integer from the input; `arr` is a list of integers containing the first `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`.**
