Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `x` must be at least 1, `y` is the third integer from the input, `arr` is a sorted list of the first `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, with an additional element `n + 1` appended to it, `ans` is `x - 2`, `i` is 1, and the difference between the second element (`arr[1]`) and the first element (`arr[0]`) in the list `arr` is 2.**
