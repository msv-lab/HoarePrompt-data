Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `command` is a list of strings read from the standard input.
   - `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and n is odd.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `line` is a list of strings.
   - `ind` is the length of `line` minus 1.
   - `grid` contains `n` lines, each a list of strings.
   - `elements` is a dictionary containing keys for each non-'..' element in the entire grid, with values being tuples representing their positions (row, column).
   - `goal` is a list containing tuples for each non-player element in the grid whose second character is 'G', with the tuples representing their positions (row, column).
   - `tmp` is 0 if the first character of these elements is 'B' or 1 if it is not.
   - `t` must be greater than 2.
   - `time` is 2.
   - `obj` is the first element of `command`.
   - `com` is the second element of `command`.
   - `pos` is the tuple representing the position (row, column) of `obj` in the `elements` dictionary.
   - `nxt` is the tuple `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`.
   - `player` is `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` returns `True`, otherwise `player` is the element at the position `nxt` in the `grid`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('%d %s ELIMINATED' % (time, player))
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `time` is explicitly given as 2.
   - `player` is determined based on the value of `obj` and the function `isPlayer(obj)`.
     - If `isPlayer(obj)` returns `True`, then `player` is `obj`.
     - Otherwise, `player` is the element at the position `nxt` in the `grid`.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The print statement will output the current time (which is 2) followed by the value of `player` and the word "ELIMINATED".
   - Since the exact value of `player` depends on the specific values of `obj` and the result of `isPlayer(obj)`, we need to consider both cases:
     - If `isPlayer(obj)` returns `True`, `player` will be `obj`.
     - If `isPlayer(obj)` returns `False`, `player` will be the element at the position `nxt` in the `grid`.

Given this, the output will be:
Output: **2 [player] ELIMINATED (where [player] is either the value of `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` returns `True`, or the element at the position `nxt` in the `grid` if `isPlayer(obj)` returns `False`)**
