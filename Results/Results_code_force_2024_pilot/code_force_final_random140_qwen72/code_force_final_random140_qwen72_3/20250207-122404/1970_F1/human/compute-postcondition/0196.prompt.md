Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and n is odd, `i` is `n-1`, `line` is a list of strings read from the standard input and split by spaces, `ind` is the length of `line` minus 1, `grid` contains `n` lines, each a list of strings read from the standard input. The `elements` dictionary contains keys for each non-'..' element in the entire grid, with values being tuples representing their positions (row, column). The `allPlayers` dictionary contains keys for each player element in the grid, with values set to `False`. The `goal` list contains tuples for each non-player element in the grid whose second character is 'G', with the tuples representing their positions (row, column), and `tmp` is 0 if the first character of these elements is 'B' or 1 if it is not. `t` is an integer read from the standard input.
Code of the loop:
for time in range(t):
    comand = stdin.readline().strip().split()
    if len(comand) == 3:
        obj, com, el = comand
        if el == '.Q':
            allPlayers[obj] = True
        elif el == '.S':
            team = 1 if obj[0] == 'B' else 0
            points[team] += 10
            print('%d %s CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' % (time, GoalName[team]))
    else:
        obj, com = comand
        pos = elements[obj]
        nxt = pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]
        if obj == '.B' and isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]) or isPlayer(obj
            ) and elements['.B'] == nxt:
            player = obj if isPlayer(obj) else grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]
            print('%d %s ELIMINATED' % (time, player))
        elif com == 'T':
            allPlayers[obj] = False
            if goalIn(pos) != -1:
                team = goalIn(pos)
                print('%d %s GOAL' % (time, GoalName[team]))
                points[team] += 1
        elif isPlayer(obj):
            elements[obj] = nxt
        if obj == '.B':
            elements[obj] = nxt


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and n is odd, `i` is `n-1`, `line` is a list of strings read from the standard input and split by spaces, `ind` is the length of `line` minus 1, `grid` contains `n` lines, each a list of strings read from the standard input, `elements` dictionary contains keys for each non-'..' element in the entire grid, with values being tuples representing their positions (row, column). If the length of `command` is 3, `obj` is the first string in `command`, `com` is the second string in `command`, `el` is the third string in `command`. If `el` is equal to '.Q', the value of `obj` in `allPlayers` is set to `True` and the rest are set to `False`. If `el` is not equal to '.Q' and is equal to '.S', `team` is 1 if `obj[0]` is 'B', otherwise `team` is 0, and `points[team]` is increased by 10. If the length of `command` is not 3, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `pos` is the tuple representing the position (row, column) of `obj` in the `elements` dictionary, `nxt` is the tuple `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`. If `obj` is '.B', `elements['.B']` is updated to `nxt`. If `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]` is a player, then `player` is set to the player element found at the position `nxt` in the grid. If `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]` is not a player, the state remains unchanged. If `obj` is not '.B', the state remains unchanged. `goal` list contains tuples for each non-player element in the grid whose second character is 'G', with the tuples representing their positions (row, column), and `tmp` is 0 if the first character of these elements is 'B' or 1 if it is not, `t` must be greater than 0, `time` is 0, `command` is a list of strings read from the standard input and split by spaces.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`command` is a list of strings, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and n is odd, `i` is `n-1`, `line` is a list of strings, `ind` is the length of `line` minus 1, `grid` contains `n` lines, each a list of strings, `elements` dictionary contains keys for each non-'..' element in the entire grid, with values being tuples representing their positions (row, column), `goal` list contains tuples for each non-player element in the grid whose second character is 'G', with the tuples representing their positions (row, column), `tmp` is 0 if the first character of these elements is 'B' or 1 if it is not, `t` must be greater than 1, `time` is 1. If `len(command) == 3`, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `el` is the third element of `command`. If `el` is '.Q', `allPlayers` dictionary now includes the key `obj` with the value `True`. If `el` is '.S', `team` is 1 if the first character of `obj` is 'B' else 0, and `points[team]` is increased by 10. If `len(command) != 3`, `obj` is `command[0]`, `com` is `command[1]`, `pos` is the tuple representing the position (row, column) of `obj` in the `elements` dictionary, `nxt` is the tuple `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`. If `obj` is '.B', `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`. If `obj` is a player, the `elements` dictionary now contains the key `obj` with the value `nxt`. If `com` is 'T', `allPlayers[obj]` is set to `False`. If `goalIn(pos)` is not -1, then `team` is the return value of `goalIn(pos)`, and `points[team]` is increased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged unless specified in the conditions.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`command` is a list of strings read from the standard input, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and n is odd, `i` is `n-1`, `line` is a list of strings, `ind` is the length of `line` minus 1, `grid` contains `n` lines, each a list of strings, `elements` dictionary contains keys for each non-'..' element in the entire grid, with values being tuples representing their positions (row, column), `goal` list contains tuples for each non-player element in the grid whose second character is 'G', with the tuples representing their positions (row, column), `tmp` is 0 if the first character of these elements is 'B' or 1 if it is not, `t` must be greater than 2, `time` is 2. If `len(command) == 3`, `obj` is the first string in `command`, `com` is the second string in `command`, `el` is the third string in `command`. If `el` is '.Q', `allPlayers` dictionary now includes the key `obj` with the value `True`. If `el` is '.S', `team` is 1 if the first character of `obj` is 'B', otherwise `team` is 0, and `points[team]` is incremented by 10. If `len(command) != 3`, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `pos` is the tuple representing the position (row, column) of `obj` in the `elements` dictionary, `nxt` is the tuple `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`. If `obj` is '.B', then `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`, and all other variables retain their previous values. If `obj` is not '.B', all variables retain their previous values.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
