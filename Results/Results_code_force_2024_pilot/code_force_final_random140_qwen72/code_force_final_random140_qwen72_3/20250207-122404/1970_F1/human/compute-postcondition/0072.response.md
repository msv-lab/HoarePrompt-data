Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and n is odd, `i` is 2, `line` is a list of strings read from the standard input and split by spaces, `ind` is 0, `grid` now contains the new `line` as its last element, `elements` dictionary contains keys for each non-'..' element in the new `line`, with values being tuples representing their positions (0, index), `allPlayers` dictionary contains keys for each player element in the new `line`, with values set to `False`, `goal` list contains tuples for each non-player element in the new `line` whose second character is 'G', with the tuples representing their positions (0, index), and `tmp` is 0 if the first character of these elements is 'B' or 1 if it is not.**

Explanation:
- The code `line = stdin.readline().strip().split()` reads a line from the standard input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and splits the line into a list of strings.
- This updates the `line` variable to the new list of strings read from the input.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `ind`, `grid`, `elements`, `allPlayers`, `goal`, and `tmp`) remain unchanged and retain their initial values and conditions.
