The code snippet `points[team] += 10` increments the value of `points[team]` by 10. To determine the exact value of `points[team]` after this operation, we need to consider the initial value of `points[team]`. However, since the initial value of `points[team]` is not provided, we can only state that it has been incremented by 10.

The rest of the variables and conditions remain unchanged. Here is the updated state:

Output State: **`command` is a list of strings read from the standard input, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and n is odd, `i` is `n-1`, `line` is a list of strings, `ind` is the length of `line` minus 1, `grid` contains `n` lines, each a list of strings, `elements` dictionary contains keys for each non-'..' element in the entire grid, with values being tuples representing their positions (row, column), `goal` list contains tuples for each non-player element in the grid whose second character is 'G', with the tuples representing their positions (row, column), `tmp` is 0 if the first character of these elements is 'B' or 1 if it is not, `t` must be greater than 2, `time` is 2, `obj` is the first string in `command`, `com` is the second string in `command`, `el` is the third string in `command`, `team` is 1 if the first character of `obj` is 'B', otherwise `team` is 0, `points[team]` is incremented by 10.**
