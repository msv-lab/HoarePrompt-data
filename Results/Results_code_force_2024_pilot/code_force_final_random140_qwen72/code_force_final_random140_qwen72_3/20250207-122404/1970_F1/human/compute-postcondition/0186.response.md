To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant variables:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `command` is a list of strings read from the standard input.
   - `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and n is odd.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `line` is a list of strings.
   - `ind` is the length of `line` minus 1.
   - `grid` contains `n` lines, each a list of strings.
   - `elements` dictionary contains keys for each non-'..' element in the entire grid, with values being tuples representing their positions (row, column).
   - `goal` list contains tuples for each non-player element in the grid whose second character is 'G', with the tuples representing their positions (row, column).
   - `tmp` is 0 if the first character of these elements is 'B' or 1 if it is not.
   - `t` must be greater than 2.
   - `time` is 2.
   - `obj` is the first element of `command`.
   - `com` is the second element of `command`.
   - `pos` is the tuple representing the position (row, column) of `obj` in the `elements` dictionary.
   - `nxt` is the tuple `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`.
   - `allPlayers[obj]` is `False`.
   - `team` is the result of `goalIn(pos)`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('%d %s GOAL' % (time, GoalName[team]))
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - `time` is explicitly given as 2.
   - `GoalName` is a dictionary or list that maps `team` to a specific name.
   - `team` is the result of the function `goalIn(pos)`, which determines the team based on the position `pos`.

Given the initial state, we need to determine the value of `team` and the corresponding value in `GoalName`.

- `team` is the result of `goalIn(pos)`, which is a function that likely checks if the position `pos` is a goal position and returns a team identifier.
- `GoalName` is a mapping from team identifiers to names.

Without the exact implementation of `goalIn` and the contents of `GoalName`, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

### Final Output:
Output: **2 [GoalName[team]] GOAL (where [GoalName[team]] is the name of the team determined by the `goalIn(pos)` function)**

This output indicates that the time is 2, and the team name is determined by the `goalIn(pos)` function, which is then looked up in the `GoalName` dictionary.
