Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and n is odd, `i` is `n-1`, `line` is a list of strings read from the standard input and split by spaces, `ind` is the length of `line` minus 1, `grid` contains `n` lines, each a list of strings read from the standard input, `elements` dictionary contains keys for each non-'..' element in the entire grid, with values being tuples representing their positions (row, column), `allPlayers` dictionary contains keys for each player element in the grid. If `el` is equal to '.Q', the value of `obj` in `allPlayers` is set to `True` and the rest are set to `False`. If `el` is not equal to '.Q' and is equal to '.S', `team` is 1 if `obj[0]` is 'B', otherwise `team` is 0, and `points[team]` is increased by 10. `goal` list contains tuples for each non-player element in the grid whose second character is 'G', with the tuples representing their positions (row, column), and `tmp` is 0 if the first character of these elements is 'B' or 1 if it is not, `t` must be greater than 0, `time` is 0, `command` is a list of strings read from the standard input and split by spaces, and the length of `command` is 3, `obj` is the first string in `command`, `com` is the second string in `command`, `el` is the third string in `command`.***
