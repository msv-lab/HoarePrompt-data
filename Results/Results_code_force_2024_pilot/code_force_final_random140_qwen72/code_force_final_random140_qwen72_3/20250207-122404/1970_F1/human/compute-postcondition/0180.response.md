The code snippet assigns the value of `elements[obj]` to the variable `pos`. This means that `pos` now holds the tuple representing the position (row, column) of the object specified by `obj` in the `elements` dictionary.

Output State: **`command` is a list of strings read from the standard input, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and n is odd, `i` is `n-1`, `line` is a list of strings, `ind` is the length of `line` minus 1, `grid` contains `n` lines, each a list of strings, `elements` dictionary contains keys for each non-'..' element in the entire grid, with values being tuples representing their positions (row, column), `goal` list contains tuples for each non-player element in the grid whose second character is 'G', with the tuples representing their positions (row, column), `tmp` is 0 if the first character of these elements is 'B' or 1 if it is not, `t` must be greater than 2, `time` is 2, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `pos` is the tuple representing the position (row, column) of `obj` in the `elements` dictionary.**
