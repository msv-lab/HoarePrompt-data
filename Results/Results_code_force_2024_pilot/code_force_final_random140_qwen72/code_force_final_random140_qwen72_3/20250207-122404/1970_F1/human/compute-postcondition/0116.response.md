Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and n is odd.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `line` is a list of strings read from the standard input and split by spaces.
   - `ind` is the length of `line` minus 1.
   - `grid` contains `n` lines, each a list of strings read from the standard input.
   - `elements` is a dictionary containing keys for each non-'..' element in the entire grid, with values being tuples representing their positions (row, column).
   - `allPlayers` is a dictionary containing keys for each player element in the grid, with values set to `False`.
   - `goal` is a list containing tuples for each non-player element in the grid whose second character is 'G', with the tuples representing their positions (row, column).
   - `tmp` is 0 if the first character of these elements is 'B' or 1 if it is not.
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `time` is 0.
   - `command` is a list of strings read from the standard input and split by spaces, and the length of `command` is 3.
   - `obj` is the first string in `command`.
   - `com` is the second string in `command`.
   - `el` is the third string in `command`, and `el` is equal to '.S'.
   - `team` is 1 if `obj[0]` is 'B', otherwise `team` is 0.
   - `points` is a dictionary where `points[team]` is increased by 10.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('%d %s CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' % (time, GoalName[team]))
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `time` is 0.
   - `team` is determined by the first character of `obj`. If `obj[0]` is 'B', then `team` is 1; otherwise, `team` is 0.
   - `GoalName` is a dictionary that maps team numbers to names. Since `GoalName` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we assume it is defined elsewhere in the code. For the purpose of this task, let's assume `GoalName` is defined as follows:
     ```python
     GoalName = {0: "Team A", 1: "Team B"}
     ```

4. **Calculate the Output:**
   - If `obj[0]` is 'B', then `team` is 1, and `GoalName[team]` is "Team B".
   - If `obj[0]` is not 'B', then `team` is 0, and `GoalName[team]` is "Team A".

5. **Final Output:**
   - If `obj[0]` is 'B':
     ```python
     print('%d %s CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' % (0, "Team B"))
     ```
     Output: **0 Team B CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH**

   - If `obj[0]` is not 'B':
     ```python
     print('%d %s CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' % (0, "Team A"))
     ```
     Output: **0 Team A CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH**

Since the exact value of `obj[0]` is not provided, we need to consider both cases. However, for the sake of a specific answer, let's assume `obj[0]` is 'B' (a common scenario in such problems).

Output: **0 Team B CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH**
