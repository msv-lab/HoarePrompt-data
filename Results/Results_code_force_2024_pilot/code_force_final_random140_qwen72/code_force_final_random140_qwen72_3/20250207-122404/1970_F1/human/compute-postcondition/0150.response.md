To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `command` is a list of strings read from the standard input and split by spaces.
   - `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and n is odd.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `line` is a list of strings read from the standard input and split by spaces.
   - `ind` is the length of `line` minus 1.
   - `grid` contains `n` lines, each a list of strings read from the standard input.
   - `elements` is a dictionary containing keys for each non-'..' element in the entire grid, with values being tuples representing their positions (row, column).
   - `goal` is a list containing tuples for each non-player element in the grid whose second character is 'G', with the tuples representing their positions (row, column).
   - `tmp` is 0 if the first character of these elements is 'B' or 1 if it is not.
   - `t` must be greater than 1.
   - `time` is 1.
   - `obj` is the first element of `command`.
   - `com` is the second element of `command`.
   - `el` is the third element of `command`.
   - `team` is 1 if the first character of `obj` is 'B' else 0.
   - `points[team]` is increased by 10.

2. **Variables Involved in the Print Statement:**
   - `time`: This is explicitly set to 1.
   - `GoalName[team]`: This depends on the value of `team`, which is determined by the first character of `obj`.

3. **Determine the Value of `team`:**
   - `obj` is the first element of `command`.
   - If the first character of `obj` is 'B', then `team` is 1.
   - Otherwise, `team` is 0.

4. **Determine the Value of `GoalName[team]`:**
   - `GoalName` is a dictionary that maps team numbers to names. Since `team` can be either 0 or 1, `GoalName[team]` will be the name associated with the team number.

5. **Construct the Output:**
   - The `print` statement will format the output as `'%d %s CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' % (time, GoalName[team])`.
   - `time` is 1.
   - `GoalName[team]` will be either `GoalName[0]` or `GoalName[1]` depending on the value of `team`.

Given the above steps, the output will be:

Output: **1 [GoalName[team]] CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH (where [GoalName[team]] is the name associated with the team number, which is either GoalName[0] or GoalName[1] based on the first character of `obj`)**
