Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and n is odd, `i` is `n-1`, `line` is a list of strings read from the standard input and split by spaces, `ind` is the length of `line` minus 1, `grid` contains `n` lines, each a list of strings read from the standard input, `elements` dictionary contains keys for each non-'..' element in the entire grid, with values being tuples representing their positions (row, column), `allPlayers` dictionary contains keys for each player element in the grid, with values set to `False`, `goal` list contains tuples for each non-player element in the grid whose second character is 'G', with the tuples representing their positions (row, column), and `tmp` is 0 if the first character of these elements is 'B' or 1 if it is not, `t` must be greater than 0, `time` is 0, `command` is a list of strings read from the standard input and split by spaces, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `pos` is the tuple representing the position (row, column) of `obj` in the `elements` dictionary, `nxt` is the tuple `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`. If `obj` is a player, `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`, and the command `com` is not 'T'. If `obj` is not a player, the state remains unchanged.***
