Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and n is odd, `i` is 1, `line` is a list of strings read from the standard input and split by spaces, `ind` is the length of the new `line` minus 1, `grid` now contains the new `line` as its last element, `elements` dictionary contains keys for each non-'..' element in the new `line`, with values being tuples representing their positions (0, index), `allPlayers` dictionary contains keys for each player element in the new `line`, with values set to `False`, `goal` list contains tuples for each non-player element in the new `line` whose second character is 'G', with the tuples representing their positions (0, index), and the `tmp` variable is set based on the first character of these elements ('B' or not).
Code of the loop:
for ind in range(len(line)):
    if line[ind] != '..':
        elements[line[ind]] = i, ind
        if isPlayer(line[ind]):
            allPlayers[line[ind]] = False
        elif line[ind][1] == 'G':
            tmp = 0 if line[ind][0] == 'B' else 1
            goal[tmp].append((i, ind))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and n is odd, `i` is 1, `line` is a list of strings read from the standard input and split by spaces and must have at least one element, `ind` is the length of the new `line` minus 1, `grid` now contains the new `line` as its last element, `elements` dictionary contains keys for each non-'..' element in the new `line`, with values being tuples representing their positions (0, index). `allPlayers` dictionary contains keys for each player element in the new `line`, with values set to `False`. `goal` list contains tuples for each non-player element in the new `line` whose second character is 'G', with the tuples representing their positions (0, index). `tmp` variable is set based on the first character of these elements ('B' or not). If the last element of `line` (at index `ind`) is not '..', the `elements` dictionary now includes the key `line[ind]` with the value `(1, ind)`. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` is true, the last element of `line` (at index `ind`) is a player element, and `allPlayers` dictionary includes the key `line[ind]` set to `False`. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` is false, and the second character of the last element of `line` (at index `ind`) is 'G', `tmp` is 0 if the first character of the last element of `line` (at index `ind`) is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1, and the tuple `(1, ind)` is appended to `goal[tmp]`. If the last element of `line` (at index `ind`) is '..', the state remains unchanged as described above.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and n is odd, `i` is 1, `line` is a list of strings read from the standard input and split by spaces and must have at least one element, `ind` is the length of the new `line`, `grid` now contains the new `line` as its last element, `elements` dictionary contains keys for each non-'..' element in the new `line`, with values being tuples representing their positions (0, index), `allPlayers` dictionary contains keys for each player element in the new `line`, with values set to `False`, `goal` list contains tuples for each non-player element in the new `line` whose second character is 'G', with the tuples representing their positions (0, index), `tmp` variable is set based on the first character of these elements ('B' or not). If the last element of `line` (at index `ind-1`) is not '..', `elements` dictionary now includes the key `line[ind-1]` with the value `(1, ind-1)`. If `line[ind-1]` is a player, `allPlayers` dictionary now includes the key `line[ind-1]` with the value `False`. If `line[ind-1][1]` is 'G', `goal[tmp]` now includes the tuple `(1, ind-1)` appended to its existing list. If the last element of `line` (at index `ind-1`) is '..', the state remains unchanged as described above.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and n is odd, `i` is 1, `line` is a list of strings read from the standard input and split by spaces and must have at least two elements, `ind` is the length of the new `line` (which is `ind + 1` from the previous state), `grid` now contains the new `line` as its last element, `elements` dictionary contains keys for each non-'..' element in the new `line`, with values being tuples representing their positions (0, index), `allPlayers` dictionary contains keys for each player element in the new `line`, with values set to `False`, `goal` list contains tuples for each non-player element in the new `line` whose second character is 'G', with the tuples representing their positions (0, index), `tmp` is 0 if the first character of `line[ind]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1. If the last element of `line` (at index `ind-1`) is not '..', `elements` dictionary now includes the key `line[ind-1]` with the value `(1, ind-1)`. If `line[ind-1]` is a player, `allPlayers` dictionary now includes the key `line[ind-1]` with the value `False`. If `line[ind-1][1]` is 'G', `goal[tmp]` now includes the tuple `(1, ind-1)` appended to its existing list. If the last element of `line` (at index `ind-1`) is '..', the state remains unchanged as described above.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
