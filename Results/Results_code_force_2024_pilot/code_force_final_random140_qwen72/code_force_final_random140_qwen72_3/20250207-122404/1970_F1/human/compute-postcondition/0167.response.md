Output State: **`elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`, all other variables remain unchanged unless specified in the conditions. If `obj` is a player, the `elements` dictionary now contains the key `obj` with the value `nxt`. If `com` is 'T', `allPlayers[obj]` is set to `False`. If `goalIn(pos)` is not -1, then `team` is the return value of `goalIn(pos)`, and `points[team]` is increased by 1.**

Explanation:
- The code updates the `elements` dictionary by setting the key `obj` to the value `nxt`.
- If `obj` is a player, the `elements` dictionary is updated to reflect the new position `nxt`.
- If the command `com` is 'T', the `allPlayers` dictionary is updated to set `allPlayers[obj]` to `False`.
- If the function `goalIn(pos)` returns a value other than -1, the `team` variable is set to this value, and the corresponding `points[team]` is incremented by 1.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged unless explicitly modified by the conditions described above.
