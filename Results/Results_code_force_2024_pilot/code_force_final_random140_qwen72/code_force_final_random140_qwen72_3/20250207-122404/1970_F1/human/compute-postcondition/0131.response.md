To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant parts of the code:

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`n`**: An integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and n is odd.
2. **`i`**: `n-1`.
3. **`line`**: A list of strings read from the standard input and split by spaces.
4. **`ind`**: The length of `line` minus 1.
5. **`grid`**: Contains `n` lines, each a list of strings read from the standard input.
6. **`elements`**: A dictionary containing keys for each non-'..' element in the entire grid, with values being tuples representing their positions (row, column).
7. **`allPlayers`**: A dictionary with the key `obj` set to `False`.
8. **`goal`**: A list containing tuples for each non-player element in the grid whose second character is 'G', with the tuples representing their positions (row, column).
9. **`tmp`**: 0 if the first character of these elements is 'B' or 1 if it is not.
10. **`t`**: Must be greater than 0.
11. **`time`**: 0.
12. **`command`**: A list of strings read from the standard input and split by spaces.
13. **`obj`**: The first element of `command`.
14. **`com`**: The second element of `command`.
15. **`pos`**: The tuple representing the position (row, column) of `obj` in the `elements` dictionary.
16. **`nxt`**: The tuple `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`.
17. **Additional Conditions**:
    - Either `obj` is not '.B' or `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]` is not a player.
    - Either `obj` is not a player or `elements['.B']` is not equal to `nxt`.
18. **`com`**: 'T'.
19. **`pos`**: A goal position, meaning `goalIn(pos)` returns a valid index (not -1).
20. **`team`**: The index returned by `goalIn(pos)`.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print('%d %s GOAL' % (time, GoalName[team]))
```

### Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. **`time`**: This is explicitly given as 0.
2. **`team`**: This is the index returned by `goalIn(pos)`. Since `pos` is a goal position, `goalIn(pos)` returns a valid index (not -1). Let's denote this index as `k`.
3. **`GoalName[team]`**: This is the name associated with the goal at index `k` in the `GoalName` list. Without the exact content of `GoalName`, we can only refer to it as `GoalName[k]`.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output the current time (which is 0) followed by the name of the goal at the index `k` in the `GoalName` list, followed by "GOAL".

Output: **0 GoalName[k] GOAL (where k is the index returned by `goalIn(pos)`)**
