Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and n is odd, `i` is `n-1`, `line` is a list of strings read from the standard input and split by spaces, `ind` is the length of `line` minus 1, `grid` contains `n` lines, each a list of strings read from the standard input, `elements` dictionary contains keys for each non-'..' element in the entire grid, with values being tuples representing their positions (row, column), `allPlayers` dictionary now has the key `obj` set to `False`, `goal` list contains tuples for each non-player element in the grid whose second character is 'G', with the tuples representing their positions (row, column), and `tmp` is 0 if the first character of these elements is 'B' or 1 if it is not, `t` must be greater than 0, `time` is 0, `command` is a list of strings read from the standard input and split by spaces, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `pos` is the tuple representing the position (row, column) of `obj` in the `elements` dictionary, `nxt` is the tuple `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`. Additionally, either `obj` is not '.B' or `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]` is not a player, and either `obj` is not a player or `elements['.B']` is not equal to `nxt`. The command `com` is 'T'. The position `pos` is a goal position, meaning `goalIn(pos)` returns a valid index (not -1). `team` is the index returned by `goalIn(pos)`. `points[team]` is increased by 1.**
