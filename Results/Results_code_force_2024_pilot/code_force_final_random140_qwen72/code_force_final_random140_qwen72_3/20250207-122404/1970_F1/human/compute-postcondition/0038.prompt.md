Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and n is odd, `i` is 0, `line` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input line, `grid` contains `line` as its last element.
Code of the loop:
for ind in range(len(line)):
    if line[ind] != '..':
        elements[line[ind]] = i, ind
        if isPlayer(line[ind]):
            allPlayers[line[ind]] = False
        elif line[ind][1] == 'G':
            tmp = 0 if line[ind][0] == 'B' else 1
            goal[tmp].append((i, ind))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and n is odd, `i` is 0, `line` is a list of strings that must have at least 1 element, `ind` is 0, `grid` contains `line` as its last element. If the first element of `line` is not '..', then `elements` is a dictionary with the key being the first element of `line` and the value being a tuple (0, 0). If the first element of `line` is a player, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with the key being the first element of `line` and the value being `False`. If the first element of `line` is not a player and the second character of the first element of `line` is 'G', then `tmp` is 1, and `goal[1]` is a list containing the tuple (0, 0). If the first element of `line` is '..', no changes are made to any variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and n is odd, `i` is 0, `line` is a list of strings that must have at least 2 elements, `ind` is 1, `grid` contains `line` as its last element. If `line[1]` is not '..', `elements` is updated to include the key `line[1]` with the value `(0, 1)`. If the first element of `line` is not '..', then `elements` also includes the key being the first element of `line` and the value being `(0, 0)`. If the first element of `line` is a player, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with the key being the first element of `line` and the value being `False`. If the first element of `line` is not a player and the second character of the first element of `line` is 'G', then `tmp` is 1, and `goal[1]` is a list containing the tuple `(0, 0)`. If the first element of `line` is '..', no changes are made to any variables. If `line[1]` is a player, `allPlayers` now includes the key `line[1]` with the value `False`. If the first character of `line[1]` is 'B', `tmp` is 0; otherwise, `tmp` is 1. If the first element of `line` is not a player and the second character of the first element of `line` is 'G', then `goal[1]` also contains the tuple `(0, 1)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and n is odd, `i` is 0, `line` is a list of strings that must have at least 3 elements, `ind` is 2, `grid` contains `line` as its last element. If `line[2]` is not '..', `elements` includes the key `line[2]` with the value `(0, 2)`. If `line[1]` is not '..', `elements` is updated to include the key `line[1]` with the value `(0, 1)`. If the first element of `line` is not '..', then `elements` also includes the key being the first element of `line` and the value being `(0, 0)`. If the first element of `line` is a player, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with the key being the first element of `line` and the value being `False`. If the first element of `line` is not a player and the second character of the first element of `line` is 'G', then `tmp` is 1, and `goal[1]` is a list containing the tuple `(0, 0)`. If the first element of `line` is '..', no changes are made to any variables. If `line[1]` is a player, `allPlayers` now includes the key `line[1]` with the value `False`. If the first character of `line[1]` is 'B', `tmp` is 0; otherwise, `tmp` is 1. If the first element of `line` is not a player and the second character of the first element of `line` is 'G', then `goal[1]` also contains the tuple `(0, 1)`. If `line[2]` is a player, `allPlayers` includes the key `line[2]` with the value `False`. If `line[2][1]` is 'G', `tmp` is 0 if the first character of `line[2]` is 'B'; otherwise, `tmp` is 1, and `goal[tmp]` now contains the tuple `(0, 2)`. If `line[2]` is '..', no changes are made to any variables.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
