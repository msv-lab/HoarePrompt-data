The code snippet `goal[tmp].append((i, ind))` appends the tuple `(i, ind)` to the list located at the index `tmp` in the `goal` dictionary.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and n is odd.
- `i` is 0.
- `line` is a list of strings that must have at least 1 element.
- `ind` is 0.
- `grid` contains `line` as its last element, and the first element of `line` is not '..'.
- `elements` is a dictionary with the key being the first element of `line` and the value being a tuple (0, 0).
- The first element of `line` is not a player.
- The second character of the first element of `line` is 'G'.
- `tmp` is 1.

The code appends the tuple `(0, 0)` to the list at the key `1` in the `goal` dictionary.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and n is odd, `i` is 0, `line` is a list of strings that must have at least 1 element, `ind` is 0, `grid` contains `line` as its last element, and the first element of `line` is not '..', `elements` is a dictionary with the key being the first element of `line` and the value being a tuple (0, 0), the first element of `line` is not a player, the second character of the first element of `line` is 'G', `tmp` is 1, and `goal[1]` is a list containing the tuple (0, 0).**
