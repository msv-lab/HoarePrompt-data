Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and n is odd, `i` is 1, `line` is a list of strings read from the standard input and split by spaces and must have at least two elements, `ind` is the length of the new `line` (which is `ind + 1` from the previous state), `grid` now contains the new `line` as its last element, `elements` dictionary contains keys for each non-'..' element in the new `line`, with values being tuples representing their positions (0, index), `allPlayers` dictionary contains keys for each player element in the new `line`, with values set to `False`, `goal` list contains tuples for each non-player element in the new `line` whose second character is 'G', with the tuples representing their positions (0, index), `tmp` is 0 if the first character of `line[ind]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1. If the last element of `line` (at index `ind-1`) is not '..', `elements` dictionary now includes the key `line[ind-1]` with the value `(1, ind-1)`. If `line[ind-1]` is a player, `allPlayers` dictionary now includes the key `line[ind-1]` with the value `False`. If `line[ind-1][1]` is 'G', `goal[tmp]` now includes the tuple `(1, ind-1)` appended to its existing list. If the last element of `line` (at index `ind-1`) is '..', the state remains unchanged as described above.***
