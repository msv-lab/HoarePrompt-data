Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and n is odd, `i` is 2, `line` is a list of strings read from the standard input and split by spaces and must contain at least one element, `ind` is 0, `grid` now contains the new `line` as its last element, `elements` dictionary contains keys for each non-'..' element in the new `line`, with values being tuples representing their positions (0, index), and the entry for `line[ind]` is updated to `(2, 0)`, `allPlayers` dictionary contains keys for each player element in the new `line`, with values set to `False`, `goal` list contains tuples for each non-player element in the new `line` whose second character is 'G', with the tuples representing their positions (0, index), and `tmp` is 0 if the first character of these elements is 'B' or 1 if it is not. Additionally, the element at `line[ind]` is not equal to '..' and is a player element.**
