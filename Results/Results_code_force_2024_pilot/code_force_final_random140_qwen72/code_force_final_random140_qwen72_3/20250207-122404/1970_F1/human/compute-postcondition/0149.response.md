The code snippet `points[team] += 10` increments the value of `points[team]` by 10. The value of `team` is determined by the first character of `obj`. If the first character of `obj` is 'B', `team` is 1; otherwise, `team` is 0. Therefore, the specific value of `points[team]` will depend on whether `team` is 0 or 1.

Output State: **`command` is a list of strings read from the standard input and split by spaces, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and n is odd, `i` is `n-1`, `line` is a list of strings read from the standard input and split by spaces, `ind` is the length of `line` minus 1, `grid` contains `n` lines, each a list of strings read from the standard input, `elements` dictionary contains keys for each non-'..' element in the entire grid, with values being tuples representing their positions (row, column), `goal` list contains tuples for each non-player element in the grid whose second character is 'G', with the tuples representing their positions (row, column), `tmp` is 0 if the first character of these elements is 'B' or 1 if it is not, `t` must be greater than 1, `time` is 1, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `el` is the third element of `command`, `team` is 1 if the first character of `obj` is 'B' else 0, `points[team]` is increased by 10.**
