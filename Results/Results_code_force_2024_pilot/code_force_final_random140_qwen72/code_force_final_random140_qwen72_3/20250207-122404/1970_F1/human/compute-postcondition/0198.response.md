The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. However, the context suggests that within the function, there are two integers `n` and `m` such that both are odd and fall within the range 3 to 99 (inclusive). The function's output is not specified in the provided information, so we cannot determine what the function returns based on the given constraints alone.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It involves two integers `n` and `m` that are both odd and within the range 3 to 99. The specific output of the function is not provided.**
