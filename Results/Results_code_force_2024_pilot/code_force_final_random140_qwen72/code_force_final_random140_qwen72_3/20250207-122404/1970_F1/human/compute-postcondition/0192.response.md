Postcondition: **`command` is a list of strings read from the standard input, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 99 and n is odd, `i` is `n-1`, `line` is a list of strings, `ind` is the length of `line` minus 1, `grid` contains `n` lines, each a list of strings, `elements` dictionary contains keys for each non-'..' element in the entire grid, with values being tuples representing their positions (row, column), `goal` list contains tuples for each non-player element in the grid whose second character is 'G', with the tuples representing their positions (row, column), `tmp` is 0 if the first character of these elements is 'B' or 1 if it is not, `t` must be greater than 2, `time` is 2, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `pos` is the tuple representing the position (row, column) of `obj` in the `elements` dictionary, `nxt` is the tuple `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`. If `obj` is '.B' and the next position `nxt` contains a player, or if `obj` is a player and the next position `nxt` matches the position of '.B', then `player` is set to `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` returns `True`, otherwise `player` is the element at the position `nxt` in the `grid`. If `com` is 'T' and `goalIn(pos)` is not -1, then `team` is the result of `goalIn(pos)`, and `points[team]` is incremented by 1. If `com` is not 'T' and `obj` is a player, the `elements` dictionary is updated to reflect the new position of `obj` as `nxt`.**
