N and M are integers such that 3 <= N, M <= 99 and both are odd; P is an integer such that 1 <= P <= 10; T is an integer such that 0 <= T <= 10000. The field is represented as a grid of size N x M, where each cell can contain a player (R0-R9 or B0-B9), a goal (RG or BG), the Quaffle (.Q), or be empty (..). The initial position of the Quaffle is at the center of the field. The actions are valid and follow the rules described in the problem statement.
