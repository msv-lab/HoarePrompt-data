### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly reads the grid dimensions `n` and `m` and initializes the grid.
   - It also initializes dictionaries and lists to keep track of the positions of elements (players, goals, and the Quaffle), the state of players (whether they are carrying the Quaffle), and the goals for each team.
   - The function correctly identifies and stores the positions of players and goals.

2. **Command Processing:**
   - The function processes a series of commands over `t` steps.
   - For each command, it updates the positions of entities (players and the Quaffle) based on the action specified (move, catch, throw).
   - It correctly handles the elimination of players and the scoring of goals.
   - The function also handles the special case of catching the golden snitch, although this is not part of the primary problem description.

3. **Scoring and Elimination:**
   - The function correctly increments the score when a player scores a goal in the opponent's goal.
   - It also correctly handles the case where a player scores in their own goal, awarding the point to the opposing team.
   - The function prints the appropriate messages for scoring and elimination.

4. **Final Score:**
   - After processing all commands, the function prints the final score for both teams.

5. **Helper Functions:**
   - The `goalIn` function correctly determines if a position is within a goal area and returns the appropriate team index.
   - The `isPlayer` function correctly identifies whether a given element is a player.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the rules and logic described in the problem statement. It processes the input, simulates the game, and outputs the correct events and final score.

**Correctness: **True****
