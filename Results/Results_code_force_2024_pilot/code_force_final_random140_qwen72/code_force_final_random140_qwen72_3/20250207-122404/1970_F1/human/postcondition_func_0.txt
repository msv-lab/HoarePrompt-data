This function reads a grid of characters from the standard input, where the grid dimensions `n` and `m` are odd integers between 3 and 99. It processes the grid to identify specific elements and their positions, including players and goals. The function then simulates a series of commands over a specified number of turns, updating the state of the game based on these commands. Players can be eliminated, score points, or catch a golden snitch, which affects the game's state and scoring. After all commands are processed, the function prints the final scores for two teams. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any values.
