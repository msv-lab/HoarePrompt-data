The function `goalIn` takes a position `pos` and checks if it is in the red team's goals (first set in the `goal` list) or the blue team's goals (second set in the `goal` list). It returns 0 if `pos` is in the red team's goals, 1 if `pos` is in the blue team's goals, and -1 if `pos` is not in either set. The function does not modify any input parameters.
