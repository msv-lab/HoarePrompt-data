Reasoning:

The program aims to find the minimum length of a continuous segment that needs to be painted white to make all cells white. The logic used in the program is to find the first and last positions of the black cells ('B') in the strip and calculate the length of the segment between these two positions, inclusive. This approach is correct because it ensures that all black cells are covered by the segment to be painted, and no unnecessary white cells are included beyond the first and last black cells.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's correctness:
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
2. **Finding First and Last Black Cells**: The program uses `s.find('B')` to find the index of the first black cell and `s.rfind('B')` to find the index of the last black cell. These functions return the correct indices or -1 if 'B' is not found. However, since the problem guarantees at least one black cell, `first_black` and `last_black` will always be valid indices.
3. **Calculating Minimum Length**: The minimum length of the segment to be painted is calculated as `last_black - first_black + 1`. This formula correctly computes the length of the segment from the first black cell to the last black cell, inclusive.
4. **Output**: The program prints the calculated minimum length for each test case, which matches the expected output format.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly solves the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
