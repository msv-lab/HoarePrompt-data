Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You have a horizontal strip of n cells. Each cell is either white or black.

You can choose a continuous segment of cells once and paint them all white.
After this action, all the black cells in this segment will become white, and
the white ones will remain white.

What is the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white in
order for all n cells to become white?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10 )
— the length of the strip.

The second line of each test case contains a string s , consisting of n
characters, each of which is either 'W' or 'B'. The symbol 'W' denotes a white
cell, and 'B' — a black one. It is guaranteed that at least one cell of the
given strip is black.

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum length of a
continuous segment of cells that needs to be painted white in order for the
entire strip to become white.

Note

In the first test case of the example for the strip "WBBWBW", the minimum
length of the segment to be repainted white is 4 . It is necessary to repaint
to white the segment from the 2 -nd to the 5 -th cell (the cells are numbered
from 1 from left to right).

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10, representing the length of the strip, and s is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', where 'W' represents a white cell and 'B' represents a black cell, with at least one cell being black.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        s = input()
        
        first_black = s.find('B')
        
        last_black = s.rfind('B')
        
        min_paint = last_black - first_black + 1
        
        print(min_paint)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `_` is `t-1`, `t` remains the same as the initial input, and for each test case, `n` and `s` are the inputs provided for that specific iteration. `first_black` is the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in `s` or -1 if 'B' is not found, `last_black` is the index of the last occurrence of 'B' in `s` or -1 if 'B' is not found, and `min_paint` is `last_black - first_black + 1`. The loop has printed the value of `min_paint` for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'W' and 'B'. It calculates the minimum number of cells that need to be painted to cover all black cells ('B') in the string `s` and prints this value for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After the function completes, `t` remains unchanged, and the values of `n` and `s` for each test case are processed and discarded.
