You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have a horizontal strip of n cells. Each cell is either white or black.

You can choose a continuous segment of cells once and paint them all white.
After this action, all the black cells in this segment will become white, and
the white ones will remain white.

What is the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white in
order for all n cells to become white?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10 )
— the length of the strip.

The second line of each test case contains a string s , consisting of n
characters, each of which is either 'W' or 'B'. The symbol 'W' denotes a white
cell, and 'B' — a black one. It is guaranteed that at least one cell of the
given strip is black.

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum length of a
continuous segment of cells that needs to be painted white in order for the
entire strip to become white.

Note

In the first test case of the example for the strip "WBBWBW", the minimum
length of the segment to be repainted white is 4 . It is necessary to repaint
to white the segment from the 2 -nd to the 5 -th cell (the cells are numbered
from 1 from left to right).

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        first_black = s.find('B')
        last_black = s.rfind('B')
        min_paint = last_black - first_black + 1
        print(min_paint)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10, representing the length of the strip, and s is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', where 'W' represents a white cell and 'B' represents a black cell, with at least one cell being black.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        s = input()
        
        first_black = s.find('B')
        
        last_black = s.rfind('B')
        
        min_paint = last_black - first_black + 1
        
        print(min_paint)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `_` is `t-1`, `t` remains the same as the initial input, and for each test case, `n` and `s` are the inputs provided for that specific iteration. `first_black` is the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in `s` or -1 if 'B' is not found, `last_black` is the index of the last occurrence of 'B' in `s` or -1 if 'B' is not found, and `min_paint` is `last_black - first_black + 1`. The loop has printed the value of `min_paint` for each test case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function starts by reading an integer `t`, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two lines: an integer `n` representing the length of the strip and a string `s` representing the strip itself.

2. **Finding Black Cells**: The function uses `s.find('B')` to find the index of the first black cell and `s.rfind('B')` to find the index of the last black cell. These functions return the indices of the first and last occurrences of 'B' in the string `s`.

3. **Calculating Minimum Segment Length**: The minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted is calculated as `last_black - first_black + 1`. This formula correctly computes the length of the segment from the first black cell to the last black cell, inclusive.

4. **Output**: The function prints the calculated minimum length for each test case.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the strip consists entirely of white cells, the problem guarantees that at least one cell is black, so this case does not need to be handled separately.
   - If there is only one black cell, the segment length will be 1, which is correct.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the function appears to handle all edge cases and correctly compute the minimum segment length for each test case.
