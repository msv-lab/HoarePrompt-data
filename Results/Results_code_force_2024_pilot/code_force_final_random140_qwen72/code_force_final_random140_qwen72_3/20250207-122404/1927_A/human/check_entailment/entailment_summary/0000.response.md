Reasoning:  
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white to turn all cells white. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the length of the strip `n` and the string `s` representing the strip.

2. **Finding Black Cells**: It uses `s.find('B')` to find the index of the first black cell and `s.rfind('B')` to find the index of the last black cell. This is correct because these methods return the indices of the first and last occurrences of 'B' in the string, respectively.

3. **Calculating Minimum Length**: The minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted is calculated as `last_black - first_black + 1`. This formula is correct because it covers all black cells between the first and last black cells, inclusive.

4. **Output**: The program prints the result for each test case, which matches the expected output format.

Given the problem description and the execution summary, the program behaves as expected and produces the correct output for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
