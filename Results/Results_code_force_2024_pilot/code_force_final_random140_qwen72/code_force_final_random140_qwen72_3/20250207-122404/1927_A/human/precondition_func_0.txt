t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10, representing the length of the strip, and s is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', where 'W' represents a white cell and 'B' represents a black cell, with at least one cell being black.
