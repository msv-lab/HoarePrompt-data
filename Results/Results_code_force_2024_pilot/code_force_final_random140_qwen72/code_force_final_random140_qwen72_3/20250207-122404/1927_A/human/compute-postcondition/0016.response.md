Output State: **`_` is 2, `t` must be greater than 2, `n` is a new input integer, `s` is a new input string, `first_black` is the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in the new `s` or -1 if 'B' is not found, `last_black` is the index of the last occurrence of 'B' in the new `s` or -1 if 'B' is not found, `min_paint` is `last_black - first_black + 1`**

Explanation: The code snippet `n = int(input())` updates the value of `n` to a new input integer provided by the user. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged. The new value of `n` is now an integer input by the user, while the rest of the initial state remains valid.
