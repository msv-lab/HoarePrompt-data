Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer (not directly relevant to the print statement).
   - `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10.
   - `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' or 'B' with at least one 'B'.
   - `i` is 2 (not directly relevant to the print statement).
   - `x` is a list of characters from a new input string.
   - `start` is the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in `x`.
   - `end` is the index of the last occurrence of 'B' in `x`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(end - start)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The variable `start` holds the index of the first 'B' in the list `x`.
   - The variable `end` holds the index of the last 'B' in the list `x`.
   - The expression `end - start` calculates the difference between these two indices.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - Since `start` is the index of the first 'B' and `end` is the index of the last 'B', the difference `end - start` gives the number of positions between the first and last 'B' (inclusive of the first 'B' but exclusive of the last 'B').

5. **Final Output:**
   - The print statement will output the integer value of `end - start`.

Output: **end - start (where end is the index of the last 'B' in the list x and start is the index of the first 'B' in the list x)**
