The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. The variable `t` is an integer input by the user, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0 (implied by the range function)**
