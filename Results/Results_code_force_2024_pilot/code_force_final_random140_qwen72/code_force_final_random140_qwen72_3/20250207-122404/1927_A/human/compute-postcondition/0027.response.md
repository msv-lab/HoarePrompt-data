Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10, `s` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' or 'B' with at least one 'B', `i` is 2, `x` is a list of characters from a new input string. If 'B' is in `x`, `start` is the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in `x`, and `end` is the index of the last occurrence of 'B' in `x`. If 'B' is not in `x`, `start` and `end` remain unchanged.***
