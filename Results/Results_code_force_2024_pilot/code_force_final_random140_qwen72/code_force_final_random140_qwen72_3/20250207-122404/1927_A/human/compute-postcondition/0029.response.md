The function `func` does not explicitly define its parameters within the function signature, but based on the provided parameter constraints, it is clear that the function is designed to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` and a string `s`. The integer `n` represents the length of a strip, and the string `s` consists of characters 'W' (white cell) and 'B' (black cell), with at least one 'B' in the string.

The function processes each test case and returns a result for each one. However, the specific output for each test case is not detailed in the provided information. Given the context, a reasonable assumption is that the function might return some form of analysis or transformation of the strip represented by `s`.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` containing characters 'W' and 'B'. It returns a result for each test case, though the exact nature of the result is not specified in the given information.**
