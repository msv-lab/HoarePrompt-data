Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10, `s` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' or 'B' with at least one 'B', `i` is `n-1`, `x` is a list of characters from the last input string. If 'B' is in `x`, `start` is the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in `x`, and `end` is the index of the last occurrence of 'B' in `x`. If 'B' is not in `x`, `start` and `end` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n-1`, which is the last index of the loop. The variable `x` will hold the list of characters from the last input string provided during the loop's final iteration. If this last input string contains at least one 'B', `start` will be the index of the first 'B' and `end` will be the index of the last 'B'. If the last input string does not contain any 'B', the variables `start` and `end` will not be modified. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
