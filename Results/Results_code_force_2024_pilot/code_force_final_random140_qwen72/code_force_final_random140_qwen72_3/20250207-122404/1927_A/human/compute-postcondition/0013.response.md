Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is a new input integer, `s` is a new input string, `first_black` is the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in the new `s` or -1 if 'B' is not found, `last_black` is the index of the last occurrence of 'B' in the new `s` or -1 if 'B' is not found, `min_paint` is `last_black - first_black + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `min_paint = last_black - first_black + 1` updates the value of `min_paint` based on the existing values of `first_black` and `last_black`.
- The initial state specifies that `first_black` is the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in the string `s`, or -1 if 'B' is not found.
- Similarly, `last_black` is the index of the last occurrence of 'B' in the string `s`, or -1 if 'B' is not found.
- The value of `min_paint` is calculated as `last_black - first_black + 1`, which represents the length of the substring between the first and last occurrences of 'B' (inclusive).
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `s`, `first_black`, `last_black`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
