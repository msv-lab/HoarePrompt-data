The code snippet `last_black = s.rfind('B')` finds the last occurrence of the character 'B' in the string `s` and assigns its index to the variable `last_black`. If 'B' is not found in `s`, `last_black` will be assigned the value -1.

Given the initial state:
- `t` must be greater than 0
- `_` is 0
- `n` is an input integer
- `s` is an input string
- `first_black` is the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in `s` or -1 if 'B' is not found

After executing the code snippet, the variable `last_black` will be updated to the index of the last occurrence of 'B' in `s`, or -1 if 'B' is not found. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `first_black` is the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in `s` or -1 if 'B' is not found, `last_black` is the index of the last occurrence of 'B' in `s` or -1 if 'B' is not found.**
