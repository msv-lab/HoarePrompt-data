Output State: **`_` is 2, `t` must be greater than 2, `n` is a new input integer, `s` is a new input string, `first_black` is the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in `s` or -1 if 'B' is not found, `last_black` is the index of the last occurrence of 'B' in `s` (updated by `s.rfind('B')`), `min_paint` is `last_black - first_black + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `last_black` is updated to the index of the last occurrence of 'B' in the string `s` using `s.rfind('B')`.
- All other variables (`_`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `first_black`, `min_paint`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The value of `min_paint` is still calculated as `last_black - first_black + 1`, but `last_black` has been updated.
