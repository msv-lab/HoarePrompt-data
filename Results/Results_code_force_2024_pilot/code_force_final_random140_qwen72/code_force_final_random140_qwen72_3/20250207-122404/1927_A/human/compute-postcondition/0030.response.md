Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` indicating the length of a string `s` (consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters), and then reads the string `s`. It calculates and prints the distance between the first and last occurrence of 'B' in the string `s`. If no 'B' is present, it prints 0. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the program state includes the printed results for each test case. **
