You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10, representing the length of the strip, and s is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', where 'W' represents a white cell and 'B' represents a black cell, with at least one cell being black.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        s = input()
        
        first_black = s.find('B')
        
        last_black = s.rfind('B')
        
        min_paint = last_black - first_black + 1
        
        print(min_paint)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `_` is `t-1`, `t` remains the same as the initial input, and for each test case, `n` and `s` are the inputs provided for that specific iteration. `first_black` is the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in `s` or -1 if 'B' is not found, `last_black` is the index of the last occurrence of 'B' in `s` or -1 if 'B' is not found, and `min_paint` is `last_black - first_black + 1`. The loop has printed the value of `min_paint` for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters for the number of test cases (`t`), the length of the strip (`n`), and the string representing the strip (`s`). It processes each test case and returns a result for each one. The result is based on the processing of the strip, which consists of characters 'W' (white) and 'B' (black).

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
