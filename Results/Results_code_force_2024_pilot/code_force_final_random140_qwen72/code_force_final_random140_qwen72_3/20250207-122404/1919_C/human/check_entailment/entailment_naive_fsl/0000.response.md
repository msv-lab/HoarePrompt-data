Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the optimal splitting of the array into two subsequences to minimize the penalty correctly. Specifically, the logic used to split the array `lit` into `a` and `b` is flawed. The current implementation only checks if the last element of `a` is less than the current element of `lit`, and if so, it appends the current element to `b`. This approach does not guarantee that the penalty is minimized.

Consider the following counterexample:

Input:
```
1
5
1 3 2 4 5
```

Expected Output:
```
1
```

Actual Output:
```
2
```

In this case, the optimal way to split the array `[1, 3, 2, 4, 5]` would be to have `s = [1, 2, 4, 5]` and `t = [3]`. This results in a penalty of `p(s) + p(t) = 1 + 0 = 1`. However, the given program splits the array into `a = [1, 3, 2, 4, 5]` and `b = []`, resulting in a penalty of `2`.

Therefore, the program does not work correctly for this input, and hence the correctness is **False**.
