Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The program's logic for splitting the array `lit` into `a` and `b` is indeed flawed. The program checks if the last element of `a` is less than the current element of `lit` and appends the current element to `b` if true; otherwise, it appends the current element to `a`. This approach does not ensure that the penalty is minimized.

The provided counterexample clearly demonstrates this issue:
- Input: `1 3 2 4 5`
- Expected Output: `1` (by splitting into `s = [1, 2, 4, 5]` and `t = [3]`)
- Actual Output: `2` (by splitting into `a = [1, 3, 2, 4, 5]` and `b = []`)

The program fails to consider the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty. Therefore, the original assessment that the program is incorrect is valid.

Final: **False**
