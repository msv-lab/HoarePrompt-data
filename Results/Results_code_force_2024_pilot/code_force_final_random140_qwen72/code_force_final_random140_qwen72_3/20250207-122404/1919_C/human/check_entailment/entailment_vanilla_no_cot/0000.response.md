Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem. The issue lies in how the arrays `a` and `b` are populated. The logic used to decide whether to append an element to `a` or `b` is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if a[-1] < lit[i]:` is not optimal for minimizing the penalty. This condition does not consider the overall structure of the sequences `s` and `t` to minimize the number of increasing pairs.

To correctly solve this problem, the optimal approach is to recognize that the minimum penalty can be achieved by ensuring that no element in `s` or `t` forms an increasing pair with any other element. This can be done by splitting the array such that all elements in one subsequence are less than or equal to all elements in the other subsequence. If this is not possible, the penalty should be calculated based on the inherent structure of the array.

A correct approach would involve sorting the array and then splitting it into two parts, ensuring that the penalty is minimized. However, even without sorting, a more careful approach to splitting the array is needed.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        lit = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Initialize the penalty
        penalty = 0
        
        # Count the number of increasing pairs in the original array
        for i in range(1, n):
            if lit[i] > lit[i - 1]:
                penalty += 1
        
        # The minimum penalty is the number of increasing pairs in the original array
        print(penalty)
```

This version correctly calculates the minimum penalty by counting the number of increasing pairs in the original array, which is the optimal way to split the array into two subsequences to minimize the penalty.
