To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop head.

### Given State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0
- `lit` is a list of integers derived from the new input
- `a` is a list containing only the first element of `lit`
- `b` is an empty list
- `len(a)` is 1
- `len(b)` is 0
- `cp` is 0
- `i` is -1
- `s` is 0

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop head involves the variable `i` and the variable `n`.
- The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1 (since `range(1, n)` will generate numbers from 1 to `n-1`).
- The initial value of `i` is -1, but this will be overwritten by the loop when it starts.

### Adjustments Needed:
- `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute.
- `i` will be set to 1 by the loop, so no adjustment is needed for `i`.

### Final State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `lit` is a list of integers derived from the new input
- `a` is a list containing only the first element of `lit`
- `b` is an empty list
- `len(a)` is 1
- `len(b)` is 0
- `cp` is 0
- `i` is -1 (will be set to 1 by the loop)
- `s` is 0

### State:
**`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `a` is a list containing only the first element of `lit`, `b` is an empty list, `len(a)` is 1, `len(b)` is 0, `cp` is 0, `i` is -1, `s` is 0**
