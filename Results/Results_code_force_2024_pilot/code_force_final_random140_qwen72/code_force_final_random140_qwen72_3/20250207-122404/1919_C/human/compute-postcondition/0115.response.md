Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` and all elements from `lit` that are greater than or equal to the previous element in `a`, `len(a)` must be greater than 2, `b` is a list containing all elements from `lit` that are less than the previous element in `a`, `len(a)` is the number of elements in `a` and must be greater than 2, `len(b)` is the number of elements in `b`, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, and `s` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The code `s += 1` increments the value of `s` by 1.
- Initially, `s` is 0 if `a[i]` is not greater than `a[i - 1]`, but since the precondition states that `s` is 1 if `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`, `s` starts at 1.
- After executing `s += 1`, the value of `s` becomes 1 + 1 = 2.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `lit`, `a`, `b`, `cp`, `i`) remain unchanged.
