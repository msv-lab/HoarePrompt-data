The code `b.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `b`. Let's analyze the impact of this code on the program:

- `b` was initially either a list containing the last element of `lit` or an empty list. After appending `lit[i]`, `b` now contains one more element, specifically the element at index `i` of `lit`.
- The length of `b` (`len(b)`) increases by 1. Since the condition `len(b)` is 1 if the last element of `a` is less than the element at index -1 in `lit`, otherwise `len(b)` is 0, and given that the last element of `a` is less than the element at index -1 in `lit`, `len(b)` was 1 before the operation. After appending, `len(b)` is now 2.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` and possibly the element at index `i` of `lit`, `b` is a list containing the last element of `lit` and the element at index `i` of `lit`, `len(a)` is 1 if the last element of `a` is less than the element at index -1 in `lit`, otherwise `len(a)` is 2, `len(b)` is 2, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `s` is 0, and the last element of `a` is less than the element at index -1 in `lit` if `a[-1] < lit[i]`, otherwise the last element of `a` is greater than or equal to the element at index `i` in `lit`.**
