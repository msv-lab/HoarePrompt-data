Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers derived from the input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` followed by all elements in `lit` that are not greater than any preceding element in `lit`, `b` is a list containing all elements in `lit` that are greater than the last element in `a` at the time they were encountered, `cp` is 0, `i` is `n-1`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 10^4.
- The variable `n` is still an input integer greater than 0.
- The list `lit` remains unchanged as it was derived from the input.
- The list `a` starts with the first element of `lit` and includes all subsequent elements from `lit` that are not greater than the last element added to `a`.
- The list `b` contains all elements from `lit` that were greater than the last element in `a` at the time they were encountered.
- The variable `cp` remains 0.
- The variable `i` is equal to `n-1`, indicating the loop has completed its final iteration.
