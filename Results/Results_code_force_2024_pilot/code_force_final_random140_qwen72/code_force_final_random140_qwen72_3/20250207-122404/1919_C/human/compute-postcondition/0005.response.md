To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for i in range(1, n):
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if the range `range(1, n)` contains at least one value. This means `n` must be greater than 1 (since the range starts from 1 and goes up to, but does not include, `n`).

### Adjusting the States:
- **`i`**: The variable `i` will start at 1 when the loop begins.
- **`n`**: For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1.

### Other Variables:
- **`t`**: This variable is not involved in the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted.
- **`lit`**: This variable is not involved in the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted.
- **`a`**: This variable is not involved in the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted.
- **`b`**: This variable is not involved in the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted.
- **`cp`**: This variable is not involved in the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted.

### Final State:
The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1 and `i` starts at 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers derived from the input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit`, `b` is an empty list, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1**
