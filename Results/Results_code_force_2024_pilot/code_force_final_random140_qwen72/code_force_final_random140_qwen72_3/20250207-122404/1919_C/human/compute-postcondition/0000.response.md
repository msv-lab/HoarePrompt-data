To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables and conditions specified in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
```

Here, the loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute at least once, `int(input())` must be greater than 0.

Let's break down the state adjustments needed:

1. **_**: This is a temporary variable used in the loop and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts.
2. **int(input())**: This is the condition that determines how many times the loop will run. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be greater than 0.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, representing the size of the array `a`.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.

We need to ensure that `int(input())` is greater than 0. Since `t` represents the number of test cases and is given to be between 1 and 10^4, we can assume that `int(input())` will be `t`.

Therefore, the adjusted state should ensure that `int(input())` is greater than 0, which is already guaranteed by the constraints on `t`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
