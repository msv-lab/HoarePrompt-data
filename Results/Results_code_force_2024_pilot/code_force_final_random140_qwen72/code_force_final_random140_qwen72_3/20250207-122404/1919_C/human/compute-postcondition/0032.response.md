To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and conditions in the loop head. The loop head is:

```python
for i in range(1, len(b)):
```

This means the loop will execute if `len(b)` is greater than 1. Let's break down the necessary adjustments:

1. **`i`**: The loop variable `i` will start from 1, as specified in the loop head.
2. **`b`**: The list `b` must have at least 2 elements for the loop to execute.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0
- `lit` is a list of integers derived from the input
- `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` followed by all elements in `lit` that are not greater than any preceding element in `lit`
- `b` is a list containing all elements in `lit` that are greater than the last element in `a` at the time they were encountered
- `cp` is 0
- `i` is `len(a) - 1`
- `s` is the number of times an element in `a` was greater than its preceding element

We need to ensure that `b` has at least 2 elements. Therefore, the state must be adjusted to reflect this condition.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers derived from the input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` followed by all elements in `lit` that are not greater than any preceding element in `lit`, `b` is a list containing all elements in `lit` that are greater than the last element in `a` at the time they were encountered and must have at least 2 elements, `cp` is 0, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `s` is the number of times an element in `a` was greater than its preceding element**
