Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `a` is a list containing elements from `lit` where each element is not greater than the next element in `lit` (if any), and `len(a)` must be greater than 1, `b` is a list containing elements from `lit` where each element is greater than the last element in `a` (if any), `cp` is 0, `i` is `len(a) + len(b)`. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`, then `s` is set to 1. Otherwise, `s` remains 0.***
