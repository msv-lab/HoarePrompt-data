Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers derived from the input, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `a` is a list containing the first and third elements of `lit`, `b` is an empty list or a list containing the second element of `lit` depending on the condition.**

Explanation:
- The code `a.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` (which is 2) of `lit` to the list `a`.
- Initially, `a` contains the first element of `lit`. After appending `lit[2]`, `a` now contains the first and third elements of `lit`.
- The state of `b` remains unchanged, which means it is either an empty list or a list containing the second element of `lit` based on the initial condition.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `lit`, `cp`, `i`) remain unchanged.
