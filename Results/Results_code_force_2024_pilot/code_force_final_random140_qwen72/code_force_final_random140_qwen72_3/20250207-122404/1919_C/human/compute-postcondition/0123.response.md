Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` and all elements from `lit` that are greater than or equal to the previous element in `a`, `len(a)` is the number of elements in `a`, `b` is a list containing all elements from `lit` that are less than the previous element in `a`, `len(b)` must be greater than 1, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its preceding element plus 1, and the current value of `b[i]` is greater than the value of `b[i - 1]`.**
