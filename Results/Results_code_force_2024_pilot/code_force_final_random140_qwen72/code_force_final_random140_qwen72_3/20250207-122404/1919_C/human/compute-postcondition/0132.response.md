To determine what will be printed by the `print(s)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `lit` is a list of integers derived from the new input.
   - `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` and all elements from `lit` that are greater than or equal to the previous element in `a`.
   - `len(a)` is the number of elements in `a`.
   - `b` is a list containing all elements from `lit` that are less than the previous element in `a`.
   - `len(b)` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations the loop has executed.
   - `cp` is 0.
   - `i` is `len(b) - 1`.
   - `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its preceding element plus the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its preceding element.

2. **Understanding `a` and `b`:**
   - `a` is constructed by iterating through `lit` and adding elements that are greater than or equal to the last element added to `a`.
   - `b` is constructed by iterating through `lit` and adding elements that are less than the last element added to `a`.

3. **Calculating `s`:**
   - `s` is the sum of two counts:
     - The number of times an element in `a` is greater than its preceding element.
     - The number of times an element in `b` is greater than its preceding element.

4. **Step-by-Step Calculation:**
   - For `a`, since it contains elements that are non-decreasing, the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its preceding element is the number of strict increases in `a`.
   - For `b`, since it contains elements that are less than the last element added to `a`, the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its preceding element is the number of strict increases in `b`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The value of `s` is the sum of the number of strict increases in `a` and the number of strict increases in `b`.

Given the initial state and the construction of `a` and `b`, the value of `s` will be the total count of strict increases in both lists `a` and `b`.

Output: **s (where s is the number of times an element in a is greater than its preceding element plus the number of times an element in b is greater than its preceding element)**
