Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `a` is a list containing only the first element of `lit`, `b` is an empty list, `cp` is 0, `i` is `len(a) + len(b) - 2`, and `s` is the number of times an element in `a` was greater than its preceding element plus the number of times an element in `b` (excluding the first element) was greater than its preceding element.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `cp = 0` sets the variable `cp` to 0.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `lit`, `a`, `b`, `i`, and `s`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- Therefore, the output state reflects the initial state with the updated value of `cp`.
