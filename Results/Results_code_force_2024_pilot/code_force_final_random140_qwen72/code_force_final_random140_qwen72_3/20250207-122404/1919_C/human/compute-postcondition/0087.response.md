To determine what will be printed when the `print(s)` statement executes, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `lit` is a list of integers derived from the new input.
   - `a` is a list containing elements from `lit` where each element is not greater than the next element in `lit` (if any), and `len(a)` must be greater than 1.
   - `b` is a list containing elements from `lit` where each element is greater than the last element in `a` (if any), and `len(b)` must be greater than 1.
   - `cp` is 0.
   - `i` is `len(a) + len(b) - 2`.
   - `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its preceding element plus the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its preceding element.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `a` is a non-decreasing subsequence of `lit` with at least two elements.
   - `b` is a strictly increasing subsequence of `lit` starting after the last element of `a` with at least two elements.
   - `s` counts the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its preceding element and the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its preceding element.

3. **Calculating `s`:**
   - For `a`, since it is a non-decreasing subsequence, the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its preceding element is 0 (because it is non-decreasing, not strictly increasing).
   - For `b`, since it is a strictly increasing subsequence, the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its preceding element is `len(b) - 1`.

4. **Combining the Counts:**
   - `s = 0 + (len(b) - 1) = len(b) - 1`.

Therefore, the value of `s` is `len(b) - 1`.

Output: **len(b) - 1 (where len(b) is the length of the list b)**
