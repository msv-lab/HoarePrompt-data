Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers derived from the input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` followed by all elements in `lit` that are not greater than any preceding element in `lit` and must have at least 2 elements, `b` is a list containing all elements in `lit` that are greater than the last element in `a` at the time they were encountered, `cp` is 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `len(a)` must be greater than `n + 1`. If `a[i]` > `a[i - 1]`, then `s` is 1; otherwise, `s` remains 0. After the code execution, `s` is 1.** 

Explanation: The code `s += 1` increments the value of `s` by 1. Initially, `s` is 0, so after the increment, `s` becomes 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
