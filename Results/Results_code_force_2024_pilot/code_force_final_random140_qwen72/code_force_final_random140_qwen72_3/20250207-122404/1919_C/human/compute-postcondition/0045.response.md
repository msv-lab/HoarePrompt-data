Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers derived from the input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` followed by all elements in `lit` that are not greater than any preceding element in `lit`, `b` is a list containing all elements in `lit` that are greater than the last element in `a` at the time they were encountered and must have at least 2 elements, `cp` is 0, `i` is `len(a) + len(b) - 2`, and `s` is the number of times an element in `a` was greater than its preceding element plus the number of times an element in `b` (excluding the first element) was greater than its preceding element.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `n = int(input())` updates the value of `n` to be an input integer greater than 0.
- All other variables (`t`, `lit`, `a`, `b`, `cp`, `i`, and `s`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
