Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers derived from the input, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2. If the last element of `a` (which initially contains the first element of `lit`) is less than the element at index `i` in `lit`, then `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit`, and `b` is a list containing the second and third elements of `lit`. Otherwise, `a` is a list containing the first and third elements of `lit`, and `b` is an empty list.***
