The function `func_1` is designed to handle multiple test cases. It accepts three parameters for each test case:

- `t`: An integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n`: An integer representing the number of containers in each test case, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.
- `a`: A list of n integers representing the initial amounts of water in the containers, where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of a_i in each test case does not exceed 2 · 10^9, and the sum of a_i is divisible by n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

The function processes each test case and returns the minimum number of operations required to make all the containers have the same amount of water. Each operation consists of transferring any amount of water from one container to another.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `t` (number of test cases), an integer `n` (number of containers), and a list `a` (initial amounts of water in the containers). It returns the minimum number of operations required to equalize the water levels in all containers for each test case.**
