The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the value `t`. The loop will execute as long as the current value of `_` is less than `t`.

At the end of the last iteration, `_` was incremented by 1, and the loop condition was still satisfied (i.e., `_` was less than `t`). For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be incremented by 1 again, and `t` must still be greater than the new value of `_`.

State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, and `arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order. If all elements in `arr` are in non-decreasing order, then the condition holds true. Otherwise, there exists at least one pair of indices `i` and `i + 1` such that `arr[i] > arr[i + 1]`. `_` is incremented by 1, and `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`**.
