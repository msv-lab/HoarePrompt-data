Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `_` is incremented by 1 (so it is now `_ + 1`), `t` must be greater than the new value of `_` (so `t > _ + 1`), `arr` is a sorted list of integers read from the input. If all elements in `arr` are in non-decreasing order, the condition is met. Otherwise, the condition is not met, but the values of `t`, `n`, `_`, and `arr` remain as described.** 

Explanation:
- The code `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `arr`.
- The initial state specifies that `arr` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, which means the new `arr` should also be a sorted list of integers.
- The values of `t`, `n`, and `_` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the given code snippet.
- The condition that `t` must be greater than the new value of `_` (so `t > _ + 1`) remains valid.
- The condition about the elements in `arr` being in non-decreasing order is still applicable, but the actual values in `arr` are updated based on the new input.
