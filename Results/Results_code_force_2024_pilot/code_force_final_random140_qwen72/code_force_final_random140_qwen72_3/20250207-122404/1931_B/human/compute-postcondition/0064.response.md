Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `total_water` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `target` is `total_water // n`, `current_balance` is 0, `i` is `n-1`. If `current_balance` has never been less than 0 during the loop, `possible` is True. Otherwise, `possible` is False.**

Explanation:
- The variable `current_balance` is reset to 0.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `total_water`, `target`, `i`, and `possible`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
