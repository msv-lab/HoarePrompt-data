The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder to indicate that the loop will run `t` times. Since the loop does not depend on the value of `_` itself, but rather on the number of iterations specified by `t`, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `_`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), and the loop has already run once. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `_` should increment by 1, but since `_` is not used, it's the remaining count of `t` that matters.

However, the loop control variable `_` is not explicitly tracked, so the key state to consider is the remaining number of iterations, which is implicitly managed by the `range(t)` function. Since the loop has already run once, the remaining number of iterations is `t - 1`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) minus 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `total_water` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `target` is `total_water // n`, `current_balance` is the sum of the elements in `a` from index 0 to `n-1` minus `n * target`, `i` is `n-1`. If `current_balance` has never been less than 0 during the loop, `possible` is True. Otherwise, `possible` is False.**

Simplified:
State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `total_water` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `target` is `total_water // n`, `current_balance` is the sum of the elements in `a` from index 0 to `n-1` minus `n * target`, `i` is `n-1`. If `current_balance` has never been less than 0 during the loop, `possible` is True. Otherwise, `possible` is False.**
