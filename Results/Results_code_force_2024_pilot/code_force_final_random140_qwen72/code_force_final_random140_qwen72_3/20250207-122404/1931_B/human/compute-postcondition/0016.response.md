Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `_` is incremented by 1, `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`, `arr` is a sorted list of integers read from the input. If all elements in `arr` are in non-decreasing order, the condition is met. Otherwise, the condition is not met, but the values of `t`, `n`, `_`, and `arr` remain as described.***
