To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which in this case is `_` and `t`.

- The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop to indicate that the value from `range(t)` is not needed within the loop body.
- The variable `t` represents the number of test cases and must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- This means `t` is already guaranteed to be at least 1, which ensures the loop will execute at least once.

Therefore, no adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute. The state remains as provided, with the only requirement being that `t` must be at least 1.

State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.**
