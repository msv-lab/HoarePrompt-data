Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `total_water` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `target` is `total_water // n`, `current_balance` is `a[0] - target`, `i` is 0, `possible` is False, and the current value of `current_balance` is less than 0. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
