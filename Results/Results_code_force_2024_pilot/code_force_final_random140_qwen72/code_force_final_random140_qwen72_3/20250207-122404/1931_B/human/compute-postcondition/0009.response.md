Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, and `arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order. If all elements in `arr` are in non-decreasing order, then the condition holds true. Otherwise, there exists at least one pair of indices `i` and `i + 1` such that `arr[i] > arr[i + 1]`.***
