The code snippet `arr.sort()` sorts the list `arr` in ascending order. This operation modifies the list `arr` but does not affect the other variables.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `_` is incremented by 1, `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`, `arr` is a sorted list of integers read from the input.**
