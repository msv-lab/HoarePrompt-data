The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `_` being less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` was incremented by 1, and `t` must be greater than the new value of `_` for the loop to execute again.

- `_` was incremented by 1, so if it was `x` before, it is now `x + 1`.
- For the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`, which is `x + 1`.

Given that `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `_` is incremented by 1, the new state is:

State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `_` is incremented by 1 (so it is now `_ + 1`), `t` must be greater than the new value of `_` (so `t > _ + 1`), `arr` is a sorted list of integers read from the input. If all elements in `arr` are in non-decreasing order, the condition is met. Otherwise, the condition is not met, but the values of `t`, `n`, `_`, and `arr` remain as described.**
