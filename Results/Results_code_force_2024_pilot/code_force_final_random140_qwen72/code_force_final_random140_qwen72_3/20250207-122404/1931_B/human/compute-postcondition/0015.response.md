The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. Let's break down the initial state and the context to understand why this output is produced:

- `t` is an input integer with a constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is another input integer.
- `_` is a variable that is incremented by 1.
- The condition `t` must be greater than the new value of `_` is checked.
- `arr` is a sorted list of integers read from the input.

However, none of these variables or conditions directly affect the `print` statement, which simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output of the code snippet is:
Output: **NO**
