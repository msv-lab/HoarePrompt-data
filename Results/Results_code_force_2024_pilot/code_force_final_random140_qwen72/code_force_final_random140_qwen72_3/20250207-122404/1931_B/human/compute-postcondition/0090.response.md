Functionality: ** The function processes multiple test cases, each involving a set of containers with initial water amounts. It checks whether it is possible to redistribute the water such that all containers have the same amount of water without any container ever having less water than its target amount. For each test case, it prints 'YES' if the redistribution is possible, otherwise it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function ends. **
