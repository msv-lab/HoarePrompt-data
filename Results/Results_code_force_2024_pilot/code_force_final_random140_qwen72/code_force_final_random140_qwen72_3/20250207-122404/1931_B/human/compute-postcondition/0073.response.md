Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `total_water` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `target` is `total_water // n`, `current_balance` is `a[0] + a[1] - 2 * target`, `i` is 1, `possible` remains True if `current_balance` is not less than 0.** 

Explanation:
- The value of `current_balance` is updated by adding `a[i] - target` to its current value.
- Since `i` is initially 1, `a[i]` refers to the second element in the list `a`.
- The new value of `current_balance` is `a[0] + a[1] - 2 * target`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `total_water`, `target`, `i`, and `possible`) remain unchanged.
