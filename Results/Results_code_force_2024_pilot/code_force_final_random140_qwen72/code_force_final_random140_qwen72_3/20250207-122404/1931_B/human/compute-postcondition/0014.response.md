Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `_` is incremented by 1.
- `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`.
- `arr` is a sorted list of integers read from the input.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Value of `t`**: `t` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. **Value of `n`**: `n` is an input integer, but its specific value is not relevant to the print statement.
3. **Value of `_`**: `_` is incremented by 1. This means `_` is initially some value (let's call it `initial_value`), and after incrementing, it becomes `initial_value + 1`.
4. **Condition**: `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`. This means `t > initial_value + 1`.
5. **Value of `arr`**: `arr` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, but its specific values are not relevant to the print statement.

### Conclusion:
The print statement `print('YES')` will always print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `_`, or `arr`. The conditions and values described in the initial state do not affect the content of the print statement.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
