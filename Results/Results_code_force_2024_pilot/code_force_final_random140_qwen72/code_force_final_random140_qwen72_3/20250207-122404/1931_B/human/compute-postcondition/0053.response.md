Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `total_water` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `target` is `total_water // n`, `current_balance` is the sum of the elements in `a` from index 0 to `n-1` minus `n * target`, `i` is `n-1`. If `current_balance` is less than 0 at any point during the loop, `possible` is set to False, and the loop breaks. Otherwise, `possible` remains True.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates `n` times, updating `current_balance` by adding `a[i] - target` for each iteration.
- After `n` iterations, `current_balance` will be the sum of the elements in `a` from index 0 to `n-1` minus `n * target`.
- The variable `i` will be `n-1` after the last iteration.
- If `current_balance` becomes less than 0 at any point during the loop, `possible` is set to False, and the loop breaks. Otherwise, `possible` remains True.
