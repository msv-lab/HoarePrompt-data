The function `func_1` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` representing the number of containers, followed by a list of `n` integers representing the initial amounts of water in the containers. The function sorts the list of water amounts and checks if the list is in non-decreasing order. If the list is sorted, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value. The final state includes the input values `t`, `n`, and the sorted lists of water amounts for each test case, with the results of the checks printed for each test case.
