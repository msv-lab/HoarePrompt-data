Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
There are n containers of water lined up, numbered from left to right from 1
to n . Each container can hold any amount of water; initially, the i -th
container contains a_i units of water. The sum of a_i is divisible by n .

You can apply the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times:
pour any amount of water from the i -th container to the j -th container,
where i must be less than j (i.e. i<j ). Any index can be chosen as i or j any
number of times.

Determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers
the same using this operation.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of containers with water.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the amounts of water in the containers. It is guaranteed
that the sum of a_i in each test case does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^9 . Also, the
sum of a_i is divisible by n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases in the input does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to make the amount of water in all
containers the same using the described operation. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the third test case of the example (a=[4, 5, 2, 1, 3] ), you can proceed as
follows:

  * pour 1 unit of water from the first vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 5, 2, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the third, then a=[3, 4, 3, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 3, 3, 3, 3] .

# Annotated Program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, representing the number of containers. a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the initial amounts of water in the containers. The sum of a_i in each test case does not exceed 2·10^9, and the sum of a_i is divisible by n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        arr.sort()
        
        if all(arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(n - 1)):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: After all iterations, `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` has been incremented by the number of test cases executed (i.e., `_` is now equal to `t`), and for each test case, `n` was an input integer, and `arr` was a sorted list of integers read from the input. For each test case, if all elements in `arr` were in non-decreasing order, the program printed 'YES'; otherwise, it printed 'NO'. The values of `t`, `n`, and the elements of `arr` for each test case remain as described in the initial state.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` representing the number of containers, followed by a list of `n` integers representing the initial amounts of water in the containers. The function sorts the list of water amounts and checks if the list is in non-decreasing order. If the list is sorted, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value. The final state includes the input values `t`, `n`, and the sorted lists of water amounts for each test case, with the results of the checks printed for each test case.
