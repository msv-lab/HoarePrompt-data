Correctness: **False**

The provided solution is incorrect because it sorts the array and checks if it is non-decreasing. This approach does not correctly solve the problem as described. The problem requires determining if it is possible to make all containers have the same amount of water by pouring water from one container to another where the source container has a lower index than the destination container.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to check if the minimum element in the array can be increased to the average value of the elements in the array by pouring water from higher-indexed containers to lower-indexed containers. If the minimum element is already greater than or equal to the average, or if the maximum element is less than or equal to the average, then it is possible to achieve the goal. However, the provided code does not perform these checks.

Here is a correct approach:

1. Calculate the average amount of water per container.
2. Check if the minimum amount of water in any container is less than the average and if there are enough water in the higher-indexed containers to balance it out.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Calculate the target amount of water in each container
        target = sum(arr) // n
        
        # Check if it's possible to make all containers have the same amount of water
        if all(x >= target for x in arr):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()
```

This code correctly determines if it is possible to make all containers have the same amount of water by checking if each container has at least the target amount of water. If any container has less than the target amount, it is impossible to achieve the goal with the given operations.
