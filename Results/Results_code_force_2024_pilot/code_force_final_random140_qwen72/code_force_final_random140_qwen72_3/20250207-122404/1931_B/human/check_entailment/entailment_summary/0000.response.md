Reasoning:  
The provided solution is incorrect because it does not correctly solve the problem. The problem requires determining if it's possible to equalize the water levels in all containers by pouring water from any container to any other container with a higher index. The key insight here is that since the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers, it is always possible to equalize the water levels if the sum of the water in the containers is evenly divisible among them. However, the current implementation simply checks if the list of water amounts is already in non-decreasing order after sorting, which is not the correct approach.

For example, consider the test case where the initial water amounts are `[4, 5, 2, 1, 3]`. The correct answer should be "YES" because, as shown in the example, it is possible to equalize the water levels. However, the provided code would sort this list to `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and check if it is in non-decreasing order, which it is, but this does not reflect the actual possibility of equalizing the water levels through the allowed operations.

A correct approach would involve checking if the sum of the water amounts is divisible by the number of containers and then ensuring that the minimum water level is not greater than the average water level (since water can only be poured from a lower-indexed container to a higher-indexed one).

Correctness: **False**
