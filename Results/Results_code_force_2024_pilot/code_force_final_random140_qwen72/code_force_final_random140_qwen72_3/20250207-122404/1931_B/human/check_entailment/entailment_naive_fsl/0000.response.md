Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program sorts the array and checks if it is in non-decreasing order. However, this approach is flawed because the problem requires determining if it's possible to equalize the water levels in all containers using the specified pouring operation, not just checking if the array is sorted.

A correct solution would involve checking if the average water level (which is the total water divided by the number of containers) can be achieved by pouring water from containers with more water to those with less, under the constraint that water can only be poured from a container with a lower index to a container with a higher index.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
5
4 5 2 1 3
```
The program will sort the array to `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and check if it is sorted, which it is, and thus output "YES". However, the correct answer should be "YES" because it is indeed possible to equalize the water levels as shown in the problem description. The program's logic is incorrect and does not handle the problem's constraints properly.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
