Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining if it's possible to equalize the amount of water in all containers by pouring water from one container to another, where the source container has a lower index than the destination container. The total amount of water across all containers is divisible by the number of containers, ensuring an even distribution is theoretically possible.

2. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the number of containers (`n`) and the initial amounts of water in each container (`arr`).

3. **Sorting the Array**: The program sorts the array `arr`. Sorting is a critical step here because it allows us to check if the smallest values can be increased to match the largest values through the allowed operations.

4. **Checking Monotonicity**: The program checks if the sorted array is monotonically increasing using the condition `all((arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(n - 1)))`. This condition is always true for a sorted array, so it doesn't actually help in solving the problem.

5. **Logical Flaw**: The key issue is that the program incorrectly assumes that if the array is sorted, it means the water can be evenly distributed. However, the problem requires checking if the water can be redistributed such that all containers have the same amount of water, which is not guaranteed by simply sorting the array.

6. **Correct Approach**: To solve the problem correctly, we need to check if the minimum value in the array can be increased to the average value (which is the target amount of water in each container after redistribution). If the minimum value is already greater than or equal to the average, then it is impossible to redistribute the water to make all containers equal.

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect because it does not properly check if the water can be redistributed to make all containers have the same amount of water.

Final: **False**
