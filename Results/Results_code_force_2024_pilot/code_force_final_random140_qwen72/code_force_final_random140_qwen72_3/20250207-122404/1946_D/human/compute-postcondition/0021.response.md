Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers with at least one element, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30 and bit is not -1, `new_arr` is a list containing the elements from `cur_arr` that, when XORed with the previous elements, result in a value where the bit-th bit is 0, and `xor` is 0.**

### Explanation:
- **`cur_arr`**: The original list of non-negative integers remains unchanged.
- **`bit`**: The integer `bit` remains unchanged, ensuring it is within the valid range (0 <= bit < 30).
- **`new_arr`**: This list contains the elements from `cur_arr` that, when XORed with the cumulative `xor` value, result in a value where the bit-th bit is 0. Each time such a condition is met, the current `xor` value is appended to `new_arr`, and `xor` is reset to 0.
- **`xor`**: After the loop completes, `xor` is 0 because each time the bit-th bit of `xor` is 0, `xor` is reset to 0.

This final state reflects the complete execution of the loop, where `new_arr` contains the filtered results based on the specified condition, and `xor` is reset to 0.
