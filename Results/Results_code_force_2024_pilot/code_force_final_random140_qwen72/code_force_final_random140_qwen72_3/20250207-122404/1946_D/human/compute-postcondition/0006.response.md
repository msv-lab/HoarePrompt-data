The code snippet `xor ^= i` performs a bitwise XOR operation between the current value of `xor` and the variable `i`, and assigns the result back to `xor`. However, the variable `i` is not defined in the initial state, which means the code cannot be executed as is. Assuming `i` is supposed to be an element from `cur_arr`, let's consider the first element of `cur_arr` (since `cur_arr` is guaranteed to have at least one element) and perform the operation.

Let's denote the first element of `cur_arr` as `cur_arr[0]`.

- Initial `xor` is 0.
- After executing `xor ^= cur_arr[0]`, `xor` will be the result of `0 ^ cur_arr[0]`, which is simply `cur_arr[0]` because anything XORed with 0 is itself.

Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least one element, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30 and bit is not -1, `new_arr` is an empty list, `xor` is `cur_arr[0]`.**
