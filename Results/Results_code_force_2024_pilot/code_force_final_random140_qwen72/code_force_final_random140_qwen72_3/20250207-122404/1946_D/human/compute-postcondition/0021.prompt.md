Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: cur_arr is a list of non-negative integers, bit is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30, and bit is not -1, new_arr is an empty list, xor is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in cur_arr:
    xor ^= i
    if not xor >> bit & 1:
        new_arr.append(xor)
        xor = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers with at least one element, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30 and bit is not -1, `new_arr` is either an empty list or a list containing the first element of `cur_arr`, and `xor` is the first element of `cur_arr`. If the bitwise right shift of `xor` by `bit` positions results in a value where the least significant bit is 0, then `new_arr` contains the first element of `cur_arr` and `xor` is 0. Otherwise, `new_arr` remains an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers with at least one element, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30 and bit is not -1, `new_arr` is either an empty list or a list containing the first element of `cur_arr`. If the bit-th bit of `xor` (the result of the XOR operation between the first element of `cur_arr` and `i`) is 0, then `new_arr` also contains the value of `xor`, and `xor` is 0. `i` is the next element in `cur_arr`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers with at least one element, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30 and bit is not -1, `new_arr` is a list containing the first element of `cur_arr`. If the bit-th bit of `xor` (the result of the XOR operation between the first element of `cur_arr` and `i`) is 0, then `new_arr` also contains the value of `xor`, and `xor` is now 0. `i` is the next element in `cur_arr`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
