Postcondition: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least one element, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30 and bit is not -1, `new_arr` is an empty list, `xor` is `cur_arr[0]`. The bitwise right shift of `xor` by `bit` positions results in a value where the least significant bit is 0.**
