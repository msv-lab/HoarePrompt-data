To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the state of the object in the loop head, which is `cur_arr`. The loop will iterate over each element in `cur_arr`, so for the loop to execute, `cur_arr` must contain at least one element.

Given the initial state:
- `cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers.
- `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30, and bit is not -1.
- `new_arr` is an empty list.
- `xor` is 0.

We need to adjust the state to ensure that `cur_arr` has at least one element. The other variables (`bit`, `new_arr`, and `xor`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least one element, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30 and bit is not -1, `new_arr` is an empty list, `xor` is 0**
