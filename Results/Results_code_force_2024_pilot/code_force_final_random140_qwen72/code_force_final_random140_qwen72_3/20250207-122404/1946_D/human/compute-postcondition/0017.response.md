The value of `xor` is updated by performing an XOR operation with the current value of `i`. The state of `cur_arr`, `bit`, and `new_arr` remains unchanged unless `xor` being 0 affects the conditions for adding elements to `new_arr`.

Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers with at least one element, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30 and bit is not -1, `new_arr` is either an empty list or a list containing the first element of `cur_arr`. If the bit-th bit of `xor` (the result of the XOR operation between the first element of `cur_arr` and `i`) is 0, then `new_arr` also contains the value of `xor`, and `xor` is now the result of `xor` XOR `i`. `i` is the next element in `cur_arr`.**
