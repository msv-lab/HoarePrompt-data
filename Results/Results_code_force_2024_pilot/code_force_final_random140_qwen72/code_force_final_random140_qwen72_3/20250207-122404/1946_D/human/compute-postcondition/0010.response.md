Postcondition: ***`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers with at least one element, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30 and bit is not -1, `new_arr` is either an empty list or a list containing the first element of `cur_arr`, and `xor` is the first element of `cur_arr`. If the bitwise right shift of `xor` by `bit` positions results in a value where the least significant bit is 0, then `new_arr` contains the first element of `cur_arr` and `xor` is 0. Otherwise, `new_arr` remains an empty list.***
