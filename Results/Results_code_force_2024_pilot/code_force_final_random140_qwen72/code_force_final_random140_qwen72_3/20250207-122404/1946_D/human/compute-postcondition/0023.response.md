Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers with at least one element, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30 and bit is not -1, `new_arr` is a list containing the elements from `cur_arr` that, when XORed with the previous elements, result in a value where the bit-th bit is 0, `xor` is 0, and the bit-th bit of `xor` is 1, `thing1` is -1.** 

Explanation: The variable `thing1` is assigned the value -1, which updates its value from the initial state. All other variables (`cur_arr`, `bit`, `new_arr`, and `xor`) remain unchanged and retain their initial values and conditions.
