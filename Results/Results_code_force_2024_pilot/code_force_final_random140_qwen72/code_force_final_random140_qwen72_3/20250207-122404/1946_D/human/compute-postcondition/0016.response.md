The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `cur_arr`, so we can only adjust those.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers with at least one element.
- `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30 and bit is not -1.
- `new_arr` is either an empty list or a list containing the first element of `cur_arr`. If the bit-th bit of `xor` (the result of the XOR operation between the first element of `cur_arr` and `i`) is 0, then `new_arr` also contains the value of `xor`, and `xor` is 0.
- `i` is the next element in `cur_arr`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `cur_arr` must still have at least one element remaining. The variable `i` will be set to the next element in `cur_arr`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `cur_arr` must have at least one element.
- `i` will be the next element in `cur_arr`.

State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers with at least one element, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30 and bit is not -1, `new_arr` is either an empty list or a list containing the first element of `cur_arr`. If the bit-th bit of `xor` (the result of the XOR operation between the first element of `cur_arr` and `i`) is 0, then `new_arr` also contains the value of `xor`, and `xor` is 0. `i` is the next element in `cur_arr`.**
