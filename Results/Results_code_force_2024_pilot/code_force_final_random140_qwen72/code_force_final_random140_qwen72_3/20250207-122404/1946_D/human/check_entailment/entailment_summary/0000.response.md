### Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify if the functions `func_1` and `find_new` together solve the problem as described.

1. **Problem Description Recap**:
   - We need to find the maximum number \( k \) such that we can partition the array \( a \) into \( k \) segments where the bitwise OR of the XOR results of these segments is less than or equal to \( x \).
   - If no such \( k \) exists, we should return -1.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(arr, x)`**:
     - This function simply calls `find_new(arr, 30)`.
     - The choice of 30 as the initial bit is because \( x \) is less than \( 2^{30} \), so the highest bit position to consider is 29 (0-indexed).

   - **`find_new(cur_arr, bit)`**:
     - This function processes the array `cur_arr` and the current bit position `bit`.
     - It iterates through the array, maintaining a running XOR (`xor`).
     - If the `bit`-th bit of the running XOR is 0, it appends the current XOR to a new array (`new_arr`) and resets the running XOR.
     - After processing the entire array, it checks if the `bit`-th bit of the final XOR is 1. If it is, it sets `thing1` to -1; otherwise, it sets `thing1` to the length of `new_arr`.
     - It then recursively calls itself with the same array but the next lower bit position (`bit - 1`), considering different conditions:
       - If the `bit`-th bit of `x` is 1, it returns the maximum of `thing1` and the result of the recursive call.
       - If the `bit`-th bit of `x` is 0 and `thing1` is not -1, it returns the result of the recursive call with `new_arr`.
       - If neither condition is met, it returns -1.

3. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The function `find_new` effectively processes the array by considering each bit position from the most significant to the least significant.
   - It ensures that the segments formed have a bitwise OR of their XOR results that is less than or equal to `x`.
   - The recursion handles the bit-by-bit comparison and ensures that the maximum number of valid segments is found.
   - The base case of the recursion (when `bit` is -1) returns the length of the array, which is correct because it means all bits have been considered.

Given the above analysis, the functions `func_1` and `find_new` together correctly solve the problem as described.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
