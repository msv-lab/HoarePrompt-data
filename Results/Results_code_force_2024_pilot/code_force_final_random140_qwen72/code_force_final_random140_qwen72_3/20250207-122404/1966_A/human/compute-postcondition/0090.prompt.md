Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer provided by the user input, for each of the `t` test cases, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 100; `c` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ 100.
Code of the loop:
while t > 0:
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    arrC = list(map(int, input().split()))
    hashmap = {}
    ans = n
    for i in arrC:
        if i in hashmap:
            hashmap[i] += 1
        else:
            hashmap[i] = 1
        if hashmap[i] >= k:
            ans = k - 1
    print(ans)
    t -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer greater than -1, `n` and `k` are specific integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 100, `c` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ 100, `arrC` is a list of integers with `n` elements, `hashmap` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each element in `arrC`, and `ans` is either `n` or `k - 1` depending on whether any element in `arrC` appears at least `k` times.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an integer greater than -1, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 100, `c` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ 100, `arrC` is a list of integers provided by the user input that has been fully iterated over, `hashmap` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `arrC` and the value is the count of how many times that element appears in `arrC`, `ans` is `k - 1` if any element in `arrC` appears `k` or more times, otherwise `ans` remains `n`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an integer greater than 0 but now decreased by 1, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 100, `c` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ 100, `arrC` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `hashmap` is a dictionary containing the frequency count of each element in `arrC`, and `ans` is either `k - 1` if any element in `arrC` appears `k` or more times, otherwise `ans` remains `n`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
