Output State: **`_` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element of `a`, `h` is a dictionary with the third element of `a` as a key, and the value associated with `i` in `h` is incremented by 1, `ans` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration, and `ams` is set to `k - 1` if `h[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`.**
