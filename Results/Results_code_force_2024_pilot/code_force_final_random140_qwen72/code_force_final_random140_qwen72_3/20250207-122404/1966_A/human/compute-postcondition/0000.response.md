The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder to iterate over the range generated by `int(input())`. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`, which should be a positive integer for the loop to run at least once.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 100.
- `c` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100.

To ensure the loop executes, the input to `range(int(input()))` must be a positive integer. Since `t` represents the number of test cases, the input should be `t`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the input to the loop is `t`, and the loop variable `_` is set to 0 (the starting point of the range).

State: **`_` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `input()` returns `t`**
