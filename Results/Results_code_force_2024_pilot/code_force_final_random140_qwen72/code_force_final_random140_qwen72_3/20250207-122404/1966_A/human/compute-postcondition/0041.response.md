Output State: **_ is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `k` is the second integer from the new input, `a` is a list of integers from the new input and must contain at least one element, `h` is a dictionary where the key `i` (the first element of `a`) is mapped to either 1 or 2 depending on whether `i` was already in `h` or not, `ans` is equal to `n`, `ams` is set to `k - 1`, and the current value of `h[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`.**
