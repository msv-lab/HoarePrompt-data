Postcondition: **_ is 2, t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, n is the first integer from the new input, k is the second integer from the new input, a is a list of integers from the new input that must have at least one element, i is the first element of a, ans is equal to n, h is a dictionary where i is a key with a value incremented by 1. If h[i] is greater than or equal to k, ams is set to k - 1. Otherwise, ams remains undefined.**
