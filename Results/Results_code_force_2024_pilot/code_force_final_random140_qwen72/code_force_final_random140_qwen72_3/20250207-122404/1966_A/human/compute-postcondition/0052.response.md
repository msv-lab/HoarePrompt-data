Postcondition: ***`_` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `k` is the second integer from the new input, `a` is a list of integers from the new input and must contain at least two elements. If `i` (the next element of `a` after the second) is in `h`, then `h[i]` is incremented by 1. If `h[i]` is greater than or equal to `k` after the update, `ans` is set to `k - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` remains `n`. If `i` is not in `h`, then `h[i]` is set to 1 and `ans` remains `n`.***
