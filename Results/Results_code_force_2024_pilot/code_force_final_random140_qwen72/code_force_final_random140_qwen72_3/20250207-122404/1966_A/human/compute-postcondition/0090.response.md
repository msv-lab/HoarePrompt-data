Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 100, `c` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ 100, `arrC` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `hashmap` is a dictionary containing the frequency count of each element in `arrC`, and `ans` is either `k - 1` if any element in `arrC` appears `k` or more times, otherwise `ans` remains `n`.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs until `t` becomes 0, meaning all test cases have been processed.
- For each iteration, `n` and `k` are read from user input, and `arrC` is a list of `n` integers.
- A `hashmap` is used to count the frequency of each element in `arrC`.
- `ans` is set to `n` initially and updated to `k - 1` if any element in `arrC` appears `k` or more times.
- After all iterations, `t` is 0, indicating that no more test cases are left to process.
