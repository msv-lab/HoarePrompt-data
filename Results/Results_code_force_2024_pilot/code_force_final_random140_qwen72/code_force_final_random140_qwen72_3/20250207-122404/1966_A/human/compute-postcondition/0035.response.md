Postcondition: **`_` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `k` is the second integer from the new input, `a` is a list of integers from the new input and must contain at least one element, `h` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is equal to `n`, `ams` is set to `k - 1` if any integer in the new `a` appears `k` or more times, otherwise `ams` remains undefined, `i` is the first element of `a`, and `i` is a key in the dictionary `h`.**
