Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `_` is 1 (This variable is not used in the code snippet).
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500 (This variable is not used in the code snippet).
- `n` is the first integer from the new input.
- `k` is the second integer from the new input.
- `a` is a list of integers from the new input.
- `h` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `a` and its value is the count of occurrences of that integer in `a`.
- If any integer in `a` appears `k` or more times, `ams` is set to `k - 1`. Otherwise, `ams` remains undefined.
- `ans` is equal to `n`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(ans)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variables and Their Values:**
   - `n` is the first integer from the new input.
   - `k` is the second integer from the new input.
   - `a` is a list of integers from the new input.
   - `h` is a dictionary that counts the occurrences of each integer in `a`.
   - `ams` is set to `k - 1` if any integer in `a` appears `k` or more times. Otherwise, `ams` remains undefined.
   - `ans` is always equal to `n`.

2. **Determination of `ans`:**
   - Regardless of the values of `k`, `a`, and `h`, the variable `ans` is always set to `n`.

3. **Output:**
   - The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `n`.

### Final Output:
Output: **n (where n is the first integer from the new input)**
