Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and k are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 100, representing the number of cards and the number of cards exchanged in each operation, respectively. c is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100, representing the numbers written on the cards.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    h = {}
    ans = n
    for i in a:
        if i in h:
            h[i] += 1
        else:
            h[i] = 1
        if h[i] >= k:
            ams = k - 1
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `_` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `h` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `a` and the value is the count of occurrences of that integer in `a`, `ans` is equal to `n`, and `ams` is set to `k - 1` if any integer in `a` appears `k` or more times, otherwise `ams` remains undefined.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: _ is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `k` is the second integer from the new input, `a` is a list of integers from the new input, `h` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `a` and its value is the count of occurrences of that integer in `a`. If any integer in `a` appears `k` or more times, `ams` is set to `k - 1`. Otherwise, `ams` remains undefined, and `ans` is equal to `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: _ is 2, t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, n is the first integer from the new input, k is the second integer from the new input, a is a list of integers from the new input, i is the last element of a, ans is equal to n, h is a dictionary where each unique element in a is a key, and the value of each key is the count of how many times that element appears in a. If any value in h is greater than or equal to k, ams is set to k - 1. Otherwise, ams remains undefined.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
