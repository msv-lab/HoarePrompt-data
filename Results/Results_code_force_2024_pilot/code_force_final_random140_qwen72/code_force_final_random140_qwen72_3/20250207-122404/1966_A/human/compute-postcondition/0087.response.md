Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases. Each test case involves reading an integer `n` and another integer `k`, followed by a list of `n` integers `a`. The function counts the occurrences of each integer in `a` using a dictionary `h`. It then prints the value of `n` for each test case. The function does not return any values; instead, it prints the result directly. After processing all test cases, the final state includes the processed test cases and the printed results, but no modifications are made to the input variables. **
