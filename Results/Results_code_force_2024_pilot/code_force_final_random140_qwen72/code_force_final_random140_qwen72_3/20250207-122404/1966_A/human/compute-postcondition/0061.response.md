Output State: **`_` is 2, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `k` is the second integer from the new input, `a` is a list of integers from the new input, `h` is an empty dictionary `{}`, `ams` is undefined, `ans` is equal to `n`.**

Explanation: The code `ans = n` assigns the value of `n` to the variable `ans`. Since `n` is already defined as the first integer from the new input, `ans` now holds the same value as `n`. All other variables remain unchanged.
