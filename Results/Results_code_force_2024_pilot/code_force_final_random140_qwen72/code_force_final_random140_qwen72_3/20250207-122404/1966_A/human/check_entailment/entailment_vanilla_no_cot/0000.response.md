Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program does not update the `ans` variable to reflect the minimum number of cards that can be left after performing the operations. Additionally, the variable `ams` is defined but never used, and the program does not actually reduce the count of cards when an exchange operation is performed.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Count the frequency of each card number.
2. For each unique card number, calculate how many cards can be removed by performing the exchange operation as many times as possible.
3. Update the total number of cards accordingly to find the minimum number of cards left.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        h = {}
        for i in a:
            if i in h:
                h[i] += 1
            else:
                h[i] = 1
        
        ans = n
        for count in h.values():
            full_exchanges = count // k
            remaining_cards = count % k
            ans -= full_exchanges * (k - (k - 1))
        
        print(ans)
```

This corrected version correctly calculates the minimum number of cards left after performing the exchange operations.
