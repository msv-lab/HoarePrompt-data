Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to find a distribution of bets such that the total bet is less than the winnings for any outcome. This means the sum of all bets \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \) should be less than \( k_i \times x_i \) for any \( i \).

2. **Program Logic**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes \( n \) and the multipliers \( k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_n \).
   - It calculates the product of all multipliers \( m \).
   - It then computes the bets \( c_i \) as \( \frac{m}{k_i} \).
   - It finds the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the bets \( c_i \) using `func_1`.
   - It normalizes the bets by dividing each by the GCD.
   - It checks if the sum of the normalized bets is less than \( m \). If so, it prints the bets; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

3. **Issues in the Program**:
   - **Product Calculation**: The product \( m \) is calculated as the product of all \( k_i \). This can lead to very large numbers, which might cause overflow issues.
   - **GCD Calculation**: The GCD calculation is correct, but the normalization step might not ensure that the sum of bets is strictly less than \( m \).
   - **Sum Check**: The check `if sum(c) >= m:` is incorrect because \( m \) is the product of all \( k_i \), which is much larger than the sum of the bets. Instead, the sum of bets should be compared to the individual \( k_i \times x_i \).

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - The correct approach is to find a set of bets \( x_i \) such that the sum of bets is less than the minimum \( k_i \times x_i \).
   - One simple solution is to set \( x_i = 1 \) for all \( i \) and check if the sum of bets is less than the minimum \( k_i \). If not, adjust the bets accordingly.

Given the issues identified, the current program logic is incorrect.
