Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program has a logical error in the way it calculates the multipliers and checks the condition. Specifically, the issue lies in the calculation of `m` and the subsequent steps:

1. **Calculation of `m`:**
   ```python
   m = 1
   for i in range(n):
       m = m * k[i]
   ```
   This calculates the product of all multipliers `k[i]`. However, this value can become extremely large, especially for larger `n`, leading to potential overflow issues and unnecessary complexity.

2. **Calculation of `c`:**
   ```python
   c = []
   for i in range(n):
       c.append(int(m / k[i]))
   ```
   Here, `c[i]` is calculated as `m / k[i]`. This means that `c[i]` is the product of all other multipliers except `k[i]`. This approach is not necessary and can lead to very large values for `c[i]`.

3. **Calculation of HCF:**
   ```python
   hcf = func_1(c)
   for i in range(n):
       c[i] = int(c[i] / hcf)
   ```
   The HCF (Greatest Common Divisor) is calculated to reduce the values in `c`. However, this step is not necessary for the problem's requirements.

4. **Check for valid distribution:**
   ```python
   if sum(c) >= m:
       print(-1)
   else:
       for i in range(n):
           print(c[i], end=' ')
       print('')
   ```
   The condition `sum(c) >= m` is incorrect. The correct condition should be `sum(c) < min(k[i] * c[i] for i in range(n))` to ensure that the total bet is less than the return for any winning outcome.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
1
3
3 2 7
```
The program calculates:
- `m = 3 * 2 * 7 = 42`
- `c = [14, 21, 6]`
- `hcf = gcd(14, 21, 6) = 1`
- `c = [14, 21, 6]`
- `sum(c) = 41`

Since `sum(c) < 42`, the program outputs `14 21 6`.

However, the correct output should be `27 41 12` because:
- Total bet: `27 + 41 + 12 = 80`
- Returns: `3 * 27 = 81`, `2 * 41 = 82`, `7 * 12 = 84`
- All returns are strictly greater than 80.

Thus, the program does not produce the correct output for this case, making it incorrect.
