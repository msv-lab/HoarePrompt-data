### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to distribute coins across `n` outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount we would receive back for any winning outcome.
   - For each outcome `i`, if it wins, we get back `k_i * x_i` coins, where `x_i` is the amount bet on outcome `i`.

2. **Approach in the Program:**
   - The program calculates the product of all `k_i` values, which is used to find a common multiple.
   - For each `k_i`, it calculates the value `m / k_i` and stores it in the list `c`. This ensures that the sum of `c` is a multiple of the LCM of `k_i`.
   - It then finds the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the list `c` using the function `func_1`.
   - Each element in `c` is divided by the GCD to reduce the values while maintaining the same ratio.
   - Finally, it checks if the sum of the reduced values in `c` is strictly less than the product `m`. If it is, it prints the values; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

3. **Detailed Steps:**
   - **Step 1:** Calculate the product of all `k_i` values. This is used to find a common multiple.
   - **Step 2:** For each `k_i`, calculate the value `m / k_i` and store it in the list `c`. This ensures that the sum of `c` is a multiple of the LCM of `k_i`.
   - **Step 3:** Find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the list `c` using the function `func_1`.
   - **Step 4:** Divide each element in `c` by the GCD to reduce the values while maintaining the same ratio.
   - **Step 5:** Check if the sum of the reduced values in `c` is strictly less than the product `m`. If it is, print the values; otherwise, print `-1`.

4. **Potential Issues:**
   - The program uses the product of all `k_i` values to find a common multiple, which might be unnecessarily large and could lead to overflow issues for large `k_i` values.
   - The GCD calculation is correct, but the approach to ensure the sum of bets is strictly less than the product `m` might not always work as intended, especially for edge cases.

5. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The program correctly calculates the GCD and reduces the values in `c` to ensure they are minimal.
   - However, the condition `sum(c) < m` might not always hold true, especially when the multipliers `k_i` are small and the product `m` is large.
   - The program should check if the sum of the reduced values in `c` is strictly less than the sum of the bets, not the product `m`.

### Conclusion:
The program's logic is generally sound, but it has a critical flaw in the final check. The condition `sum(c) < m` is incorrect because `m` is the product of all `k_i` values, not the sum of the bets. The correct condition should be `sum(c) < sum(x_i * k_i)` for all `i`, which simplifies to `sum(c) < sum(c) * min(k_i)`. This means the program will fail in cases where the multipliers `k_i` are small and the product `m` is large.

Therefore, the original assessment is correct in identifying the potential issues with the program's logic.

Final: **False**
