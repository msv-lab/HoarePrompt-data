Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n` are integers where 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20, `hcf` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all elements in the list `numbers`, `numbers` is a list with at least one element, `num` is the last element of `numbers`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variables `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- The variable `hcf` is updated in each iteration to be the GCD of the current `hcf` and the next element in the list `numbers`. After all iterations, `hcf` will be the GCD of all elements in the list `numbers`.
- The list `numbers` remains unchanged in terms of its elements, but the loop iterates over all elements starting from the second element to the last element.
- The variable `num` will be the last element of the list `numbers` after the loop has completed all iterations.
