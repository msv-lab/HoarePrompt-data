To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given state and the loop head:

### Given State:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, representing the number of outcomes.
- `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n` are integers where 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20, representing the multipliers for the amount of coins if the i-th outcome turns out to be winning.
- `hcf` is now set to the first element of the list `numbers`.

### Loop Head:
```python
for num in numbers[1:]:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over `numbers[1:]`, which means it starts from the second element of the list `numbers`.
- For the loop to execute, `numbers` must have at least two elements (one for `hcf` and one for the loop to start).

### Adjustments Needed:
- Ensure that `numbers` has at least two elements.
- `num` should be the second element of `numbers` when the loop starts.

### Final State:
- `t` remains as given (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
- `n` remains as given (1 ≤ n ≤ 50).
- `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n` remain as given (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20).
- `hcf` is set to the first element of `numbers`.
- `numbers` must have at least two elements.
- `num` is the second element of `numbers`.

### State:
**`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n` are integers where 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20, `hcf` is set to the first element of `numbers`, `numbers` is a list with at least two elements, `num` is the second element of `numbers`**
