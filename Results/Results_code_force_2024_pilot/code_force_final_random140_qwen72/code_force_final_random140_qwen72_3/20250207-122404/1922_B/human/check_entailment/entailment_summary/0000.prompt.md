Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
You have n sticks, numbered from 1 to n . The length of the i -th stick is
2^{a_i} .

You want to choose exactly 3 sticks out of the given n sticks, and form a non-
degenerate triangle out of them, using the sticks as the sides of the
triangle. A triangle is called non-degenerate if its area is strictly greater
than 0 .

You have to calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a
triangle can be formed out of them. Note that the order of choosing sticks
does not matter (for example, choosing the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4 -th stick is the
same as choosing the 2 -nd, 4 -th and 1 -st stick).

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le n ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the number of ways to choose exactly 3
sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    7
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    4
    
    3 2 1 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3
    
    1
    
    1

Output

    35
    2
    0
    0
    
Note

In the first test case of the example, any three sticks out of the given 7 can
be chosen.

In the second test case of the example, you can choose the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4
-th stick, or the 1 -st, 3 -rd and 4 -th stick.

In the third test case of the example, you cannot form a triangle out of the
given sticks with lengths 2 , 4 and 8 .

# Program:

def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    current_index = 0
    t = int(data[current_index])
    current_index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        hashing = {}
        n = int(data[current_index])
        current_index += 1
        a = []
        for i in range(n):
            a.append(int(data[current_index]))
            current_index += 1
        a.sort()
        ans = 0
        for i in range(n - 1):
            if a[i] not in hashing:
                hashing[a[i]] = 0
            hashing[a[i]] += i
            if a[i] == a[i + 1]:
                ans += hashing[a[i]]
        results.append(ans)
    for result in results:
        print(result)





# Execution Summary:
The function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and prints the result for each case. Each test case involves an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. The function calculates a specific value `ans` for each test case based on the sorted list `a` and a hash map that tracks the cumulative indices of elements. The final output is a list of these `ans` values, one for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function prints each result. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results.
