Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem. The logic used in the function `func_1` to count the number of ways to form a non-degenerate triangle is flawed. Specifically, the way it uses the `hashing` dictionary and the `ans` variable does not correctly account for the conditions required to form a triangle with side lengths that are powers of 2.

### Issues:
1. **Triangle Inequality Theorem**: For three lengths to form a non-degenerate triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the remaining side. Given that the lengths are powers of 2, this condition is only met if the three chosen lengths are equal (i.e., all three sticks have the same length). This is because \(2^a + 2^b > 2^c\) only holds if \(a = b = c\).

2. **Counting Valid Triangles**: The code does not correctly count the number of valid triangles. It incorrectly uses a hash table to count occurrences and then adds these counts to `ans`. This approach does not correctly handle the combinatorial aspect of choosing 3 sticks from a set of sticks with the same length.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, you should:
- Count the frequency of each unique length.
- For each length that appears at least 3 times, calculate the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of that length using the combination formula \( \binom{n}{3} = \frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{6} \).

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
import sys
from collections import Counter

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
current_index = 0
t = int(data[current_index])
current_index += 1
results = []

for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[current_index])
    current_index += 1
    a = [int(data[current_index + i]) for i in range(n)]
    current_index += n
    counter = Counter(a)
    ans = 0
    for count in counter.values():
        if count >= 3:
            ans += count * (count - 1) * (count - 2) // 6
    results.append(ans)

for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This corrected version correctly counts the number of ways to form a non-degenerate triangle using the given sticks.
