The function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and prints the result for each case. Each test case involves an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. The function calculates a specific value `ans` for each test case based on the sorted list `a` and a hash map that tracks the cumulative indices of elements. The final output is a list of these `ans` values, one for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function prints each result. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results.
