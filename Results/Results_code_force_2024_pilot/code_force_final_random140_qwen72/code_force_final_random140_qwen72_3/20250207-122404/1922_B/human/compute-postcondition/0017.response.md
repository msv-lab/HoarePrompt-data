The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1 (so it becomes 2), and `n` must still be greater than `i` (so `n` must be greater than 2).

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a list containing two elements which are the integer values of `data[2]` and `data[3]`, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 Â· 10^5, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input data, `current_index` is 4, `results` is an empty list, `hashing` is an empty dictionary, `i` is 2**
