Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `a[1]` is in `hashing`, `hashing[a[1]]` is 1, `a[2]` is in `hashing`, `hashing[a[2]]` is 2, if `a[1] == a[2]`, `ans` is increased by 1, `ans` is increased by `hashing[a[2]]` (which is 2).**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` is 2.
- The value of `n` is greater than 2.
- `a[1]` is in `hashing` and `hashing[a[1]]` is 1.
- `a[2]` is in `hashing` and `hashing[a[2]]` is 2.
- If `a[1] == a[2]`, `ans` is increased by 1.
- The code `ans += hashing[a[i]]` increases `ans` by the value of `hashing[a[2]]`, which is 2. Therefore, `ans` is increased by 2.
