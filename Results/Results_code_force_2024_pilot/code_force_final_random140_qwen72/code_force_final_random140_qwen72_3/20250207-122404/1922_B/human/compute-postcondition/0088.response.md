Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `n` is the integer value of `data[2 * n + 3]`, `a` is an empty list, `current_index` is `2 * n + 4`, `results` is a list containing two elements `[ans, ans]`, `i` is `n - 2`, `ans` is the sum of `hashing[a[i]]` for all `i` where `a[i] == a[i + 1]`, `hashing` is an empty dictionary `{}`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `a = []` reassigns the variable `a` to an empty list.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `current_index`, `results`, `i`, `ans`, `hashing`) remain unchanged.
- The initial state information about `a` being a sorted list containing `n` elements is no longer valid because `a` is now an empty list.
