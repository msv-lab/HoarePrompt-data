The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still be greater than 2 (or equivalently, `n - 1` must be greater than 1).

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `a[1]` is in `hashing`, `hashing[a[1]]` is 1. If `a[1] == a[2]`, `ans` is increased by 1.**
