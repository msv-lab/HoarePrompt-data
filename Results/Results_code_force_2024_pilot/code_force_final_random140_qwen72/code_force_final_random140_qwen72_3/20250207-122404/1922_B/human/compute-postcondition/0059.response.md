Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list containing `n` elements, where each element is `int(data[current_index - n + i])` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 Â· 10^5, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input data, `current_index` is `2 * n + 3`, `results` is a list containing one element `ans`, `i` is `n - 1`, `ans` is the sum of the values in `hashing` for each element in `a` that appears consecutively in the list, `hashing` is an empty dictionary.**

### Explanation:
- **`t` must be greater than 0**: This condition remains unchanged as it is part of the initial state.
- **`n` must be greater than or equal to 0**: After the loop completes, `n` can be any non-negative integer, but it must have been greater than 0 initially for the loop to execute at least once.
- **`a` is a list containing `n` elements**: The loop appends `n` elements to the list `a`, each element being the integer value of `data[current_index - n + i]` for `i` ranging from 0 to `n-1`.
- **`current_index` is `2 * n + 3`**: The `current_index` starts at `n + 3` and increments by 1 for each iteration of the loop, resulting in `current_index` being `2 * n + 3` after `n` iterations.
- **`results` is a list containing one element `ans`**: This remains unchanged as the loop does not modify `results`.
- **`i` is `n - 1`**: The loop variable `i` starts at `n - 1` and decrements by 1 with each iteration, so after `n` iterations, `i` will be 0.
- **`ans` is the sum of the values in `hashing` for each element in `a` that appears consecutively in the list**: This remains unchanged as the loop does not modify `ans` or `hashing`.
- **`hashing` is an empty dictionary**: This remains unchanged as the loop does not modify `hashing`.
