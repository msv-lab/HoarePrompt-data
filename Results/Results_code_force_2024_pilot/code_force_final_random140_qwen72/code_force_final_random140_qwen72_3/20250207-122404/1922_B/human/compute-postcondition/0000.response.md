The code snippet `input = sys.stdin.read` reassigns the built-in `input` function to the method `sys.stdin.read`. This means that any subsequent calls to `input` will now read from standard input until EOF (End Of File) is reached.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.

After executing the code snippet, the only change is that the `input` function is now reassigned to `sys.stdin.read`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged, but the behavior of `input` is altered.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5. The `input` function is now reassigned to `sys.stdin.read`.**
