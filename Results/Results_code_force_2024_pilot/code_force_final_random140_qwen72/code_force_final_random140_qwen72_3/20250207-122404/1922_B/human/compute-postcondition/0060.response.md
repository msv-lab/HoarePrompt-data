The code snippet `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. This operation modifies the list `a` but does not affect any other variables. The other conditions and values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a sorted list containing `n` elements, where each element is `int(data[current_index - n + i])` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 Â· 10^5, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input data, `current_index` is `2 * n + 3`, `results` is a list containing one element `ans`, `i` is `n - 1`, `ans` is the sum of the values in `hashing` for each element in `a` that appears consecutively in the list, `hashing` is an empty dictionary.**
