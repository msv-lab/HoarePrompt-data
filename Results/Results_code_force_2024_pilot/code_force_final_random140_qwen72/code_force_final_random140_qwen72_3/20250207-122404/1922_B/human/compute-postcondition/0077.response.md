The code snippet `hashing[a[i]] = 0` updates the dictionary `hashing` by setting the key `a[i]` to `0`. Given the initial state:

- `t` is greater than 0
- `n` is greater than 1
- `a` is a sorted list containing `n` elements, where each element is `int(data[current_index - n + i])` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5
- `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input data
- `current_index` is `2 * n + 3`
- `results` is a list containing one element `ans`
- `i` is `1`
- `ans` is `0`
- `hashing[a[0]]` is `0`

After executing the code snippet, the only change is that `hashing[a[1]]` is set to `0`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list containing `n` elements, where each element is `int(data[current_index - n + i])` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input data, `current_index` is `2 * n + 3`, `results` is a list containing one element `ans`, `i` is `1`, `ans` is `0`, `hashing[a[0]]` is `0`, `hashing[a[1]]` is `0`.**
