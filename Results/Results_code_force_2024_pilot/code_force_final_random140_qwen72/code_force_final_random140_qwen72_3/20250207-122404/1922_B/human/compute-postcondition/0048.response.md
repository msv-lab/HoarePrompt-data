Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[current_index - 1]`, `a` is a sorted list containing `n` elements which are the integer values of `data[2]` to `data[n+1]`, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 Â· 10^5, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input data, `current_index` is `n + 3`, `results` is a list containing one element `ans`, `i` is `n - 1`, `ans` is the sum of the values in `hashing` for each element in `a` that appears consecutively in the list, `hashing` is an empty dictionary.**

Explanation:
- `current_index` is incremented by 1, so its new value is `n + 3`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `data`, `results`, `i`, `ans`, `hashing`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
