The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is greater than 0. At the start of the next iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. For the loop to execute again, `n` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list containing one element which is the integer value of `data[2]`, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 Â· 10^5, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input data, `current_index` is 3, `results` is an empty list, `hashing` is an empty dictionary, `i` is 1**
