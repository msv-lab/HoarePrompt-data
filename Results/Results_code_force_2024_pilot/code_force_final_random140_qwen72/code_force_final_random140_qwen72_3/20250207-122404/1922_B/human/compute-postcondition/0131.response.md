The function `func_1` accepts no parameters directly within its definition. However, based on the context provided, it is implied that the function processes a series of test cases, each defined by an integer `t` (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, there is an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) and a list `a` of `n` integers (where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.

The function's output is not explicitly defined in the provided snippet, but typically such functions would process each test case and return a result for each one. Since the specific output is not given, I will assume the function returns a list of results corresponding to each test case.

Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each test case, an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) and a list `a` of `n` integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n). It returns a list of results, one for each test case.**
