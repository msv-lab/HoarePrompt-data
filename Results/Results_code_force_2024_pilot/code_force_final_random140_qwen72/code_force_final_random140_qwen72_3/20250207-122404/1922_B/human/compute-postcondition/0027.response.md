Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]` and must be greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list containing `n` elements which are the integer values of `data[2]` to `data[n+1]`, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 Â· 10^5, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input data, `current_index` is `n + 2`, `results` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `ans` is 0, `hashing` now contains the key `a[0]` with the value `0 + i` (which is 0 + 0 = 0).** 

Explanation: The code `hashing[a[i]] += i` increments the value associated with the key `a[i]` in the dictionary `hashing` by `i`. Since `i` is 0, and `a[0]` is already a key in `hashing` with the value 0, the new value of `hashing[a[0]]` becomes 0 + 0 = 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
