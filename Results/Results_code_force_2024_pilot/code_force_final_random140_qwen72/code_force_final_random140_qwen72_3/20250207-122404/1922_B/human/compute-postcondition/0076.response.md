To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop head:

### Given Information:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `a` is a sorted list containing `n` elements, where each element is `int(data[current_index - n + i])` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
- `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input data.
- `current_index` is `2 * n + 3`.
- `results` is a list containing one element `ans`.
- `i` is `0`.
- `ans` is `0`.
- `hashing[a[0]]` is `0`.
- If `a[0]` is equal to `a[1]`, the state remains unchanged.

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(n - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range `range(n - 1)`.
- The variable `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration.
- The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.

### Adjusting the State:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `0`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
- The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than `n - 1`.

### Updated State:
- `i` is incremented from `0` to `1`.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `data`, `current_index`, `results`, `ans`, `hashing[a[0]]`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list containing `n` elements, where each element is `int(data[current_index - n + i])` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input data, `current_index` is `2 * n + 3`, `results` is a list containing one element `ans`, `i` is `1`, `ans` is `0`, `hashing[a[0]]` is `0`.**
