The code snippet `ans += hashing[a[i]]` updates the value of `ans` by adding the value of `hashing[a[i]]` to it.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `n` is the integer value of `data[2 * n + 3]` and must be at least 2.
- `a` is a sorted list containing `n` elements `[int(data[2 * n + 4]), int(data[2 * n + 5]), ..., int(data[2 * n + 4 + n - 1])]`.
- `current_index` is `2 * n + 4 + n`.
- `results` is a list containing two elements `[ans, ans]`.
- `i` is `n - 2`.
- `hashing[a[i]]` is `i` (or `n - 2`). If `a[i]` is not in `hashing`, then `hashing[a[i]]` was set to 0 before the increment, otherwise, it was already present and its value was incremented by `i`.
- If `a[i]` is equal to `a[i + 1]`, then `ans` is set to 0. Otherwise, the values of `ans` and `hashing` remain unchanged.

Let's analyze the impact of the code:

1. **Value of `a[i]`**: Since `i` is `n - 2`, `a[i]` is the second-to-last element in the list `a`.
2. **Value of `hashing[a[i]]`**: According to the initial state, `hashing[a[i]]` is `i` (which is `n - 2`).
3. **Update of `ans`**: The value of `ans` is incremented by `hashing[a[i]]`, which is `n - 2`.

Therefore, the new value of `ans` is `ans + (n - 2)`.

The output state is:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `n` is the integer value of `data[2 * n + 3]` and must be at least 2.
- `a` is a sorted list containing `n` elements `[int(data[2 * n + 4]), int(data[2 * n + 5]), ..., int(data[2 * n + 4 + n - 1])]`.
- `current_index` is `2 * n + 4 + n`.
- `results` is a list containing two elements `[ans, ans]`.
- `i` is `n - 2`.
- `hashing[a[i]]` is `i` (or `n - 2`).
- `ans` is now `ans + (n - 2)`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[2 * n + 3]` and must be at least 2, `a` is a sorted list containing `n` elements `[int(data[2 * n + 4]), int(data[2 * n + 5]), ..., int(data[2 * n + 4 + n - 1])]`, `current_index` is `2 * n + 4 + n`, `results` is a list containing two elements `[ans, ans]`, `i` is `n - 2`, `hashing[a[i]]` is `i` (or `n - 2`), `ans` is now `ans + (n - 2)`.**
