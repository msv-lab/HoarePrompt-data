Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input data, `current_index` is 1, `results` is an empty list, `hashing` is an empty dictionary.**

Explanation:
- `n` is assigned the integer value of `data[1]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
