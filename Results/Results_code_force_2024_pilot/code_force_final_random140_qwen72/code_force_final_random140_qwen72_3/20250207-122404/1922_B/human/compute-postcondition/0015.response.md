Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list containing two elements which are the integer values of `data[2]` and `data[3]`, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 Â· 10^5, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input data, `current_index` is 3, `results` is an empty list, `hashing` is an empty dictionary, `i` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The code appends the integer value of `data[current_index]` (which is `data[3]`) to the list `a`.
- Initially, `a` contained one element, which was the integer value of `data[2]`.
- After executing the code, `a` now contains two elements: the integer values of `data[2]` and `data[3]`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `data`, `current_index`, `results`, `hashing`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
