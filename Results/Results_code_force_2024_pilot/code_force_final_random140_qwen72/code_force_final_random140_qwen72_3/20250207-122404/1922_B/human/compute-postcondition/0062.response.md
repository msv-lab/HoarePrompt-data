To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's focus on the variables and conditions in the loop head:

```python
for i in range(n - 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Variables in the Loop Head**:
   - The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `n - 1`.

2. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will execute if `n - 1` is greater than 0, which means `n` must be greater than 1.

3. **Initial State**:
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 0 (as given).
   - `i` is initially set to `n - 1`.

4. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1 (since `n - 1` must be greater than 0).
   - `i` should start at 0 when the loop begins, but it is initially set to `n - 1`. This is not a concern for the loop condition, as `i` will be reset by the loop itself.

### Final Adjusted State:
- `n` must be greater than 1 to ensure the loop executes.
- `i` will be managed by the loop itself, starting from 0 and iterating up to `n - 2`.

### Adjusted State:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list containing `n` elements, where each element is `int(data[current_index - n + i])` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 Â· 10^5, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input data, `current_index` is `2 * n + 3`, `results` is a list containing one element `ans`, `i` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, `hashing` is an empty dictionary.**
