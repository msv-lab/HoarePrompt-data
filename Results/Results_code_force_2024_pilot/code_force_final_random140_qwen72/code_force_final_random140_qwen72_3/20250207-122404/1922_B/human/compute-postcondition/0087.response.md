Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `n` is the integer value of `data[2 * n + 3]`, `a` is a sorted list containing `n` elements, where each element is `int(data[current_index - n + i])` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 Â· 10^5, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input data, `current_index` is `2 * n + 4`, `results` is a list containing two elements `[ans, ans]`, `i` is `n - 2`, `ans` is the sum of `hashing[a[i]]` for all `i` where `a[i] == a[i + 1]`, `hashing` is an empty dictionary `{}`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `current_index` is incremented by 1, changing from `2 * n + 3` to `2 * n + 4`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `data`, `results`, `i`, `ans`, `hashing`) remain unchanged.
