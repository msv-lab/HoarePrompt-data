Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `a` is a sorted list containing `n` elements which are the integer values of `data[2]` to `data[n+1]`, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 Â· 10^5, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input data, `current_index` is `n + 2`, `results` is an empty list, `i` is `n - 1`, `ans` is the sum of the values in `hashing` for each element in `a` that appears consecutively in the list, `hashing` contains each unique element in `a` as keys, and their values are the cumulative indices where they appear in the list.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Must still be greater than 0, as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`n`**: The integer value of `data[1]`, which remains unchanged.
- **`a`**: The sorted list of integers from `data[2]` to `data[n+1]`, which remains unchanged.
- **`data`**: The list of strings obtained by splitting the input data, which remains unchanged.
- **`current_index`**: Remains `n + 2`, as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`results`**: Remains an empty list, as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be `n - 1` because the loop iterates from `0` to `n - 2`.
- **`ans`**: This variable accumulates the values in `hashing` for each element in `a` that appears consecutively in the list. Specifically, if `a[i]` is equal to `a[i + 1]`, `ans` is incremented by the value of `hashing[a[i]]`.
- **`hashing`**: This dictionary contains each unique element in `a` as keys, and their values are the cumulative indices where they appear in the list. For example, if `a` is `[1, 1, 2, 2, 3]`, then `hashing` will be `{1: 1, 2: 5, 3: 4}`. The value for each key is the sum of the indices where that key appears in the list.
