Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[current_index - 1]`, `a` is an empty list, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 Â· 10^5, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input data, `current_index` is `n + 3`, `results` is a list containing one element `ans`, `i` is `n - 1`, `ans` is the sum of the values in `hashing` for each element in `a` that appears consecutively in the list, `hashing` is an empty dictionary.**

Explanation: The code snippet `a = []` reassigns the variable `a` to an empty list, overriding its previous value. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
