Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `hashing[a[1]]` is 0.**

Explanation:
- `i` was incremented to 1, so `i` is now 1.
- The condition `i < n - 1` must still be true, which means `n` must be greater than 2.
- The line `hashing[a[i]] = 0` sets the value of `hashing[a[1]]` to 0, assuming `a[1]` is a valid index in the list `a`. The value of `a[1]` is not specified, but the dictionary `hashing` now has the key `a[1]` with the value 0.
