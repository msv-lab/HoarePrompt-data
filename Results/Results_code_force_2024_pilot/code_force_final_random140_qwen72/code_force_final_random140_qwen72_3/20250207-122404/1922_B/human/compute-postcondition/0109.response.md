To determine the state adjustments necessary for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head, which in this case are `i` and `n`.

Given the current state:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `n` is the integer value of `data[2 * n + 3]` and must be at least 2
- `a` is a sorted list containing `n` elements `[int(data[2 * n + 4]), int(data[2 * n + 5]), ..., int(data[2 * n + 4 + n - 1])]`
- `current_index` is `2 * n + 4 + n`
- `results` is a list containing two elements `[ans, ans]`
- `i` is `n - 1`

The loop statement is:
```python
for i in range(n - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is within the range `0` to `n - 2` (inclusive). This means `i` must be less than `n - 1`.
2. **Current State of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n - 1`.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1. Therefore, `i` should be `n - 2`.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is `n - 2`
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `current_index`, `results`, `ans`, and `hashing`) remain unchanged.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[2 * n + 3]` and must be at least 2, `a` is a sorted list containing `n` elements `[int(data[2 * n + 4]), int(data[2 * n + 5]), ..., int(data[2 * n + 4 + n - 1])]`, `current_index` is `2 * n + 4 + n`, `results` is a list containing two elements `[ans, ans]`, `i` is `n - 2`. If `a[i]` is equal to `a[i + 1]`, then `ans` is set to `hashing[a[i]]`, and `hashing` is a dictionary with the key `a[n-1]` and its value updated to `i`. Otherwise, the values of `ans` and `hashing` remain unchanged.**
