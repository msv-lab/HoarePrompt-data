Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `a` is a sorted list containing `n` elements which are the integer values of `data[2]` to `data[n+1]`, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input data, `current_index` is `n + 2`, `results` is an empty list, `hashing` is an empty dictionary, `i` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if a[i] not in hashing:
        hashing[a[i]] = 0
    hashing[a[i]] += i
    if a[i] == a[i + 1]:
        ans += hashing[a[i]]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]` and must be greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list containing `n` elements which are the integer values of `data[2]` to `data[n+1]`, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input data, `current_index` is `n + 2`, `results` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `ans` is 0, `hashing` now contains the key `a[0]` with the value `0 + i` (which is 0 + 0 = 0). If `a[i]` is equal to `a[i + 1]`, the current value of `a[i]` is equal to the current value of `a[i + 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `a[1]` is in `hashing`, `hashing[a[1]]` is 1. If `a[1] == a[2]`, `ans` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `a[1]` is in `hashing`, `hashing[a[1]]` is 1, `a[2]` is in `hashing`, `hashing[a[2]]` is 2. If `a[1] == a[2]`, `ans` is increased by 1. If `a[2] == a[3]`, `ans` is further increased by 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
