The code snippet `results.append(ans)` appends the value of `ans` to the list `results`. Given the initial state, let's analyze the impact:

- `results` initially contains two elements `[ans, ans]`.
- After appending `ans` to `results`, `results` will contain three elements `[ans, ans, ans]`.

All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `current_index`, `i`, `hashing`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[2 * n + 3]` and must be at least 2, `a` is a sorted list containing `n` elements `[int(data[2 * n + 4]), int(data[2 * n + 5]), ..., int(data[2 * n + 4 + n - 1])]`, `current_index` is `2 * n + 4 + n`, `results` is a list containing three elements `[ans, ans, ans]`, `i` is `0`, `hashing` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `a` and its value is the sum of indices where the element appears in `a`, and `ans` is the sum of `hashing[a[i]]` for all `i` where `a[i] == a[i + 1]`.**
