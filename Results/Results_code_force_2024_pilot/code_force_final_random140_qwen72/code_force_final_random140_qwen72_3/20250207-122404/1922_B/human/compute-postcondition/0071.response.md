Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list containing `n` elements, where each element is `int(data[current_index - n + i])` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 Â· 10^5, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input data, `current_index` is `2 * n + 3`, `results` is a list containing one element `ans`, `i` is `0`, `ans` is 0, `hashing[a[n-1]]` is `n - 1` if `a[n-1]` was not previously in `hashing`, otherwise `hashing[a[n-1]]` is incremented by `n - 1`, `hashing[a[0]]` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The initial state remains unchanged for all variables except `hashing[a[0]]`.
- The code `hashing[a[i]] = 0` sets the value of `hashing[a[0]]` to 0, because `i` is 0.
- All other variables and conditions remain as they were in the initial state.
