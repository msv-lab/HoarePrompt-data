Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[2 * n + 3]` and must be at least 2, `a` is a sorted list containing `n` elements `[int(data[2 * n + 4]), int(data[2 * n + 5]), ..., int(data[2 * n + 4 + n - 1])]`, `current_index` is `2 * n + 4 + n`, `results` is a list containing two elements `[ans, ans]`, `i` is `n - 1`. If `a[i]` is not in `hashing`, then `hashing[a[i]]` is set to 0, and `ans` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `hashing[a[i]]` is `i` (or `n - 1`), and if `a[i]` is equal to `a[i + 1]`, then `ans` is set to `ans + (n - 1)`.***
