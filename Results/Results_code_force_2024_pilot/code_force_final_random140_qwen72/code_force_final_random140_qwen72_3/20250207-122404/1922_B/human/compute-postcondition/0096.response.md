Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `n` is the integer value of `data[2 * n + 3]` and must be greater than 2, `a` is a list containing three elements `[int(data[current_index - 1]), int(data[current_index]), int(data[current_index])]`, `current_index` is `2 * n + 6`, `results` is a list containing two elements `[ans, ans]`, `i` is 2, `ans` is the sum of `hashing[a[i]]` for all `i` where `a[i] == a[i + 1]`, `hashing` is an empty dictionary `{}`.**

Explanation:
- The code `a.append(int(data[current_index]))` appends the integer value of `data[current_index]` to the list `a`.
- Initially, `a` was `[int(data[current_index - 1]), int(data[current_index])]`.
- After appending `int(data[current_index])`, `a` becomes `[int(data[current_index - 1]), int(data[current_index]), int(data[current_index])]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
