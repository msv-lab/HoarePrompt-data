Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `a[1]` is in `hashing`, `hashing[a[1]]` is 1.** 

Explanation: The code `hashing[a[i]] += i` increments the value of `hashing[a[1]]` by `i`. Since `i` is 1 and `a[1]` was not initially in `hashing`, `hashing[a[1]]` was set to 0 before this operation. After adding `i` (which is 1), `hashing[a[1]]` becomes 1. The other conditions (`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 2) remain unchanged.
