Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5. `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input data. `current_index` is 0.**
