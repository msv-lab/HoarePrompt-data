Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `a` is a list containing `n` elements which are the integer values of `data[2]` to `data[n+1]`, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 Â· 10^5, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input data, `current_index` is `n + 2`, `results` is an empty list, `hashing` is an empty dictionary, `i` is `n - 1`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` remains greater than 0.
- The variable `n` retains its initial value, which is the integer value of `data[1]`.
- The list `a` now contains `n` elements, each of which is the integer value of the corresponding element from `data[2]` to `data[n+1]`.
- The variable `current_index` is updated to `n + 2`, reflecting the position in the `data` list after all elements have been processed.
- The lists `results` and `hashing` remain empty, as they are not modified within the loop.
- The loop index `i` reaches `n - 1`, indicating that the loop has completed all `n` iterations.
