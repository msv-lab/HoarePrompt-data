To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
- `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input data.
- `current_index` is 1.
- `results` is an empty list.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for _ in range(t):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0.
- The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a dummy variable used for iteration.
- The loop will iterate `t` times.

### Adjustments Needed:
- To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be greater than 0.
- The other variables (`n`, `a`, `data`, `current_index`, `results`) are not directly involved in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Final State:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input data, `current_index` is 1, `results` is an empty list.**
