The code snippet `results.append(ans)` appends the value of `ans` to the list `results`. The value of `ans` is already calculated as the sum of `hashing[a[i]]` for all `i` where `a[i] == a[i + 1]`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list containing `n` elements, where each element is `int(data[current_index - n + i])` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 Â· 10^5, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input data, `current_index` is `2 * n + 3`, `results` is a list containing two elements `[ans, ans]`, `i` is `n - 2`, `ans` is the sum of `hashing[a[i]]` for all `i` where `a[i] == a[i + 1]`, `hashing` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `a` and the value is the sum of indices `i` for which `a[i]` appears in the list `a` up to the current iteration.**
