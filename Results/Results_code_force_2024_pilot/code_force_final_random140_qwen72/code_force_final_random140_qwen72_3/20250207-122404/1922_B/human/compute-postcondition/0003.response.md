Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input data, `current_index` is 0.** 

Explanation: The value of `t` is updated to the integer value of the first element in the `data` list, which is accessed using `data[current_index]`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
