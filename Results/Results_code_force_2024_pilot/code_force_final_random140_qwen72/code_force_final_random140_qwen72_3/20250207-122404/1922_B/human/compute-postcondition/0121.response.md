Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[2 * n + 3]` and must be at least 2, `a` is a sorted list containing `n` elements `[int(data[2 * n + 4]), int(data[2 * n + 5]), ..., int(data[2 * n + 4 + n - 1])]`, `current_index` is `2 * n + 4 + n`, `results` is a list containing two elements `[ans, ans]`, `i` is `0`, `hashing` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `a` and its value is the sum of indices where the element appears in `a`, and `ans` is the sum of `hashing[a[i]]` for all `i` where `a[i] == a[i + 1]`.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains greater than 0 as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`n`**: Remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`a`**: Remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`current_index`**: Remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`results`**: Remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be `0` because the loop iterates from `n - 1` down to `0`.
- **`hashing`**: This dictionary will contain keys for each unique element in `a` and the values will be the sum of the indices where each element appears in `a`.
- **`ans`**: This variable will be the sum of the values in `hashing` for all elements `a[i]` where `a[i] == a[i + 1]`.

This output state reflects the final state of the variables after the loop has completed all its iterations.
