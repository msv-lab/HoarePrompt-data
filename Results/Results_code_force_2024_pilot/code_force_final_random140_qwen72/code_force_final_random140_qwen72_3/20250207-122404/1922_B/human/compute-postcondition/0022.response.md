Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `a` is a sorted list containing `n` elements which are the integer values of `data[2]` to `data[n+1]`, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 Â· 10^5, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input data, `current_index` is `n + 2`, `results` is an empty list, `hashing` is an empty dictionary, `i` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The variable `ans` is initialized to 0.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `data`, `current_index`, `results`, `hashing`, `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
