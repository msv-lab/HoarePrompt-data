Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list containing `n` elements, where each element is `int(data[current_index - n + i])` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 Â· 10^5, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input data, `current_index` is `2 * n + 3`, `results` is a list containing one element `ans`, `i` is `1`, `ans` is `0`, `hashing[a[0]]` is `0`, `hashing[a[1]]` is `1`.**

Explanation:
- The code `hashing[a[i]] += i` increments the value of `hashing[a[i]]` by `i`.
- Given `i` is `1`, the value of `hashing[a[1]]` is incremented by `1`.
- Initially, `hashing[a[1]]` was `0` (as per the initial state), so after the increment, `hashing[a[1]]` becomes `1`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
