Initial State: `results` is a list containing at least two elements, `result` is the second element in `results`.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. The `results` list is defined and contains at least two elements.
2. The variable `result` is assigned the value of the second element in the `results` list.
3. The `print(result)` statement will print the value of `result`.

Since the exact values of the elements in the `results` list are not specified, we can only describe the value of `result` as the second element in the `results` list.

Output: **result (where result is the second element in the results list)**
