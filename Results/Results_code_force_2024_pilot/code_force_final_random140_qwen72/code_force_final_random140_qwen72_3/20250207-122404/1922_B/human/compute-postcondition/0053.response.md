The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 1, and `n` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list containing one element which is `int(data[current_index - 1])`, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 Â· 10^5, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input data, `current_index` is `n + 4`, `results` is a list containing one element `ans`, `i` is 1, `ans` is the sum of the values in `hashing` for each element in `a` that appears consecutively in the list, `hashing` is an empty dictionary.**
