Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` remains the same (1 ≤ t ≤ 50)
- `i` is 2
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 6
- `j` is 6

The print statement is:
```python
print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))
```

Explanation:
- The variable `j` is explicitly given as 6.
- The print statement converts `j` to a string and concatenates it with a space and another string representation of `j`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **6 6**
