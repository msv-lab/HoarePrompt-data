Initial State: `i` is 4, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print(i, i)
```

Explanation:
- The variable `i` is explicitly stated to be 4 in the initial state.
- The `print` statement will print the value of `i` twice, separated by a space.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be:
Output: **4 4**
