Output State: **`i` is `n + 2`, `n` remains unchanged.**

### Explanation:
- The loop starts with `i` initialized to 3 and runs as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n + 2`.
- After each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.
- The loop will continue to run until `i` becomes `n + 2` (the last value it can take before the condition `i <= n + 2` fails).
- Therefore, after the loop has completed all its iterations, `i` will be `n + 2`.
- The value of `n` remains unchanged throughout the loop because it is not modified within the loop body.
