The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the integer `1`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(0 < t \leq 47\).
- `n` is a new input integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^3\).

These variables (`t` and `n`) are not used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement simply outputs the constant integer `1`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be:

Output: **1**
