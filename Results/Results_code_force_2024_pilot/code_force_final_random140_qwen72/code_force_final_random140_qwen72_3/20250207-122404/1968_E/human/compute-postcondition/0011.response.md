The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. The loop condition is `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n + 1`, and `n` remains the same as the input integer greater than 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be reset to a value that satisfies the loop condition (`i < n`). However, since the loop has already completed and `i` is now `n + 1`, the loop cannot execute again unless the loop is restarted from the beginning, which would mean `i` is reset to 0.

Given the current state, the loop cannot execute again because `i` is already greater than or equal to `n`.

State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` remains the same as the input integer greater than 0** (The loop cannot execute again with these values.)
