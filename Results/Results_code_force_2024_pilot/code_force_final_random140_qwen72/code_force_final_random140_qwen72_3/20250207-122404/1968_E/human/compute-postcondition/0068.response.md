Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer between 1 and 50. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` such that 2 <= n <= 10^3. It then prints the value of `n` twice, followed by `n` and `n-1`. If `n` is 3, it additionally prints `2` and `1`. Otherwise, it prints the numbers from 1 to `n-1`, each followed by itself. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and `t` is 0. **
