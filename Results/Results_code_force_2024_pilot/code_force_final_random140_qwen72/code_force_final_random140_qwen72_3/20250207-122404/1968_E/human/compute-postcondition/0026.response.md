To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given state and the loop head:

### Given State:
- `i` is `n + 3`
- `n` is an input integer greater than `n + 3` (previous `n` value)
- `int(input())` must be greater than `n + 3` (previous `n` value)

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(3, n + 2):
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute if the range `range(3, n + 2)` is non-empty. This means that `3` must be less than `n + 2`.
2. **Initial Value of `i`**: The variable `i` is initialized to `n + 3` in the given state, but this value is not relevant to the loop head. The loop will reassign `i` starting from `3`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`n`**: For the loop to execute, `n` must be such that `3 < n + 2`. Simplifying this, we get `n > 1`.
- **`i`**: The initial value of `i` in the loop head is determined by the `range` function, so we don't need to adjust `i` explicitly.

### Final State:
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `i` will be set to 3 by the loop.

### State:
**`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 1**
