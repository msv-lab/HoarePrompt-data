Output State: **`t` remains the same (1 ≤ t ≤ 50), `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to the final value of `j`, `j` is `n`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains unchanged throughout the loop execution, staying within the range 1 to 50.
- The variable `i` also remains unchanged at 2.
- The variable `n` must be greater than or equal to the final value of `j` for the loop to complete all its iterations.
- The variable `j` starts at 4 and increments by 1 with each iteration until it reaches `n`. Therefore, after the loop completes all its iterations, `j` will be equal to `n`.

This means that the loop will have executed from `j = 4` to `j = n`, printing each value of `j` twice during each iteration. After the loop finishes, `j` will be equal to `n`, and the conditions for `t` and `i` will remain as they were initially.
