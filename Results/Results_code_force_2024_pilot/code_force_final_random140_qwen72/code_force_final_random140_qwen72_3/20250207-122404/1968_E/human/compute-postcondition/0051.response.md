Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases. It first reads an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 50) indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3). The function then prints the pairs '1 1' and '1 2'. If `n` is 3, it prints '2 3'. If `n` is 4 or greater, it prints '2 4' followed by pairs `(j, j)` for each `j` from 4 to `n`. The function does not modify the values of `t` or `n` and has no return value. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, leaving `t` unchanged and `i` set to `t - 1`. **
