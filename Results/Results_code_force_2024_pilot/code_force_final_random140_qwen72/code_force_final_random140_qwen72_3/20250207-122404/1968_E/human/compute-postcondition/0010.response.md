Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` remains the same as the input integer greater than 0.**

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `i` will have the value `n + 1`, because the loop starts at 3 and increments `i` until it reaches `n + 2`. The variable `n` remains unchanged from its initial value, which is an input integer greater than 0.
