Output State: **`t` is 0, and for each of the t test cases, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3. The loop has completed all its iterations, and no further changes are made to `t` or `n`.**

### Explanation:
- **`t` is 0:** After the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` is decremented to 0, indicating that there are no more test cases left to process.
- **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3:** For each iteration of the loop, `n` was an input integer within the specified range. However, since the loop has completed, `n` is no longer being updated or used.
- **No further changes are made to `t` or `n`:** Once the loop has finished executing, the values of `t` and `n` are not modified further. The loop has processed all the test cases, and the program will exit the loop.
