To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\).
- For each of the `t` test cases, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^3\).

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(0, int(input())):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The variables in the loop head are `i` and the result of `int(input())`.
2. **Condition for Execution**: The loop will execute if the upper bound of the range (i.e., `int(input())`) is greater than the lower bound (which is 0). Therefore, `int(input())` must be greater than 0.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`i`**: This variable is initialized by the loop itself and starts at 0.
- **`int(input())`**: This value must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

### Final State:
Since `t` and `n` are not directly involved in the loop head, they do not need to be adjusted. However, the input value must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

State: **`i` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
