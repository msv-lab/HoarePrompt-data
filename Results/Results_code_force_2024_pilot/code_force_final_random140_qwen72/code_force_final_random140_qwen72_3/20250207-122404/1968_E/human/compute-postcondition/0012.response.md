The code snippet `n = int(input())` updates the value of `n` to a new integer input by the user. Since the initial state specifies that `i` is `n + 1` and `n` was an input integer greater than 0, after executing the code, `n` will now be the new input integer, and `i` will no longer be `n + 1` because `n` has been updated. However, since `i` is not reassigned in the code, its value remains as it was before the execution of the code, which is the original `n + 1`.

Output State: **`i` is the original `n + 1`, `n` is a new input integer greater than 0**.
