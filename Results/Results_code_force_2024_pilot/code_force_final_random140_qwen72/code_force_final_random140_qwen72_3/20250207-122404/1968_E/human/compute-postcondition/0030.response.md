To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

- **Current State**: `i` is 4, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.
- **Loop Statement**: `for i in range(3, n + 2):`

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**:
   - The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**:
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n + 2`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 4.

3. **Adjust the State**:
   - In the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will be 5 at the start of the next iteration.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n + 2`. This means `5 < n + 2`, which simplifies to `n > 3`.

### Final State:
- `i` is 5.
- `n` must be greater than 3.

State: **`i` is 5, `n` must be greater than 3**
