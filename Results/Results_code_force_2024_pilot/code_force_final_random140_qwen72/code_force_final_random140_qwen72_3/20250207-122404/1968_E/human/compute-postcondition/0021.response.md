Output State: **`i` is `n + 2`, `n` remains unchanged.**

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has completed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be `n + 2`, which is the point where the loop condition `i < n + 2` becomes false and the loop stops. The value of `n` remains the same as it was before the loop started, since `n` is not modified within the loop.
