The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` relative to `n`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2. Additionally, for the loop condition to still hold true, `n` must be greater than 2 (since `i` must be less than `n - 1`).

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(0 < t \leq 47\), `n` is a new input integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^3\), `i` is 2**
