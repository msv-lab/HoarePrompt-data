Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer such that \(0 < t \leq 47\).
- `n` is a new input integer such that \(4 < n \leq 10^3\).
- `i` is explicitly set to 3.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print(i, end=' ')
```

This statement will print the value of `i` followed by a space (since `end=' '` is specified).

Given that `i` is explicitly set to 3, the output will be:

Output: **3 **

The value of `i` is 3, and the `end=' '` ensures that a space follows the printed value.
