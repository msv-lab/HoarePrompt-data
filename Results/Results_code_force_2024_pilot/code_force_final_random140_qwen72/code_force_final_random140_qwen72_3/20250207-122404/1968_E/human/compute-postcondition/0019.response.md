To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

- The current state at the end of the previous iteration is: `i` is 4, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4.
- The loop statement is: `for i in range(3, n + 2):`

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Next Value of `i`:**
   - The loop iterates over the range `range(3, n + 2)`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 4.
   - In the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 5.

3. **Determine the Condition for the Loop to Continue:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n + 2`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` (which is now 5) must be less than `n + 2`.
   - Therefore, `n` must be greater than or equal to 5 - 2, which simplifies to `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is now 5.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 5.

### Final State:
State: **`i` is 5, `n` must be greater than or equal to 5**
