The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints given, it can be inferred that the function likely processes a series of test cases, where `t` represents the number of test cases, and for each test case, `n` is an integer representing some input value.

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50.
- For each of the `t` test cases, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3.

The function's output is not specified, but typically, such functions would process each test case and return a result for each `n`.

Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 50. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` between 2 and 10^3 and returns a result for each `n`.**
