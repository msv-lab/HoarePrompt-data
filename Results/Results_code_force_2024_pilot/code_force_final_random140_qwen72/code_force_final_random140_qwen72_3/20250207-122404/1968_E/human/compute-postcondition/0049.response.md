Output State: **`t` remains the same (an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50), `i` is `t - 1`, and for each of the `t` test cases, `n` is an input integer. If `n` == 3, the program prints '2 3'. If `n` ≥ 4, the program prints '2 4' and then prints each pair `(j, j)` for `j` from 4 to `n`. If `n` < 3, no additional lines are printed.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` still holds the original number of test cases, `i` has reached the value `t - 1` (indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations), and for each test case, the program has printed the appropriate lines based on the value of `n`. If `n` was 3, it printed '2 3'. If `n` was 4 or greater, it printed '2 4' followed by pairs `(j, j)` for `j` from 4 to `n`. If `n` was less than 3, no additional lines were printed.
