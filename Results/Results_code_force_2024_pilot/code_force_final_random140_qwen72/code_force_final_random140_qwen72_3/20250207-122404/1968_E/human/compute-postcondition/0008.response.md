The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop starts from `i = 3` and goes up to `n + 2 - 1` (since `range` is exclusive of the stop value). 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, and `n` must be at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 4. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `i` must be less than `n + 2`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least 4 (since `i` is now 4 and it must be less than `n + 2`).

State: **`i` is 4, `n` must be at least 4**
