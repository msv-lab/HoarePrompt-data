Let's analyze the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` remains the same (an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50).
- `i` is 2.
- `n` is a new input integer.
- If `n` == 3, the condition for `j` remains unchanged.
- If `n` ≥ 4, `j` is set to `n` and `n` must be greater than or equal to the final value of `j`.
- If `n` < 4, `j` remains unchanged.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('2 4')
```

### Analysis:
1. The `print` statement is a simple string literal: `'2 4'`.
2. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `j` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the `print` statement is printing a fixed string and not any of these variables.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print the string `'2 4'` regardless of the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, or `j`.

Output: **2 4**
