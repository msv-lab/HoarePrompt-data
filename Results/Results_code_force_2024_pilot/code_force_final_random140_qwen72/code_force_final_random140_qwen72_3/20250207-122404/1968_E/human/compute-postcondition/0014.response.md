The given Python code snippet is:

```python
print(1, 2)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any variables or objects from the initial state.
- The `print` statement simply outputs the numbers 1 and 2, separated by a space.

### Initial State:
- `i` is the original `n + 1`.
- `n` is a new input integer greater than 0.

### Explanation:
- The values of `i` and `n` do not affect the output of the `print` statement because the `print` statement explicitly prints the constants 1 and 2.
- Therefore, regardless of the values of `i` and `n`, the output will always be the same.

### Final Output:
Output: **1 2**
