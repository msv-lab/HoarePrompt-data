The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop starts from `i = 3` and goes up to `n + 1` (since `range(3, n + 2)` includes all integers from 3 up to but not including `n + 2`).

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 4. For the loop condition to still hold true, `n` must be such that `n + 2` is greater than 4, meaning `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.

State: **`i` is 4, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3**
