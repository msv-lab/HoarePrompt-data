The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop starts from `i = 3` and goes up to `n + 1` (since `range(3, n + 2)` includes values from 3 up to but not including `n + 2`).

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` must be at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to the next value in the range, which is 3, and `n` must still be at least 2 to ensure the loop condition is met.

State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be at least 2**
