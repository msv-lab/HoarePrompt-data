To determine the state adjustments necessary for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop structure:

### Given Information:
- State at the end of the previous iteration: `i` is `n + 2`, `n` remains unchanged.
- Loop statement: `for i in range(0, int(input())):`

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and the upper bound of the range, which is `int(input())`.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n + 2`.
3. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than the upper bound of the range.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
- The loop iterates over the range from 0 to `int(input()) - 1`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
- Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `n + 3`.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is incremented by 1, so it becomes `n + 3`.
- The upper bound of the range, `int(input())`, remains unchanged.

### Final State:
State: **`i` is `n + 3`, `n` remains unchanged, `int(input())` must be greater than `n + 3`**
