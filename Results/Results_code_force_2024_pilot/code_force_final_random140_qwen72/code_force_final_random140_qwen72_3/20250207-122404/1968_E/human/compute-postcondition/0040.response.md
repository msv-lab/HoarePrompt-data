To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop head:

### Given Conditions:
- `t` remains the same (an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50).
- `i` is 2.
- `n` is a new input integer.
  - If `n` == 3, the condition for `j` remains unchanged.
  - If `n` ≥ 4, `j` is set to `n` and `n` must be greater than or equal to the final value of `j`.
  - If `n` < 4, `j` remains unchanged.

### Loop Head:
```python
for j in range(4, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop will execute if `range(4, n + 1)` generates a sequence of numbers. This means `n` must be at least 4 for the loop to run at least once.
- The variable `j` is initialized to 4 and iterates up to `n`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 4.
- The variable `j` is automatically set to 4 by the `range` function, so we don't need to adjust `j` explicitly.
- The other variables (`t` and `i`) are not involved in the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted.

### Final State:
State: **`t` remains the same (1 ≤ t ≤ 50), `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `j` is 4**
