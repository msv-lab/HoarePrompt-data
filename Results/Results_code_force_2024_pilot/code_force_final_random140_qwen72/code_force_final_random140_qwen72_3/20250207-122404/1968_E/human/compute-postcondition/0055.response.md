Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer such that \(0 < t \leq 47\).
- `n` is a new input integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^3\).
- `i` is 1.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print(i, end=' ')
```

This statement prints the value of `i` followed by a space (because `end=' '` is specified).

Given that `i` is explicitly set to 1, the output will be:

Output: **1 **

The `1` is printed followed by a space.
