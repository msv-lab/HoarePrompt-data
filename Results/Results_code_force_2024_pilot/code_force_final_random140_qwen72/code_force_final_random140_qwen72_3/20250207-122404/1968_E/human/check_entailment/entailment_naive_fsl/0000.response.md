Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases for maximizing the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances. Specifically, the program always prints the same pattern of points, which may not maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all values of \(n\).

For example, consider \(n = 3\). The program outputs:
```
1 1
1 2
3 3
```
However, the optimal arrangement for \(n = 3\) should be:
```
2 1
2 3
3 1
```
This arrangement results in the set \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), which has a size of 4. The program's output, on the other hand, results in a smaller set of distinct Manhattan distances.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not always produce the optimal solution for maximizing the size of \(\mathcal{H}\).
