Reasoning:  
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by printing a specific pattern of coordinates for each test case. However, the approach taken does not necessarily maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Pattern for Maximizing Distances**: The program prints the coordinates `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)` for every test case, followed by a diagonal pattern starting from `(3, 3)` to `(n+1, n+1)`. This pattern does not ensure that the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances is maximized. For example, for \(n = 3\), the program outputs:
   ```
   1 1
   1 2
   3 3
   ```
   The set \(\mathcal{H}\) for these points is \(\{1, 2, 4\}\), but the maximum possible size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for \(n = 3\) is 4, as shown in the problem statement.

2. **Generalization Issue**: The program does not generalize well for larger values of \(n\). The pattern used does not consider the full range of possible distances and may miss out on maximizing the set \(\mathcal{H}\).

3. **Test Case Handling**: The program correctly handles the input format and iterates over the test cases, but the logic inside the loop is flawed.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
