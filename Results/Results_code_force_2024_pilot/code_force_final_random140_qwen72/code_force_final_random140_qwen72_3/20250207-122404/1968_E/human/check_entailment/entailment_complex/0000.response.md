Reasoning:  
The program aims to solve the problem of maximizing the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an \(n \times n\) grid. The program's approach is to print specific coordinates for each test case. Let's analyze the logic:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases \(t\) and the value of \(n\) for each test case.
2. **Output Logic**:
   - For each test case, it prints the coordinates \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\).
   - Then, it prints the coordinates \((i, i)\) for \(i\) ranging from 3 to \(n + 1\).

However, this approach has a flaw:
- The coordinates \((i, i)\) for \(i\) ranging from 3 to \(n + 1\) will result in a diagonal line of points starting from \((3, 3)\) to \((n+1, n+1)\). This means that the points \((3, 3)\), \((4, 4)\), ..., \((n+1, n+1)\) are all on the same diagonal, which does not maximize the set of distinct Manhattan distances.

To maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\), the points should be chosen such that they cover a wide range of distances. A better approach would be to use a combination of points that are spread out across the grid.

For example, a better strategy could be:
- Use points along the edges of the grid.
- Use points that are diagonally opposite to each other.

Given the current implementation, the program does not achieve the goal of maximizing the size of \(\mathcal{H}\).

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
