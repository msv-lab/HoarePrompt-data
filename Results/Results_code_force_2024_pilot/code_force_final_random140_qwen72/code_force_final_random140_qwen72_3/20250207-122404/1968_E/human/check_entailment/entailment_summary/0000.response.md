Reasoning:  
The goal of the problem is to maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of chosen cells in an \(n \times n\) grid. The provided program attempts to achieve this by printing specific cell coordinates for each test case.

However, the program has a flaw in its logic for generating the coordinates. Specifically, it always prints the same initial two points `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`, and then prints points of the form `(i, i)` for \(i\) ranging from 3 to \(n + 1\). This approach does not necessarily maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\).

For example, consider \(n = 3\):
- The program outputs:
  - (1, 1)
  - (1, 2)
  - (3, 3)

The set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) for these points is:
- \(|1-1| + |1-1| = 0\)
- \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\)
- \(|1-3| + |1-3| = 4\)
- \(|1-3| + |1-2| = 3\)
- \(|1-3| + |2-3| = 3\)
- \(|1-2| + |1-3| = 3\)

Thus, \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 3, 4\}\), which has a size of 4. However, the optimal solution for \(n = 3\) should yield a set \(\mathcal{H}\) with a size of 5, as shown in the problem statement.

Therefore, the program does not correctly maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all \(n\).

Correctness: **False**
