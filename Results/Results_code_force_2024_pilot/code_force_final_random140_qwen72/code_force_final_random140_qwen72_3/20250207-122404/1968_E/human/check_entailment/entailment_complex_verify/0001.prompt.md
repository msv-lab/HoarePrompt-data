You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n . You choose n cells (x_1,y_1),
(x_2,y_2),\dots,(x_n,y_n) in the grid n\times n where 1\le x_i\le n and 1\le
y_i\le n .

Let \mathcal{H} be the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of
cells. Your task is to maximize the size of \mathcal{H} . Examples of sets and
their construction are given in the notes.

If there exists more than one solution, you are allowed to output any.

Manhattan distance between cells (x_1,y_1) and (x_2,y_2) equals
|x_1-x_2|+|y_1-y_2| .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 10^3 ).

Output

For each test case, output n points which maximize the size of \mathcal{H} .
It is not necessary to output an empty line at the end of the answer for each
test case.

Note

In the first testcase we have n=2 . One of the possible arrangements is:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/4d7adaa08c9ee5ebf2a0caba13185ac968d6bcd9.png)
The arrangement with cells located in (1,1) and (1,2) . In this case
\mathcal{H}=\\{|1-1|+|1-1|,|1-1|+|2-2|,|1-1|+|1-2|\\}=\\{0,0,1\\}=\\{0,1\\} .
Hence, the size of \mathcal{H} is 2 . It can be shown that it is the greatest
possible answer.

In the second testcase we have n=3 . The optimal arrangement is:

The arrangement with cells located in (2,1) , (2,3) and (3,1) .

\mathcal{H}
=\\{|2-2|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|3-3|,|3-3|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|1-3|,|2-3|+|1-1|,|2-3|+|3-1|\\}
=\\{0,0,0,2,1,3\\} =\\{0,1,2,3\\} .

For n=4 a possible arrangement is:

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(0, int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        print(1, 1)
        print(1, 2)
        for i in range(3, n + 2):
            print(i, i)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, and for each of the t test cases, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3.
def func():
    for i in range(0, int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        print(1, 1)
        
        print(1, 2)
        
        for i in range(3, n + 2):
            print(i, i)
        
    #State: After all iterations, `i` is equal to the total number of test cases `t` plus the last value of `n` for each test case, and `n` remains unchanged for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 50. For each test case, it reads another integer `n`, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3. It then prints a series of pairs of integers: (1, 1), (1, 2), followed by (i, i) for each `i` from 3 to `n + 1`. The function does not return any value; its primary purpose is to generate and print these pairs for each test case. After the function completes, the input values `t` and `n` for each test case remain unchanged, and the program state reflects the printed output.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to place `n` points in an `n x n` grid such that the number of unique Manhattan distances between any two points is maximized. The Manhattan distance between two points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` is defined as `|x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|`.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Solution**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n`.
   - It prints the first point as `(1, 1)`.
   - It prints the second point as `(1, 2)`.
   - For the remaining points, it prints `(i, i)` for `i` ranging from `3` to `n + 1`.

3. **Evaluating the Output**:
   - The first two points are always `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`, which ensures a distance of `1` between them.
   - The remaining points are placed along the diagonal starting from `(3, 3)` up to `(n+1, n+1)`. This means the points are `(3, 3)`, `(4, 4)`, ..., `(n+1, n+1)`.

4. **Checking the Distances**:
   - The distance between `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)` is `1`.
   - The distance between `(1, 1)` and any point `(i, i)` (for `i >= 3`) is `|1 - i| + |1 - i| = 2(i - 1)`.
   - The distance between `(1, 2)` and any point `(i, i)` (for `i >= 3`) is `|1 - i| + |2 - i| = 2(i - 1.5)`.
   - The distance between any two points `(i, i)` and `(j, j)` (for `i < j`) is `|i - j| + |i - j| = 2(j - i)`.

5. **Maximizing Unique Distances**:
   - The distances generated by the points `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, and `(i, i)` for `i >= 3` include a variety of values, but they are not necessarily all unique.
   - For example, the distance between `(1, 1)` and `(3, 3)` is `4`, and the distance between `(1, 2)` and `(3, 3)` is also `4`. This means the solution does not maximize the number of unique distances.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided solution does not ensure that the number of unique Manhattan distances is maximized. Therefore, the solution is incorrect.
