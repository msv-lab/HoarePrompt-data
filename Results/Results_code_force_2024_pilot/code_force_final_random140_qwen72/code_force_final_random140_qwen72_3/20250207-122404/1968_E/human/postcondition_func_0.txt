The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 50. For each test case, it reads another integer `n`, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3. It then prints a series of pairs of integers: (1, 1), (1, 2), followed by (i, i) for each `i` from 3 to `n + 1`. The function does not return any value; its primary purpose is to generate and print these pairs for each test case. After the function completes, the input values `t` and `n` for each test case remain unchanged, and the program state reflects the printed output.
