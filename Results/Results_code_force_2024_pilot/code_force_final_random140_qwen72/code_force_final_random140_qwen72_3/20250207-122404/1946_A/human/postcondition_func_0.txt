The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. Each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by an array `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, the function sorts the array `a`, finds the median element (or the first median element if the array length is even), and counts how many times this median element appears in the second half of the sorted array. The function prints this count for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function terminates.
