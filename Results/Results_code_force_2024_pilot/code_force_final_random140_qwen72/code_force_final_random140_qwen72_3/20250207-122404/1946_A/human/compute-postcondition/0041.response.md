The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into parts based on spaces, converts each part into an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is `t - 2`
- `_` is a placeholder
- `n` is a new input integer greater than or equal to 0
- `a` is a sorted list of integers from user input
- `median_index` is `n // 2`
- `median` is `a[n // 2]`
- `i` is `n-1`

After executing the code:
- `a` is now a list of integers from the new user input.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `median_index`, `median`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 2`, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is a new input integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers from the new user input, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `median` is `a[n // 2]`, `i` is `n-1`.**
