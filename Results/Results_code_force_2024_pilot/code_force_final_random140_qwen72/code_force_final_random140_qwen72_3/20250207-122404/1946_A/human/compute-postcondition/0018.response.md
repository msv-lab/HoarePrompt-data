Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `p` is `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`, `res` is the number of times the element at index `p` appears in the sublist `a[p:]`, `t` must be greater than 1.**

Explanation:
- The code `a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in the list `a`.
- The initial state specifies that `a` was a sorted list of integers, but after executing the code, `a` is now a list of integers provided by the user.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `p`, and `res` remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code snippet.
- The condition that `t` must be greater than 1 remains valid.
