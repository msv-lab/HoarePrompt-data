The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is `t - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1, making it `t - 2`.

State: **`t` is `t - 2`, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is a new input integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers from user input, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `median` is `a[n // 2]`, `i` is `n-1`**
