Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is a new input integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers from user input, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `median` is `a[n // 2]`, `i` is 2, `operations` is `operations + (median - a[2])`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `operations` is incremented by the difference between `median` and `a[2]`.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `median_index`, `median`, `i`) remain unchanged.
