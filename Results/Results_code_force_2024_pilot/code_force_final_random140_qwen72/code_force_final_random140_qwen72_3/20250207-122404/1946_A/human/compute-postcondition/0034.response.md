The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the input `n`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is a new input integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is a new input integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers from user input, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `median` is `a[n // 2]`, `i` is 2. If `a[2]` is less than the median value, `operations` is incremented by `(median - a[2])`. Otherwise, `operations` remains unchanged.**
