Output State: **`t` is `t - 2`, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is a new input integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the new user input, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `median` is `a[n // 2]`, `i` is `n-1`, `operations` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The variable `operations` is initialized to 0.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `median_index`, `median`, `i`) retain their initial values as they are not modified by the given code snippet.
