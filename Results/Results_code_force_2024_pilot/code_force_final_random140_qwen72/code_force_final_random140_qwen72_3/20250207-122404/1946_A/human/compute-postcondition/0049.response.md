Output State: **`t` is `t - 2`, `_` is a placeholder, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the new user input, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `median` is `a[n // 2]`, `i` is 0, `operations` is `median - a[i]`, and the current value of `a[i]` is less than `median`.**

Explanation: The value of `operations` is updated to `median - a[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged. The current value of `a[i]` is still less than `median`.
