The function `func` does not explicitly define parameters within its signature, but based on the provided parameter constraints and relationships, it is implied that the function processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. The function's purpose is to handle these test cases according to the specified constraints.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It returns results for each test case, ensuring that the number of test cases `t` is between 1 and 10^4, each `n` is between 1 and 10^5, and each element `a_i` in the list `a` is between 1 and 10^9. The total sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 Â· 10^5.**
