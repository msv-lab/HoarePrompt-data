The provided code snippet reassigns the value of `p` using the same expression `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`. Since `p` was already defined with this expression in the initial state, the value of `p` does not change. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state except for the fact that the assignment operation is redundant.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `p` is `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`, `res` is the number of times the element at index `p` appears in the sublist `a[p:]`, `t` must be greater than 1.**
