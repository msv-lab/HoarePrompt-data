Output State: **`t` is `t - 2`, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is a new input integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the new user input, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `median` is `a[n // 2]`, `i` is `n-1`.**

Explanation:
- The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order.
- The initial state indicates that `a` is a list of integers from the new user input. After sorting, `a` remains a list of integers but now in ascending order.
- The other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `median_index`, `median`, `i`) remain unchanged in their values or expressions.
