The code snippet `operations += median - a[i]` updates the value of `operations` by adding the difference between `median` and `a[i]` to its current value. Let's break down the impact:

- `t` remains `t - 2`.
- `_` remains a placeholder.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers from the new user input.
- `median_index` is `n // 2`.
- `median` is `a[n // 2]`.
- `i` is 1.
- `operations` is updated by adding `median - a[i]` to its current value.

If `a[i]` is less than `median`, `operations` was initially set to `median - a[i]`. Now, `operations` is incremented by `median - a[i]` again. If `a[i]` is not less than `median`, `operations` was initially 0, and now it is set to `median - a[i]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is `t - 2`, `_` is a placeholder, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the new user input, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `median` is `a[n // 2]`, `i` is 1, `operations` is `2 * (median - a[i])` if `a[i]` is less than `median`, otherwise `operations` is `median - a[i]`.**
