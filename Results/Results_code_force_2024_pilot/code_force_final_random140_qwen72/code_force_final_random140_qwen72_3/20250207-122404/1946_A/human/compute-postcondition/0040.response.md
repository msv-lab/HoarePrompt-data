The code snippet `n = int(input())` assigns a new value to `n` based on user input, which is converted to an integer. This new value of `n` replaces the previous value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 2`, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is a new input integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers from user input, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `median` is `a[n // 2]`, `i` is `n-1`.** 

Note: The value of `n` has been updated to the new input integer, but the other variables and their relationships remain the same as described in the initial state.
