Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order.
   - `p` is calculated as \((n + 1) // 2 - 1\).
   - `res` is the number of times the element at index `p` appears in the sublist `a[p:]`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `p` is the index of the middle element in the list `a` if `n` is odd, or the index just before the middle if `n` is even.
   - `a[p:]` is the sublist starting from the element at index `p` to the end of the list.
   - `res` counts how many times the element at index `p` appears in this sublist.

3. **Calculating `p`:**
   - If `n` is odd, \((n + 1) // 2\) is the middle index, so \((n + 1) // 2 - 1\) is the index just before the middle.
   - If `n` is even, \((n + 1) // 2\) is the index just after the middle, so \((n + 1) // 2 - 1\) is the middle index.

4. **Counting the Occurrences:**
   - The element at index `p` is the median of the list `a` if `n` is odd, or one of the two middle elements if `n` is even.
   - `res` will count how many times this element appears in the sublist starting from `p` to the end of the list.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The `print(res)` statement will print the number of times the element at index `p` appears in the sublist `a[p:]`.

Given the initial state and the calculations, the output will be the count of the element at index `p` in the sublist `a[p:]`.

Output: **res (where res is the number of times the element at index p appears in the sublist a[p:])**
