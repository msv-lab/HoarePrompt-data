Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers.** 

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `a`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
