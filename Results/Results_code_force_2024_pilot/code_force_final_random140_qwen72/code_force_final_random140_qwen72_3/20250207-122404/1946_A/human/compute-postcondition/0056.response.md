The code snippet `operations += median - a[i]` updates the value of `operations` by adding the difference between `median` and `a[i]` to its current value. Let's break down the impact:

- `t` is `t - 2`: This remains unchanged.
- `_` is a placeholder: This remains unchanged.
- `n` must be greater than 2: This remains unchanged.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers from the new user input: This remains unchanged.
- `median_index` is `n // 2`: This remains unchanged.
- `median` is `a[n // 2]`: This remains unchanged.
- `i` is 2: This remains unchanged.
- `operations` is initially set to `median - a[i]` if `a[i]` is less than `median`, otherwise it remains 0. The code snippet adds `median - a[i]` to `operations`.

Since `i` is 2, and `a` is a sorted list, `a[i]` is the third element in the list. If `a[i]` is less than `median`, the initial value of `operations` is `median - a[i]`. The code snippet then adds `median - a[i]` to `operations`, effectively doubling the initial value.

If `a[i]` is not less than `median`, `operations` remains 0, and the code snippet does not change its value.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is `t - 2`, `_` is a placeholder, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the new user input, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `median` is `a[n // 2]`, `i` is 2, `operations` is `2 * (median - a[i])` if `a[i]` is less than `median`, otherwise `operations` remains 0.**
