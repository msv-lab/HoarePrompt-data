Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is a new input integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers from user input, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `median` is `a[n // 2]`, `i` is `n-1`. For each element `a[j]` in the list `a` where `j` ranges from `0` to `n-1`, if `a[j]` is less than the median value, `operations` is incremented by `(median - a[j])`. Otherwise, `operations` remains unchanged.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `i` will have the value `n-1`, which is the last index of the list `a`. The variable `operations` will have been incremented by the difference between the median value and each element in the list `a` that is less than the median. If any element in the list `a` is greater than or equal to the median, it does not contribute to the increment of `operations`. All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `median_index`, `median`) remain unchanged from their initial values.
