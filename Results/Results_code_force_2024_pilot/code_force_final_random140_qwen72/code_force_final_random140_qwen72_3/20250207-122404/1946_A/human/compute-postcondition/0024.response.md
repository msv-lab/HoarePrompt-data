The function `func` does not explicitly define its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships described, the function is expected to process multiple test cases, each involving an integer `n` and an array `a` of integers. 

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, representing the length of the array `a`.
- The array `a` consists of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
- The sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

Given these constraints, the function is expected to return some result based on the processing of each test case. Since the specific output is not provided, I will assume the function processes the data and returns a result for each test case.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and an array `a` of `n` integers. It returns a result for each test case based on the processing of the array `a`.**
