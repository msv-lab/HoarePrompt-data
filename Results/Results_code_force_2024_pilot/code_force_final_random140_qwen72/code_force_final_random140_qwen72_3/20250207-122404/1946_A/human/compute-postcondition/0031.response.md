The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the range defined by `n`. The loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is a new input integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 (so it becomes 1), and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i` (which is 1).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is a new input integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers from user input, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `median` is `a[n // 2]`, `i` is 1, `operations` is incremented by `(median - a[0])` if `a[0]` is less than the median value, otherwise `operations` remains unchanged.**
