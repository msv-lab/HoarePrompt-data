Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem as described. The issue lies in how the solution calculates the result. The code counts the occurrences of the current median in the part of the array from the median position to the end. However, the goal is to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median, which involves more than just counting the occurrences of the current median.

To correctly solve the problem, the approach should involve:
1. Sorting the array.
2. Identifying the current median.
3. Determining the smallest value greater than the current median.
4. Calculating the minimum number of operations required to make the current median equal to this next higher value.

The provided solution does not perform these steps correctly, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is **False**.
