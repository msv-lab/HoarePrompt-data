You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of n integers.

The median of an array q_1, q_2, \ldots, q_k is the number p_{\lceil
\frac{k}{2} \rceil} , where p is the array q sorted in non-decreasing order.
For example, the median of the array [9, 5, 1, 2, 6] is 5 , as in the sorted
array [1, 2, 5, 6, 9] , the number at index \lceil \frac{5}{2} \rceil = 3 is 5
, and the median of the array [9, 2, 8, 3] is 3 , as in the sorted array [2,
3, 8, 9] , the number at index \lceil \frac{4}{2} \rceil = 2 is 3 .

You are allowed to choose an integer i (1 \le i \le n ) and increase a_i by 1
in one operation.

Your task is to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the
median of the array.

Note that the array a may not necessarily contain distinct numbers.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^5
) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of operations
required to increase the median of the array.

Note

In the first test case, you can apply one operation to the first number and
obtain the array [3, 2, 8] , the median of this array is 3 , as it is the
number at index \lceil \frac{3}{2} \rceil = 2 in the non-decreasing sorted
array [2, 3, 8] . The median of the original array [2, 2, 8] is 2 , as it is
the number at index \lceil \frac{3}{2} \rceil = 2 in the non-decreasing sorted
array [2, 2, 8] . Thus, the median increased (3 > 2 ) in just one operation.

In the fourth test case, you can apply one operation to each of the numbers at
indices 1, 2, 3 and obtain the array [6, 6, 6, 4, 5] , the median of this
array is 6 , as it is the number at index \lceil \frac{5}{2} \rceil = 3 in the
non-decreasing sorted array [4, 5, 6, 6, 6] . The median of the original array
[5, 5, 5, 4, 5] is 5 , as it is the number at index \lceil \frac{5}{2} \rceil
= 2 in the non-decreasing sorted array [4, 5, 5, 5, 5] . Thus, the median
increased (6 > 5 ) in three operations. It can be shown that this is the
minimum possible number of operations.

In the fifth test case, you can apply one operation to each of the numbers at
indices 1, 3 and obtain the array [3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 4] , the median of this
array is 3 , as it is the number at index \lceil \frac{6}{2} \rceil = 3 in the
non-decreasing sorted array [1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 4] . The median of the original
array [2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 4] is 2 , as it is the number at index \lceil
\frac{6}{2} \rceil = 3 in the non-decreasing sorted array [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4] .
Thus, the median increased (3 > 2 ) in two operations. It can be shown that
this is the minimum possible number of operations.

- Program:
def func():
    """Median of Array"""
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        a.sort()
        p = (n + 1) // 2 - 1
        res = a[p:].count(a[p])
        print(res)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. Each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by an array `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, the function sorts the array `a`, finds the median element (or the first median element if the array length is even), and counts how many times this median element appears in the second half of the sorted array. The function prints this count for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function terminates.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. An operation consists of increasing any element of the array by 1.

2. **Identifying the Median**: The median is defined as the middle element in the sorted array. For an array of length `n`, the median is the element at index `(n + 1) // 2 - 1` when the array is sorted.

3. **Algorithm Explanation**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a`.
   - It sorts the array `a`.
   - It calculates the index `p` of the median in the sorted array.
   - It counts the number of elements in the array from index `p` onwards that are equal to the median value `a[p]`.

4. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - The program correctly identifies the median by sorting the array and finding the middle element.
   - However, the program's logic for counting the number of operations needed to increase the median is flawed. The current implementation simply counts how many elements from the median position onwards are equal to the median. This does not necessarily give the minimum number of operations required to increase the median.

5. **Flaw in Logic**:
   - To increase the median, we need to ensure that the element at the median position is greater than its current value. The simplest way to do this is to increment the median element itself until it is greater than the next smallest element.
   - The program should instead calculate the difference between the median and the next smallest element and determine the minimum number of increments needed to make the median greater than this next smallest element.

Given the above analysis, the program's logic for determining the minimum number of operations is incorrect.
