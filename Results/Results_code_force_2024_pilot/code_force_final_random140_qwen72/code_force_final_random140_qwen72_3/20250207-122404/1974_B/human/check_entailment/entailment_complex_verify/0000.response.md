### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and the annotations to verify the correctness of the solution.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list `data`.
   - It then processes each test case by reading the length `n` and the encoded string `encoded`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - **Unique Characters and Sorting:**
     - `unique_chars = sorted(set(encoded))` creates a sorted list of unique characters in the encoded string.
     - `r = ''.join(unique_chars)` joins these unique characters into a string `r`.
   - **Character Mapping:**
     - `char_map = {char: r[-i - 1] for i, char in enumerate(r)}` creates a dictionary where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric counterpart in `r`.
   - **Decoding:**
     - `decoded = ''.join(char_map[char] for char in encoded)` constructs the decoded string by replacing each character in `encoded` with its corresponding character from `char_map`.

3. **Annotations and State:**
   - Before the function call, `encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters.
   - Inside `func_1`, `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters from `encoded`.
   - `r` is a string of these unique characters in sorted order.
   - `char_map` is a dictionary that maps each character in `r` to its symmetric counterpart.
   - The `decoded` string is constructed by replacing each character in `encoded` with its corresponding character from `char_map`.

4. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly identifies the unique characters in the encoded string and sorts them.
   - The mapping is created correctly, ensuring that the first character in `r` is mapped to the last, the second to the second last, and so on.
   - The decoding process accurately replaces each character in the encoded string with its corresponding character from the mapping.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Single Character String:**
     - If `encoded` is a single character, `r` will also be a single character, and the mapping will map that character to itself. The decoded string will be the same as the encoded string.
   - **Strings with Repeated Characters:**
     - The program handles repeated characters correctly by only considering unique characters in `r` and mapping them accordingly.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the decoding process as described in the problem statement. It handles all edge cases and produces the correct output for all potential inputs.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
