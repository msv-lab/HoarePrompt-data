The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `encoded`. `encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The function returns a string `decoded`, which is formed by replacing each character in the original string `encoded` with its corresponding character as mapped in `char_map`. The `char_map` dictionary maps each character in `r` (a string containing the characters in `unique_chars` joined together) to its corresponding character in reverse order of `r`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `encoded` and returns a new string `decoded` where each character in `encoded` is replaced by its corresponding character from a reversed mapping of `unique_chars`.**
