Output State: **The program returns the string `decoded`, which is formed by replacing each character in the original string `encoded` with its corresponding character as mapped in `char_map`. The `char_map` dictionary maps each character in `r` (which is a string containing the characters in `unique_chars` joined together) to its corresponding character in reverse order of `r`.**
