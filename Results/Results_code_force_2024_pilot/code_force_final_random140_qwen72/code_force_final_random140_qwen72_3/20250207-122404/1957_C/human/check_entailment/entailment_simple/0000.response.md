### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Initial Setup:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of initial moves `k`.

2. **Processing Initial Moves:**
   - The program iterates through the `k` moves and updates the size of the remaining available positions `n` based on whether the move is mirrored or not.
   - If the move is not on the diagonal (`a != b`), it reduces `n` by 2 because both the player's move and the computer's mirrored move occupy two positions.
   - If the move is on the diagonal (`a == b`), it reduces `n` by 1 because only one position is occupied.

3. **Final Configuration Calculation:**
   - The program calls `func_1(n)` to compute the number of possible final configurations.
   - `func_1` initializes an empty dictionary `dp` and calls the `helper` function with the updated `n`.

4. **Helper Function:**
   - The `helper` function uses dynamic programming to compute the number of ways to place rooks on the remaining positions.
   - It handles the base case where `len` is 0 or less, returning 1.
   - It checks if the result for `len` is already computed and stored in `dp` to avoid redundant calculations.
   - It recursively computes the number of ways to place rooks by considering two cases:
     - Placing a rook in a way that doesn't affect the remaining positions (`x1`).
     - Placing a rook in a way that affects the remaining positions (`x2`).

5. **Modulo Operation:**
   - The problem requires the result to be printed modulo \(10^9 + 7\). However, the provided code does not explicitly perform this operation. This is a critical oversight that would lead to incorrect results for large values.

### Conclusion:
The program is mostly correct in terms of logic and structure, but it lacks the necessary modulo operation to handle large results as required by the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
