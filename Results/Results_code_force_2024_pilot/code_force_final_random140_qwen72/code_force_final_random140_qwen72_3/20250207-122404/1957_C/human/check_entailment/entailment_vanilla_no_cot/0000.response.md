Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fully address the problem statement. The functions `func_1` and `helper` seem to be part of a solution for calculating permutations or combinations, possibly related to the placement of rooks on a chessboard. However, the program lacks several critical components:

1. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The program does not read input for multiple test cases or process them individually.
2. **Processing Initial Moves**: The program does not account for the initial moves that have already been made on the board.
3. **Modulo Operation**: The problem requires the result to be printed modulo \(10^9 + 7\), but the program does not include this operation.
4. **Final Configuration Calculation**: The program does not calculate the number of different final configurations based on the rules provided in the problem statement.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- Read the number of test cases.
- For each test case, read the board size \(n\) and the number of initial moves \(k\).
- Process the initial moves and their mirrored counterparts.
- Calculate the number of different final configurations using dynamic programming or combinatorial methods.
- Ensure the result is modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Here is a more complete approach to solving the problem:

```python
MOD = 10**9 + 7

def count_configurations(n, moves):
    rows = set()
    cols = set()
    for r, c in moves:
        rows.add(r)
        cols.add(c)
    
    # Calculate the number of free rows and columns
    free_rows = n - len(rows)
    free_cols = n - len(cols)
    
    # Calculate the number of free positions
    free_positions = free_rows * free_cols
    
    # Use dynamic programming to count the number of ways to place rooks
    dp = [0] * (free_positions + 1)
    dp[0] = 1
    for i in range(1, free_positions + 1):
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]
        dp[i] %= MOD
    
    return dp[free_positions]

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        k = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        moves = [(int(data[index + 2 * i]), int(data[index + 2 * i + 1])) for i in range(k)]
        index += 2 * k
        result = count_configurations(n, moves)
        results.append(result)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This program reads the input, processes the initial moves, and calculates the number of different final configurations using dynamic programming, ensuring the result is modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
