Output State: **`len` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `len` is not in `dp`, `x1` is the return value of `helper(len - 1)`, `x2` is 2 * (len - 1) * the return value of `helper(len - 2)`**. 

Explanation: The value of `x2` is calculated as `2 * (len - 1) * helper(len - 2)`. The other variables (`len`, `dp`, and `x1`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
