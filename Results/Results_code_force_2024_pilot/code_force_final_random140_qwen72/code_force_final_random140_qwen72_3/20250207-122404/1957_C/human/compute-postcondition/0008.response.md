Output State: **`len` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `len` is not in `dp`, `x1` is the return value of `helper(len - 1)`, `x2` is 2 * (len - 1) * the return value of `helper(len - 2)`, `y` is `x1` + `x2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `y` is calculated as the sum of `x1` and `x2`.
- `x1` is the return value of `helper(len - 1)`.
- `x2` is 2 * (len - 1) * the return value of `helper(len - 2)`.
- All other conditions from the initial state remain unchanged.
