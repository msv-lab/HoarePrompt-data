You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: len is a non-negative integer representing the length of a sequence or a dimension in the context of the problem.
def helper(len):
    if (len <= 0) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1.
    #State: *len is a non-negative integer representing the length of a sequence or a dimension in the context of the problem, and len is greater than 0
    if (len in dp) :
        return dp[len]
        #The program returns the value associated with the key `len` in the dictionary `dp`. Since `len` is a non-negative integer greater than 0 and is a key in `dp`, the returned value is the specific value stored in `dp` for the key `len`.
    #State: *`len` is a non-negative integer representing the length of a sequence or a dimension in the context of the problem, and `len` is greater than 0, and `len` is not in `dp`
    x1 = helper(len - 1)
    x2 = 2 * (len - 1) * helper(len - 2)
    y = x1 + x2
    dp[len] = y
    return y
    #The program returns the value of `y`, which is the sum of `x1` and `x2`. Here, `x1` is the return value of `helper(len - 1)`, and `x2` is 2 times `(len - 1)` times the return value of `helper(len - 2)`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a non-negative integer `len` and returns 1 if `len` is 0. If `len` is a positive integer and a key in the dictionary `dp`, it returns the value associated with `len` in `dp`. Otherwise, it returns the sum of the result of `helper(len - 1)` and 2 times `(len - 1)` times the result of `helper(len - 2)`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 1.

Case_2: The program returns the value associated with the key `len` in the dictionary `dp`. Since `len` is a non-negative integer greater than 0 and is a key in `dp`, the returned value is the specific value stored in `dp` for the key `len`.

Case_3: The program returns the value of `y`, which is the sum of `x1` and `x2`. Here, `x1` is the return value of `helper(len - 1)`, and `x2` is 2 times `(len - 1)` times the return value of `helper(len - 2)`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
