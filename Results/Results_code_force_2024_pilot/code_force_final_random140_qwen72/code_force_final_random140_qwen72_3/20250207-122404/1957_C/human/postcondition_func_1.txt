The `helper` function takes a non-negative integer `len` as input and returns an integer value. If `len` is 0, the function returns 1. If `len` is a positive integer and exists as a key in the dictionary `dp`, the function returns the value associated with `len` in `dp`. If `len` is a positive integer and not in `dp`, the function computes a new value `y` as the sum of the results of `helper(len - 1)` and `2 * (len - 1) * helper(len - 2)`, stores this value in `dp` with the key `len`, and then returns `y`. The function effectively memoizes intermediate results to optimize recursive calls.
