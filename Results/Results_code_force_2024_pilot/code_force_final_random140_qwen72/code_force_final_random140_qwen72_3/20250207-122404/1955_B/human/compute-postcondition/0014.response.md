Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6, `l` is a list of n^2 integers where each integer b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, and `l` is sorted in non-decreasing order. The difference between the last element and the first element of `l` is equal to (n - 1) * (c + d). `a` is equal to the sum of the first and last elements of `l`. `r` is equal to n^2 // 2. If `n` is odd, `l[r]` is equal to `a // 2`. `k` is 0. Additionally, `l[k]` is equal to `l[-1 - k]`.**
