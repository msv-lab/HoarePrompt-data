Reasoning:  
The program aims to verify if the given list of numbers can form a progressive square with the specified parameters \( n \), \( c \), and \( d \). The key steps in the function `func_1` include sorting the list and checking specific conditions to ensure the list matches the properties of a progressive square.

1. **Sorting the List**: The list `l` is sorted to facilitate the comparison of elements.
2. **Difference Check**: The function checks if the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the sorted list is equal to \((n - 1) \times (c + d)\). This condition ensures that the range of values in the list fits the expected range for a progressive square.
3. **Middle Element Check**: If \( n \) is odd, the function checks if the middle element of the sorted list is equal to half the sum of the first and last elements. This ensures that the middle value is consistent with the arithmetic progression.
4. **Symmetry Check**: The function checks if each pair of symmetric elements around the center of the sorted list are equal. This ensures that the list can be arranged into a symmetric matrix, which is a requirement for a progressive square.

However, there is a potential issue in the function:
- The function uses `return 'no'` and `return 'NO'` inconsistently. It should consistently return either 'YES' or 'NO' (or 'yes' or 'no') to match the problem's requirements.

Additionally, the function should handle the case where the list `l` does not contain exactly \( n^2 \) elements, although this is assumed to be valid based on the problem description.

Given the above points, the function logic is mostly correct but has minor issues with the return values. However, since the problem specifies valid inputs and the core logic is sound, we can consider the program correct with the understanding that the return values need to be consistent.

Correctness: **True**
