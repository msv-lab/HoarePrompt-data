Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution has a few issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described:

1. The function `func_1` checks if the difference between the largest and smallest elements in the sorted list `l` is equal to `(n - 1) * (c + d)`. This check is correct for ensuring that the range of values fits the pattern of the progressive square.

2. However, the function incorrectly assumes that the middle element (if `n` is odd) should be equal to half the sum of the smallest and largest elements (`a // 2`). This is not necessarily true for all valid progressive squares. The middle element should be the value at the center of the matrix, which is calculated differently.

3. The function also checks if the elements are symmetric around the middle (i.e., `l[k] == l[-1 - k]`). This is a good check for symmetry, but it doesn't fully validate the progressive square because it doesn't ensure that the elements follow the specific pattern defined by `c` and `d`.

4. The function returns `'no'` and `'NO'` inconsistently. It should return `'NO'` consistently for negative cases.

To fix these issues, the function needs to correctly reconstruct the progressive square and compare it with the sorted list of elements. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, c, d, l):
    l.sort()
    
    # Calculate the initial value a11
    a11 = l[0]
    
    # Generate the expected progressive square
    expected = []
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            expected.append(a11 + i * c + j * d)
    
    # Check if the sorted expected values match the sorted input values
    return 'YES' if expected == l else 'NO'

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, c, d) = map(int, input().split())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, c, d, l))
```

This version correctly generates the expected values for the progressive square and compares them with the sorted input list to determine if they match. If they do, it returns `'YES'`; otherwise, it returns `'NO'`.
