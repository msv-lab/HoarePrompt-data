The code snippet `p, q, r = map(int, line.split())` reads the next line from the file, splits it into three parts, and assigns these parts to `p`, `q`, and `r` as integers.

- `p` is now assigned the first integer from the split line.
- `q` is now assigned the second integer from the split line.
- `r` is now assigned the third integer from the split line.

The previous values of `p`, `q`, and `r` are overwritten, and the new values are taken from the line read from the file. The variable `line` is no longer needed as it has been used to update `p`, `q`, and `r`.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9, `p` is the first integer from the line, `q` is the second integer from the line, `r` is the third integer from the line, `line` is the next line in the file (now consumed).**
