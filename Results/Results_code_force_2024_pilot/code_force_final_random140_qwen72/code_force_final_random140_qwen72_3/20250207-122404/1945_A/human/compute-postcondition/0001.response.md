The code reads a line from the file opened by `open(0)`, splits the line into three parts, and assigns these parts to the variables `p`, `q`, and `r` after converting them to integers.

Given the initial state:
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9.
- The file opened by `open(0)` must have at least two lines.

After executing the code:
- The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.
- `p`, `q`, and `r` are now integers derived from the first line of the file.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9, `p`, `q`, and `r` are integers read from the first line of the file.**
