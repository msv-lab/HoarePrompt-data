Functionality: ** The function reads from standard input (or a file), ignoring the first line, and processes each subsequent line. Each line is expected to contain three integers `p`, `q`, and `r`. The function updates `q` by adding `r` to it, then prints a value based on the condition `r < q % 3`. If `r` is less than `q % 3`, it prints `-1`; otherwise, it prints `p - q // 3`. The function does not modify the input parameters `a`, `b`, and `c`, and it does not return any value. The final state of the program is that all lines in the input have been processed, and the appropriate values have been printed for each line. **
