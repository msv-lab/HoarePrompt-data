Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: a, b, and c are non-negative integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9, representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively.
Code of the loop:
for line in [*open(0)][1:]:
    p, q, r = map(int, line.split())
    q += r
    print((p - q // 3, -1)[r < q % 3])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a`, `b`, and `c` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9, `p` is an integer read from the first line of the file, `q` is now `q + r`, `r` is an integer read from the first line of the file.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a`, `b`, and `c` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9, `p` is the first integer from the line, `q` is the sum of the second and third integers from the line, `r` is the third integer from the line, `line` is the next line in the file (now consumed).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a`, `b`, and `c` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9, `p` is the first integer from the new line, `q` is the sum of the second and third integers from the new line plus the third integer from the new line, `r` is the third integer from the new line, `line` is the next (unconsumed) line in the file.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
