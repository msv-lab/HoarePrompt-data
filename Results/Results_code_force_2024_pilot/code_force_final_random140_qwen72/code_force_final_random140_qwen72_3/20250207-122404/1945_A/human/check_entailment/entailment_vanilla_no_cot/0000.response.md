Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution has a few issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Handling of Universals**: The solution adds all universals (`r`) to the extroverts (`q`). However, this does not correctly account for the fact that universals can be used to fill in the gaps where extroverts need to be paired with others. The solution should carefully consider how many universals are needed to satisfy the extroverts' requirements.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Tents**: The solution calculates the number of tents as `p - q // 3`, which is incorrect. The number of tents should be calculated based on the number of introverts, extroverts, and the remaining universals after satisfying the extroverts' needs.

3. **Edge Cases**: The solution does not handle edge cases correctly, such as when there are not enough universals to satisfy the extroverts' requirements.

A correct approach would involve:
- Ensuring that each introvert gets a tent.
- Checking if there are enough universals to pair with extroverts to form groups of 3.
- Calculating the total number of tents required based on the above conditions.

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(t):
        a = int(data[index])
        b = int(data[index + 1])
        c = int(data[index + 2])
        index += 3
        
        # Introverts need individual tents
        tents = a
        
        # Extroverts need to be in groups of 3
        if b * 3 > c + a:
            results.append(-1)
            continue
        
        # Use universals to fill in the gaps for extroverts
        b_tents = b
        c -= min(b * 2, c)
        
        # Remaining universals can be used to form groups of 3
        if c > 0:
            additional_tents = (c + 2) // 3
            tents += additional_tents
        
        results.append(tents + b_tents)
    
    print('\n'.join(map(str, results)))

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that:
- Each introvert gets a tent.
- Extroverts are paired with universals to form groups of 3.
- The total number of tents is calculated correctly.
- Edge cases where it's impossible to satisfy the extroverts' requirements are handled.
