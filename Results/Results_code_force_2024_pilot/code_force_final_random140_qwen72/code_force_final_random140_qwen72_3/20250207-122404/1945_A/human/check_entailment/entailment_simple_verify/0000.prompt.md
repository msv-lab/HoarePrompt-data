You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The organizing committee plans to take the participants of the Olympiad on a
hike after the tour. Currently, the number of tents needed to be taken is
being calculated. It is known that each tent can accommodate up to 3 people.

Among the participants, there are a introverts, b extroverts, and c
universals:

  * Each introvert wants to live in a tent alone. Thus, a tent with an introvert must contain exactly one person — only the introvert himself. 
  * Each extrovert wants to live in a tent with two others. Thus, the tent with an extrovert must contain exactly three people. 
  * Each universal is fine with any option (living alone, with one other person, or with two others). 

The organizing committee respects the wishes of each participant very much, so
they want to fulfill all of them.

Tell us the minimum number of tents needed to be taken so that all
participants can be accommodated according to their preferences. If it is
impossible to accommodate the participants in a way that fulfills all the
wishes, output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case is described by a single line containing three integers a , b ,
c (0 \le a, b, c \le 10^9 ) — the number of introverts, extroverts, and
universals, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of tents, or
-1 if it is impossible to accommodate the participants.

Note

In the first test case, 1 tent will be given to the introverts, 1 tent will be
shared by two extroverts and one universal, and the last tent will be shared
by two universals. In total, 3 tents are needed.

In the second test case, three extroverts will take 1 tent, and 1 tent will be
taken by an introvert. Then, one extrovert and one universal will be left.
This extrovert will not be able to live with two others.

- Program: 
def func():
    for line in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (p, q, r) = map(int, line.split())
        q += r
        print((p - q // 3, -1)[r < q % 3])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a, b, and c are non-negative integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9, representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively.
def func():
    for line in [*open(0)][1:]:
        p, q, r = map(int, line.split())
        
        q += r
        
        print((p - q // 3, -1)[r < q % 3])
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain non-negative integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9. The variable `q` is the sum of all third integers (`r`) from each line in the file, and the loop has processed all lines in the file except the first one. For each line, the expression `(p - q // 3, -1)[r < q % 3]` has been printed, where `p` is the first integer, `q` is the updated sum of the second and third integers, and `r` is the third integer from the current line.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program has a logical flaw in how it calculates the number of tents required. Specifically, the line `q += r` incorrectly adds all universals to the extroverts, which is not always the correct approach. Universals can be used to fill in different configurations of tents, but simply adding them to the extroverts does not account for all possible valid configurations.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
1 2 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Actual Output:**
```
-1
```

**Explanation:**
- There is 1 introvert, 2 extroverts, and 1 universal.
- The introvert needs 1 tent.
- The 2 extroverts need 1 tent together.
- The universal can either join the extroverts' tent or take a separate tent.
- Therefore, the minimum number of tents required is 3 (1 for the introvert, 1 for the extroverts, and 1 for the universal).

However, the program outputs `-1`, indicating that it incorrectly determines that it is impossible to accommodate the participants according to their preferences. This is a clear case where the program does not work as expected.
