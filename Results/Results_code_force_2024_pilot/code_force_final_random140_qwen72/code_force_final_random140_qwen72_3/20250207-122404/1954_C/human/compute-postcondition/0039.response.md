Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is 0, `a` is an input string with at least 3 characters, `b` is an input string, `i` is 2, `vt` is either 0 or 1 depending on the previous iteration's outcome, `kq1` is the character at index 2 of `a`, `kq2` is the character at index 2 of `a` concatenated with the character at index 2 of `a`. We continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
