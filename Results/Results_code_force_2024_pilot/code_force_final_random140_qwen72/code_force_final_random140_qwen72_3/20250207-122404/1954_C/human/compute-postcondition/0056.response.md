Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is 1, `a` is an input string with at least `len(a)` characters, `b` is an input string with at least `len(a)` characters, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `kq1` is an empty string, `kq2` is an empty string, and `vt` is either 0 or 1 depending on the last comparison made in the loop.**
