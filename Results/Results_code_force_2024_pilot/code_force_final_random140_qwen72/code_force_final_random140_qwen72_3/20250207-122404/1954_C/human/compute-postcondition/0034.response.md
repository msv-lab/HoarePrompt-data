Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is 0, `a` is an input string with at least 2 characters, `b` is an input string, `i` is 1, and `vt` is either 0 or 1 depending on the previous iteration's outcome. If `a[i] == b[i]`, `kq1` and `kq2` are each updated by concatenating `a[1]` to their current values, and the loop continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[1])` and `int(b[1])`, and `y` is the maximum of `int(a[1])` and `int(b[1])`. If `vt` is 0, `kq1` is updated by concatenating the string representation of `x`, and `kq2` is updated by concatenating the string representation of `y`, and `vt` is set to 1. If `vt` is 1, `kq1` is updated by concatenating the string representation of `y`, and `kq2` is updated by concatenating the string representation of `x`, and `vt` remains unchanged.***
