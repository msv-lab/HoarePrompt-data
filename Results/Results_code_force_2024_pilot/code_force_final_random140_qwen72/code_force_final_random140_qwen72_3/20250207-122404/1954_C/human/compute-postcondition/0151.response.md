The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it is clear that the function should accept three parameters: `t`, `x`, and `y`. Here, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `x` and `y` are integers where 1 <= x, y < 10^100, and both `x` and `y` consist only of digits from 1 to 9.

Since the output is not specified, we can infer that the function likely processes these inputs and returns some result based on the given constraints. However, without more specific information about the output, we can only describe the input parameters and the general structure of the expected output.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `x`, and `y`. `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, inclusive, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, `x` and `y` are integers between 1 and 10^100, consisting only of digits from 1 to 9. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case.**
