Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is 0, `a` is an input string that must have at least 1 character, `b` is an input string, `kq1` is now the first character of `a`, `kq2` is now the first character of `a`, `vt` is 0, `i` is 0, and the first character of `a` is equal to the first character of `b`. We continue to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement outside the loop.**
