Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is 1, `a` is an input string with at least 3 characters, `b` is an input string with at least `len(a)` characters, `i` is 2, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`. If `vt` is 0, `kq1` is '1' concatenated with the string representation of `x`, `kq2` is '1' concatenated with the string representation of `y`, and `vt` is set to 1. Otherwise, `kq1` is the original value of `kq1` concatenated with the string representation of `y`, `kq2` is the original value of `kq2` concatenated with the string representation of `x`, and `vt` remains unchanged.***
