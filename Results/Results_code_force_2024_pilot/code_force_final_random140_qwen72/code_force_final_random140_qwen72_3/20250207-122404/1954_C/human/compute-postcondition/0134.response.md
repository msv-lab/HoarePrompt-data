Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is 2, `a` is an input string with at least 1 character, `b` is a new input string, `i` is 1. If the characters at index `i` in `a` and `b` are equal, `kq1` and `kq2` are both set to the concatenation of their previous values and the character at index `i` in `a`, and `vt` is 0 or 1 depending on the initial conditions. If the characters at index `i` in `a` and `b` are not equal, `x` is the minimum of the integer values of the characters at index `i` in `a` and `b`, and `y` is the maximum of these integer values. If the first characters of `a` and `b` are equal, `kq1` and `kq2` are both set to the first character of `a`, and `vt` is 0. If `vt` is 0, `kq1` is set to the string representation of `y` followed by the string representation of `x`, `kq2` is set to the string representation of `x` followed by the string representation of `y`, and `vt` is set to 1. If `vt` is non-zero, `kq1` is updated to its previous value concatenated with the string representation of `y`, `kq2` is updated to its previous value concatenated with the string representation of `x`, and `vt` remains 1.***
