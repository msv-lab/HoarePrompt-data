Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is 1, `a` is an input string with at least 1 character, `b` is an input string with at least `len(a)` characters, `i` is 0, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[0])` and `int(b[0])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[0])` and `int(b[0])`. If `vt` is 0, `kq1` is a string containing the minimum of `int(a[0])` and `int(b[0])`, and `kq2` is a string containing the maximum of `int(a[0])` and `int(b[0])`, and `vt` is updated to 1. If `vt` is not 0, `kq1` is the string representation of `y`, and `kq2` is the string representation of `x`.***
