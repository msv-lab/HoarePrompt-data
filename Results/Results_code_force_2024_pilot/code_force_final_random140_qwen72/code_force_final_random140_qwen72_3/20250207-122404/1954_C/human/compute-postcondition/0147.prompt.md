Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is 2, `a` is an input string with at least `len(a)` characters, `b` is a new input string, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `kq1` is an empty string, `kq2` is an empty string, `vt` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        kq1 = kq1 + a[i]
        kq2 = kq2 + a[i]
        continue
    else:
        x, y = min(int(a[i]), int(b[i])), max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))
        if vt == 0:
            vt = 1
            kq1 = kq1 + str(x)
            kq2 = kq2 + str(y)
        else:
            kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
            kq2 = kq2 + str(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is 2, `a` is an input string with at least 1 character, `b` is a new input string, `i` is 0. If the first characters of `a` and `b` are equal, `kq1` and `kq2` are both set to the first character of `a`, and `vt` is 0. Otherwise, `x` is the minimum of the integer values of the first characters of `a` and `b`, and `y` is the maximum of these integer values. If `vt` is 0, `kq1` is set to the string representation of `x`, `kq2` is set to the string representation of `y`, and `vt` is set to 1. If `vt` is non-zero, `kq1` is set to the string representation of `y`, and `kq2` is set to the string representation of `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is 2, `a` is an input string with at least 1 character, `b` is a new input string, `i` is 1. If the characters at index `i` in `a` and `b` are equal, `kq1` and `kq2` are both set to the concatenation of their previous values and the character at index `i` in `a`, and `vt` is 0 or 1 depending on the initial conditions. If the characters at index `i` in `a` and `b` are not equal, `x` is the minimum of the integer values of the characters at index `i` in `a` and `b`, and `y` is the maximum of these integer values. If the first characters of `a` and `b` are equal, `kq1` and `kq2` are both set to the first character of `a`, and `vt` is 0. If `vt` is 0, `kq1` is set to the string representation of `y` followed by the string representation of `x`, `kq2` is set to the string representation of `x` followed by the string representation of `y`, and `vt` is set to 1. If `vt` is non-zero, `kq1` is updated to its previous value concatenated with the string representation of `y`, `kq2` is updated to its previous value concatenated with the string representation of `x`, and `vt` remains 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is 2, `a` is an input string with at least 2 characters, `b` is a new input string, `i` is 2, and `vt` is 0 or 1 depending on the initial conditions. If `a[2]` equals `b[2]`, `kq1` and `kq2` are each updated to include `a[2]`. If `a[2]` does not equal `b[2]`, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`, and `y` is the maximum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`. If `vt` is 0, `kq1` is updated to the string representation of `x`, and `kq2` is updated to the original value of `kq2` plus the string representation of `y`, and `vt` is updated to 1. If `vt` is 1, `kq1` is updated to `kq1` plus the string representation of `y`, and `kq2` is updated to `kq2` plus the string representation of `x`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
