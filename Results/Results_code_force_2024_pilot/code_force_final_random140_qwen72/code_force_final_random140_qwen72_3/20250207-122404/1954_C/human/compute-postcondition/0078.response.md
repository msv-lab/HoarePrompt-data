Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is 1, `a` is an input string with at least 2 characters, `b` is an input string with at least `len(a)` characters, `i` is 1, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[1])` and `int(b[1])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[1])` and `int(b[1])`. If the first character of `a` is equal to the first character of `b`, then `kq1` and `kq2` are both set to the first character of `a`, and `vt` remains 0. Otherwise, if `vt` is 0, `kq1` is set to the string representation of `x`, and `kq2` is set to the string representation of `y`, and `vt` is updated to 1. If `vt` is not 0, `kq1` is set to the string representation of `y`, and `kq2` is set to the string representation of `x`.**
