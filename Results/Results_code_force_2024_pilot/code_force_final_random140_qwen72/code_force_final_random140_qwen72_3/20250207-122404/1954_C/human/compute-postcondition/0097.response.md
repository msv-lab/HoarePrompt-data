Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is 1, `a` is an input string with at least 3 characters, `b` is an input string with at least `len(a)` characters, and `i` is 2. If `a[2] == b[2]`, `kq1` is updated to `kq1 + a[2]`, `kq2` is updated to `kq2 + a[2]`, and `vt` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`. If `vt` is 0, `kq1` is set to '1' concatenated with the string representation of `x`, `kq2` is set to '1' concatenated with the string representation of `y`, and `vt` is set to 1. If `vt` is not 0, `kq1` is updated to the original value of `kq1` concatenated with the string representation of `y`, `kq2` is updated to the original value of `kq2` concatenated with the string representation of `x`, and `vt` remains unchanged.***
