Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is 2, `a` is an input string with at least 1 character, `b` is a new input string, `i` is 1, `x` is the minimum of the integer values of the characters at index `i` in `a` and `b`, `y` is the maximum of the integer values of the characters at index `i` in `a` and `b`, `kq1` is the string representation of `y` followed by the string representation of `x`, `kq2` is the string representation of `x` followed by the string representation of `y`, `vt` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `kq2` is updated by appending the string representation of `y` to its current value.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
