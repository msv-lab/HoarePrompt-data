Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is 1, `a` is an input string with at least 2 characters, `b` is an input string with at least `len(a)` characters, `i` is 1, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[1])` and `int(b[1])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[1])` and `int(b[1])`, `kq1` is the first character of `a` concatenated with the string representation of `x` if the first character of `a` is equal to the first character of `b`, otherwise `kq1` is the string representation of `x` concatenated with itself, `kq2` is the first character of `a` if the first character of `a` is equal to the first character of `b`, otherwise `kq2` is the string representation of `y`, and `vt` is 1.**
