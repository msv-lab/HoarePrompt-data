Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is 0, `a` is an input string with at least 3 characters, `b` is an input string, `i` is 2, and `vt` is either 0 or 1 depending on the previous iteration's outcome. If `a[2]` equals `b[2]`, `kq1` is the character at index 2 of `a`, and `kq2` is the character at index 2 of `a` concatenated with itself. If `a[2]` does not equal `b[2]`, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`, and `y` is the maximum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`. If `vt` is 0, `vt` is updated to 1, `kq1` is the string representation of `x`, and `kq2` is the string representation of `y`. Otherwise, `kq1` is the string representation of `y`, and `kq2` is the concatenation of its previous value and the string representation of `x`.***
