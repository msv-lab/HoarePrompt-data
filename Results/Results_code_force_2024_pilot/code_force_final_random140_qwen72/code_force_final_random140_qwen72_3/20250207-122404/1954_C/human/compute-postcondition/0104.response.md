Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is 2, `a` is an input string with at least `len(a)` characters, `b` is a new input string, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `kq1` is an empty string, `kq2` is a string where each character is either the corresponding character from `a` if it matches the corresponding character in `b`, or the maximum of the corresponding characters from `a` and `b` based on the alternating pattern determined by `vt`, and `vt` is 0 or 1 depending on whether the alternating pattern has been triggered during the loop.**
