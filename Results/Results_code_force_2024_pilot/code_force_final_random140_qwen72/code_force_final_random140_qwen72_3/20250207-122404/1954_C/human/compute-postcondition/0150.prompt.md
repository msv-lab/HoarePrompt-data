Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, x and y are integers for each test case where 1 <= x, y < 10^100, and x and y consist only of digits from 1 to 9.
Code of the loop:
for q in range(t):
    a = input()
    b = input()
    kq1 = ''
    kq2 = ''
    vt = 0
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if a[i] == b[i]:
            kq1 = kq1 + a[i]
            kq2 = kq2 + a[i]
            continue
        else:
            x, y = min(int(a[i]), int(b[i])), max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))
            if vt == 0:
                vt = 1
                kq1 = kq1 + str(x)
                kq2 = kq2 + str(y)
            else:
                kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
                kq2 = kq2 + str(x)
    print(kq1)
    print(kq2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is 0, `a` is an input string with at least `len(a)` characters, `b` is an input string with at least `len(a)` characters, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `kq1` is a string formed by concatenating the characters from `a` and `b` based on the rules specified in the loop, `kq2` is a string formed similarly but with the opposite choices for differing characters, and `vt` is either 0 or 1 depending on the last comparison made in the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is 1, `a` is an input string with at least `len(a)` characters, `b` is an input string with at least `len(a)` characters, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `kq1` is a string where each character is either the corresponding character from `a` if it matches the corresponding character in `b`, or the minimum of the corresponding characters from `a` and `b` based on the alternating pattern determined by `vt`, `kq2` is a string where each character is either the corresponding character from `a` if it matches the corresponding character in `b`, or the maximum of the corresponding characters from `a` and `b` based on the alternating pattern determined by `vt`, and `vt` is 0 or 1 depending on whether the alternating pattern has been triggered during the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is 2, `a` is an input string with at least `len(a)` characters, `b` is a new input string, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `kq1` is a string that contains the minimum character between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for each `i` where `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, alternating based on the value of `vt`, and the same character as `a[i]` when `a[i]` equals `b[i]`. `kq2` is a string that contains the maximum character between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for each `i` where `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, alternating based on the value of `vt`, and the same character as `a[i]` when `a[i]` equals `b[i]`. `vt` is 0 or 1 depending on the initial conditions and the alternation pattern during the loop execution.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
