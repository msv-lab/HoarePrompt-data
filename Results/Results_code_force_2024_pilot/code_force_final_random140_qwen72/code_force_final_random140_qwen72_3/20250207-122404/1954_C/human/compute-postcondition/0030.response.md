Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is 0, `a` is an input string with at least 2 characters, `b` is an input string, `i` is 1, `kq1` is updated to its original value concatenated with the string representation of `x`, `kq2` is updated to its original value concatenated with the string representation of `y`, `vt` is 1, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[1])` and `int(b[1])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[1])` and `int(b[1])`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `kq2` is updated by concatenating the string representation of `y` to its original value.
- All other variables (`t`, `q`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `kq1`, `vt`, `x`, `y`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
