Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program has a logical flaw in how it checks the conditions for the robot's movement. Specifically, the program only checks certain positions and their adjacent cells, but it does not fully simulate the robot's movement according to the rules described in the problem statement.

Here is a counterexample where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
4
><><
><><
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Actual Output:**
```
NO
```

In this case, the robot can indeed reach the cell (2, 4) by following the path:
- Start at (1, 1)
- Move right to (1, 2)
- Follow the arrow to (2, 2)
- Move right to (2, 3)
- Follow the arrow to (1, 3)
- Move right to (1, 4)
- Follow the arrow to (2, 4)

However, the program incorrectly prints "NO" because it does not correctly simulate the robot's movements and only checks specific conditions that do not cover all possible scenarios. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
