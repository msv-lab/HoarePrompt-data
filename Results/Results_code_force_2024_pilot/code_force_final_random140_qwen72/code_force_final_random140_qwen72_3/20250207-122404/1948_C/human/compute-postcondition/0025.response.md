Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `j` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a new input string, `b` is a new input string, `i` is 1, and either (i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<') or (a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'). We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
