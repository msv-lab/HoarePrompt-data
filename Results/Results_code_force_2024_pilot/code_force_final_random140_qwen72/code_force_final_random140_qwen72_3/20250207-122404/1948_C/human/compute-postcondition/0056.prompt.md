You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an even integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, representing the number of columns in the grid. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5. Each test case includes two strings of length n, consisting only of the characters '<' and '>', representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid, respectively.
def func():
    for j in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
                print('NO')
                break
        else:
            print('YES')
        
    #State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `j` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, and `i` is the largest odd integer less than `n`. The loop has completed all iterations without breaking, so the final output is 'YES' for each test case that did not encounter the break condition.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases. Each test case consists of an even integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) and two strings of length `n` containing only the characters '<' and '>'. The function returns a list of results, one for each test case, indicating whether the arrows in the two strings can form a valid grid configuration.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
