The only objects in the loop head are variables `i`, `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1 because the loop starts from 1 and increments by 2. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 3 (since the loop starts at 1 and increments by 2, the next value would be 3).

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `n` is at least 3, and `i` is 1.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `j` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, `i` is 1**
