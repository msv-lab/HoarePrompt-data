To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `j` and the result of `int(input())`.

1. **Variable `j`:** This variable is the loop iterator and is initialized to 0 by the `range` function.
2. **Result of `int(input())`:** This represents the number of iterations the loop will perform. For the loop to execute, this value must be greater than 0.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` is an even integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, representing the number of columns in the grid.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
- Each test case includes two strings of length `n`, consisting only of the characters '<' and '>', representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid.

We need to adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute:

- `j` should be 0 (the initial value for the loop iterator).
- The result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0 to ensure the loop runs at least once.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `j` is 0, and the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0**.
