Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `j` is 0, `n` is a new input integer greater than 1, `b` is a new input string, `i` is the largest odd integer less than `n` plus 4, and `a` is a new input string. If `i + 1 < n` and either `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing the next statement.***
