Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an even integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, representing the number of columns in the grid. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5. Each test case includes two strings of length n, consisting only of the characters '<' and '>', representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid, respectively.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    for i in range(1, n, 2):
        if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
            print('NO')
            break
    else:
        print('YES')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `j` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, `i` is the largest odd integer less than `n`. If the loop did not break early due to the condition `(i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<') or (a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<')`, then the program prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO' and exits the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `j` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a new input string, `b` is a new input string, and `i` is the largest odd integer less than `n`. The loop has completed all its iterations without breaking, and the final output is 'YES'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `j` is 0, `n` is a new input integer greater than 0, `b` is a new input string, `i` is the largest odd integer less than `n`, `a` is a new input string. The loop has completed all iterations without breaking, so the final output is 'YES'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
