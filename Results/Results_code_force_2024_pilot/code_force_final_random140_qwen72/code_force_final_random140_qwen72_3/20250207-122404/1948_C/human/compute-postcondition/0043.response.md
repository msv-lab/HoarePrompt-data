Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `j` is 0, `n` is a new input integer greater than 1, `b` is a new input string, `i` is the largest odd integer less than `n`, `a` is a new input string. Additionally, either (i + 1 < n and the character at index `i` in `a` is '<', and the character at index `i + 1` in `b` is '<') or (the character at index `i` in `a` is '<', and the character at index `i - 1` in `b` is '<'). We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
