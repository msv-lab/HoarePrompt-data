Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `j` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, `i` is the largest odd integer less than `n`. If the loop did not break early due to the condition `(i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<') or (a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<')`, then the program prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO' and exits the loop.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over odd integers starting from 1 up to the largest odd integer less than `n`.
- For each iteration, the loop checks if the current index `i` satisfies the condition `(i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<') or (a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<')`.
- If the condition is met at any point, the loop breaks and prints 'NO'.
- If the loop completes all iterations without breaking, it prints 'YES'.
- The final value of `i` will be the largest odd integer less than `n`.
- The variables `t`, `j`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged throughout the loop execution.
