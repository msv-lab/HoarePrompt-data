Postcondition: **`_` is derived from the input, which must be a positive integer (1 <= int(input()) <= 100). `n` and `m` are updated to the new integers read from the input. If the new `n` is less than the new `m`, the condition `n < m` holds true. If the new `n` is greater than or equal to the new `m`, the condition `n >= m` holds true. If the new `n` and `m` are both odd or both even, the loop has executed one more time, so the remaining iterations are reduced by 1.**
