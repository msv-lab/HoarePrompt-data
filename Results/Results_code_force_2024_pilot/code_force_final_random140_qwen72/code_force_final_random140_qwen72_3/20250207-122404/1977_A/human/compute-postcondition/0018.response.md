Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
1. `_` is derived from the input, which must be a positive integer (1 <= int(input()) <= 100).
2. `n` and `m` are updated to new integers read from the input.
3. If the new `n` is less than the new `m`, the condition `n < m` holds true.
4. If the new `n` is greater than or equal to the new `m`, the condition `n >= m` holds true.
5. If the new `n` and `m` are both odd or both even, the condition is satisfied.
6. The loop has executed one more time, so the remaining iterations are reduced by 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
- The initial state describes a series of conditions and updates to variables `n` and `m` based on user input.
- The conditions mentioned (such as `n < m`, `n >= m`, and both being odd or even) are used to determine the flow of the program, but they do not directly affect the output of the `print` statement.
- The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always output the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of `n` and `m` or any other conditions mentioned in the initial state.

Output: **YES**
