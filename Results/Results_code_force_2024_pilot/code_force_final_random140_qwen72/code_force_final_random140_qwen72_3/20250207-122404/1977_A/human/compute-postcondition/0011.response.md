Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `_` is derived from the input, which must be a positive integer (1 <= int(input()) <= 100).
- `n` and `m` are integers derived from the input.
- If `n` is less than `m`, the condition `n < m` holds true.
- If `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, the condition `n >= m` holds true.
- If `n` and `m` are both odd or both even, the condition is satisfied.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`.
- The conditions described in the initial state do not affect the output of the `print` statement directly. They only describe the relationship between `n` and `m` and the constraints on the input.
- Since the `print` statement is hardcoded to print `'NO'`, it will always print `'NO'` regardless of the values of `n` and `m`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
