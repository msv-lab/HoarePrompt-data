Based on the initial state provided:

- `_` is derived from the input, which must be a positive integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive).
- `n` and `m` are integers derived from the input.
- `n` is greater than or equal to `m`.
- Both `n` and `m` are either both odd or both even.

Given these conditions, the `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print('YES')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'YES'` to the console. The conditions described in the initial state do not affect the content of the `print` statement, as it is a static string.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **YES**
