Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly solves the problem based on the given constraints and logic. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Condition Checking**:
   - If `n` (number of moves) is less than `m` (desired number of cubes), it's impossible to build a tower of height `m`, so it prints 'NO'.
   - If `n` and `m` are both odd or both even, it is possible to build a tower of height `m` after `n` moves, so it prints 'YES'.
   - The conditions `n & 1` and `m & 1` check if `n` and `m` are odd, respectively. The condition `n % 2 == 0 and m % 2 == 0` checks if both `n` and `m` are even.
3. **Output**: The program outputs 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions, which aligns with the problem requirements.

Thus, the program is correct and meets the problem's specifications.
