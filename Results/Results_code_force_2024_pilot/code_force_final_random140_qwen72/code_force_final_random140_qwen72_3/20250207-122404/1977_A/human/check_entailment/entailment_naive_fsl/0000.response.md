Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the condition `elif n & 1 and m & 1 or (n % 2 == 0 and m % 2 == 0):` is incorrect. This condition checks if both `n` and `m` are odd or both are even, but this is not sufficient to determine if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

A correct approach would be to check if the difference between `n` and `m` is even, because each move can either add or remove one cube, and the parity of the number of moves must match the parity of the final number of cubes.

For example, consider the test case `n = 4` and `m = 2`. According to the problem description, it is possible to achieve this by performing the following moves:
- Add a cube (1 cube)
- Add a cube (2 cubes)
- Remove a cube (1 cube)
- Add a cube (2 cubes)

However, the given program would incorrectly output "No" for this case because it does not correctly handle the parity check. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
