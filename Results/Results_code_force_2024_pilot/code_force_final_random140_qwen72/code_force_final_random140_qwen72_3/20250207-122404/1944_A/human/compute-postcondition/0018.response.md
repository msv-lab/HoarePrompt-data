To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute at least once, let's analyze the conditions in the loop head:

```python
while k >= reachable_count - 1 and k > 0:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - `k`
   - `reachable_count`

2. **Initial States:**
   - `k` is the second integer from input and must be greater than or equal to `n - 1`.
   - `reachable_count` is equal to `n`.

3. **Conditions for the Loop to Execute:**
   - The loop will execute if both conditions are true:
     - `k >= reachable_count - 1`
     - `k > 0`

4. **Evaluating the Conditions:**
   - For the first condition `k >= reachable_count - 1`:
     - Given `reachable_count` is `n`, this condition becomes `k >= n - 1`.
     - Since `k` is already given to be greater than or equal to `n - 1`, this condition is satisfied.
   - For the second condition `k > 0`:
     - This condition must also be true for the loop to execute.

5. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - The only adjustment needed is to ensure that `k > 0`.
   - Since `k` is the second integer from input and must be greater than or equal to `n - 1`, and `n` is a positive integer (as `n` is the first integer from input), `k` should be positive as long as `n` is at least 1.

### Conclusion:
Given the initial conditions, no adjustments are needed because the conditions for the loop to execute are already met.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is the first integer from input, `k` is the second integer from input, `k` must be greater than or equal to `n - 1`, `qs` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, `reachable_count` is equal to `n`**
