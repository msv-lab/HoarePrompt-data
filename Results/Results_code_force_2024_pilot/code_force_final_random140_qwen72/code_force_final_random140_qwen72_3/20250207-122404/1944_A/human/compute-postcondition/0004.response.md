The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `k` is an integer where 0 ≤ k ≤ n * (n - 1) / 2. The function has two possible return cases:

- Case_1: The function returns 1.
- Case_2: The function returns the integer value of `n`, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers `n` and `k` within the specified ranges and return either 1 or the value of `n`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer in the range 1 to 100, and `k` is an integer in the range 0 to n * (n - 1) / 2. It returns 1 in one case, and in another case, it returns the value of `n`.**
