Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is the first integer from input, `k` is now `k - n + 1`, `k` must be greater than or equal to `n - 1`, `qs` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, `reachable_count` is equal to `n - 1`**

Explanation:
- The code `reachable_count -= 1` decrements the value of `reachable_count` by 1.
- Initially, `reachable_count` was equal to `n`.
- After decrementing, `reachable_count` is now `n - 1`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
