Output State: **After all iterations, `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` and `k` are the last input integers from the final iteration, `qs` is 0, `_` is equal to the number of iterations (which is `qs`), and `reachable_count` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains unchanged as it represents the total number of test cases and is not modified within the loop.
- The variables `n` and `k` are updated with each iteration based on the input provided for each test case.
- The variable `qs` is decremented to 0 after all iterations because the loop runs `qs` times.
- The variable `_` is incremented with each iteration and will be equal to the number of iterations, which is `qs`.
- The variable `reachable_count` is always reduced to 1 after the inner while loop completes, regardless of the values of `n` and `k`.
