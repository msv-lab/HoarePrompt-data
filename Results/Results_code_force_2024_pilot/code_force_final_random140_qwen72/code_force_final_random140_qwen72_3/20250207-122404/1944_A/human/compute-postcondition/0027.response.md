Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is the first integer from input, `k` is now `k % (n - 1)` if `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1` otherwise `k` is 0, `qs` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, `reachable_count` is equal to 1.**

### Explanation:
- The loop continues as long as `k` is greater than or equal to `reachable_count - 1` and `k` is greater than 0.
- In each iteration, `k` is reduced by `reachable_count - 1`, and `reachable_count` is decremented by 1.
- After each iteration, `reachable_count` decreases until it reaches 1.
- When `reachable_count` becomes 1, the condition `k >= reachable_count - 1` simplifies to `k >= 0`, which will always be true if `k > 0`. However, the loop also checks `k > 0`, so the loop will terminate when `k` becomes 0.
- The final value of `k` will be `k % (n - 1)` if `k` is initially greater than or equal to `n - 1`, otherwise, `k` will be 0.
- The variable `reachable_count` will be 1 when the loop terminates.
