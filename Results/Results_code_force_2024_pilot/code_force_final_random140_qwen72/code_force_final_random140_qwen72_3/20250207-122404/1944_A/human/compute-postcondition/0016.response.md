The provided Python code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k`. The initial state specifies that `n` is an input integer, and `k` is defined as `k - (n-1) - (n-2) - ... - 1`. After executing the code, the new values of `n` and `k` are taken from the input, and the rest of the initial conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is the first integer from input, `k` is the second integer from input, `k` must be greater than or equal to `n - 1`, `qs` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, `reachable_count` is equal to 1.**
