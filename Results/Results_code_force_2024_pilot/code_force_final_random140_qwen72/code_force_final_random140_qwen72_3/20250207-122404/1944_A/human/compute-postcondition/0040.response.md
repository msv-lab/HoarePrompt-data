Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `k` is now `k - (n - 3)`, `k` must be at least 0 and greater than 0, `qs` must be greater than 0, `_` is 2, `reachable_count` is `n - 3`**

Explanation:
- The code `reachable_count -= 1` decrements the value of `reachable_count` by 1.
- Initially, `reachable_count` was `n - 2`.
- After decrementing, `reachable_count` becomes `(n - 2) - 1`, which simplifies to `n - 3`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
