Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is the first integer from input, `k` is now `k - (n - 1) + 1` and must be greater than or equal to `2n - 3` and greater than 0, `qs` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, `reachable_count` is equal to `n - 1`**

Explanation:
- The value of `k` is updated by subtracting `reachable_count - 1` from its current value.
- Since `reachable_count` is `n - 1`, the expression `reachable_count - 1` simplifies to `(n - 1) - 1`, which is `n - 2`.
- Therefore, `k` is updated to `k - (n - 2)`, which simplifies to `k - n + 2`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
