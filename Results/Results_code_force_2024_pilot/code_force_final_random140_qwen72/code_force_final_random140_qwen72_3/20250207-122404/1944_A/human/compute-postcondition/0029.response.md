The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the value `qs`. The loop will execute as long as `_` is within the range of `qs`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3,
- `n` is the first integer from input,
- `k` is now `k % (n - 1)` if `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1` otherwise `k` is 0,
- `qs` must be greater than 0,
- `_` is 1,
- `reachable_count` is equal to 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, and `qs` must still be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is the first integer from input, `k` is now `k % (n - 1)` if `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1` otherwise `k` is 0, `qs` must be greater than 0, `_` is 2, `reachable_count` is equal to 1**
