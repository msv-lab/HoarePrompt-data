Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `k` is the second integer from the new input, `k` is now `k % (n - 1)` if `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1` otherwise `k` is 0, `qs` must be greater than 0, `_` is 2, `reachable_count` is equal to `n`**. 

Explanation: The value of `reachable_count` is updated to be equal to `n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
