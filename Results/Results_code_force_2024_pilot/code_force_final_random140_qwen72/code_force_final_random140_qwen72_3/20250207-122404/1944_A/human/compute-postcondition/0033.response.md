The value of `k` is updated by subtracting `reachable_count - 1` from its current value. Given that `reachable_count` is equal to `n`, the expression `reachable_count - 1` simplifies to `n - 1`. Therefore, `k` is reduced by `n - 1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `k` is now `k - (n - 1)`, `qs` must be greater than 0, `_` is 2, `reachable_count` is equal to `n`**.
