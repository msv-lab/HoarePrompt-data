Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3.
- `n` is the first integer from input.
- `k` is now `k % (n - 1)` if `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`; otherwise, `k` is 0.
- `qs` must be greater than 0.
- `_` is 1.
- `reachable_count` is equal to 1.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print(reachable_count)
```

Given that `reachable_count` is explicitly set to 1, the value of `reachable_count` is 1.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be:

Output: **1**
