Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is the first integer from input, `k` is the second integer from input, `k` must be greater than or equal to `n - 1`, `qs` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, `reachable_count` is equal to `n`.**

Explanation: The code snippet assigns the value of `n` to `reachable_count`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the new value of `reachable_count` is `n`, and all other conditions and values specified in the initial state remain valid.
