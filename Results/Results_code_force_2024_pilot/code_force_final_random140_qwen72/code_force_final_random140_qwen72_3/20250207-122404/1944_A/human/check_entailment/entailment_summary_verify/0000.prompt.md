You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n islands, numbered 1, 2, \ldots, n . Initially, every pair of
islands is connected by a bridge. Hence, there are a total of \frac{n (n -
1)}{2} bridges.

Everule lives on island 1 and enjoys visiting the other islands using bridges.
Dominater has the power to destroy at most k bridges to minimize the number of
islands that Everule can reach using (possibly multiple) bridges.

Find the minimum number of islands (including island 1 ) that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le
n \le 100 , 0 \le k \le \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2} ).

Output

For each test case, output the minimum number of islands that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Example

Input

    6
    
    2 0
    
    2 1
    
    4 1
    
    5 10
    
    5 3
    
    4 4

Output

    2
    1
    4
    1
    5
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, since no bridges can be destroyed, all the islands
will be reachable.

In the second test case, you can destroy the bridge between islands 1 and 2 .
Everule will not be able to visit island 2 but can still visit island 1 .
Therefore, the total number of islands that Everule can visit is 1 .

In the third test case, Everule always has a way of reaching all islands
despite what Dominater does. For example, if Dominater destroyed the bridge
between islands 1 and 2 , Everule can still visit island 2 by traveling by 1
\to 3 \to 2 as the bridges between 1 and 3 , and between 3 and 2 are not
destroyed.

In the fourth test case, you can destroy all bridges since k = \frac{n \cdot
(n - 1)}{2} . Everule will be only able to visit 1 island (island 1 ).

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    print(func_1(n, k))

def func_1(n, k):
    if k >= n - 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer in the range 1 to 100, and `k` is an integer in the range 0 to n * (n - 1) / 2. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it returns the value of `n`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the problem correctly for all potential cases. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not correctly calculate the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit after Dominater destroys the bridges optimally.

### Case Analysis:
- **Case 1: \( k \geq n - 1 \)**
  - The program correctly returns 1, as Everule can only visit island 1 if \( k \geq n - 1 \). This is because destroying \( n - 1 \) bridges will isolate island 1 from all other islands.

- **Case 2: \( k < n - 1 \)**
  - The program incorrectly returns \( n \), which suggests that Everule can visit all islands. However, this is not always true. For example, consider \( n = 4 \) and \( k = 1 \):
    - If Dominater destroys the bridge between island 1 and island 2, Everule can still visit islands 1, 3, and 4 by traveling through the remaining bridges. Therefore, the correct answer should be 3, not 4.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to consider the following:
- If \( k \geq n - 1 \), Everule can only visit island 1.
- If \( k < n - 1 \), the optimal strategy for Dominater is to isolate as many islands as possible from island 1. The maximum number of islands that can be isolated is \( \min(k, n - 1) \). Therefore, the minimum number of islands Everule can visit is \( n - \min(k, n - 1) \).

### Corrected Program:
```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    print(func_1(n, k))

def func_1(n, k):
    if k >= n - 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n - min(k, n - 1)
```

This corrected program will handle all potential cases correctly.
