Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the problem correctly for all potential cases. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not correctly calculate the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit after Dominater destroys the bridges optimally.

### Case Analysis:
- **Case 1: \( k \geq n - 1 \)**
  - The program correctly returns 1, as Everule can only visit island 1 if \( k \geq n - 1 \). This is because destroying \( n - 1 \) bridges will isolate island 1 from all other islands.

- **Case 2: \( k < n - 1 \)**
  - The program incorrectly returns \( n \), which suggests that Everule can visit all islands. However, this is not always true. For example, consider \( n = 4 \) and \( k = 1 \):
    - If Dominater destroys the bridge between island 1 and island 2, Everule can still visit islands 1, 3, and 4 by traveling through the remaining bridges. Therefore, the correct answer should be 3, not 4.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to consider the following:
- If \( k \geq n - 1 \), Everule can only visit island 1.
- If \( k < n - 1 \), the optimal strategy for Dominater is to isolate as many islands as possible from island 1. The maximum number of islands that can be isolated is \( \min(k, n - 1) \). Therefore, the minimum number of islands Everule can visit is \( n - \min(k, n - 1) \).

### Corrected Program:
```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    print(func_1(n, k))

def func_1(n, k):
    if k >= n - 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n - min(k, n - 1)
```

This corrected program will handle all potential cases correctly.
