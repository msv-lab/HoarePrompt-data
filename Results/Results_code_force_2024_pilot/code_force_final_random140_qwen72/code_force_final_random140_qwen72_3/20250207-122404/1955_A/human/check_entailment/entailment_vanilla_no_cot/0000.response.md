Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly calculates the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts under the given conditions. It considers both the cost of buying all yogurts at the regular price (`s1`) and the cost of buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotional price plus any remaining yogurts at the regular price (`s2`). The program then prints the minimum of these two costs for each test case, which aligns with the problem's requirements.
