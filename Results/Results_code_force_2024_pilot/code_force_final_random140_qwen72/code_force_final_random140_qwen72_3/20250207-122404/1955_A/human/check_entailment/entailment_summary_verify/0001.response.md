### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to find the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts.
   - There are two pricing options:
     - Buying all yogurts at the regular price: `n * a`.
     - Buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotional price and the remaining yogurts at the regular price: `b * (n // 2) + (n % 2) * a`.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
   - It calculates the cost of buying all yogurts at the regular price: `s1 = n * a`.
   - It calculates the cost of buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotional price and the remaining yogurts at the regular price: `s2 = b * (n // 2) + (n % 2) * a`.
   - It prints the minimum of these two costs: `print(min(s1, s2))`.

3. **Verification:**
   - The logic correctly handles both scenarios:
     - If `n` is even, it buys `n // 2` pairs at the promotional price.
     - If `n` is odd, it buys `n // 2` pairs at the promotional price and 1 yogurt at the regular price.
   - The program uses the correct mathematical operations to compute the costs.
   - The use of `min(s1, s2)` ensures that the minimum cost is printed for each test case.

4. **Function Summary Validation:**
   - The function summary accurately describes the behavior of the program.
   - It correctly states that the function processes a series of test cases, reads the necessary inputs, calculates the costs, and prints the minimum cost for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and will produce the expected output for the given problem description. The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
