Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly handles the problem by calculating two potential costs for buying `n` yogurts: one where all yogurts are bought at the regular price (`s1 = n * a`), and another where as many pairs of yogurts as possible are bought at the promotional price, with any remaining yogurts bought at the regular price (`s2 = b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a`). The program then outputs the minimum of these two costs for each test case.

The function summary confirms that the program processes each test case as described, and the logic used to calculate `s1` and `s2` aligns with the problem requirements. The use of `min(s1, s2)` ensures that the minimum cost is selected, which is the desired outcome for each test case.

No edge cases or logical errors have been identified that would cause the program to produce incorrect results within the given constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

Final: **True**
