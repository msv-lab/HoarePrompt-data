Reasoning: 

The original assessment states that the program is correct, and this assessment appears to be accurate based on the following analysis:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Cost Calculation**:
   - `s1` is calculated as `n * a`, which represents the total cost if all yogurts are bought at the regular price.
   - `s2` is calculated as `b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a`, which represents the total cost if as many pairs of yogurts as possible are bought at the promotional price, and any remaining yogurts are bought at the regular price.
     - `n // 2` gives the number of pairs of yogurts.
     - `n % 2` gives the number of remaining yogurts (either 0 or 1).
     - `b * (n // 2)` is the cost for the pairs of yogurts.
     - `n % 2 * a` is the cost for the remaining yogurts.

3. **Output**: The program prints the minimum of `s1` and `s2` for each test case, ensuring that the minimum cost is always chosen.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - When `n` is even, `n % 2` is 0, so the formula simplifies to `b * (n // 2)`.
   - When `n` is odd, `n % 2` is 1, so the formula simplifies to `b * (n // 2) + a`.
   - Both scenarios are correctly handled by the program.

5. **Constraints**: The program handles the constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30) appropriately, and the calculations do not exceed the limits of integer arithmetic in Python.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. There are no apparent issues or edge cases that would cause the program to fail.

Final: **True**
