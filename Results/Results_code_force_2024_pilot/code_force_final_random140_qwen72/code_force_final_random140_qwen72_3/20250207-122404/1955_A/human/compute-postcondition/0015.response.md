Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` have been processed, with `s1` calculated as `n * a` and `s2` calculated as `b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a`. The minimum of `s1` and `s2` has been printed for each test case. The loop has completed all its iterations based on the input value of `t`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` remains within its initial range, and for each of the `t` test cases, the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` have been read, the values of `s1` and `s2` have been computed, and the minimum of these two values has been printed. The loop has finished running through all the test cases specified by `t`.
