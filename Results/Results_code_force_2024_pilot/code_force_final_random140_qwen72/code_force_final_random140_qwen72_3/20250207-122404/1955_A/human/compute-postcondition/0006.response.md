The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b`. This changes the values of these variables from their initial specific values to new values provided by the input.

- `n` is now the first integer from the input.
- `a` is now the second integer from the input.
- `b` is now the third integer from the input.

The values of `s1` and `s2` are recalculated based on the new values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.

- `s1` is now equal to `n * a`.
- `s2` is now equal to `b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a`.

The loop condition remains unchanged, meaning there is still at least one more iteration remaining based on the input value.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `a` is the second integer from the input, `b` is the third integer from the input, `s1` is equal to `n * a`, `s2` is equal to `b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a`, and the loop has at least one more iteration remaining based on the input value.**
