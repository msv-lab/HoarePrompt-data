The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is the loop counter. The loop iterates based on the value provided by `int(input())`, which is the number of times the loop should run. Since the loop counter `_` is not explicitly used in the loop body or modified within the loop, it does not affect the state of other variables.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `s1`, and `s2` remains unchanged because they are not modified within the loop. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are iterations left based on the input value.

Since the loop counter `_` is incremented by 1 for each iteration, and the loop condition is based on the input value, the only adjustment needed is to increment the implicit loop counter `_` by 1. However, since `_` is not explicitly tracked, we focus on the input value that determines the number of iterations.

Given that the loop is about to start another iteration, the input value must still allow for at least one more iteration. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is a specific integer where 1 <= n <= 100, `a` is a specific integer where 1 <= a <= 30, `b` is a specific integer where 1 <= b <= 30, `s1` is equal to `n * a`, `s2` is equal to `b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a`, and the loop has at least one more iteration remaining based on the input value.**
