Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is a specific integer where 1 <= n <= 100, `a` is a specific integer where 1 <= a <= 30, `b` is a specific integer where 1 <= b <= 30, `s1` is equal to `n * a`.** 

Explanation: The code snippet `s1 = n * a` calculates the product of `n` and `a` and assigns it to the variable `s1`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged, but `s1` is now equal to the product of `n` and `a`.
