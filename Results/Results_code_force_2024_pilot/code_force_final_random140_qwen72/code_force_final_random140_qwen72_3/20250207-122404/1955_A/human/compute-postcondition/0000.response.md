The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder to indicate that the loop variable itself is not used within the loop body. The loop's execution depends on the result of `int(input())`.

For the loop to execute, the input provided by `int(input())` must be a positive integer. This is because the `range()` function will generate a sequence of numbers from 0 up to (but not including) the value returned by `int(input())`, and if this value is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30.

We need to ensure that the input provided by `int(input())` is a positive integer, which aligns with the constraints of `t`.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted to ensure that the input is a positive integer, and since the loop variable `_` is not used, no other adjustments are necessary.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30, and the input provided by `int(input())` must be a positive integer**.
