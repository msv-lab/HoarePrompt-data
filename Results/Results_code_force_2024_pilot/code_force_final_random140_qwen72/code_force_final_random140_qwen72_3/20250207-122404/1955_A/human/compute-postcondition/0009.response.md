To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is the first integer from the input.
   - `a` is the second integer from the input.
   - `b` is the third integer from the input.
   - `s1` is equal to \(n \times a\).
   - `s2` is equal to \(b \times (n // 2) + n \% 2 \times a\).

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(min(s1, s2))
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - `s1` is calculated as \(n \times a\). This is simply the product of `n` and `a`.
   - `s2` is calculated as \(b \times (n // 2) + n \% 2 \times a\). This can be broken down as follows:
     - `n // 2` gives the integer division of `n` by 2.
     - `n % 2` gives the remainder when `n` is divided by 2 (which is 0 if `n` is even and 1 if `n` is odd).
     - Therefore, `s2` is the sum of \(b \times (n // 2)\) and \(n \% 2 \times a\).

4. **Determine the Minimum:**
   - The `min(s1, s2)` function will return the smaller of the two values `s1` and `s2`.

5. **Output:**
   - The `print(min(s1, s2))` statement will print the minimum value between `s1` and `s2`.

Given the initial state and the calculations, the output will be the minimum value between \(n \times a\) and \(b \times (n // 2) + n \% 2 \times a\).

Output: **min(n * a, b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a)**
