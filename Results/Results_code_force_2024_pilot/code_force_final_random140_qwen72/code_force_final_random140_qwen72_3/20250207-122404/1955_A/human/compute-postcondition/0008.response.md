Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `a` is the second integer from the input, `b` is the third integer from the input, `s1` is equal to `n * a`, `s2` is equal to `b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a`, and the loop has at least one more iteration remaining based on the input value.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `s2 = b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a` recalculates the value of `s2` using the same formula as in the initial state.
- Since the formula for `s2` is the same as the one given in the initial state, the value of `s2` remains unchanged.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `s1`) retain their initial values.
- The condition that the loop has at least one more iteration remaining based on the input value is still valid.
