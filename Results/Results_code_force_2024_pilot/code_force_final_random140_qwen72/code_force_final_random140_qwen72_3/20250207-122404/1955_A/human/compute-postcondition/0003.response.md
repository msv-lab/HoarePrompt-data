Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is a specific integer where 1 <= n <= 100, `a` is a specific integer where 1 <= a <= 30, `b` is a specific integer where 1 <= b <= 30, `s1` is equal to `n * a`, `s2` is equal to `b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a`.**

Explanation:
- `s2` is calculated using the formula `b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a`.
- `n // 2` gives the integer division of `n` by 2.
- `n % 2` gives the remainder when `n` is divided by 2, which is either 0 or 1.
- If `n` is even, `n % 2` is 0, so the term `n % 2 * a` is 0.
- If `n` is odd, `n % 2` is 1, so the term `n % 2 * a` is `a`.
- Therefore, `s2` is the sum of `b * (n // 2)` and `n % 2 * a`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `s1`) remain unchanged from their initial values.
