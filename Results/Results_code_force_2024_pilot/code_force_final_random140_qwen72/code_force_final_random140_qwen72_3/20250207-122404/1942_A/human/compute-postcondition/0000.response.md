To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the conditions that affect the loop's execution based on the loop head. The loop head in this case is:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
```

This loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute at least once, the value of `int(input())` must be greater than 0.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3
- For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3

We need to adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute. The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is the result of `int(input())`.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. The loop will execute if `int(input())` is greater than 0.
2. The initial state does not provide information about the input, so we need to assume that the input will be a valid integer within the range that allows the loop to execute.
3. Since `t` is the number of test cases, and each test case involves reading `n` and `k`, the input should be a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3).

### Adjusted State:
To ensure the loop executes, the input must be a positive integer. Therefore, the state should reflect that the input is a positive integer.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
