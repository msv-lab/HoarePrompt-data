Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, and `k` is an input integer greater than 0. If `n` equals `k`, the program maintains the values of `t`, `n`, and `k`. If `n` does not equal `k`, and `k` is 1, the program does nothing. Otherwise, if `k` is not 1, the program maintains the values of `t`, `n`, and `k` as well.***
