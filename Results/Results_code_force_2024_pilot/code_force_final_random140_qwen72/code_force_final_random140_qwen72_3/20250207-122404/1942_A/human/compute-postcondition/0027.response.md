Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `k` (where `1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3`). For each test case, it prints a specific output based on the values of `n` and `k`:
- If `n` equals `k`, it prints a space-separated string of `n` ones.
- If `k` equals 1, it prints a space-separated string of integers from 1 to `n`.
- For any other values of `n` and `k`, it prints `-1`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the console. **
