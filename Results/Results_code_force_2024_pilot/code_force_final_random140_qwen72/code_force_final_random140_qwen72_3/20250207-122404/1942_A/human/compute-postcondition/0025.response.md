Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged for each iteration of the loop.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `t` remains within the specified range (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3). For each test case, the values of `n` and `k` are read from input and processed according to the conditions in the loop. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` do not change during the execution of the loop, as the loop only prints output based on these values but does not modify them. Therefore, the final state of the variables is the same as their initial state, with the only difference being that the loop has completed its execution for all test cases.
