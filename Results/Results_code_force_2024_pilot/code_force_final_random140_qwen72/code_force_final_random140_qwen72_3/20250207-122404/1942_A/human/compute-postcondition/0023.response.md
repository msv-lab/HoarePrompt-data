Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is the first input integer greater than 0, `k` is the second input integer greater than 0. If `k` == 1, the program does not change the values of `t`, `n`, or `k`. Otherwise, the program also does not change the values of `t`, `n`, or `k`.***
