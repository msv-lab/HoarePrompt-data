### Reasoning:

1. **Case 1: \( n = k \)**  
   - If \( n = k \), it means all \( n \) cyclic shifts of the array must be sorted. This can only happen if all elements in the array are equal. Therefore, the solution is to print an array where all elements are `1`. This ensures that every cyclic shift will be sorted.
   - Example: For \( n = 2 \) and \( k = 2 \), the output is `1 1`.

2. **Case 2: \( k = 1 \)**  
   - If \( k = 1 \), it means only one cyclic shift of the array must be sorted. This can be achieved by creating an array where the elements are in strictly increasing order except for the last element, which is smaller than the first element. This ensures that only one cyclic shift (the original array) is sorted.
   - Example: For \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 1 \), the output is `1 2 3` (or any other strictly increasing sequence followed by a smaller number).

3. **Case 3: \( 1 < k < n \)**  
   - If \( 1 < k < n \), it is impossible to construct an array where exactly \( k \) cyclic shifts are sorted. This is because if more than one cyclic shift is sorted, the array must have a specific structure that cannot be easily generalized to produce exactly \( k \) sorted shifts without violating the constraints.
   - Therefore, the program correctly prints `-1` in this case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the specified cases and produces the expected output for each scenario. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
