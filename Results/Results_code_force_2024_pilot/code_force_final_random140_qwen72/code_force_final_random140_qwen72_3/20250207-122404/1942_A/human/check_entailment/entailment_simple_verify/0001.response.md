### Reasoning:

1. **Case 1: \( n = k \)**
   - The program correctly identifies that if \( n = k \), all \( n \) cyclic shifts of the array must be sorted. The only way to achieve this is if all elements in the array are equal. The program prints an array where all elements are `1`, ensuring that every cyclic shift will be sorted.
   - Example: For \( n = 2 \) and \( k = 2 \), the output is `1 1`.
   - **Correctness**: True

2. **Case 2: \( k = 1 \)**
   - The program correctly identifies that if \( k = 1 \), only one cyclic shift of the array must be sorted. The program constructs an array where the elements are in strictly increasing order, ensuring that only the original array is sorted.
   - Example: For \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 1 \), the output is `1 2 3`.
   - **Correctness**: True

3. **Case 3: \( 1 < k < n \)**
   - The program correctly identifies that if \( 1 < k < n \), it is impossible to construct an array where exactly \( k \) cyclic shifts are sorted. This is because if more than one cyclic shift is sorted, the array must have a specific structure that cannot be easily generalized to produce exactly \( k \) sorted shifts without violating the constraints.
   - Therefore, the program prints `-1` in this case.
   - **Correctness**: True

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the specified cases and produces the expected output for each scenario. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**
