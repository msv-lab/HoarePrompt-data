Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem of generating an array that has exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts out of `n` possible shifts. Let's break down the logic of the program:

1. **Case when `n == k`:**
   - If `n` equals `k`, it means every cyclic shift must be sorted. This can only happen if all elements in the array are the same. Hence, the program prints an array of `n` ones. This is correct because any permutation of an array with all equal elements will always be sorted.

2. **Case when `k == 1`:**
   - If `k` equals 1, it means there should be exactly one sorted cyclic shift. The program generates an array where each element is distinct and in increasing order. For example, `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]`. When this array is shifted, only the original array itself will be sorted, and all other shifts will not be sorted. This is also correct.

3. **Other cases:**
   - For any other combination of `n` and `k`, the program prints `-1`. This is because the problem constraints do not allow for more than one sorted cyclic shift unless all elements are the same (which is covered by the first case), or exactly one sorted cyclic shift (which is covered by the second case). Any other combination of `n` and `k` would not meet the problem requirements.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly handles all specified cases and outputs the appropriate results based on the problem constraints.

Correctness: **True**
