### Reasoning:

1. **Case 1: \( n = k \)**
   - The program correctly identifies that if \( n = k \), all \( n \) cyclic shifts of the array must be sorted. The only way to achieve this is if all elements in the array are equal. The program prints a space-separated string of `n` ones, which is correct.
   - Example: For \( n = 2 \) and \( k = 2 \), the output is `1 1`.

2. **Case 2: \( k = 1 \)**
   - The program correctly identifies that if \( k = 1 \), only one cyclic shift of the array must be sorted. The program prints a space-separated string of integers from 1 to \( n \), which ensures that only the original array is sorted.
   - Example: For \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 1 \), the output is `1 2 3`.

3. **Case 3: \( 1 < k < n \)**
   - The program correctly identifies that if \( 1 < k < n \), it is impossible to construct an array where exactly \( k \) cyclic shifts are sorted. The program prints `-1` in this case, which is correct.
   - Example: For \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 2 \), the output is `-1`.

### Validation with Annotations:
- The annotations confirm that the program processes each test case correctly and prints the appropriate output based on the values of \( n \) and \( k \).
- The state of the program remains consistent throughout the iterations, ensuring that the input constraints are respected.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the specified cases and produces the expected output for each scenario. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
