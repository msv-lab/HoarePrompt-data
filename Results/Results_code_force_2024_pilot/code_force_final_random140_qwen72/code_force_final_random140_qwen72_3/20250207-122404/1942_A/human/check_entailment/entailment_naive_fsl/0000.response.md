Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program fails to handle the case where \( k > 1 \) and \( k < n \). According to the problem description, the program should output a valid array if there exists one that has exactly \( k \) sorted cyclic shifts. However, the program only handles the cases where \( k = 1 \) or \( k = n \), and returns `-1` for all other values of \( k \).

For example, consider the input:
```
3 2
```
The program will output `-1`, but there exists a valid array that satisfies the conditions. One such array is `[1, 2, 1]`, which has exactly 2 sorted cyclic shifts: `[1, 2, 1]` and `[1, 1, 2]`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem.
