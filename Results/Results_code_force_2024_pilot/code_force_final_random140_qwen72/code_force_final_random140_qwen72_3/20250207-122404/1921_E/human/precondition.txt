t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of six integers h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b where (1 ≤ x_a, x_b ≤ h ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ y_a, y_b ≤ w ≤ 10^9), representing the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips. It is guaranteed that either x_a ≠ x_b or y_a ≠ y_b, ensuring the initial positions do not coincide.
