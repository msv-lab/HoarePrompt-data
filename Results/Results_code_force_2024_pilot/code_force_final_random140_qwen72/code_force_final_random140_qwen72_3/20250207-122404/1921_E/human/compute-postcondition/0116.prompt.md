You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each test case contains six integers h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b where 1 ≤ x_a, x_b ≤ h ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ y_a, y_b ≤ w ≤ 10^9, and it is guaranteed that either x_a ≠ x_b or y_a ≠ y_b.
def func():
    test_cases = int(input())
    answers = []
    for i in range(test_cases):
        clues = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        
        if clues[2] > clues[4] or clues[0] == 1:

    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` remains an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is an input integer and must be equal to the number of iterations the loop has executed, `i` is equal to `test_cases - 1`, and `answers` is a list containing 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice' for each test case processed. The length of `answers` is equal to `test_cases`. Each element in `answers` corresponds to the result of the respective test case based on the conditions evaluated in the loop.
    for j in answers:
        print(j)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is an input integer and must be equal to the number of iterations the loop has executed, `i` is equal to `test_cases - 1`, `answers` is a list containing exactly `test_cases` elements ('Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice'), and all elements in `answers` have been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it accepts six integers `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`. It processes each test case and returns a result based on the relationship or distance between the points A (`x_a`, `y_a`) and B (`x_b`, `y_b`) on a grid of dimensions `h` by `w`.
