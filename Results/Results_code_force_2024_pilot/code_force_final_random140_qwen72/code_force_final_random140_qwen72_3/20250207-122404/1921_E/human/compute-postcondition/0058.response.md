Output State: **`n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x1` is `r[2]`, `y1` is `r[3]`, `x2` is `r[4]`, `y2` is `r[5]`, `a` is `m - y1`, `x2` is greater than `x1`, the difference between `x2` and `x1` is even, and `y2` is less than `y1`.** 

Explanation: The variable `a` is assigned the value of `m - y1`. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
