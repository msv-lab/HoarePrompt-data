Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
   - `test_cases` is an input integer and must be equal to the number of iterations the loop has executed.
   - `i` is equal to `test_cases - 1`.
   - `answers` is a list containing at least two elements ('Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice').
   - `j` is the second element in `answers`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(j)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `j` is defined as the second element in the list `answers`.
   - The list `answers` contains at least two elements, and these elements can be 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice'.
   - Therefore, `j` will be one of these three values: 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice'.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since `j` is the second element in the list `answers`, the `print(j)` statement will print the second element of the `answers` list.

Output: **j (where j is the second element in the list answers, which can be 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice')**
