Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads six integers `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b` and determines the outcome based on the positions of two points A (`x_a`, `y_a`) and B (`x_b`, `y_b`) on a grid of dimensions `h` by `w`. The function appends one of three possible outcomes ('Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice') to a list for each test case. After processing all test cases, it prints each outcome in the list. The final state of the program includes the integer `t` (unchanged), the number of test cases processed (`test_cases`), the index of the last processed test case (`i`), and the list of outcomes (`answers`) which has been printed. **
