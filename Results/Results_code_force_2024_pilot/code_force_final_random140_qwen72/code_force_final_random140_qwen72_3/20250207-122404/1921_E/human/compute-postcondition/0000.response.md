The provided code snippet reads a line of input and splits it into a list of integers, which is then assigned to the variable `r`. Since the initial state mentions that the function `func_1` is not properly defined and does not provide specific values for the variables involved, we can only infer the changes based on the code snippet itself.

Output State: **The function `func_1` is not properly defined for the given problem. `r` is a list of integers read from input.**
