Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is an input integer and must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `clues` is a list of integers provided by the user's input. If `clues[5] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`, then `answers` is a list containing the string 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` contains the string 'Bob'.***
