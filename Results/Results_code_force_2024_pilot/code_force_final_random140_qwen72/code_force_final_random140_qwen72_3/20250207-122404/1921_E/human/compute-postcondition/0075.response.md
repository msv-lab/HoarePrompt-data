Output State: **`n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x1` is `x1 + a`, `y1` is `r[1]`, `x2` is `r[4] - a`, `y2` is updated to `y2 + a` (where `a` is `y1 - 1` if `y2 >= y1` or `m - y1` if `y2 < y1`), `x2` is greater than `x1`, the difference between `x2` and `x1` is even, `y1` is not equal to `y2`, `b` is `x2 - x1` (a positive even number), `t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`, `x2` is greater than `x1`, `x1` is greater than or equal to 1, `x2` is less than or equal to `n`, `c` is `m - y2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `c` is calculated as `m - y2`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
