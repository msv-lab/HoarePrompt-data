Let's break down the initial state and determine what will be printed:

1. **Variables and Conditions:**
   - `n` is `r[0]`
   - `m` is `r[1]`
   - `x1` is `x1 + a`
   - `y1` is `r[3]`
   - `x2` is `r[4] - a`
   - `y2` is `r[5]`
   - `x2` is greater than `x1`
   - The difference between `x2` and `x1` is even
   - `y1` is not equal to `y2`
   - If `y2` is greater than or equal to `y1`, then `a` is `y1 - 1`
   - If `y2` is less than `y1`, then `a` is `m - y1`
   - `b` is `x2 - x1` (a positive even number)
   - `t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`
   - Either `x2` is less than or equal to `x1`, or `x1` is less than 1, or `x2` is greater than `n`

2. **Analysis:**
   - The condition `x2` is greater than `x1` is explicitly stated.
   - The difference between `x2` and `x1` is even, which means `b` is a positive even number.
   - `y1` is not equal to `y2`, so `t` (which is `abs(y2 - y1)`) is a positive integer.
   - The value of `a` depends on the relationship between `y1` and `y2`:
     - If `y2 >= y1`, then `a = y1 - 1`
     - If `y2 < y1`, then `a = m - y1`
   - The final condition states that either `x2` is less than or equal to `x1`, or `x1` is less than 1, or `x2` is greater than `n`. However, since `x2` is greater than `x1`, the only relevant conditions are `x1 < 1` or `x2 > n`.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the conditions, the only way the final condition can be true is if `x1 < 1` or `x2 > n`.
   - Since the print statement is `print('draw')`, it will always print 'draw' regardless of the specific values of `x1` and `x2` as long as one of the conditions (`x1 < 1` or `x2 > n`) is met.

Output: **draw**
