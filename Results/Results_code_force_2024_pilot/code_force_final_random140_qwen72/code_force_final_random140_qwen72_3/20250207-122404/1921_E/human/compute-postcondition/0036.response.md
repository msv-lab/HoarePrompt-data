Output State: **`n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x1` is `r[2] + 1 + a`, `x2` is `r[4] - a`, `x2` is greater than `x1`, the difference between `x2` and `x1` is an odd number, `y1` is not equal to `y2`, if `y1` is greater than or equal to `y2`, then `y1` is `r[3] + 1` and `a` is `y2 - 1`, otherwise `y1` is `r[3] - 1` and `a` is `r[1] - y2`, `b` is `x2 - x1` (which is an odd number), `t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`, `x2` is greater than `x1`, `x1` is greater than or equal to 1, `x2` is less than or equal to `n`, the absolute difference between `y2` and 1 is less than the absolute difference between `y2` and `m`, `y2` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `y2 = 1` sets the value of `y2` to 1.
- All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
- The condition "the absolute difference between `y2` and 1 is less than the absolute difference between `y2` and `m`" is now trivially true because `y2` is 1, and the absolute difference between 1 and 1 is 0, which is always less than the absolute difference between 1 and any other value of `m` (since `m` is `r[1]` and `r[1]` is not 1).
- The value of `t` is updated to `abs(1 - y1)` because `y2` is now 1.
- The value of `a` is updated based on the new value of `y2` (which is 1). If `y1` is greater than or equal to 1, then `a` is `y2 - 1` (which is 0), and `y1` is `r[3] + 1`. Otherwise, `a` is `r[1] - y2` (which is `r[1] - 1`), and `y1` is `r[3] - 1`.
- All other conditions and relationships remain valid.
