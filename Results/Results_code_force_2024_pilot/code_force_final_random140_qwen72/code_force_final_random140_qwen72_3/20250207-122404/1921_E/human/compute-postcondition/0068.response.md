Postcondition: **`n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x1` is `x1 + a`, `y1` is `r[3]`, `x2` is `r[4] - a`, `y2` is `r[5]`, `x2` is greater than `x1`, the difference between `x2` and `x1` is even, `y1` is not equal to `y2`, if `y2` is greater than or equal to `y1`, then `a` is `y1 - 1`, if `y2` is less than `y1`, then `a` is `m - y1`, `b` is `x2 - x1` (a positive even number), `t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`, `x2` is greater than `x1`, `x1` is greater than or equal to 1, and `x2` is less than or equal to `n`. Additionally, the absolute value of `y1 - 1` is less than the absolute value of `y1 - m`.**
