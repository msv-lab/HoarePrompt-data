Postcondition: ***`n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x1` is `r[2] + 1`, `x2` is `r[4]`, `x2` is greater than `x1`, the difference between `x2` and `x1` is an odd number, and `y1` is not equal to `y2`. If `y1` is greater than or equal to `y2`, then `y1` is `r[3] + 1` and `a` is `y2 - 1`. Otherwise, `y1` is `r[3] - 1` and `a` is `r[1] - y2`.***
