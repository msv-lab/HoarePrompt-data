The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the given parameter constraints, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts multiple parameters to process each test case. The parameters include:

- `t`: An integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, the function accepts six integers:
  - `h`: An integer where 1 ≤ h ≤ 10^6, representing the height of a grid.
  - `w`: An integer where 1 ≤ w ≤ 10^9, representing the width of a grid.
  - `x_a`: An integer where 1 ≤ x_a ≤ h, representing the x-coordinate of point A.
  - `y_a`: An integer where 1 ≤ y_a ≤ w, representing the y-coordinate of point A.
  - `x_b`: An integer where 1 ≤ x_b ≤ h, representing the x-coordinate of point B.
  - `y_b`: An integer where 1 ≤ y_b ≤ w, representing the y-coordinate of point B.

It is also mentioned that either `x_a ≠ x_b` or `y_a ≠ y_b` for each test case, ensuring that points A and B are distinct.

The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the input parameters. Since the specific output is not detailed, we can infer that the function might return some form of distance or relationship between the two points (A and B) on the grid.

Functionality: **The function accepts a number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it accepts six integers `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`. It processes each test case and returns a result based on the relationship or distance between the points A (`x_a`, `y_a`) and B (`x_b`, `y_b`) on a grid of dimensions `h` by `w`.**
