Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
   - `test_cases` is an input integer and must be equal to the number of iterations the loop has executed.
   - `i` is equal to `test_cases - 1`.
   - `answers` is a list containing at least one element ('Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice').
   - `j` is the first element in `answers`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(j)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `j` is assigned the first element of the list `answers`.
   - Since `answers` is a list containing at least one element, and the elements can be either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice', the value of `j` will be one of these three strings.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print(j)` statement will print the first element of the list `answers`.

Therefore, the output will be one of the following strings: 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice'.

Output: **j (where j is the first element of the list answers, which can be 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice')**
