The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the list `answers`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `answers`. If there are more elements in `answers`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is the second element in `answers`, and `answers` is a list containing at least two elements.

For the loop to execute one more time, `answers` must have at least three elements, and `j` should be the third element in `answers`.

State: **`t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is an input integer and must be equal to the number of iterations the loop has executed, `i` is equal to `test_cases - 1`, `answers` is a list containing at least three elements ('Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice'), `j` is the third element in `answers`**
