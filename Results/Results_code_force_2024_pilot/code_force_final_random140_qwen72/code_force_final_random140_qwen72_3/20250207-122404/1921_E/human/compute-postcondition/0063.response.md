Output State: **`n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x1` is `x1 + a`, `y1` is `r[3]`, `x2` is `r[4] - a`, `y2` is `r[5]`, `x2` is greater than `x1`, the difference between `x2` and `x1` is even, `y1` is not equal to `y2`, if `y2` is greater than or equal to `y1`, then `a` is `y1 - 1`, if `y2` is less than `y1`, then `a` is `m - y1`, `b` is `x2 - x1` (a positive even number), `t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `x2` is updated to `r[4] - a`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged. The difference between `x2` and `x1` remains even, and `x2` is still greater than `x1`. The values of `n`, `m`, `y1`, `y2`, `b`, and `t` remain the same. The value of `a` is determined based on the conditions involving `y1` and `y2`.
