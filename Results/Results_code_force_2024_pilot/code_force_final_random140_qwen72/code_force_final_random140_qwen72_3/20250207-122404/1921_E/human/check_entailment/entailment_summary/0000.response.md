Reasoning:  
The program aims to simulate a game where Alice and Bob move their chips on a board, with specific rules for movement and winning conditions. The logic of the program is complex, involving checks for the parity of the distance between the chips, their relative positions, and whether certain moves would lead to a win or a draw. 

However, there are a few issues with the program:

1. **Function Call Order**: The function `func_1()` is called before it is defined, which will result in a `NameError` in Python. The function should be defined before it is called in the loop.

2. **Logic for Even and Odd Distances**: The program distinguishes between even and odd distances between the chips. However, the logic for determining the winner or a draw is intricate and may not cover all edge cases correctly. For example, the conditions for moving the chips and checking for a draw might not be fully accurate.

3. **Boundary Conditions**: The program checks for boundary conditions (e.g., `if x2 <= x1 or x1 < 1 or x2 > n:`), but these checks might not be comprehensive enough to handle all possible edge cases, especially when the chips are near the edges of the board.

4. **Simplification Needed**: The logic for determining the winner or a draw is overly complex and could be simplified. For instance, the conditions for Alice or Bob winning should be more straightforward and easier to verify.

Given these issues, the program is not entirely correct and may produce incorrect results for some test cases.

Correctness: **False**
