Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic for determining the winner or a draw is flawed in certain scenarios. Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Test Case:**
```
1
4 4 1 1 4 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Draw
```

**Actual Output:**
The program might incorrectly output "Alice" or "Bob" instead of "Draw".

In this scenario, Alice starts at (1, 1) and Bob starts at (4, 4). Both players are at the corners of the board, and neither can move into a position where they can win. Alice can only move down, down-right, or down-left, but none of these moves will allow her to capture Bob. Similarly, Bob can only move up, up-right, or up-left, but none of these moves will allow him to capture Alice. Therefore, the game should end in a draw. However, the program's logic does not correctly handle this scenario, leading to an incorrect output.
