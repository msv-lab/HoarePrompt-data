### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `tt` and iterates through each test case using a loop.
   - Inside the loop, it calls the function `func_1()` to process each test case.

2. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - The function reads the input values for each test case and assigns them to variables `n`, `m`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`.
   - It checks if `x2` is less than or equal to `x1`. If true, it prints "draw" and returns, which is correct because Bob cannot move up if he is already in the same or higher row than Alice.

3. **Parity Check**:
   - The function checks the parity of `(x2 - x1)`:
     - If `(x2 - x1)` is odd, it checks if `y1` equals `y2`. If true, Alice wins because she can move directly to Bob's position. If not, it adjusts `y1` and `x1` to simulate a move and checks again.
     - If `(x2 - x1)` is even, it performs similar checks but for Bob. If `y1` equals `y2`, Bob wins. Otherwise, it adjusts `y1` and `x1` and checks for winning conditions.

4. **Winning Conditions**:
   - The program correctly handles the conditions where Alice or Bob can win by moving to the same position as the other player.
   - It also checks for draw conditions where neither player can force a win due to the board boundaries or the positions of the chips.

5. **Boundary Checks**:
   - The program ensures that the new positions of the chips do not go beyond the board boundaries by checking `1 <= x1 <= n` and `1 <= y1 <= m`.

6. **Optimal Play**:
   - The logic assumes optimal play by both players, which is consistent with the problem statement.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Initial Position Check**:
  - The condition `if x2 <= x1:` correctly identifies a draw because Bob cannot move up if he is in the same or higher row than Alice.

- **Odd Parity Case**:
  - If `(x2 - x1)` is odd:
    - The condition `if y1 == y2:` correctly identifies that Alice can win by moving directly to Bob's position.
    - If `y1 != y2`, the program simulates a move and checks again, which is a valid approach to determine if Alice can win.

- **Even Parity Case**:
  - If `(x2 - x1)` is even:
    - The condition `if y1 == y2:` correctly identifies that Bob can win by moving directly to Alice's position.
    - If `y1 != y2`, the program simulates a move and checks again, which is a valid approach to determine if Bob can win.

- **Boundary and Draw Conditions**:
  - The program correctly checks if the new positions of the chips go beyond the board boundaries and handles these cases by printing "draw".

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly handle all the conditions specified in the problem description and follows the rules of the game. The logic is sound and the boundary checks are appropriate. Therefore, the program is correct.

Final: **True**
