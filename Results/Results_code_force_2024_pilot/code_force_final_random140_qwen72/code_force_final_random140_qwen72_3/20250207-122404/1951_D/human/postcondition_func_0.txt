The function `func_1` reads two positive integers `n` and `k` from user input for each test case, where `1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18`. It evaluates whether `n` can be split into two parts such that one part is `k - 1` and the other is `n - k + 1`. If `n < k`, it prints 'NO'. If `n == k`, it prints 'YES' followed by two lines, each containing the number `1`. If `n > k` and `2k < n + 2`, it prints 'YES', followed by `2`, and then the values `n - k + 1` and `1`. If `n > k` and `2k ≥ n + 2`, it prints 'NO'. The function processes up to 1000 test cases, each time reading new values for `n` and `k`. After processing each test case, the function does not modify the values of `n` and `k` for subsequent test cases.
