Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles multiple test cases by using a loop to call `func_1()` for each test case.
2. **Base Case Check**: The program checks if `n < k` and prints 'NO' if true, which is correct because Alice cannot buy more jewels than she has coins.
3. **Exact Match Case**: If `n == k`, the program prints 'YES' followed by `1` and `1`, which is correct because Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels at a single stall with a price of `1` coin per jewel.
4. **Two-Stall Solution**: The program attempts to find a solution with two stalls. It checks if `k - 1 < n - k + 1` and prints 'YES' followed by `2` and the values `n - k + 1` and `1`. This condition ensures that Alice can buy `k - 1` jewels at the first stall and 1 jewel at the second stall, totaling `k` jewels.
5. **No Solution Case**: If none of the above conditions are met, the program prints 'NO', which is correct because it means it's impossible to set up the stalls to meet the requirements.

However, the program does not consider the possibility of setting up more than two stalls, which might be necessary for some cases. For example, if `n = 7` and `k = 3`, the current logic would print 'NO', but a valid solution exists with more than two stalls (e.g., `2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11`).

Given the problem constraints and the need to ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels, the program should be able to handle more complex scenarios by setting up more stalls if needed.

Correctness: **False**
