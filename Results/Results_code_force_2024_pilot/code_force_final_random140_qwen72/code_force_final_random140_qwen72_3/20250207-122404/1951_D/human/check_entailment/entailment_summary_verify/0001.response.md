### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case using a loop.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k` from the input.

2. **Base Case Check**:
   - **If `n < k`**: The program prints "NO" because Alice cannot buy more jewels than she has coins. This is correct.
   - **If `n == k`**: The program prints "YES" and sets up one stall with a price of 1. This is correct because Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels from one stall if each jewel costs 1 coin.

3. **Intermediate Case Check**:
   - **If `k - 1 < n - k + 1`**: The program prints "YES" and sets up two stalls with prices `n - k + 1` and 1. This ensures that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels:
     - She buys `k - 1` jewels from the first stall.
     - She buys 1 jewel from the second stall.
   - **Else**: If none of the above conditions are met, it prints "NO".

### Analysis of Conditions:
- **Condition 1 (`n < k`)**: Correct. If Alice has fewer coins than the number of jewels Bob wants her to buy, it is impossible.
- **Condition 2 (`n == k`)**: Correct. If Alice has exactly the same number of coins as the number of jewels, she can buy all the jewels from one stall priced at 1 coin per jewel.
- **Condition 3 (`k - 1 < n - k + 1`)**: This condition ensures that Alice can buy `k - 1` jewels from the first stall and 1 jewel from the second stall. This is a valid setup because:
  - The first stall price `n - k + 1` ensures that Alice can buy `k - 1` jewels.
  - The second stall price 1 ensures that Alice buys the remaining 1 jewel.
- **Else Condition**: If none of the above conditions are met, it prints "NO". This is correct because if Alice cannot satisfy the conditions with the given constraints, it is impossible to set up the stalls to meet Bob's requirement.

### Additional Considerations:
- The program only considers up to 2 stalls, which is within the limit of 60 stalls.
- The program does not consider more complex scenarios with more than 2 stalls, but it is not necessary because the conditions cover all possible cases for the given constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the given conditions and outputs the correct results for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**
