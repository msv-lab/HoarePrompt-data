Correctness: **False**

The provided solution does not fully address the problem requirements. Specifically, it fails to handle the general case where the number of stalls can be more than 2, and it does not provide a valid configuration of stall prices when `n` is significantly larger than `k`. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Handling the General Case**: The solution only considers the cases where `n < k`, `n == k`, and `k - 1 < n - k + 1`. It does not handle the scenario where `k` is much smaller than `n` and requires more than 2 stalls to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

2. **Stall Configuration**: The solution only prints 1 or 2 stalls, which is insufficient for the problem constraints. The problem allows up to 60 stalls, and the solution should be able to generate a valid configuration of stall prices for any valid `n` and `k`.

3. **Correctness of Output**: For the case where `k - 1 < n - k + 1`, the solution prints `n - k + 1` and `1` as the stall prices. This is not always correct, especially when `k` is large and `n` is much larger.

To correctly solve the problem, a more comprehensive approach is needed. Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def solve():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        if n < k:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        # If n >= k, we can always find a valid configuration
        print('YES')
        
        # We need to set up stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels
        # One simple way is to use powers of 2 for the first k-1 stalls
        # and the remaining coins for the last stall
        prices = []
        remaining_coins = n
        for i in range(k - 1):
            price = 1 << i  # 2^i
            if remaining_coins >= price:
                prices.append(price)
                remaining_coins -= price
            else:
                break
        
        # Add the remaining coins to the last stall
        prices.append(remaining_coins)
        
        # Print the number of stalls and their prices
        print(len(prices))
        print(' '.join(map(str, prices)))

solve()
```

This solution ensures that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels by using a combination of powers of 2 for the first `k-1` stalls and the remaining coins for the last stall. This approach guarantees that the total number of stalls is at most 60 and that the prices are within the allowed range.
