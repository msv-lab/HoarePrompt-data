Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program fails to handle certain cases correctly. Specifically, it does not always provide a valid solution when it is possible to set up the stalls to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. Here is a specific case where the program fails:

### Test Case:
```
Input:
1
10 3
```

### Expected Output:
```
YES
3
3 3 4
```

### Actual Output:
```
NO
```

### Explanation:
- In this case, Alice has 10 coins and Bob wants her to buy exactly 3 jewels.
- The program incorrectly outputs "NO".
- A valid solution would be to set up 3 stalls with prices 3, 3, and 4. Alice will buy:
  - 3 jewels from the first stall (spending 9 coins, leaving 1 coin).
  - 0 jewels from the second and third stalls (since she only has 1 coin left).

Thus, Alice buys exactly 3 jewels, which is the desired outcome. The program fails to recognize this valid configuration and incorrectly outputs "NO". Therefore, the program is incorrect.
