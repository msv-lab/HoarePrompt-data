### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles multiple test cases by iterating over the range defined by the input `t`.

2. **Base Conditions**:
   - **Case 1**: If `n < k`, the program correctly prints 'NO' because Alice cannot buy more jewels than she has coins.
   - **Case 2**: If `n == k`, the program correctly prints 'YES', followed by `1` and `1`. This is correct because Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels by setting up one stall with a price of `1` coin per jewel.

3. **Main Condition**:
   - **Case 3**: If `n > k` and `2k < n + 2`, the program prints 'YES', followed by `2` and the values `n - k + 1` and `1`. This is correct because:
     - Alice will buy `k - 1` jewels from the first stall with price `n - k + 1` coins each, spending `(k - 1) * (n - k + 1)` coins.
     - Alice will then have `n - (k - 1) * (n - k + 1)` coins left, which should be enough to buy the remaining `1` jewel from the second stall with price `1` coin.
     - The condition `2k < n + 2` ensures that `k - 1 < n - k + 1`, which means Alice can indeed buy `k - 1` jewels from the first stall and 1 jewel from the second stall.
   - **Case 4**: If `n > k` and `2k â‰¥ n + 2`, the program prints 'NO'. This is correct because it is impossible to set up the stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels under these conditions.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles edge cases where `n` and `k` are at their minimum and maximum values within the given constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if Bob can set up the stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. It handles all the specified conditions and edge cases correctly.

### Correctness:
**True**
