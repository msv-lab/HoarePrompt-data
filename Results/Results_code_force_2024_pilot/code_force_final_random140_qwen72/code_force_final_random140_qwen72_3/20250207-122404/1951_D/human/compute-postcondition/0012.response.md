Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `n` and `k` are positive integers provided by the user input, where \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\).
- `n` is greater than or equal to `k` (\(n \geq k\)).
- `n` is not equal to `k` (\(n \neq k\)).
- The condition \((k - 1 < n - k + 1)\) holds true, which simplifies to \(2k - 1 < n + 1\) or \(2k < n + 2\).

### Print Statement:
```python
print(n - k + 1, 1)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Condition Simplification**:
   - The condition \(2k < n + 2\) can be rewritten as \(2k - 2 < n\), which further simplifies to \(k - 1 < \frac{n}{2}\). This means \(k\) is less than half of \(n\) plus one.

2. **Expression Evaluation**:
   - The expression `n - k + 1` is evaluated as follows:
     - `n` is a positive integer.
     - `k` is a positive integer less than or equal to `n` but not equal to `n`.
     - `n - k` is a positive integer since \(n > k\).
     - Adding 1 to `n - k` results in a positive integer greater than `n - k`.

3. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement will output two values: `n - k + 1` and `1`.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output the value of `n - k + 1` followed by `1`.

Output: **n - k + 1, 1 (where n and k are positive integers such that n > k and 2k < n + 2)**
