The function `func_1` does not explicitly define any parameters in its signature. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it seems that the function might be designed to handle multiple test cases (indicated by `t`), where for each test case, two parameters `n` and `k` are considered. The constraints indicate that `t` is an integer ranging from 1 to 1000, and for each test case, `n` and `k` are positive integers ranging from 1 to 10^18.

Since the output is not specified, we can infer that the function likely processes these inputs and returns some result for each test case, but without more specific information about the output, we cannot definitively state what the function returns. However, given the context, a reasonable assumption is that the function processes each test case and returns a result for each.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by two positive integers `n` and `k` within the range 1 to 10^18. It returns a result for each test case.**
