Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` and `k` are positive integers provided by the user input, where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`. Additionally, `n` is not equal to `k`. The condition `(k - 1 < n - k + 1)` holds true, which simplifies to `2k - 1 < n + 1` or `2k < n + 2`.**
