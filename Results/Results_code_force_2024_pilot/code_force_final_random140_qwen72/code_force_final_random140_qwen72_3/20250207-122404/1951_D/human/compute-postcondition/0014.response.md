Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `n` and `k` are positive integers provided by the user input, where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.
- `n` is not equal to `k`.
- The condition `(k - 1 < n - k + 1)` is false, which means `(k - 1)` is greater than or equal to `(n - k + 1)`.

Given this information, the condition `(k - 1 < n - k + 1)` being false implies that the inequality `(k - 1) >= (n - k + 1)` holds true.

The code snippet is:
```python
print('NO')
```

Since the condition `(k - 1 < n - k + 1)` is false, the code will execute the `print('NO')` statement.

Output: **NO**
