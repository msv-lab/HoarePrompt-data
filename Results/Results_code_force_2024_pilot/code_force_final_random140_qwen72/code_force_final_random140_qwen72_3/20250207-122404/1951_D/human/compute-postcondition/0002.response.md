Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 1000.
- `n` and `k` are positive integers provided by user input, with both values ranging from 1 to 10^18.
- It is explicitly stated that the current value of `n` is less than `k`.

Given this information, the code snippet provided is:

```python
print('NO')
```

This `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `n`, or `k`. It simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **NO**
