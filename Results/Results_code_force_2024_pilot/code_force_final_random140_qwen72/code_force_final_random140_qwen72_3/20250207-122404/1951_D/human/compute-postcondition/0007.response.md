Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `n` and `k` are positive integers provided by the user input, where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18.
- It is explicitly stated that `n` is equal to `k`.

Given this information, the `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print(1)
```

This statement simply prints the integer `1`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the statement does not reference any of these variables.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **1**
