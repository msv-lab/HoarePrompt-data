The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the integer `1`.

Based on the initial state:
- `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 1000.
- `n` and `k` are positive integers provided by user input, with both values ranging from 1 to 10^18.
- It is explicitly stated that `n` is equal to `k`.

However, none of these variables (`t`, `n`, or `k`) are used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement simply outputs the constant integer `1`.

Output: **1**
