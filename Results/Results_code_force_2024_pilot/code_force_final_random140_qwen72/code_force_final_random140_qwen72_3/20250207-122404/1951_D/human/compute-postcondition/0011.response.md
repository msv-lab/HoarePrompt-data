The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement:

```python
print(2)
```

This statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It simply prints the integer `2`.

Therefore, regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, and `k`, or the condition `(k - 1 < n - k + 1)`, the output will always be:

Output: **2**
