You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n and k are positive integers where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18.
def func_1():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    if (n < k) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    else :
        if (n == k) :
            print('YES')
            #This is printed: YES
            print(1)
            #This is printed: 1
            print(1)
            #This is printed: 1
        else :
            if (k - 1 < n - k + 1) :
                print('YES')
                #This is printed: YES
                print(2)
                #This is printed: 2
                print(n - k + 1, 1)
                #This is printed: n - k + 1, 1 (where n and k are positive integers such that n > k and 2k < n + 2)
            else :
                print('NO')
                #This is printed: NO
            #State: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` and `k` are positive integers provided by the user input, where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`. Additionally, `n` is not equal to `k`. If `2k < n + 2`, then the condition `(k - 1 < n - k + 1)` holds true. Otherwise, `(k - 1) ≥ (n - k + 1)`.
        #State: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` and `k` are positive integers provided by the user input, where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `n` is equal to `k`, no further changes are made. If `n` is greater than `k`, then if `2k < n + 2`, the condition `(k - 1 < n - k + 1)` holds true. Otherwise, `(k - 1) ≥ (n - k + 1)`.
    #State: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` and `k` are positive integers provided by the user input, where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. If `n` < `k`, no changes are made. If `n` ≥ `k`, then if `n` = `k`, no further changes are made. If `n` > `k`, then if `2k < n + 2`, the condition `(k - 1 < n - k + 1)` holds true. Otherwise, `(k - 1) ≥ (n - k + 1)`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by two positive integers `n` and `k` within the range 1 to 10^18. It returns a result for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
