The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` must still satisfy the conditions given in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` and `k` are positive integers provided by the user input, where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18.**
