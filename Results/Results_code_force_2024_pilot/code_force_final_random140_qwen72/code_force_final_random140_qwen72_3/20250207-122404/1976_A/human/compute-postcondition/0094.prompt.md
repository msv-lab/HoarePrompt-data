Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and test_cases is a list of t elements where each element is a tuple (n, s), with n being a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and s being a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits. `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for n, password in test_cases:
    letters = ''
    digits = ''
    for ch in password:
        if ch.isalpha():
            letters += ch
        elif ch.isdigit():
            digits += ch
    if list(letters) != sorted(letters) or list(digits) != sorted(digits):
        results.append('NO')
        continue
    if letters and digits and password.index(letters[-1]) > password.index(
        digits[0]):
        results.append('NO')
    else:
        results.append('YES')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of t elements where each element is a tuple (n, s), with n being a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and s being a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits. `(n, password)` is the first element in `test_cases`, `password` is a non-empty string. After the loop has executed all iterations, `letters` contains all the lowercase Latin letters from `password` in the order they appear, and `digits` contains all the digits from `password` in the order they appear. If `letters` and `digits` are both non-empty and the last letter in `letters` appears after the first digit in `digits` in the `password`, then `results` is a list containing the element 'NO'. Otherwise, `results` is a list containing the element 'YES'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of `t` elements where each element is a tuple `(n, s)`, with `n` being a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and `s` being a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits. `(n, password)` is the second element in `test_cases`, `password` is a non-empty string. After the loop has executed all iterations, `letters` contains all the alphabetic characters from `password` in the order they appear, and `digits` contains all the digit characters from `password` in the order they appear. If either the list of `letters` is not sorted in ascending order or the list of `digits` is not sorted in ascending order, `results` is a list containing the string 'NO' and the current iteration of the loop is skipped. If `letters` and `digits` are both non-empty and the last character in `letters` appears after the first character in `digits` in the `password`, `results` contains one additional 'NO' string. Otherwise, `results` contains the string 'YES' appended to its existing content.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of `t` elements where each element is a tuple `(n, s)`, with `n` being a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and `s` being a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits. `(n, password)` is the third element in `test_cases`, `password` is a non-empty string, `letters` is a string containing all the alphabetic characters from `password` in the order they appear, and `digits` is a string containing all the digits from `password` in the order they appear. If `letters` and `digits` are both non-empty and the last character in `letters` appears after the first character in `digits` in the `password`, `results` is a list with one element 'NO'. Otherwise, if either the alphabetic characters in `letters` are not in sorted order, or the digits in `digits` are not in sorted order, `results` is a list with one element 'NO'. If neither of these conditions are met, `results` is a list with one element 'YES'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
