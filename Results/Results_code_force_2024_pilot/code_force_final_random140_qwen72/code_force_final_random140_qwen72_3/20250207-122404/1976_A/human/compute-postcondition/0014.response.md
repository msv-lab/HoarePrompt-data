The code snippet `digits += ch` appends the value of `ch` to the string `digits`. Given the initial state, `ch` is the second character in `password`, which is part of the first element `(n, password)` in the `test_cases` list. If `ch` is a digit, it will be appended to `digits`. If `ch` is not a digit, `digits` will remain unchanged.

Since the initial state specifies that if `ch` is a digit, `digits` is a string containing the current character `ch`, and `letters` remains an empty string, the code snippet will only affect `digits`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of t elements where each element is a tuple (n, s), with n being a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and s being a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `results` is an empty list, `test_cases` must have at least 1 element, `(n, password)` is the first element in `test_cases`, `password` is a non-empty string, `ch` is the second character in `password`, `digits` is a string containing the current character `ch`, and `letters` remains an empty string.**
