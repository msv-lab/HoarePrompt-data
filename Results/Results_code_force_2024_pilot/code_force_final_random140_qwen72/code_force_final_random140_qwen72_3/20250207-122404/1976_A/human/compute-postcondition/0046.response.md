Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of `t` elements where each element is a tuple `(n, s)`, `(n, password)` is the second element in `test_cases`, `password` is a non-empty string, `ch` is the second character of `password`. If `ch` is a digit, `digits` contains the first character of `password` followed by `ch` and `letters` remains an empty string. If `ch` is an alphabetic character, `digits` remains an empty string and `letters` contains the first character of `password`.***
