The only object in the loop head is the variable `ch`, which is derived from iterating over the string `password`. Therefore, we can only adjust the state of `ch` and its relation to `password`.

At the end of the last iteration, `ch` was the second character of `password`. For the loop to execute one more time, `ch` must now be the third character of `password`. The conditions regarding `letters` and `digits` depend on the value of `ch` but are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted directly in this context.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of `t` elements where each element is a tuple `(n, s)`, with `n` being a positive integer such that 1 <= n >= 20, and `s` being a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits. `(n, password)` is the second element in `test_cases`, `password` is a non-empty string, and `ch` is the third character of `password`. If `ch` is an alphabetic character, `letters` contains the first three characters of `password` and `digits` remains an empty string. If `ch` is a digit, `digits` contains the first two characters of `password` and `letters` remains an empty string.**
