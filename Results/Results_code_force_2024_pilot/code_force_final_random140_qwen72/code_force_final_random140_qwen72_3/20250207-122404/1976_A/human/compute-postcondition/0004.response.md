The only objects in the loop head are the variable `ch` and the string `password`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `password`. If `password` is a non-empty string, the loop will execute. Given that `test_cases` must have at least 1 element and `(n, password)` is the first element in `test_cases`, we need to ensure that `password` is not empty.

Since `password` is part of the first element in `test_cases` and `test_cases` must have at least one element, `password` should be a string of length `n` where `1 <= n <= 20`. Therefore, `password` must be a non-empty string for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of t elements where each element is a tuple (n, s), with n being a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and s being a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `results` is an empty list, `test_cases` must have at least 1 element, `(n, password)` is the first element in `test_cases`, `password` is a non-empty string, `letters` is an empty string, `digits` is an empty string**
