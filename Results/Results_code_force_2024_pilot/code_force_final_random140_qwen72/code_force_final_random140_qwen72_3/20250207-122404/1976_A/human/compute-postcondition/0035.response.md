The only objects in the loop head are the variable `ch` and the string `password`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `password`. If `password` is non-empty, the loop will execute. Given that `password` is already stated as a non-empty string, no adjustment is needed for `password` itself. However, for the loop to start, `ch` should be the first character of `password`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of t elements where each element is a tuple (n, s), with n being a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and s being a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits. `(n, password)` is the second element in `test_cases`, `password` is a non-empty string, `letters` is an empty string, `digits` is an empty string, `ch` is the first character of `password`**
