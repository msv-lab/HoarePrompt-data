Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes two parameters: a positive integer `t` and a list `test_cases` containing `t` tuples. Each tuple consists of a positive integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` made up of lowercase Latin letters and digits. The function evaluates each string in `test_cases` to determine if the alphabetic characters and digits within the string are in sorted order and if no alphabetic character appears after any digit. It returns a list `results` where each element is either 'YES' if the conditions are met for the corresponding string, or 'NO' if any condition is not met. **
