The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop explicitly shown in the provided code snippet, the `continue` statement would typically be used within a loop structure (like a `for` or `while` loop). In the context of the given initial state, the `continue` statement does not change any variable values but affects the flow control of the loop.

Given the initial state and the `continue` statement, the output state remains unchanged except for the fact that the loop iteration is skipped, and the next iteration (if any) will proceed.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of `t` elements where each element is a tuple `(n, s)`, with `n` being a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and `s` being a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits. `(n, password)` is the second element in `test_cases`, `password` is a non-empty string. After the loop has executed all iterations, `letters` contains all the alphabetic characters from `password` in the order they appear, and `digits` contains all the digit characters from `password` in the order they appear. Additionally, either the list of `letters` is not sorted in ascending order, or the list of `digits` is not sorted in ascending order. `results` is a list containing the string 'NO'. The current iteration of the loop is skipped.**
