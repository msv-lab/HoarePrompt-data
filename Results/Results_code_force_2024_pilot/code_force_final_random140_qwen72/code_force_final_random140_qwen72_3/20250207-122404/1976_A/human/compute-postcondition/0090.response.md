Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of `t` elements where each element is a tuple `(n, s)`, with `n` being a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and `s` being a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits. `(n, password)` is the third element in `test_cases`, `password` is a non-empty string, `letters` is a string containing all the alphabetic characters from `password` in the order they appear, and `digits` is a string containing all the digits from `password` in the order they appear. The alphabetic characters in `letters` are in sorted order, and the digits in `digits` are in sorted order. `letters` and `digits` are both non-empty, and the last character in `letters` appears after the first character in `digits` in the `password`. `results` is a list with one element 'NO'.** 

Explanation: The code appends the string 'NO' to the list `results`. Since `results` was initially unchanged, after the execution of the code, `results` now contains one element, which is 'NO'. All other variables and conditions remain the same as described in the initial state.
