Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of `t` elements where each element is a tuple `(n, s)`, with `n` being a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and `s` being a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits. `(n, password)` is the third element in `test_cases`, `password` is a non-empty string, `letters` is a string containing all the alphabetic characters from `password` in the order they appear, and `digits` is a string containing all the digits from `password` in the order they appear. If either the alphabetic characters in `letters` are not in sorted order, or the digits in `digits` are not in sorted order, `results` is a list with one element 'NO'. Otherwise, `results` remains unchanged.***
