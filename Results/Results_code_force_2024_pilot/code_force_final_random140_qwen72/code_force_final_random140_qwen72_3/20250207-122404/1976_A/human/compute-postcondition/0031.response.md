Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of t elements where each element is a tuple (n, s), with n being a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and s being a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits. `(n, password)` is the first element in `test_cases`, `password` is a non-empty string. After the loop has executed all iterations, `letters` contains all the lowercase Latin letters from `password` in the order they appear, and `digits` contains all the digits from `password` in the order they appear. If `letters` and `digits` are both non-empty and the last letter in `letters` appears after the first digit in `digits` in the `password`, then `results` is a list containing the element 'NO'. Otherwise, `results` is a list containing the element 'YES'.***
