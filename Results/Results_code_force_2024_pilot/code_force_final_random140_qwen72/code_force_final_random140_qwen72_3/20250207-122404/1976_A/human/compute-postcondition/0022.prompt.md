Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of t elements where each element is a tuple (n, s), with n being a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and s being a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `results` is an empty list, `test_cases` must have at least 1 element, `(n, password)` is the first element in `test_cases`, `letters` is an empty string, `digits` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for ch in password:
    if ch.isalpha():
        letters += ch
    elif ch.isdigit():
        digits += ch


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of t elements where each element is a tuple (n, s), with n being a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and s being a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `results` is an empty list, `test_cases` must have at least 1 element, `(n, password)` is the first element in `test_cases`, `password` is a non-empty string. If `ch` is a lowercase Latin letter, `letters` is a string containing the current character `ch`, and `digits` remains an empty string. If `ch` is a digit, `digits` is a string containing the current character `ch`, and `letters` remains an empty string. If `ch` is neither a lowercase Latin letter nor a digit, both `letters` and `digits` remain empty strings.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of t elements where each element is a tuple (n, s), with n being a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and s being a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits. `results` is an empty list, `(n, password)` is the first element in `test_cases`, `password` is a non-empty string, and `ch` is the second character in `password`. If `ch` is a lowercase Latin letter, `letters` is a string containing the current character `ch`, and `digits` remains an empty string. If `ch` is a digit, `digits` is a string containing the current character `ch`, and `letters` remains an empty string. If `ch` is neither a lowercase Latin letter nor a digit, both `letters` and `digits` remain empty strings.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of t elements where each element is a tuple (n, s), with n being a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and s being a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits. `results` is an empty list, `(n, password)` is the first element in `test_cases`, `password` is a non-empty string, and `ch` is the third character in `password`. If `ch` is a lowercase Latin letter, `letters` is updated to include the character `ch`, and `digits` remains an empty string. If `ch` is a digit, `digits` is updated to include the character `ch`, and `letters` remains an empty string. If `ch` is neither a lowercase Latin letter nor a digit, both `letters` and `digits` remain empty strings.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
