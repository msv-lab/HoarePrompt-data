The code snippet `results.append('NO')` adds the string `'NO'` to the list `results`. This operation modifies the `results` list by appending the string `'NO'` to it. No other variables are directly affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of `t` elements where each element is a tuple `(n, s)`, with `n` being a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and `s` being a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits. `(n, password)` is the second element in `test_cases`, `password` is a non-empty string. `letters` contains all the alphabetic characters from `password` in the order they appear, and `digits` contains all the digit characters from `password` in the order they appear. If either the list of `letters` is not sorted in ascending order or the list of `digits` is not sorted in ascending order, `results` is a list containing the string 'NO'. `letters` and `digits` are both non-empty lists, and the last character in `letters` appears after the first character in `digits` in the `password`. `results` now contains one additional 'NO' string.**
