Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of t elements where each element is a tuple (n, s), with n being a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and s being a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits. `results` is an empty list, `(n, password)` is the first element in `test_cases`, `password` is a non-empty string, and `ch` is the third character in `password`. If `ch` is a digit, `digits` is a string containing the current character `ch`, and `letters` remains an empty string. If `ch` is not a digit, `digits` remains an empty string and `letters` remains an empty string.**
