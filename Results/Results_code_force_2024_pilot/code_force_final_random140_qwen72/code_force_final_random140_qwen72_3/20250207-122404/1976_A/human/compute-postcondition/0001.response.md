To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the conditions that affect the loop head, which in this case involves the `test_cases` list and the tuple `(n, password)`.

1. **`test_cases` List**: The loop will only execute if `test_cases` is not empty. Since `t` is a positive integer and `test_cases` is a list of `t` elements, `test_cases` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.
2. **Tuple `(n, password)`**: This tuple is unpacked from `test_cases` during each iteration. For the first iteration, `n` and `password` should be set to the values of the first element in `test_cases`.

Given these points, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `test_cases` is not empty and that `n` and `password` are set to the values of the first element in `test_cases`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of t elements where each element is a tuple (n, s), with n being a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and s being a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `results` is an empty list, `test_cases` must have at least 1 element, `(n, password)` is the first element in `test_cases`**
