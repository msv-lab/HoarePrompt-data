The code snippet `letters += ch` appends the character `ch` to the string `letters`. Given the initial conditions:

- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `test_cases` is a list of `t` elements where each element is a tuple `(n, s)`, with `n` being a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and `s` being a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
- `(n, password)` is the third element in `test_cases`.
- `password` is a non-empty string.
- `ch` is the second character of `password`.
- If `ch` is an alphabetic character, `letters` is a string containing `ch`, and `digits` is an empty string.
- If `ch` is a digit, `letters` is an empty string, and `digits` is a string containing `ch`.

After executing the code snippet:

- If `ch` is an alphabetic character, `letters` will now contain `ch` twice, and `digits` remains an empty string.
- If `ch` is a digit, `letters` remains an empty string, and `digits` remains a string containing `ch`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of `t` elements where each element is a tuple `(n, s)`, with `n` being a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and `s` being a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits. `(n, password)` is the third element in `test_cases`, `password` is a non-empty string, `ch` is the second character of `password`. If `ch` is an alphabetic character, `letters` is a string containing `ch` repeated twice, and `digits` is an empty string. If `ch` is a digit, `letters` is an empty string, and `digits` is a string containing `ch`.**
