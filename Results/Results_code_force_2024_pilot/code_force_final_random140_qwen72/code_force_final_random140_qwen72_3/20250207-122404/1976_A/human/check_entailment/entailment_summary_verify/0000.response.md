### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and the function `func_1` to ensure that it meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

1. **Separation of Letters and Digits:**
   - The function iterates through each character in the password and separates them into two strings: `letters` and `digits`.
   - This step is crucial because it allows us to independently check the sorting of letters and digits.

2. **Checking Sorted Order:**
   - The function checks if the `letters` and `digits` strings are sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing them to their sorted versions.
   - If either `letters` or `digits` is not sorted, the function appends 'NO' to the results list and continues to the next test case.

3. **Checking No Digit After a Letter:**
   - If both `letters` and `digits` are present, the function checks if the last letter appears before the first digit in the password.
   - This is done using `password.index(letters[-1]) > password.index(digits[0])`. If this condition is true, it means a digit appears after a letter, and the function appends 'NO' to the results list.

4. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The function correctly handles cases where the password contains only letters or only digits.
   - It also handles cases where the password is empty or has a single character.

### Validation Against Example Test Cases:

1. **Test Case 1: "12ac"**
   - Letters: "ac" (sorted)
   - Digits: "12" (sorted)
   - No digit after a letter.
   - Output: "YES" (Correct)

2. **Test Case 2: "123wa"**
   - Letters: "aw" (not sorted)
   - Digits: "123" (sorted)
   - Output: "NO" (Correct)

3. **Test Case 3: "allllmost"**
   - Letters: "allllmost" (sorted)
   - Digits: "" (no digits)
   - Output: "YES" (Correct)

4. **Test Case 4: "ac123"**
   - Letters: "ac" (sorted)
   - Digits: "123" (sorted)
   - Digit '1' appears after letter 'c'.
   - Output: "NO" (Correct)

5. **Test Case 5: "011679"**
   - Letters: "" (no letters)
   - Digits: "011679" (sorted)
   - Output: "YES" (Correct)

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the conditions specified in the problem description. It accurately checks the sorting of letters and digits and ensures that no digit appears after a letter. The function `func_1` handles all edge cases and produces the correct output for the given test cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
