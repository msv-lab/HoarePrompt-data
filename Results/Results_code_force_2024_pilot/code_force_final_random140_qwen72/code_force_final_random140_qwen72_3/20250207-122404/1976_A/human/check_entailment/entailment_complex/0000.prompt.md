Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Monocarp is working on his new site, and the current challenge is to make the
users pick strong passwords.

Monocarp decided that strong passwords should satisfy the following
conditions:

  * password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits; 
  * there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends); 
  * all digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order; 
  * all letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order. 

Note that it's allowed for the password to have only letters or only digits.

Monocarp managed to implement the first condition, but he struggles with the
remaining ones. Can you help him to verify the passwords?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 20 )
— the length of the password.

The second line contains a string, consisting of exactly n characters. Each
character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if the given password is strong and "NO"
otherwise.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    12ac
    
    5
    
    123wa
    
    9
    
    allllmost
    
    5
    
    ac123
    
    6
    
    011679

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the second testcase, the letters are not sorted in the non-decreasing
order.

In the fourth testcase, there is a digit that comes after a letter — digit '1'
after a letter 'c'.

# Annotated Program:
t = int(input('Number of test cases, t = '))
test_cases = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input('Length of password, n: '))
    password = input('enter passowrd: ').strip()
    test_cases.append((n, password))
results = func_1(t, test_cases)
for result in results:
    print(result)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and test_cases is a list of t elements where each element is a tuple (n, s), with n being a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and s being a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, password) in test_cases:
        letters = ''
        
        digits = ''
        
        for ch in password:
            if ch.isalpha():
                letters += ch
            elif ch.isdigit():
                digits += ch
        
        if list(letters) != sorted(letters) or list(digits) != sorted(digits):
            results.append('NO')
            continue
        
        if letters and digits and password.index(letters[-1]) > password.index(digits
            [0]):
            results.append('NO')
        else:
            results.append('YES')
        
    #State: After the loop has executed all iterations, `t` remains a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and `test_cases` is a list of `t` elements where each element is a tuple `(n, s)`, with `n` being a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and `s` being a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits. The variable `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each `password` in `test_cases`. For each `password`, if the alphabetic characters in `letters` are not in sorted order, or the digits in `digits` are not in sorted order, or if `letters` and `digits` are both non-empty and the last character in `letters` appears after the first character in `digits` in the `password`, then the corresponding element in `results` is 'NO'. Otherwise, the corresponding element in `results` is 'YES'.
    return results
    #The program returns a list `results` containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each password in `test_cases`. Each element in `results` corresponds to whether the conditions for the respective password in `test_cases` are met. If the alphabetic characters are not in sorted order, or the digits are not in sorted order, or if the last alphabetic character appears after the first digit in the password, the corresponding element in `results` is 'NO'. Otherwise, it is 'YES'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes two parameters: a positive integer `t` and a list `test_cases` containing `t` tuples. Each tuple consists of a positive integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` made up of lowercase Latin letters and digits. The function evaluates each string in `test_cases` to determine if the alphabetic characters and digits within the string are in sorted order and if no alphabetic character appears after any digit. It returns a list `results` where each element is either 'YES' if the conditions are met for the corresponding string, or 'NO' if any condition is not met.
