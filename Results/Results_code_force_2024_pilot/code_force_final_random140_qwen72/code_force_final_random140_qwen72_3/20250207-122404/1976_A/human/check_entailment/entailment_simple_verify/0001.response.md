### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the password `n` and the password itself.
   - It stores these in a list `test_cases`.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `func_1` takes the number of test cases `t` and the list of test cases `test_cases` as arguments.
   - It initializes an empty list `results` to store the results for each test case.

3. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it separates the letters and digits from the password.
   - It checks if the letters and digits are sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If either the letters or digits are not sorted, it appends 'NO' to the results and continues to the next test case.
   - If both letters and digits are sorted, it checks if there is any digit that comes after a letter. This is done by ensuring that the last letter (if any) appears before the first digit (if any).

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the results for each test case.

### Analysis:
- **Condition 1:** The password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits. This is implicitly handled by the input format and the separation logic.
- **Condition 2:** There should be no digit that comes after a letter. This is checked by ensuring that the last letter (if any) appears before the first digit (if any). The check `password.index(letters[-1]) > password.index(digits[0])` ensures this condition.
- **Condition 3:** All digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order. This is checked by comparing the list of digits to its sorted version.
- **Condition 4:** All letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order. This is checked by comparing the list of letters to its sorted version.

### Verification Using Annotations:
- **State Before Function Call:**
  - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \le t \le 1000\).
  - `test_cases` is a list of `t` elements where each element is a tuple `(n, s)`, with `n` being a positive integer such that \(1 \le n \le 20\), and `s` being a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits.

- **State After Function Execution:**
  - `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each password in `test_cases`.
  - For each password, if the alphabetic characters in `letters` are not in sorted order, or the digits in `digits` are not in sorted order, or if `letters` and `digits` are both non-empty and the last character in `letters` appears after the first character in `digits` in the password, then the corresponding element in `results` is 'NO'. Otherwise, the corresponding element in `results` is 'YES'.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements all the conditions specified in the problem description. The annotations confirm that the program maintains the correct state and performs the necessary checks to ensure the validity of the passwords.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
