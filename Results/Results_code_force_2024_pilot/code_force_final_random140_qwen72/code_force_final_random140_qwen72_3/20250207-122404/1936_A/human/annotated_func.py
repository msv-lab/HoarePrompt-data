#State of the program right berfore the function call: a, b, c, and d are non-negative integers such that 0 <= a, b, c, d < n, where n is the length of the permutation p.
def func_1(a, b, c, d):
    print('?', a, b, c, d)
    #This is printed: ? a b c d (where a, b, c, and d are non-negative integers such that 0 <= a, b, c, d < n)
    return input()
    #The program returns the input provided by the user.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts four parameters `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`, which are non-negative integers. It prints a query string in the format `? a b c d` and then waits for user input. The function returns the input provided by the user. After the function concludes, the program has printed the query string and obtained a string input from the user, which is returned.
