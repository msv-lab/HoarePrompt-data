Precondition: **The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case involves a single integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), representing the length of the permutation to be generated. The total number of test cases, t, is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), and the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 10^5.**
