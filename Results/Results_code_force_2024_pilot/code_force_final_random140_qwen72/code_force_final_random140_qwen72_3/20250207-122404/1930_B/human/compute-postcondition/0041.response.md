The value of `i` is appended to the list `p`. Since the initial state specifies that `a` must be at least 1, and there is no direct impact on `a` from the given code, `a` remains unchanged. The list `p` now includes the value of `i`.

Output State: **`a` must be at least 1, `p` is a list that now includes the value of `i`.**
