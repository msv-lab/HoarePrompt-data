To determine what will be printed by the `print(*p)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the structure of the list `p`.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`a`**: This variable remains unchanged after the loop completes.
2. **`p`**: This list contains:
   - All even numbers from 2 up to and including `a` (if `a` is even) or `a - 1` (if `a` is odd).
   - Followed by all odd numbers from 1 up to and including `a` (if `a` is odd) or `a - 1` (if `a` is even).
3. **`i`**: This variable is `a + 1` if `a` is odd or `a + 2` if `a` is even.
4. **`t`**: This variable remains unchanged.

### Determining the Content of `p`:
- If `a` is even, `p` will contain:
  - Even numbers from 2 to `a`.
  - Odd numbers from 1 to `a - 1`.
- If `a` is odd, `p` will contain:
  - Even numbers from 2 to `a - 1`.
  - Odd numbers from 1 to `a`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's consider two cases to illustrate:

#### Case 1: `a` is even (e.g., `a = 6`)
- Even numbers: 2, 4, 6
- Odd numbers: 1, 3, 5
- Therefore, `p` will be: `[2, 4, 6, 1, 3, 5]`

#### Case 2: `a` is odd (e.g., `a = 7`)
- Even numbers: 2, 4, 6
- Odd numbers: 1, 3, 5, 7
- Therefore, `p` will be: `[2, 4, 6, 1, 3, 5, 7]`

### General Form:
- If `a` is even, `p` will be: `[2, 4, 6, ..., a, 1, 3, 5, ..., a-1]`
- If `a` is odd, `p` will be: `[2, 4, 6, ..., a-1, 1, 3, 5, ..., a]`

### Final Output:
The `print(*p)` statement will print the elements of the list `p` separated by spaces.

Output: **2 4 6 ... a 1 3 5 ... a-1 (if `a` is even) or 2 4 6 ... a-1 1 3 5 ... a (if `a` is odd)**

This output will vary depending on the value of `a`, but it will always follow the pattern described above.
