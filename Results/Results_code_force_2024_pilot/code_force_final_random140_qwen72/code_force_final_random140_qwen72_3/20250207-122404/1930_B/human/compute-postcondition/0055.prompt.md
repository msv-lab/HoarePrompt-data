Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case involves a single integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), representing the length of the permutation to be generated. The total number of test cases, t, is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), and the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    a = [int(i) for i in input().split()][0]
    p = []
    for i in range(2, a + 1, 2):
        p += [i]
    for i in range(1, a + 1, 2):
        p += [i]
    print(*p)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is `a` if `a` is odd or `a + 1` if `a` is even, `a` remains the same as the first integer from the input, `t` is a positive integer representing the total number of test cases, `p` is a list containing all even numbers from 2 up to `a` (inclusive if `a` is even, or up to `a - 1` if `a` is odd), followed by all odd numbers from 1 up to `a` (inclusive if `a` is odd, or up to `a - 1` if `a` is even).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the loop completes all iterations, `a` remains unchanged, `p` is a list containing all even numbers from 2 up to and including `a` (if `a` is even) or `a - 1` (if `a` is odd), followed by all odd numbers from 1 up to and including `a` (if `a` is odd) or `a - 1` (if `a` is even), `i` is `a + 1` if `a` is odd or `a + 2` if `a` is even, and `t` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After all iterations of the loop, `a` remains unchanged, `i` is the last odd number less than or equal to `a`, `p` is a list containing all even numbers from 2 up to and including `a` (if `a` is even) or `a-1` (if `a` is odd), followed by all odd numbers from 1 up to and including the last odd number less than or equal to `a`, and `t` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
