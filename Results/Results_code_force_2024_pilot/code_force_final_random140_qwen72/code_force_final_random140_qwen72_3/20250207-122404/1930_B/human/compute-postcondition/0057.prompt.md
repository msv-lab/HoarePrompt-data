You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case involves a single integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), representing the length of the permutation to be generated. The total number of test cases, t, is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), and the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        a = [int(i) for i in input().split()][0]
        
        p = []
        
        for i in range(2, a + 1, 2):
            p += [i]
        
        for i in range(1, a + 1, 2):
            p += [i]
        
        print(*p)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `a` remains unchanged for each test case, `p` is a list containing all even numbers from 2 up to and including `a` (if `a` is even) or `a - 1` (if `a` is odd), followed by all odd numbers from 1 up to and including `a` (if `a` is odd) or `a - 1` (if `a` is even). The variable `i` is no longer relevant after the loop completes, and `t` remains unchanged, representing the total number of test cases.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts the total number of test cases, `t`, and for each test case, an integer `n` representing the length of the permutation to be generated. It returns a permutation of length `n` for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
