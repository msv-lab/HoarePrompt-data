The code `p += [i]` appends the current value of `i` to the list `p`. Given that `i` is already `i + 2` from the initial state, and `p` already includes the value of `i + 2`, appending `i` again will add the same value to the list. The value of `a` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code.

Output State: **`a` must be at least 1, `p` is a list that now includes the value of `i + 2` twice, `i` is `i + 2`**
