Output State: **`a` must be at least 5, `p` is a list that now includes the value of `i + 4` three times, `i` is `i + 4`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `a` remains unchanged and must be at least 5.
- The list `p` initially includes the value of `i + 4` twice. After executing `p += [i]`, the list `p` now includes the value of `i + 4` three times.
- The value of `i` remains `i + 4` as it was before the code execution.
