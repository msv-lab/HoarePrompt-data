Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `a` remains unchanged.
- `i` is the last odd number less than or equal to `a`.
- `p` is a list containing:
  - All even numbers from 2 up to and including `a` (if `a` is even) or `a-1` (if `a` is odd).
  - Followed by all odd numbers from 1 up to and including the last odd number less than or equal to `a`.
- `t` remains unchanged.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*p)
```

### Explanation:
- The `print(*p)` statement will print the elements of the list `p` separated by spaces.
- The list `p` contains two segments:
  1. Even numbers from 2 up to and including `a` (if `a` is even) or `a-1` (if `a` is odd).
  2. Odd numbers from 1 up to and including the last odd number less than or equal to `a`.

### Example Scenarios:
1. If `a = 7`:
   - Even numbers: 2, 4, 6
   - Odd numbers: 1, 3, 5, 7
   - `p` will be `[2, 4, 6, 1, 3, 5, 7]`
   - Output: **2 4 6 1 3 5 7**

2. If `a = 8`:
   - Even numbers: 2, 4, 6, 8
   - Odd numbers: 1, 3, 5, 7
   - `p` will be `[2, 4, 6, 8, 1, 3, 5, 7]`
   - Output: **2 4 6 8 1 3 5 7**

### General Case:
- For any value of `a`, the list `p` will contain:
  - All even numbers from 2 up to and including `a` (if `a` is even) or `a-1` (if `a` is odd).
  - Followed by all odd numbers from 1 up to and including the last odd number less than or equal to `a`.

### Final Output:
Output: **2 4 6 ... (even numbers up to a or a-1) 1 3 5 ... (odd numbers up to the last odd number less than or equal to a)**

This output format ensures that the even numbers are printed first, followed by the odd numbers, with all numbers separated by spaces.
