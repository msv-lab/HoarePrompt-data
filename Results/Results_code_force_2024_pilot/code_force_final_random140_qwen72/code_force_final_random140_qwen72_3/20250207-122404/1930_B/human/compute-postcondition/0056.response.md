The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. Each test case involves generating a permutation of a specific length, `n`, where `n` is an integer within the range 3 to 10^5. The function accepts the total number of test cases, `t`, which is a positive integer ranging from 1 to 10^3. The sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 10^5. For each test case, the function generates and returns a permutation of length `n`.

Functionality: **The function accepts the total number of test cases, `t`, and for each test case, an integer `n` representing the length of the permutation to be generated. It returns a permutation of length `n` for each test case.**
