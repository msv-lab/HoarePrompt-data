Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case. For each test case, it reads the value of `n`.

2. **Permutation Construction**:
   - The function constructs the permutation `p` by first adding all even numbers from 2 to `n` (inclusive if `n` is even, or `n-1` if `n` is odd).
   - Then, it adds all odd numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive if `n` is odd, or `n-1` if `n` is even).

3. **Validation of Permutation**:
   - The constructed permutation ensures that no two distinct indices `i` and `j` (1 ≤ i, j < n; i ≠ j) exist such that `p[i]` divides `p[j]` and `p[i+1]` divides `p[j+1]`.
   - This is because the permutation alternates between even and odd numbers, which inherently avoids the condition where both `p[i]` divides `p[j]` and `p[i+1]` divides `p[j+1]`.

4. **Output**:
   - The function prints the permutation for each test case, which is the correct format as specified in the problem statement.

Given the above points, the program correctly handles the problem requirements and generates valid permutations for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
