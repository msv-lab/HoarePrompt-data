Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not correctly solve the problem as specified. The issue lies in the way the permutation `p` is constructed. The program constructs `p` by first adding all even numbers and then all odd numbers in ascending order. This approach does not guarantee that there will not exist two distinct indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}`.

For example, consider the input `n = 4`. The program will output `[2, 4, 1, 3]`. However, this permutation is invalid because for `i = 1` and `j = 3`, `p_1 = 2` divides `p_3 = 1` and `p_2 = 4` divides `p_4 = 3`.

A correct solution would need to ensure that no such pairs `(i, j)` exist. One possible correct approach is to alternate between the largest and smallest available numbers, which can help avoid the divisibility condition.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        p = list(range(1, n + 1))
        p[::2], p[1::2] = p[:n//2], p[n//2:]
        print(*p)
```

This version alternates between the first half and the second half of the permutation, ensuring that the divisibility condition is not violated.
