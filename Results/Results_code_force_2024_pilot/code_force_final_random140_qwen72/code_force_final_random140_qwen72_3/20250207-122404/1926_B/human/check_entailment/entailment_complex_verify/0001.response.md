### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the grid `n` and then reads `n` lines of input representing the grid.

2. **Shape Detection**:
   - The function uses two variables, `a` and `b`, to track whether a triangle or a square is detected.
   - For each row `s` in the grid:
     - If the row contains exactly one '1', it sets `a` to 'Triangle'.
     - If the row contains more than one '1', it sets `b` to 'Square'.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing all rows, if `a` is not zero (i.e., it was set to 'Triangle'), it prints 'Triangle'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'Square'.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Triangle Detection**:
  - The logic for detecting a triangle is flawed. A triangle can have multiple '1's in a row, especially as it grows larger. The current logic will incorrectly identify any row with more than one '1' as a square, even if it is part of a triangle.
  - The function does not check if the '1's in a triangle are centered around a single column, which is a requirement for a valid triangle.
- **No Central Column Check**:
  - The function does not verify that the '1's in a triangle are centered around a single column, which is a critical part of the triangle definition.
- **No Size Validation**:
  - The function does not validate the size of the shape to ensure it matches the definition of a triangle or square.

### Example Analysis:
- **Test Case 1**:
  - Grid:
    ```
    000
    011
    011
    ```
  - The function will set `b` to 'Square' because the second and third rows each contain more than one '1'. This is incorrect because the grid forms a square, but the function should also consider the structure of the '1's.

- **Test Case 2**:
  - Grid:
    ```
    0000
    0000
    0100
    1110
    ```
  - The function will set `a` to 'Triangle' because the third row contains exactly one '1'. This is incorrect because the grid forms a triangle, but the function should also consider the structure of the '1's.

- **Test Case 3**:
  - Grid:
    ```
    11
    11
    ```
  - The function will set `b` to 'Square' because both rows contain more than one '1'. This is correct, but the function should also verify the structure of the '1's.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly identify the shapes as per the problem description. It fails to accurately detect triangles and does not perform the necessary checks to ensure the shapes meet the required criteria.

### Correctness:
**False**

Final: **False**
