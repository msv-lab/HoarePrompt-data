Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly identify the shapes as described in the problem statement. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Shape Identification**: The code checks if a row has exactly one '1' to label the shape as a triangle and more than one '1' to label it as a square. This approach is flawed because:
   - A triangle can have rows with more than one '1'.
   - A square can have rows with exactly one '1' (e.g., the last row of a 2x2 square).

2. **Single Row Check**: The code only checks the count of '1's in each row independently. It does not consider the overall structure of the shape, which is crucial for identifying triangles and squares correctly.

3. **Variable Initialization and Usage**: The variables `a` and `b` are used to store the shape type, but they are not initialized properly. The variable `a` is set to 'Triangle' if any row has exactly one '1', and `b` is set to 'Square' if any row has more than one '1'. This logic is incorrect and can lead to misidentification of shapes.

To correctly solve this problem, you need to:
- Identify the center of the shape.
- Check the pattern of '1's in the grid to determine if it forms a triangle or a square.
- Ensure the entire shape is checked, not just individual rows.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def is_triangle(grid, n):
    # Check for both normal and upside-down triangles
    for direction in [1, -1]:
        for start_row in range(n):
            for start_col in range(n):
                k = 1
                while start_row + (k - 1) * direction < n and start_col + (k - 1) * 2 < n:
                    row = start_row + (k - 1) * direction
                    col = start_col + (k - 1)
                    if col < 0 or col >= n or row < 0 or row >= n:
                        break
                    if grid[row][col] != '1':
                        break
                    k += 1
                if k > 1:
                    return True
    return False

def is_square(grid, n):
    for start_row in range(n):
        for start_col in range(n):
            k = 1
            while start_row + (k - 1) < n and start_col + (k - 1) < n:
                for i in range(k):
                    for j in range(k):
                        if start_row + i >= n or start_col + j >= n or grid[start_row + i][start_col + j] != '1':
                            break
                    else:
                        continue
                    break
                else:
                    return True
                k += 1
    return False

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        grid = [input() for _ in range(n)]
        
        if is_triangle(grid, n):
            print("TRIANGLE")
        elif is_square(grid, n):
            print("SQUARE")
        else:
            print("UNKNOWN")  # This should not happen as per the problem constraints

func()
```

This corrected version checks for both triangles and squares by iterating through possible starting points and sizes, ensuring the shape is identified correctly.
