Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by checking each row of the grid to see if it contains exactly one '1' or more than one '1'. However, this approach is flawed because it does not correctly identify the shapes as defined in the problem statement. Here are the specific issues:

1. **Incorrect Shape Identification**:
   - The program assumes that if any row contains exactly one '1', the shape is a triangle. This is incorrect because a triangle can have multiple '1's in a row, especially as the triangle grows larger.
   - The program assumes that if any row contains more than one '1', the shape is a square. This is also incorrect because a triangle can have rows with more than one '1'.

2. **Lack of Pattern Recognition**:
   - The program does not check the pattern of '1's to determine if they form a triangle or a square. For example, a triangle should have rows with an increasing or decreasing number of '1's centered around a column, while a square should have rows with a constant number of '1's aligned in a rectangular pattern.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the shape might be an upside-down triangle or a square with a different alignment.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly identify the shapes as required by the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
