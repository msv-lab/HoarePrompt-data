Output State: **`t` is 0, `i` is `t-1`, `n` is the last input integer, `j` is `n-1`, and `s` is the last input string processed. If any of the input strings contained exactly one '1' character, `a` is 'Triangle'. Otherwise, `a` is 0. If any of the input strings contained more than one '1' character, `b` is 'Square'. Otherwise, `b` is an empty string.**

Explanation:
- After the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` becomes 0 because the loop has run `t` times.
- `i` is `t-1` because the loop runs from 0 to `t-1`.
- `n` is the last input integer provided during the final iteration.
- `j` is `n-1` because the inner loop runs from 0 to `n-1`.
- `s` is the last input string processed during the final iteration.
- `a` is 'Triangle' if any of the input strings contained exactly one '1' character; otherwise, it remains 0.
- `b` is 'Square' if any of the input strings contained more than one '1' character; otherwise, it remains an empty string.
