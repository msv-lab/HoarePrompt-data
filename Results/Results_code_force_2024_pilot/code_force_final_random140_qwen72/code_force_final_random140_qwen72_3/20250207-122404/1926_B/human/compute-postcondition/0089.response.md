Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 2, `n` is the new input integer, `j` is `n-1`, `s` is the last input string processed. At least one of the input strings contained exactly one '1' character, so `a` is 'Triangle'. `b` is either 'Square' if any of the input strings contained more than one '1' character, or an empty string otherwise.**
