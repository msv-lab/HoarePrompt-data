To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for j in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The only variable in the loop head is `n`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. This is because `range(n)` generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to `n-1`, and this sequence is non-empty only if `n` is greater than 0.

3. **Adjust the States:**
   - The state of `n` must be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute. Specifically, `n` must be greater than 0.

4. **Other Variables:**
   - The other variables (`t`, `i`, `j`, `s`, `a`, `b`) are not directly involved in the loop head and do not affect whether the loop will execute. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted.

### Final Adjusted State:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- The other variables (`t`, `i`, `j`, `s`, `a`, `b`) remain as they are.

### State:
**`t` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is `n-1`, `s` is the last input string processed. If any of the input strings contained exactly one '1' character, `a` is 0. Otherwise, `a` is 0. `b` is an empty string.**
