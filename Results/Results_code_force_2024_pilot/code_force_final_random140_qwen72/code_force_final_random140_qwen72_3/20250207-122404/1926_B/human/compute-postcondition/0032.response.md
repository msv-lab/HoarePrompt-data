The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `t` is an integer between 1 and 100. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 1, and `t` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `j` is `n-1`, and `s` is the last input string processed. If any input string contained exactly one '1', then `a` is 'Triangle' and `b` remains an empty string unless a previous input string contained more than one '1'. Otherwise, `a` is 0, and `b` will be 'Square' if any input string contained more than one '1', otherwise `b` remains an empty string.**
