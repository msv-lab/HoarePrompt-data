The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the problem description, it implicitly accepts multiple inputs through a mechanism like reading from standard input or another source. These inputs include:

- An integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) indicating the number of test cases.
- For each test case, an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10) indicating the size of the grid.
- A grid of size `n x n` where each cell contains either '0' or '1'. This grid is represented by `n` lines, each line containing `n` characters.

The function processes each test case to determine if the grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all '1's, with the constraint that the shape cannot consist of exactly one '1'.

Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and an `n x n` grid of '0's and '1's. It returns the shape (triangle or square) that includes all '1's in the grid, ensuring that the shape does not consist of exactly one '1'.**
