The value of `b` is set to 'Square'. The conditions regarding the string `s` and the variables `a` and `b` are updated based on the assignment. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `j`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is `n`, `s` is the new input string, `a` remains unchanged if `s` does not contain exactly one '1'. If `s` contains exactly one '1', `a` is set to 'Triangle'. `b` is set to 'Square'.**
