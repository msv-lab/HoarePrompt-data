Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `j` is `n-1`, `s` is the last input string processed. The value of `a` is 'Triangle' because at least one input string contained exactly one '1'. The value of `b` remains an empty string unless a previous input string contained more than one '1'.**
