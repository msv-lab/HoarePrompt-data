Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is `n-1`, `s` is the new input string, `a` is 0, and the count of '1' in `s` is not equal to 1. If the count of '1' in `s` is greater than 1, `b` is set to 'Square'. Otherwise, `b` remains an empty string.***
