Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 1, `n` is the new input integer, `j` is `n-1`, `s` is the last input string processed. If any of the input strings contained exactly one '1' character, `a` is 'Triangle'. If any of the input strings contained more than one '1' character, `b` is 'Square'. If no input strings contained exactly one '1' character, `a` remains 0. If no input strings contained more than one '1' character, `b` remains an empty string.**

This means that after the loop has completed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` remains an integer between 1 and 100.
- The variable `i` remains 1.
- The variable `n` remains the same as the initial input integer.
- The variable `j` is now `n-1`.
- The variable `s` holds the value of the last input string processed.
- The variable `a` will be 'Triangle' if any of the input strings contained exactly one '1' character; otherwise, it remains 0.
- The variable `b` will be 'Square' if any of the input strings contained more than one '1' character; otherwise, it remains an empty string.
