The code snippet `b = ''` sets the variable `b` to an empty string. This overrides any previous value of `b`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 1, `n` is the new input integer, `j` is `n-1`, `s` is the last input string processed, `a` is 0, `b` is an empty string.**
