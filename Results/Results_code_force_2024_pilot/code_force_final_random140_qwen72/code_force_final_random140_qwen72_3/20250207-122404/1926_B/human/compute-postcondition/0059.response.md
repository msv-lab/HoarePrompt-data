Based on the initial state:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 100.
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is the new input integer.
- `j` is `n-1`.
- `s` is the last input string processed.
- At least one of the input strings contained exactly one '1' character, so `a` is 'Triangle'.
- If any of the input strings contained more than one '1' character, `b` is 'Square'.
- If no input strings contained more than one '1' character, `b` remains an empty string.

The `print(a)` statement will print the value of `a`.

Given that at least one of the input strings contained exactly one '1' character, the variable `a` is set to 'Triangle'.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **Triangle**
