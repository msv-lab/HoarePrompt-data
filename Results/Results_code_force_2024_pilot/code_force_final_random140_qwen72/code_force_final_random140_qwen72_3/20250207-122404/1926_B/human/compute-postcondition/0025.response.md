Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `j` is 2, `s` is an input string, `a` and `b` remain unchanged based on the initial conditions. If `s.count('1') == 1`, then `a` is set to 'Triangle' and `b` remains unchanged. If `s.count('1') > 1`, then `b` is set to 'Square' and `a` remains unchanged. If `s.count('1') == 0`, then both `a` and `b` remain unchanged.***
