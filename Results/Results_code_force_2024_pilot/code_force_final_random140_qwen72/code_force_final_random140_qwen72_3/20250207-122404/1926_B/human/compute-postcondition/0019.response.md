Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, `s` is an input string, `a` and `b` remain unchanged based on the initial conditions. If the count of '1' in `s` is exactly 1, `a` is set to 'Triangle'. If the count of '1' in `s` is greater than 1, `b` is set to 'Square'.***
