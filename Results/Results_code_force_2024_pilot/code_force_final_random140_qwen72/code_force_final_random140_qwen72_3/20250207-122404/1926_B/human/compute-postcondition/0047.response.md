Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, `s` is the new input string, `a` is 'Triangle', `b` is 'Square' if the count of '1' in `s` is greater than 1, otherwise `b` remains an empty string.**

Explanation:
- The value of `a` is explicitly set to 'Triangle'.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `j`, `s`, and `b`) retain their initial values or conditions.
