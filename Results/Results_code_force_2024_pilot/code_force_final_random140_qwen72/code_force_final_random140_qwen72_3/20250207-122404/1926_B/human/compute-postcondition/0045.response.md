The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 (so `j` becomes 1), and `n` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, `s` is the new input string, and `a` is either 'Triangle' if `s` contains exactly one '1' character, or 0 otherwise. If the count of '1' in `s` is greater than 1, `b` is set to 'Square'. Otherwise, `b` remains an empty string.**
