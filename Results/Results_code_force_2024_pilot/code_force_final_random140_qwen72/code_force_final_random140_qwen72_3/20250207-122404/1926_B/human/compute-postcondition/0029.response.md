Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `j` is `n-1`, `s` is the last input string processed. The value of `a` is 0, meaning no input string contained exactly one '1'. The value of `b` will be 'Square' if any input string contained more than one '1', otherwise it remains an empty string.***
