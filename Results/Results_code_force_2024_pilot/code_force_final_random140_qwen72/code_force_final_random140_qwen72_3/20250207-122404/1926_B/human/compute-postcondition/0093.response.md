Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 2, `n` is the new input integer, `j` is `n-1`, and `s` is the last input string processed. If at least one of the input strings contained exactly one '1' character, `a` is 'Triangle'. Otherwise, `a` is 0. If any of the input strings contained more than one '1' character, `b` is 'Square'. Otherwise, `b` is an empty string.***
