Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer between 2 and 100.
- `i` is 2.
- `n` is a new input integer.
- `j` is `n-1`.
- `s` is the last input string processed.
- At least one of the input strings contained exactly one '1' character, so `a` is 'Triangle'.
- `b` is either 'Square' if any of the input strings contained more than one '1' character, or an empty string otherwise.

The print statement is:
```python
print(a)
```

Given that `a` is explicitly set to 'Triangle' because at least one of the input strings contained exactly one '1' character, the output of the print statement will be:

Output: **Triangle**
