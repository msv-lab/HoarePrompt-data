To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop:

```python
for j in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0.
   - The variable `j` will start from 0 and increment up to `n-1`.

3. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 1.
   - The variable `j` should start at 0.

4. **Consider Other Variables:**
   - The other variables (`t`, `i`, `a`, and `b`) are not part of the loop head and do not affect the loop's execution directly. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted.

### Final Adjusted State:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `j` is 0.

### State:
**`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is 0, `b` is an empty string, `j` is 0**
