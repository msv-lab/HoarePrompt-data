To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop:

```python
for j in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `j` and the variable `n`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if `range(n)` generates a sequence of numbers. This happens if `n` is greater than 0.

3. **Adjust the States:**
   - The variable `j` will start at 0 (the first value in the range).
   - The variable `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.

4. **Other Variables:**
   - The other variables (`t`, `i`, `s`, `a`, `b`) are not part of the loop head and do not affect the loop's execution directly. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Final Adjusted State:
- `j` should be 0 (the starting value of the range).
- `n` must be greater than 0.

Thus, the adjusted state is:
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0, `s` is the last input string processed, `a` is 0, `b` is an empty string.**
