Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is `n`, `s` is the new input string, `a` and `b` remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The code `s = input()` assigns a new input string to the variable `s`.
- The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged.
- The conditions for setting `a` and `b` based on the content of `s` are not evaluated in this code snippet, so `a` and `b` retain their previous values.
