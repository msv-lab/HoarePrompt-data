The function reads a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and an `n x n` grid represented by `n` lines of `n` characters ('0' or '1'). For each test case, it determines and prints whether the grid contains a 'Triangle' (if any row has exactly one '1') or a 'Square' (if any row has more than one '1'). If no row has exactly one '1', the function will always print 'Square'. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes.
