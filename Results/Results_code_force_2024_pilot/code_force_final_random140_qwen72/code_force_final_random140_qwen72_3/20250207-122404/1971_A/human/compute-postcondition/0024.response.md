Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is 0
- `n` is greater than 2
- `x` and `y` are integers where 0 <= `x`, `y` <= 9
- `i` is 2
- `a` and `b` are input integers
- The conditions for `a` and `b` are such that if `a` > `b`, the state remains unchanged; if `a` equals `b`, the state remains unchanged; if `a` < `b`, the state remains unchanged.

Given these conditions, the state of the program does not change regardless of the relationship between `a` and `b`. Therefore, the values of `a` and `b` remain the same as they were input.

The print statement:
```python
print(a, ' ', b)
```
will print the values of `a` and `b` separated by a space.

Output: **a, b (where a and b are the input integers)**
