The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is 1 less than its value at the end of the previous iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `t` is 1 less than its value at the end of the previous iteration, but it must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

State: **`t` is 1 less than its value at the end of the previous iteration, `a` is the first integer from the input, `b` is the second integer from the input, `t` must be greater than 0**
