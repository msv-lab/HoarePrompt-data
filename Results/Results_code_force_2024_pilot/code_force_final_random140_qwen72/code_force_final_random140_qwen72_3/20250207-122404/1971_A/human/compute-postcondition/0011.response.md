Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but operates within a context where `t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 100) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, `x` and `y` are integers (0 <= x, y <= 9). The function processes each test case and returns a result specific to the combination of `x` and `y` for each case.**
