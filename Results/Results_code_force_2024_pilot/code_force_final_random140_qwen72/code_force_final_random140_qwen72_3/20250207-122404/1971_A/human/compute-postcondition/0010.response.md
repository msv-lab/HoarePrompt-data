Output State: **`t` is 0, and all pairs of integers (a, b) have been processed, printing the maximum and minimum of each pair.**

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` is reduced to 0, indicating that all the test cases have been processed. For each test case, the loop read two integers `a` and `b`, and printed the maximum and minimum of these two integers. The loop completes when there are no more test cases left to process.
