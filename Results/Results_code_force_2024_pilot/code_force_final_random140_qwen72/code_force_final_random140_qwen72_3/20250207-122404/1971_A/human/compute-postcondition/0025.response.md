Let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is 0.
- `n` is greater than 2.
- `x` and `y` are integers where 0 <= `x`, `y` <= 9.
- `i` is 2.
- `a` and `b` are input integers.
- If `a` > `b`, the state remains unchanged.
- If `a` equals `b`, the state remains unchanged.
- If `a` < `b`, the state remains unchanged.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(b, ' ', a)
```

### Analysis:
- The initial state specifies that the values of `a` and `b` are input integers.
- The conditions given (`a` > `b`, `a` == `b`, `a` < `b`) indicate that regardless of the relationship between `a` and `b`, the state remains unchanged. This means that the values of `a` and `b` are not modified by any of these conditions.
- Therefore, the `print` statement will simply print the values of `b` and `a` as they were input.

### Output:
The `print` statement will output the value of `b` followed by a space and then the value of `a`.

Output: **b, ' ', a (where b and a are the input integers)**
