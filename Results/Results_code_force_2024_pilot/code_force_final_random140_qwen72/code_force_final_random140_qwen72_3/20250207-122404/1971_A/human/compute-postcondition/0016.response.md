Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is 0
- `n` is greater than 1
- `x` and `y` are integers where 0 <= `x`, `y` <= 9
- `i` is 1
- `a` and `b` are input integers

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print(a, ' ', b)
```

This statement will print the values of `a` and `b`, separated by a space.

Since `a` and `b` are described as input integers, their exact values are not specified in the initial state. Therefore, the output will be the values of `a` and `b` as they were input.

Output: **a, ' ', b (where a and b are the input integers)**
