The code snippet `a, b = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, and assigns the integer values of these parts to `a` and `b`.

Output State: **`t` is now 1 less than its value at the end of the previous iteration, `a` is the first integer from the input, `b` is the second integer from the input.**
