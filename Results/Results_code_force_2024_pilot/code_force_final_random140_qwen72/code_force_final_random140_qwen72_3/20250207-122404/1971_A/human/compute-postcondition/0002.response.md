The code snippet `a, b = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into two parts, and assigns the integer values of these parts to the variables `a` and `b`.

- The initial state specifies that `t` must be greater than 0, but this variable is not affected by the code snippet.
- The variables `a` and `b` are assigned the integer values from the input.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `a` and `b` are integers from the input.**
