The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust these. The loop condition is based on `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 <= `x`, `y` <= 9, `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are input integers. If `a` > `b`, the state remains unchanged. If `a` equals `b`, the state remains unchanged. If `a` < `b`, the state remains unchanged.**
