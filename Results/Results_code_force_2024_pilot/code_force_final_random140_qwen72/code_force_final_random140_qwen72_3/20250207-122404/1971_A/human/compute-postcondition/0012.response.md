Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 <= t <= 100`, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` (where `0 <= a, b <= 9`) from the input, and prints the maximum and minimum of these two integers. After processing all `t` test cases, the function completes without returning any value. The state of the program after the function concludes is that all input pairs `(a, b)` have been processed and their maximum and minimum values have been printed. **
