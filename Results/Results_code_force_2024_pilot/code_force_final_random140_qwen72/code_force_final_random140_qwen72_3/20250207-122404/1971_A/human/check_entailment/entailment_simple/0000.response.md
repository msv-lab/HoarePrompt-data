Reasoning:  
The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`. The program then prints the maximum of `a` and `b` followed by the minimum of `a` and `b`. However, according to the problem statement, the output should be the minimum of `a` and `b` followed by the maximum of `a` and `b`. The current implementation has the order reversed.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not match the required output format specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
