Reasoning:

1. The function `func()` starts by reading an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input.
3. It then prints the maximum of `a` and `b` followed by the minimum of `a` and `b`.

However, according to the problem statement, the output should be the minimum of `a` and `b` followed by the maximum of `a` and `b`. The current implementation prints the maximum first and the minimum second, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
