Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program prints the maximum of `a` and `b` first, followed by the minimum of `a` and `b`. However, according to the problem description, the output should be the minimum of `a` and `b` followed by the maximum of `a` and `b`. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.

Example of incorrect behavior:
- Input: `1 9`
- Expected Output: `1 9`
- Actual Output: `9 1`

This shows that the program does not work correctly for this input.
