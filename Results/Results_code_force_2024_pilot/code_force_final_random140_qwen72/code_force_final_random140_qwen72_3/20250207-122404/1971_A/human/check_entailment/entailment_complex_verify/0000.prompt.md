You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

Input

    10
    
    1 9
    
    8 4
    
    1 4
    
    3 4
    
    2 0
    
    2 4
    
    6 9
    
    3 3
    
    0 0
    
    9 9

Output

    1 9
    4 8
    1 4
    3 4
    0 2
    2 4
    6 9
    3 3
    0 0
    9 9

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        print(max(a, b), min(a, b))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 100, and for each of the t test cases, x and y are integers where 0 <= x, y <= 9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        print(max(a, b), min(a, b))
        
    #State: `t` is 0, and all pairs of integers (a, b) have been processed, printing the maximum and minimum of each pair.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 <= t <= 100`, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` (where `0 <= a, b <= 9`) from the input, and prints the maximum and minimum of these two integers. After processing all `t` test cases, the function completes without returning any value. The state of the program after the function concludes is that all input pairs `(a, b)` have been processed and their maximum and minimum values have been printed.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program prints the maximum of `a` and `b` first, followed by the minimum of `a` and `b`. However, according to the problem description, the output should be the minimum of `a` and `b` followed by the maximum of `a` and `b`. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.

Example of incorrect behavior:
- Input: `1 9`
- Expected Output: `1 9`
- Actual Output: `9 1`

This shows that the program does not work correctly for this input.
