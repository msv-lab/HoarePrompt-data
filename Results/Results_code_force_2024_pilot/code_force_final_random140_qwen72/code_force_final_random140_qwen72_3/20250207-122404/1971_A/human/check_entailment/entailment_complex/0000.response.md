Reasoning:  
The program is designed to read a number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`, and prints the maximum and minimum of these two integers. However, there is a mistake in the order of the output. According to the problem statement, the output should be the minimum of `x` and `y`, followed by the maximum of `x` and `y`. The current implementation prints the maximum first and the minimum second, which is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
