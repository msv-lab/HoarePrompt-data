Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `m` and iterates over each test case. It also reads the size of the array `k` and the array itself `a`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - The program processes each element of the array `a` to check if it needs to be split.
   - For elements greater than 10, it splits them into their tens and units digits and adds them to the list `c` based on certain conditions.
   - The conditions ensure that the resulting list `c` remains in a potentially sorted order after each split.

3. **Checking Sorted Order**:
   - After processing all elements, the program checks if the list `c` is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it with its sorted version `d`.
   - If `c` is equal to `d`, it appends `1` to the list `b`, indicating that the array can be sorted. Otherwise, it appends `0`.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing all test cases, the program prints 'YES' for each `1` in `b` and 'NO' for each `0`.

However, there are a few issues in the logic that need to be addressed:

- **Splitting Logic**: The splitting logic is overly complex and may not handle all edge cases correctly. Specifically, the conditions for appending `y` and `x` to `c` are not robust enough to ensure the array remains sorted.
- **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle cases where the array might become unsorted after multiple splits, especially when elements are split in different positions.

Given these issues, the program is not guaranteed to work correctly for all inputs. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
