You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) â€” the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is the total number of elements in the list `c`, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is the length of the list `a` minus 1, and `c` is a list of integers. The list `c` contains the processed elements from `a` according to the rules defined in the loop. For each element in `a` that is greater than 10 and not the first element, it is split into its tens and units digits (`y` and `x`), and these are added to `c` based on the conditions specified. If the element is the first element or less than or equal to 10, it is added directly to `c`.
    d = sorted(c)
    if (c == d) :
        b.append(1)
    else :
        b.append(0)
    #State: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is the total number of elements in the list `c`, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is the length of the list `a` minus 1, `c` is a list of integers, `d` is a sorted version of `c`. If `c` is equal to `d`, `b` is a list that includes the integer 1. Otherwise, `b` is a list with one element which is 0.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `m`.
   - It initializes an empty list `b` to store the results of each test case.
   - It iterates over the number of test cases, calling `func_1()` for each one.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function reads the length of the array `k` and the array itself `a`.
   - It initializes variables `x`, `y`, `n`, and an empty list `c` to store the transformed array.
   - It iterates over the elements of the array `a`.

3. **Transformation Logic**:
   - For each element in the array:
     - If the element is greater than 10 and it is not the first element:
       - It splits the element into its digits `x` and `y`.
       - It checks if the digit `y` is greater than or equal to the last element in `c` and if `y` is less than or equal to `x`.
       - If both conditions are met, it appends `y` and `x` to `c`.
       - Otherwise, it appends the original element to `c`.
     - If the element is greater than 10 and it is the first element:
       - It splits the element into its digits `x` and `y`.
       - It checks if `y` is less than or equal to `x`.
       - If true, it appends `y` and `x` to `c`.
       - Otherwise, it appends the original element to `c`.
     - If the element is less than or equal to 10, it appends the element to `c`.

4. **Sorting Check**:
   - After transforming the array, it sorts the list `c` and checks if the transformed list `c` is equal to the sorted list `d`.
   - If they are equal, it appends 1 to `b` (indicating a successful transformation).
   - Otherwise, it appends 0 to `b`.

5. **Output**:
   - After processing all test cases, it iterates over the results in `b` and prints 'YES' for 1 and 'NO' for 0.

### Correctness:
- The logic for splitting elements and checking the sorted condition seems correct.
- However, there is a potential issue with the way the digits are split and appended. Specifically, the division `y = int(a[i] / 10)` should use integer division `y = a[i] // 10` to ensure `y` is an integer.
- Additionally, the logic for appending digits to `c` could be simplified and made more robust.

### Conclusion:
Despite the minor issues mentioned, the overall logic and structure of the program are correct and should work for the given problem description.

Correctness: **True**
