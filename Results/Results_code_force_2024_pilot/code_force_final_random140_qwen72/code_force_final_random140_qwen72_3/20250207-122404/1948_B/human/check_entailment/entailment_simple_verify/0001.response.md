### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `m`.
   - It initializes an empty list `b` to store the results of each test case.
   - It iterates over the number of test cases, calling `func_1()` for each one.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function reads the length of the array `k` and the array itself `a`.
   - It initializes variables `x`, `y`, `n`, and an empty list `c` to store the transformed array.
   - It iterates over the elements of the array `a`.

3. **Transformation Logic**:
   - For each element in the array:
     - If the element is greater than 10 and it is not the first element:
       - It splits the element into its digits `x` and `y`.
       - It checks if the digit `y` is greater than or equal to the last element in `c` and if `y` is less than or equal to `x`.
       - If both conditions are met, it appends `y` and `x` to `c`.
       - Otherwise, it appends the original element to `c`.
     - If the element is greater than 10 and it is the first element:
       - It splits the element into its digits `x` and `y`.
       - It checks if `y` is less than or equal to `x`.
       - If true, it appends `y` and `x` to `c`.
       - Otherwise, it appends the original element to `c`.
     - If the element is less than or equal to 10, it appends the element to `c`.

4. **Sorting Check**:
   - After transforming the array, it sorts the list `c` and checks if the transformed list `c` is equal to the sorted list `d`.
   - If they are equal, it appends 1 to `b` (indicating a successful transformation).
   - Otherwise, it appends 0 to `b`.

5. **Output**:
   - After processing all test cases, it iterates over the results in `b` and prints 'YES' for 1 and 'NO' for 0.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Integer Division**:
  - The original assessment mentions that `y = int(a[i] / 10)` should use integer division `y = a[i] // 10`. This is correct because `int(a[i] / 10)` can lead to floating-point numbers, which might cause issues when comparing or appending to the list. Using `a[i] // 10` ensures that `y` is always an integer.

- **Logic for Appending Digits**:
  - The logic for appending digits to `c` is somewhat complex and could be simplified. However, the current implementation does handle the basic requirements of the problem:
    - It correctly splits elements greater than 10 into their digits.
    - It appends the digits in the correct order based on the conditions provided.
    - It handles the first element separately, which is necessary to avoid index out-of-bounds errors.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles edge cases such as arrays with elements less than or equal to 10, and arrays with elements greater than 10.
  - It also correctly handles the case where the array is already sorted.

### Conclusion:
- Despite the minor issue with integer division, the overall logic and structure of the program are correct and should work for the given problem description.
- The program correctly transforms the array and checks if it can be sorted in non-decreasing order using the specified operations.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
