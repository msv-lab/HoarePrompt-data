#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (2 <= n <= 50) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 99).

    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is the total number of elements in the list `c`, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is the length of the list `a` minus 1, and `c` is a list of integers. The list `c` contains the processed elements from `a` according to the rules defined in the loop. For each element in `a` that is greater than 10 and not the first element, it is split into its tens and units digits (`y` and `x`), and these are added to `c` based on the conditions specified. If the element is the first element or less than or equal to 10, it is added directly to `c`.
    d = sorted(c)
    if (c == d) :
        b.append(1)
    else :
        b.append(0)
    #State: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is the total number of elements in the list `c`, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is the length of the list `a` minus 1, `c` is a list of integers, `d` is a sorted version of `c`. If `c` is equal to `d`, `b` is a list that includes the integer 1. Otherwise, `b` is a list with one element which is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `k` and a list of integers `a`. It then processes the list `a` by splitting numbers greater than 10 into their tens and units digits and appending them to a new list `c` based on specific conditions. After processing, it checks if the list `c` is sorted in non-decreasing order. If `c` is sorted, it appends 1 to a list `b`; otherwise, it appends 0. The function does not return any value but modifies the list `b` to contain the results of the test cases.
