The code snippet `a = list(map(int, a.split()))` converts the string `a` into a list of integers. Hereâ€™s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3.
   - Each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 50) and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 <= a_i <= 99).
   - `k` is an input integer.
   - `a` is the input string.

2. **Impact of the Code**:
   - The string `a` is split into a list of substrings using spaces as delimiters.
   - Each substring is converted to an integer.
   - The resulting list of integers is assigned back to `a`.

3. **Updated Values**:
   - `a` is now a list of integers derived from the original string `a`.

4. **Unchanged Values**:
   - `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3.
   - `n` remains an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50.
   - `k` remains an input integer.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers.**
