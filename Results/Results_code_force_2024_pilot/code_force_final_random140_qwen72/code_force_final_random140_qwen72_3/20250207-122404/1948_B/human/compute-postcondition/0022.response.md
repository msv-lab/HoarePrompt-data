The code snippet `c.append(a[i])` adds the element at index `i` of the list `a` to the list `c`. Let's analyze the impact on the program:

- `c` was initially an empty list, and now it contains the element from `a` at index `i`.
- The value of `a[i]` is added to `c`, making `c` no longer empty.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `x`, `y`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `x` is the last digit of the element at index `i` in `a`, `y` is the integer part of the division of the element at index `i` in `a` by 10, `c` is a list containing the element at index `i` in `a`, `i` is greater than 0, and the element at index `i` in `a` is greater than 10, and `y` is less than the element at index `n - 1` in `c`.**
