The code snippet `a = list(map(int, a.split()))` converts the string `a` into a list of integers. This operation splits the string `a` by whitespace and then converts each split part into an integer, storing these integers in a list.

- `a` was initially a string.
- After the code executes, `a` becomes a list of integers.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `k`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the original string `a` and converting each part to an integer.**
