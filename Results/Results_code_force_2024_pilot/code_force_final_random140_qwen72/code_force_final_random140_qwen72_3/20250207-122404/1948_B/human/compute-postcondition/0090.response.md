Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is either 1, 2, 3, or 4, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `i` is 2 or greater than 2, `c` is a list. If `i` is 0 and `a[0]` is greater than 10, `x` is the remainder when `a[0]` is divided by 10, `y` is the integer division result of `a[0]` by 10, and `c` contains either `[y, x]` if `y` <= `x` or `[a[0]]` if `y` > `x`. If `i` is 0 and `a[0]` is less than or equal to 10, or if `i` is not 0 and `a[i]` is less than or equal to 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, and `c` contains the first element of `a`. If `i` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is greater than 10, `x` is the last digit of the element at index `i` in `a`, `y` is the integer part of the division of the element at index `i` in `a` by 10, and `c` contains either the element at index `i` from `a` if `y` >= `c[n - 1]` (with `n` set to 2) or the integer part of the division of the element at index `i` in `a` by 10 followed by `x` if `y` < `c[n - 1]` (with `n` set to 3).***
