Functionality: ** The function `func_1` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `k` and a list of integers `a`. It then processes the list `a` by splitting numbers greater than 10 into their tens and units digits and appending them to a new list `c` based on specific conditions. After processing, it checks if the list `c` is sorted in non-decreasing order. If `c` is sorted, it appends 1 to a list `b`; otherwise, it appends 0. The function does not return any value but modifies the list `b` to contain the results of the test cases. **
