To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for i in range(len(a)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and the length of the list `a` (i.e., `len(a)`).
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if `len(a)` is greater than 0. This means the list `a` must have at least one element.
3. **Initial State Adjustments**:
   - `i` should start at 0.
   - `a` must have at least one element for the loop to execute.

### Given Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3 (irrelevant to the loop execution).
- `n` is 0 (irrelevant to the loop execution).
- `k` is an input integer (irrelevant to the loop execution).
- `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the original string `a` and converting each part to an integer.
- `x` is 0 (irrelevant to the loop execution).
- `y` is 0 (irrelevant to the loop execution).
- `c` is an empty list (irrelevant to the loop execution).

### Adjusted State:
- `a` must have at least one element.
- `i` should start at 0.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `c` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
