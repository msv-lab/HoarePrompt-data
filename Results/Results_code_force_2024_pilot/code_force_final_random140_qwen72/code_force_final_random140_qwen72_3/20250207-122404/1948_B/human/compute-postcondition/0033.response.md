Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is 2, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `x` is the remainder when the first element of `a` is divided by 10, `y` is the integer division result of the first element of `a` by 10, `c` is a list containing the integer division result of the first element of `a` by 10 and the remainder when the first element of `a` is divided by 10, `i` is 0, the first element of `a` (i.e., `a[0]`) is greater than 10, and the integer division result of the first element of `a` by 10 (`y`) is less than or equal to the remainder when the first element of `a` is divided by 10 (`x`).**
