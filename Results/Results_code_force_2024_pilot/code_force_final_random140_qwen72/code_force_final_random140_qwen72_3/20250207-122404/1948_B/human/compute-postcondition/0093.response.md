Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is the total number of elements in the list `c`, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is the length of the list `a` minus 1, `c` is a list of integers, `d` is a sorted version of `c`.** 

Explanation: The code snippet `d = sorted(c)` creates a new list `d` which is a sorted version of the list `c`. The original list `c` remains unchanged. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `i`) retain their initial values and properties.
