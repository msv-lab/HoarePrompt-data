Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the original string `a` and converting each part to an integer, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `c` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if a[i] > 10 and i > 0:
        x = int(a[i] % 10)
        y = int(a[i] / 10)
        if y >= c[n - 1]:
            if y <= x:
                c.append(y)
                c.append(x)
                n = n + 2
            else:
                c.append(a[i])
                n = n + 1
        else:
            c.append(a[i])
            n = n + 1
    elif i == 0 and a[i] > 10:
        x = int(a[i] % 10)
        y = int(a[i] / 10)
        if y <= x:
            c.append(y)
            c.append(x)
            n = n + 2
        else:
            c.append(a[i])
            n = n + 1
    else:
        c.append(a[i])
        n = n + 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is either 1 or 2, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `i` is 0 or greater than 0, and `c` is a list. If `a[i]` is greater than 10 and `i` is greater than 0, `x` is the last digit of the element at index `i` in `a`, `y` is the integer part of the division of the element at index `i` in `a` by 10, and `c` contains either the element at index `i` from `a` if `y` >= `c[n - 1]` (with `n` set to 1) or the integer part of the division of the element at index `i` in `a` by 10 followed by `x` if `y` < `c[n - 1]` (with `n` set to 2). If `i` is 0 and `a[0]` is greater than 10, `x` is the remainder when `a[0]` is divided by 10, `y` is the integer division result of `a[0]` by 10, and `c` contains either `[y, x]` if `y` <= `x` or `[a[0]]` if `y` > `x`. If `i` is 0 and `a[0]` is less than or equal to 10, or if `i` is not 0 and `a[i]` is less than or equal to 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, and `c` contains the first element of `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is either 1 or 2, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `i` is 1 or greater than 1, and `c` is a list. If `a[i]` is greater than 10 and `i` is greater than 0, `x` is the last digit of the element at index `i` in `a`, `y` is the integer part of the division of the element at index `i` in `a` by 10, and `c` contains either the element at index `i` from `a` if `y` >= `c[n - 1]` (with `n` set to 1) or the integer part of the division of the element at index `i` in `a` by 10 followed by `x` if `y` < `c[n - 1]` (with `n` set to 2). If `i` is 0 and `a[0]` is greater than 10, `x` is the remainder when `a[0]` is divided by 10, `y` is the integer division result of `a[0]` by 10, and `c` contains either `[y, x]` if `y` <= `x` or `[a[0]]` if `y` > `x`. If `i` is 0 and `a[0]` is less than or equal to 10, or if `i` is not 0 and `a[i]` is less than or equal to 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, and `c` contains the first element of `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is either 1 or 2, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `i` is 2 or greater than 2, and `c` is a list. If `a[i]` is greater than 10 and `i` is greater than 0, `x` is the last digit of the element at index `i` in `a`, `y` is the integer part of the division of the element at index `i` in `a` by 10. If `y` >= `c[n - 1]`, `c` contains the original elements plus the element at index `i` of `a`. If `y` < `c[n - 1]`, `c` contains the original elements plus the integer part of the division of the element at index `i` in `a` by 10 followed by `x`. If `i` is 0 and `a[0]` is greater than 10, `x` is the remainder when `a[0]` is divided by 10, `y` is the integer division result of `a[0]` by 10, and `c` contains either `[y, x]` if `y` <= `x` or `[a[0]]` if `y` > `x`. If `i` is 0 and `a[0]` is less than or equal to 10, or if `i` is not 0 and `a[i]` is less than or equal to 10, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, and `c` contains the first element of `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
