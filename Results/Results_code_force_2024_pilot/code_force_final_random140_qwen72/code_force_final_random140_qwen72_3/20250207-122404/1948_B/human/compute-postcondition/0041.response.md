Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is either 1 or 2, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `i` is 0, and `c` is a list. If `i` is 0 and `a[0]` is greater than 10, `x` is the remainder when `a[0]` is divided by 10, `y` is the integer division result of `a[0]` by 10, and `c` contains either `[y, x]` if `y` <= `x` or `[a[0]]` if `y` > `x`. If `i` is 0 and `a[0]` is less than or equal to 10, or if `i` is not 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, and `c` contains the first element of `a`.***
