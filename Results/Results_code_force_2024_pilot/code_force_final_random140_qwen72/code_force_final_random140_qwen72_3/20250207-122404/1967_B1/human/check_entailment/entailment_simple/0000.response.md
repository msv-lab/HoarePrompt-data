Reasoning:  
The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The main issue lies in the loop where it calculates the number of valid pairs `(a, b)`. The condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` is not checked. Instead, the program simply adds `n // b + 1` to `ans` for each `b` from 1 to `min(n, m)`. This calculation does not correspond to the problem's requirements and will produce incorrect results.

Additionally, the loop should iterate over all possible values of `b` from 1 to `m`, not just up to `min(n, m)`. The correct approach would involve iterating over all possible values of `b` and for each `b`, finding the number of valid `a` values that satisfy the given condition.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
