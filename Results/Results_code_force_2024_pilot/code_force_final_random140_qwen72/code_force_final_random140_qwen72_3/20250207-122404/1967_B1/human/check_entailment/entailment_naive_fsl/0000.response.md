Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. Specifically, the program has several issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Counting Valid Pairs**:
   - The program iterates over `b` from 1 to `min(n, m)`, which is not correct. According to the problem, `b` should range from 1 to `m`, and `a` should range from 1 to `n`.
   - The program incorrectly adds `n // b + 1` to the answer for each `b`. This does not account for the condition that `a + b` must be a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

2. **Missing GCD Calculation**:
   - The program does not calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`, which is essential for checking the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

3. **Incorrect Condition Check**:
   - The program does not check if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. Instead, it simply adds `n // b + 1` to the answer, which is not the correct way to count valid pairs.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
For the input:
```
1
2 3
```
The correct output should be `3` because the valid pairs are `(1, 1)`, `(2, 1)`, and `(2, 2)`. However, the given program will produce an incorrect output.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you would need to:
1. Iterate over all possible values of `b` from 1 to `m`.
2. For each `b`, iterate over all possible values of `a` from 1 to `n`.
3. For each pair `(a, b)`, calculate `gcd(a, b)` and check if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
4. Count the number of valid pairs.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
from math import gcd

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        ans = 0
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            for a in range(1, n + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    ans += 1
        print(ans)

func()
```

This corrected program will correctly count the number of valid pairs for each test case.
