You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = input().split()
        [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
        ans = 0
        for b in range(1, min(n, m) + 1):
            ans = ans + n // b + 1
        print(ans)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = input().split()
        
        [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
        
        ans = 0
        
        for b in range(1, min(n, m) + 1):
            ans = ans + n // b + 1
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `T` is `t - 1`, `t` is the initial value of `t`, `n` and `m` are the last pair of integers read from the input, `b` is `min(n, m) + 1`, and `ans` is the sum of `n // i + 1` for all `i` from 1 to `min(n, m)` for the last iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6). It calculates the sum of `n // i + 1` for all `i` from 1 to `min(n, m)` and prints the result. After processing all test cases, the function has no return value, but it has printed the results for each test case. The final state of the program includes the variable `T` being equal to `t - 1`, `t` retaining its initial value, `n` and `m` holding the values of the last test case, and `b` being `min(n, m) + 1`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\).
   - Additionally, \(a + b\) must be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(m\).
   - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the count of valid pairs.
   - It iterates over \(b\) from 1 to \(\min(n, m)\).
   - For each \(b\), it adds \(n // b + 1\) to `ans`.

3. **Logical Flaw**:
   - The key issue is in the line `ans = ans + n // b + 1`. This does not correctly count the valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The expression \(n // b + 1\) is not the correct way to count the valid pairs. It seems to be an attempt to count the number of multiples of \(b\) up to \(n\), but it does not consider the gcd condition.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To correctly solve this problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - Alternatively, we can use a more efficient approach by leveraging properties of gcd and divisors.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to count the valid pairs \((a, b)\) as required by the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
