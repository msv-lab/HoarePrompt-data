The only variables in the loop head are `b`, `n`, and `m`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `b` relative to the minimum of `n` and `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `b` is 2, and both `n` and `m` are at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `b` must be incremented by 1, and the minimum of `n` and `m` must still be greater than or equal to `b`.

Since `b` is 2 at the end of the last iteration, it will be 3 at the start of the next iteration. For the loop to continue, the minimum of `n` and `m` must be at least 3.

State: **`n` and `m` are the first and second positive integers from the input, both must be at least 3, `b` is 3, `t` is greater than 0, `T` is 0, `ans` is `n + n // 2 + 2`**
