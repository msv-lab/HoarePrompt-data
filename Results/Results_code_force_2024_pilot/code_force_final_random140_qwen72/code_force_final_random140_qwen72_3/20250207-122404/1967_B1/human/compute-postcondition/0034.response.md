The code snippet `ans = ans + n // b + 1` updates the value of `ans`. Given that `ans` is initially `n + 1`, `n` and `m` are integers at least 2, `b` is 2, and `t` is greater than 1, we can calculate the new value of `ans`.

1. `ans` is initially `n + 1`.
2. The expression `n // b` performs integer division of `n` by `b`. Since `b` is 2, `n // b` is the integer part of `n / 2`.
3. Adding 1 to `n // b` gives `n // 2 + 1`.
4. The new value of `ans` is `ans + n // b + 1`, which is `(n + 1) + (n // 2) + 1`.

Therefore, the new value of `ans` is `n + 1 + n // 2 + 1`, which simplifies to `n + n // 2 + 2`.

Output State: **`[n, m]` are converted to integers and both must be at least 2, `T` is 2, `t` is greater than 1, `b` is 2, `ans` is `n + n // 2 + 2`.**
