The code snippet `[n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]` converts the strings `n` and `m` into integers. This changes the types of `n` and `m` from strings to integers, but does not affect their values.

Let's list the impact of the code on the program:

- `n` is converted from a string to an integer.
- `m` is converted from a string to an integer.
- The values of `n` and `m` remain the same, but their types are now integers.
- The other variables (`b`, `t`, `T`, and `ans`) are not affected.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` and `m` are the new input values as integers, `b` is `min(n, m)`, `t` is greater than 1, `T` is 1, `ans` is the sum of `n // i + 1` for all `i` from 1 to `min(n, m)`.**
