Output State: **`n` and `m` are the first and second positive integers from the input, respectively; `t` is greater than 0; `T` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `[n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]` ensures that `n` and `m` are converted to integers. Since they were already specified as the first and second positive integers from the input, this conversion does not change their values. The variables `t` and `T` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.
