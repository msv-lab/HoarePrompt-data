Output State: **`n` and `m` are the first and second positive integers from the input, `b` is `min(n, m)`, `t` is greater than 0, `T` is 0, `ans` is the sum of `n // i + 1` for all `i` from 1 to `min(n, m)`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `b = 1` to `b = min(n, m)`.
- In each iteration, `ans` is updated by adding `n // b + 1` to its current value.
- After all iterations, `b` will be equal to `min(n, m)`, and `ans` will be the sum of `n // i + 1` for all `i` from 1 to `min(n, m)`.
- The variables `t` and `T` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
