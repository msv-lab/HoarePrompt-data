The code snippet sets `ans` to 0. This overrides the previous value of `ans`, which was the sum of `n // i + 1` for all `i` from 1 to `min(n, m)`. The values of `n`, `m`, `b`, `t`, and `T` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are the new input values as integers, `b` is `min(n, m)`, `t` is greater than 1, `T` is 1, `ans` is 0.**
