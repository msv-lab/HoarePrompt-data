The code snippet updates the value of `ans` by adding `n // b + 1` to its current value. Given the initial state:

- `n` and `m` are the first and second positive integers from the input, both must be at least 2.
- `b` is 2.
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `T` is 0.
- `ans` is `n + 1`.

Let's calculate the new value of `ans`:

1. `ans` starts as `n + 1`.
2. `n // b` is the integer division of `n` by `b`. Since `b` is 2, `n // 2` is the largest integer less than or equal to `n / 2`.
3. Adding 1 to `n // 2` gives us `n // 2 + 1`.
4. Adding this result to the initial value of `ans` gives us the new value of `ans`: `(n + 1) + (n // 2 + 1)`.

Simplifying the expression:
- `ans = (n + 1) + (n // 2 + 1)`
- `ans = n + 1 + n // 2 + 1`
- `ans = n + n // 2 + 2`

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` and `m` are the first and second positive integers from the input, both must be at least 2, `b` is 2, `t` is greater than 0, `T` is 0, `ans` is `n + n // 2 + 2`.**
