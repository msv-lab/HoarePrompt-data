The value of `ans` is updated by adding `n // b + 1` to its current value. Since `b` is 3, the expression `n // b` calculates the integer division of `n` by 3. The initial value of `ans` is `n + n // 2 + 2`. After the addition, the new value of `ans` is `n + n // 2 + 2 + n // 3 + 1`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` and `m` are the first and second positive integers from the input, both must be at least 3, `b` is 3, `t` is greater than 0, `T` is 0, `ans` is `n + n // 2 + n // 3 + 3`.**
