The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided code snippet, but based on the parameter constraints given, it is implied that the function should accept two parameters, `n` and `m`. Both `n` and `m` are positive integers within the range 1 to 2 * 10^6. However, since the output section is not provided, I cannot determine the specific return value or behavior of the function. Assuming the function is designed to perform some operation with `n` and `m`, the general functionality would be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `m`, which are positive integers within the range 1 to 2 * 10^6. The function's return value or behavior is not specified without further information.**
