The only variables in the loop head are `T` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `T` being less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `T` is 0 and `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `T` needs to be incremented by 1, and `t` must still be greater than `T`.

State: **`n` and `m` are the first and second positive integers from the input, `b` is `min(n, m)`, `t` is greater than 1, `T` is 1, `ans` is the sum of `n // i + 1` for all `i` from 1 to `min(n, m)`**
