Output State: **`n` and `m` are the new input values as integers such that `min(n, m)` is at least 2, `b` is 2, `t` is greater than 1, `T` is 1, `ans` is `ans + n + 1 + n // 2 + 1`**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated to `ans + n // b + 1`.
- Since `b` is 2, `n // b` is equivalent to `n // 2`.
- Therefore, the new value of `ans` is `ans + n + 1 + n // 2 + 1`.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `b`, `t`, `T`) remain unchanged.
