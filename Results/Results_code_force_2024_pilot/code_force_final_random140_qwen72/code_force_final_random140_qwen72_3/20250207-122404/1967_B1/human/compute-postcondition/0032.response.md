The value of `ans` is updated by adding the result of the expression `n // b + 1`. Given that `b` is 1, the expression simplifies to `n // 1 + 1`, which is equivalent to `n + 1`. Therefore, the new value of `ans` is the original value of `ans` (which is 0) plus `n + 1`, resulting in `ans` being `n + 1`.

Output State: **`[n, m]` are converted to integers and both must be at least 1, `T` is 2, `t` is greater than 1, `b` is 1, `ans` is `n + 1`**
