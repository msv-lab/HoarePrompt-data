Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program appears to correctly generate a k-level permutation for the given constraints. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why the program works:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads multiple test cases using `func_2`, which calls `func_1` for each test case. This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Permutation Construction**:
   - The program initializes a permutation array of length `n` with zeros.
   - It uses two pointers, `bottom_v` and `top_v`, to fill the permutation array with values from 1 to `n`.
   - The loop iterates over indices from 0 to `k-1`, ensuring that the pattern of filling the permutation array alternates between increasing and decreasing values based on the index's parity.
   - For each index `idx`, it fills the permutation array at positions that are multiples of `k` plus `idx`.

3. **Ensuring k-Level Property**:
   - The alternating pattern ensures that the sums of continuous segments of length `k` differ by at most 1. This is because the values are distributed in a way that balances the sums across the segments.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the constructed permutation for each test case, which matches the required output format.

Given the constraints and the problem description, the program appears to handle all potential cases correctly. No edge cases or missing logic have been identified that would cause the program to fail. Therefore, the program is correct.
