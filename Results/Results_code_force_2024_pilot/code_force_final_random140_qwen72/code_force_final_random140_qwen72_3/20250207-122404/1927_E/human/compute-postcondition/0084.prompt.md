Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `permutation` is a list of length `n` where elements at indices that are multiples of `k` (starting from 0) are filled alternately with increasing values from `1` to `n//2 + 1` (if the index is even) and decreasing values from `n` to `n//2 + 1` (if the index is odd), `bottom_v` is `n // 2 + 1 + (number of even-indexed assignments)`, `top_v` is `n - (n // 2) - (number of odd-indexed assignments)`, `idx` is 2, and `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is 2.
Code of the loop:
while multiples_of_k_plus_idx < len(permutation):
    if idx % 2 == 0:
        permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] = bottom_v
        bottom_v += 1
    else:
        permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] = top_v
        top_v -= 1
    multiples_of_k_plus_idx += k


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `permutation` is a list of length `n` where elements at indices that are multiples of `k` (starting from 0) are filled alternately with increasing values from `1` to `n//2 + 1` (if the index is even) and decreasing values from `n` to `n//2 + 1` (if the index is odd), if `idx % 2 == 0`, `bottom_v` is `n // 2 + 1 + (number of even-indexed assignments) + 1`, `top_v` is `n - (n // 2) - (number of odd-indexed assignments)`, and `permutation[2]` is `bottom_v`, if `idx % 2 != 0`, `bottom_v` is `n // 2 + 1 + (number of even-indexed assignments)`, `top_v` is `n - (n // 2) - (number of odd-indexed assignments) - 1`, and `permutation[2]` is `top_v`, `idx` is 2, and `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `2 + k`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `permutation` is a list of length `n` where elements at indices that are multiples of `k` (starting from 0) are filled alternately with increasing values from `1` to `n//2 + 1` (if the index is even) and decreasing values from `n` to `n//2 + 1` (if the index is odd). `idx` is 2, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `2 + 2*k`, `bottom_v` is `n // 2 + 1 + (number of even-indexed assignments) + 2` if `idx % 2 == 0` or `n // 2 + 1 + (number of even-indexed assignments)` if `idx % 2 != 0`, and `top_v` is `n - (n // 2) - (number of odd-indexed assignments)` if `idx % 2 == 0` or `n - (n // 2) - (number of odd-indexed assignments) - 2` if `idx % 2 != 0`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `permutation` is a list of length `n` where elements at indices that are multiples of `k` (starting from 0) are filled alternately with increasing values from `1` to `n//2 + 1` (if the index is even) and decreasing values from `n` to `n//2 + 1` (if the index is odd). `idx` is 2, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `2 + 3*k`. If `idx % 2 == 0`, `bottom_v` is `n // 2 + 1 + (number of even-indexed assignments) + 3` and `top_v` is `n - (n // 2) - (number of odd-indexed assignments)`, and `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is now `bottom_v`. If `idx % 2 != 0`, `bottom_v` is `n // 2 + 1 + (number of even-indexed assignments) + 1` and `top_v` is `n - (n // 2) - (number of odd-indexed assignments) - 2`, and `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is now `bottom_v`. If `idx % 2 == 0`, the element at index `2 + 2*k` in `permutation` is now `top_v - 1`. If `idx % 2 != 0`, the element at index `2 + 2*k` in `permutation` is now `top_v - 3`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
