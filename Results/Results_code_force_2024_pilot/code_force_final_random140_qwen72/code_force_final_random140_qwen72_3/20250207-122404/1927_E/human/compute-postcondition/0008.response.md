Output State: **No variables are passed to the function `func_2`, `t` is now `t - 2` (where `t` was originally greater than 0) and `t` must be greater than 0, `func_1()` has been called three times.** 

Explanation: The code `func_1()` is called once, which increments the number of times `func_1()` has been called from twice to three times. The values of `t` and the fact that no variables are passed to `func_2` remain unchanged.
