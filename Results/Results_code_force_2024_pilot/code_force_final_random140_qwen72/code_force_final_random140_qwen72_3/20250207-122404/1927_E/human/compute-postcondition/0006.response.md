Output State: **No variables are passed to the function `func_2`, `t` is now `t - 2` (where `t` was originally greater than 0) and `t` must be greater than 0, `func_1()` has been called twice.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is decremented by 1 again, making it `t - 2` from its original value. The conditions that no variables are passed to `func_2` and that `func_1()` has been called twice remain unchanged. The requirement that `t` must be greater than 0 also remains valid.
