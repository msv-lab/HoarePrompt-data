Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `permutation` is a list of length `n` initialized with zeros except for the element at index `0` which is 1. If `idx` is even, the element at index `k` is set to 2, `bottom_v` is 3, `top_v` is `n`. If `idx` is odd, the element at index `k` is set to `n - 1`, `bottom_v` is 2, `top_v` is `n - 1`. In both cases, `idx` remains 0 and `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `2 * k`.**
