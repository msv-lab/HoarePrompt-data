To ensure the `while` loop executes at least once, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head, which is `multiples_of_k_plus_idx < len(permutation)`.

### Initial State Analysis:
- `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even.
- `permutation` is a list of length `n`.
- `idx` is 1.
- `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is 1.

### Condition Analysis:
- The loop will execute if `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is less than `len(permutation)`.
- Given that `permutation` is a list of length `n`, the condition becomes `multiples_of_k_plus_idx < n`.

### Initial Values:
- `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is 1.
- `n` is the length of `permutation`.

### Required Adjustment:
- For the loop to execute at least once, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` must be less than `n`.
- Since `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is 1, the condition `1 < n` must hold true.

Given that `n` is at least 2 (since 2 <= k <= n and k is even), the condition `1 < n` is always true. Therefore, no adjustment is needed to the state.

### Final State:
State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `permutation` is a list of length `n` where elements at indices that are multiples of `k` (starting from 0) are filled alternately with increasing values from `1` to `n//2 + 1` (if the index is even) and decreasing values from `n` to `n//2 + 1` (if the index is odd), `bottom_v` is `n // 2 + 1` if `idx` is even and `n // 2 + 2` if `idx` is odd, `top_v` is `n - (n // 2)` if `idx` is even and `n - (n // 2) - 1` if `idx` is odd, `idx` is 1, and `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is 1**.
