The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is now `t - 2` (where `t` was originally greater than 0) and `t` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0 after the adjustment.

Since `t` is already stated to be greater than 0, no further adjustment is necessary for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **No variables are passed to the function `func_2`, `t` is now `t - 2` (where `t` was originally greater than 0) and `t` must be greater than 0, `func_1()` has been called twice.**
