The code snippet `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] = bottom_v` updates the value at the index `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` in the `permutation` list to `bottom_v`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even.
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `k` is the second integer from the input.
- `permutation` is a list of length `n` where elements at indices that are multiples of `k` (starting from 0) are filled alternately with increasing values from `1` to `n//2 + 1` (if the index is even) and decreasing values from `n` to `n//2 + 1` (if the index is odd).
- `bottom_v` is `n // 2 + 1` because `idx` is even.
- `top_v` is `n - (n // 2)` because `idx` is even.
- `idx` is 1, and `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is 1.
- `idx` is even.

The code updates the value at index `1` in the `permutation` list to `bottom_v`, which is `n // 2 + 1`.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even.
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `k` is the second integer from the input.
- `permutation` is a list of length `n` where elements at indices that are multiples of `k` (starting from 0) are filled alternately with increasing values from `1` to `n//2 + 1` (if the index is even) and decreasing values from `n` to `n//2 + 1` (if the index is odd). The value at index `1` is now `n // 2 + 1`.
- `bottom_v` is `n // 2 + 1` because `idx` is even.
- `top_v` is `n - (n // 2)` because `idx` is even.
- `idx` is 1, and `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is 1.
- `idx` is even.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `permutation` is a list of length `n` where elements at indices that are multiples of `k` (starting from 0) are filled alternately with increasing values from `1` to `n//2 + 1` (if the index is even) and decreasing values from `n` to `n//2 + 1` (if the index is odd). The value at index `1` in `permutation` is now `n // 2 + 1`, `bottom_v` is `n // 2 + 1`, `top_v` is `n - (n // 2)`, `idx` is 1, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is 1, and `idx` is even.**
