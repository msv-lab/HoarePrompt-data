The code snippet `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] = bottom_v` updates the value at the index `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` in the `permutation` list to `bottom_v`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even.
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `k` is the second integer from the input.
- `permutation` is a list of length `n` initialized with zeros except for the element at index `0` which is either `1` if `idx` is even or `n` if `idx` is odd.
- `bottom_v` is 2 if `idx` is even and 1 if `idx` is odd.
- `top_v` is `n` if `idx` is even and `n - 1` if `idx` is odd.
- `idx` is 0.
- `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `k`.

Since `idx` is 0, `bottom_v` is 2 (because `idx` is even), and `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `k`, the code updates the value at index `k` in the `permutation` list to 2.

Therefore, the updated `permutation` list will have:
- The element at index 0 set to 1 (since `idx` is even).
- The element at index `k` set to 2.

All other elements in the `permutation` list remain 0.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `permutation` is a list of length `n` initialized with zeros except for the element at index `0` which is 1 and the element at index `k` which is 2, `bottom_v` is 2, `top_v` is `n`, `idx` is 0, and `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `k`.**
