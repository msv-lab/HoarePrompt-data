The value of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is incremented by `k`. Since the initial value of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is 0, after the increment, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` will be equal to `k`.

All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `permutation` is a list of length `n` initialized with zeros except for the element at index `0` which is either `1` if `idx` is even or `n` if `idx` is odd, `bottom_v` is 2 if `idx` is even and 1 if `idx` is odd, `top_v` is `n` if `idx` is even and `n - 1` if `idx` is odd, `idx` is 0, and `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `k`.**
