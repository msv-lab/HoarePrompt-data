Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `permutation` is a list of length `n` initialized with zeros except `permutation[0]` which is `n`, `bottom_v` is 1, `top_v` is `n - 1`, `idx` is 0, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is 0, and `idx % 2 != 0`.** 

Explanation: The value of `top_v` is decremented by 1, changing its value from `n` to `n - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
