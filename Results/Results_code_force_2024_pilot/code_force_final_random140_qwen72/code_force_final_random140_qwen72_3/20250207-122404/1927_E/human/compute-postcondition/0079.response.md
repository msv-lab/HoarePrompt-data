Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `permutation` is a list of length `n` where elements at indices that are multiples of `k` (starting from 0) are filled alternately with increasing values from `1` to `n//2 + 1` (if the index is even) and decreasing values from `n` to `n//2 + 1` (if the index is odd), `idx` is 2, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `2 + 2*k`, `bottom_v` is `n // 2 + 1 + (number of even-indexed assignments) + 3` if `idx % 2 == 0` or `n // 2 + 1 + (number of even-indexed assignments) + 1` if `idx % 2 != 0`, `top_v` is `n - (n // 2) - (number of odd-indexed assignments)` if `idx % 2 == 0` or `n - (n // 2) - (number of odd-indexed assignments) - 2` if `idx % 2 != 0`, and `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is now `bottom_v`.**
