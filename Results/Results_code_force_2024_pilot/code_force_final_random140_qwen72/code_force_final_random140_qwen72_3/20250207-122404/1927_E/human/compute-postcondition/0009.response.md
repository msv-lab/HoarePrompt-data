Output State: **No variables are passed to the function `func_2`, `t` is now `t - 3` (where `t` was originally greater than 0) and `t` must be greater than 0, `func_1()` has been called three times.** 

Explanation: The value of `t` is decremented by 1, making it `t - 3` from its original value. All other conditions remain unchanged.
