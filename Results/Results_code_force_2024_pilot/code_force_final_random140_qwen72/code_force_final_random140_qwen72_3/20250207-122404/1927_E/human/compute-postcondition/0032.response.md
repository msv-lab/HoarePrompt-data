To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition and the relevant variables:

The loop condition is:
```python
while idx < k:
```

This means the loop will continue to execute as long as `idx` is less than `k`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even.
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `k` is the second integer from the input.
- `permutation` is a list of length `n` with specific values at indices that are multiples of `k`.
- `bottom_v` is `n // 2 + 1` if `idx` is even and `n // 2 + 2` if `idx` is odd.
- `top_v` is `n - (n // 2)` if `idx` is even and `n - (n // 2) - 1` if `idx` is odd.
- `idx` is 1.
- `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is the smallest multiple of `k` greater than or equal to `n`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `idx` must still be less than `k`. Since `idx` is currently 1, and `k` is an even integer greater than or equal to 2, `idx` is already less than `k`.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `permutation` is a list of length `n` where elements at indices that are multiples of `k` (starting from 0) are filled alternately with increasing values from `1` to `n//2 + 1` (if the index is even) and decreasing values from `n` to `n//2 + 1` (if the index is odd), `bottom_v` is `n // 2 + 1` if `idx` is even and `n // 2 + 2` if `idx` is odd, `top_v` is `n - (n // 2)` if `idx` is even and `n - (n // 2) - 1` if `idx` is odd, `idx` is 1, and `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is the smallest multiple of `k` greater than or equal to `n`**.
