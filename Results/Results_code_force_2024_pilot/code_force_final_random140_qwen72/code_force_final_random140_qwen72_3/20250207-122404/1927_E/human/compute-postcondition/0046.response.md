Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `permutation` is a list of length `n` where elements at indices that are multiples of `k` (starting from 0) are filled alternately with increasing values from `1` to `n//2 + 1` (if the index is even) and decreasing values from `n` to `n//2 + 1` (if the index is odd). If `idx` is even, the value at index `1` in `permutation` is `n // 2 + 1`, `bottom_v` is `n // 2 + 2`, and `top_v` is `n - (n // 2)`. If `idx` is odd, the value at index `1` in `permutation` is `n - (n // 2) - 2`, `bottom_v` is `n // 2 + 1` if `idx` is even and `n // 2 + 2` if `idx` is odd, and `top_v` is `n - (n // 2) - 2`. `idx` is 1, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `k + 1`, and the value at index `k + 1` in `permutation` is `n - (n // 2) - 2`.**
