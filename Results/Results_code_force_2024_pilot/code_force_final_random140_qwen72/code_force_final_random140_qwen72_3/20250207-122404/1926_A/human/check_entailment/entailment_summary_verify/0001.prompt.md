You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

- Program:
userStrings = ['8', 'ABABB', 'ABABA', 'BBBAB', 'AAAAA', 'BBBBB', 'BABAA', 'AAAAB', 'BAAAA']
for userString in userStrings:
    func_1(userString)

def func_1(userString):
    list(userString)
    countA = 0
    countB = 0
    for letter in userString:
        if letter == 'A':
            countA += 1
        elif letter == 'B':
            countB += 1
        else:
            continue
    if countA > countB:
        print('A')
    elif countB > countA:
        print('B')
    else:
        pass



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` takes a string `userString` of length 5 consisting only of the characters 'A' and 'B'. It counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in the string. If there are more 'A's than 'B's, it prints 'A'. If there are more 'B's than 'A's, it prints 'B'. If the counts of 'A' and 'B' are equal, it does nothing. The function does not modify `userString` and does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts with a predefined list `userStrings` containing the number of test cases and the test cases themselves. However, the number of test cases (the first element of the list) is not used in the program, which is fine since the loop iterates over all elements in the list, including the first one. This means the first iteration will process the string '8', which is not a valid test case. This is a logical error but does not affect the correctness of the solution for the actual test cases.

2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is defined to process each string. It converts the string to a list, which is unnecessary since strings are already iterable in Python. However, this does not impact the functionality.

3. **Counting Letters**: Inside the function, two counters, `countA` and `countB`, are initialized to zero. The function then iterates over each character in the string, incrementing the appropriate counter based on whether the character is 'A' or 'B'. If a character is neither 'A' nor 'B', it is ignored, which is consistent with the problem statement that guarantees the string consists only of 'A' and 'B'.

4. **Output**: After counting, the function checks which counter is greater and prints the corresponding letter. If both counts are equal, the function does nothing (`pass`), which is acceptable since the problem guarantees that the string length is 5, so there will always be a majority letter.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles the edge case where the string length is exactly 5, and the characters are only 'A' or 'B'. The program correctly identifies the most frequent letter in each test case.

6. **Test Case Execution**: The program processes each string in the `userStrings` list, including the first element '8', which is not a valid test case. However, this does not affect the correctness of the solution for the actual test cases.

Given the above points, the program is logically correct for the actual test cases, even though it processes an extra, invalid test case. 

Correctness: **True**
