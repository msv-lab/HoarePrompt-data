Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `a` is the new input string, `l` is the total number of 'A' characters in the new `a`, and `h` is the total number of characters in the new `a` that are not 'A'. If `l` is greater than `h`, the conditions remain unchanged. If `l` is less than or equal to `h`, the conditions also remain unchanged.***
