The value of `countB` is incremented by 1. The initial state specifies that if the third character (`letter`) is 'A', then `countA` is 2 and `countB` is 0. If the third character is 'B', then `countA` is 0 and `countB` is 2. Since the code increments `countB` by 1, the new value of `countB` will be 1 if the third character is 'A', or 3 if the third character is 'B'. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`userString` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B', `letter` is the third character in `userString`. If the third character is 'A', then `countA` is 2 and `countB` is 1. If the third character is 'B', then `countA` is 0 and `countB` is 3.**
