Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a non-empty input string with at least one more character, and `j` is the third character of `a`. If `j` is 'A', then `l` is the number of 'A' characters in `a` plus 2, and `h` is the number of characters in `a` that are not 'A'. If `j` is not 'A', then `l` is the number of 'A' characters in `a` plus 1, and `h` is the number of characters in `a` that are not 'A' plus 1. Additionally, if `j` is 'A', `l` is incremented by 1, and if `j` is not 'A', `h` is incremented by 1.***
