The value of `countA` is incremented by 1. The initial state specifies that if the third character (`letter`) is 'A', then `countA` is 2 and `countB` is 0. If the third character is 'B', then `countA` is 0 and `countB` is 2. Since the code increments `countA` by 1, the only scenario where this makes sense is when `letter` is 'A', making the initial `countA` 2. After the increment, `countA` becomes 3. The value of `countB` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`userString` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B', `letter` is 'A', `countA` is 3, `countB` is 0.**
