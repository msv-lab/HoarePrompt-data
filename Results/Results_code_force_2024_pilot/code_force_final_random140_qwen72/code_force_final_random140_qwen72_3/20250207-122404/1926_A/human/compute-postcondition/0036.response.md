Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes a string `userString` of length 5 consisting only of the characters 'A' and 'B'. It counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in the string. If there are more 'A's than 'B's, it prints 'A'. If there are more 'B's than 'A's, it prints 'B'. If the counts of 'A' and 'B' are equal, it does nothing. The function does not modify `userString` and does not return any value. **
