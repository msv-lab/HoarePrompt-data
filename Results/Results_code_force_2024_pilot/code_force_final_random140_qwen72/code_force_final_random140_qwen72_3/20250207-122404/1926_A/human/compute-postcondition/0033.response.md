Postcondition: ***`userString` remains a string of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B'. The variable `countA` is the total number of 'A's in `userString`, and the variable `countB` is the total number of 'B's in `userString`. Additionally, `countA` is less than or equal to `countB`. If `countB` is greater than `countA`, no changes occur. If `countB` is equal to `countA`, no changes occur.***
