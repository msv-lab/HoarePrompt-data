Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `a` is the new input string, `l` is the total number of 'A' characters in the new `a`, and `h` is the total number of characters in the new `a` that are not 'A'. If `l` is greater than `h`, the conditions remain unchanged. If `l` is less than or equal to `h`, the conditions also remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for j in a:
    if j in 'A':
        l += 1
    else:
        h += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `a` is the new input string that must have at least one character. If the current character `j` is 'A', `l` is the total number of 'A' characters in the new `a` plus 1, and `h` is the total number of characters in the new `a` that are not 'A'. If the current character `j` is not 'A', `l` is the total number of 'A' characters in the new `a`, and `h` is the total number of characters in the new `a` that are not 'A' plus 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `a` is the new input string that must have at least 2 characters, `j` is the third character in the string `a`. If `j` is 'A', `l` is the total number of 'A' characters in the new `a` plus 1, and `h` is the total number of characters in the new `a` that are not 'A'. If `j` is not 'A', `l` is the total number of 'A' characters in the new `a`, and `h` is the total number of characters in the new `a` that are not 'A' plus 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `a` is the new input string that must have at least 3 characters, and `j` is the fourth character in the string `a`. If `j` is 'A', `l` is the total number of 'A' characters in the new `a` plus 1, and `h` is the total number of characters in the new `a` that are not 'A' plus 1. If `j` is not 'A', `l` is the total number of 'A' characters in the new `a`, and `h` is the total number of characters in the new `a` that are not 'A' plus 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
