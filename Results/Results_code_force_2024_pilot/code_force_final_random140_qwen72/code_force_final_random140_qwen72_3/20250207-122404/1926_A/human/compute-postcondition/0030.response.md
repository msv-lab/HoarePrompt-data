Based on the initial state:

- `userString` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B'.
- `countA` is the total number of 'A's in `userString`.
- `countB` is the total number of 'B's in `userString`.
- `countA` is less than or equal to `countB`.
- The current value of `countB` is greater than `countA`.

Given these conditions, the `print` statement simply prints the character 'B'. The values of `countA` and `countB` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement.

Output: **B**
