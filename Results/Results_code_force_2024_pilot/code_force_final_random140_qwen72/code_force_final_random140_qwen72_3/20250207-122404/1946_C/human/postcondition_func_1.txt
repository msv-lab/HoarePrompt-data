The function `dfs` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, where `x` is a vertex in the graph `g` and `y` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of the connected component after removing edges. The function performs a depth-first search starting from vertex `x` and updates the `visited` set to include all visited vertices. It returns two values: `c` and `r`. `c` is the total count of vertices in the connected component rooted at `x` that do not meet the minimum size threshold `y`, plus 1 (for the initial vertex `x`). `r` is the total count of edges removed to ensure no connected component exceeds the size `y`, plus the number of times a connected component meets or exceeds the size `y`. After the function concludes, the `visited` set includes all vertices that were part of the DFS traversal starting from `x`.
