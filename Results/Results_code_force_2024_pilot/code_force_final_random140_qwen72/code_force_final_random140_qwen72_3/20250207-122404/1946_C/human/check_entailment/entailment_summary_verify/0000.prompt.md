You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a tree with n vertices.

Your task is to find the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove
exactly k edges from this tree in such a way that the size of each remaining
connected component^{\dagger} is at least x .

^{\dagger} Two vertices v and u are in the same connected component if there
exists a sequence of numbers t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k of arbitrary length k ,
such that t_1 = v , t_k = u , and for each i from 1 to k - 1 , vertices t_i
and t_{i+1} are connected by an edge.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of sets of input data. This
is followed by a description of the sets of input data.

The first line of each set of input data contains two integers n and k (1 \le
k < n \le 10^5 ) — the number of vertices in the tree and the number of edges
to be removed.

Each of the next n - 1 lines of each set of input data contains two integers v
and u (1 \le v, u \le n ) — the next edge of the tree.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all sets of input data
does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each set of input data, output a single line containing the maximum number
x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree in such a
way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x .

Note

The tree in the first set of input data:

After removing the edge 1 — 3 , the tree will look as follows:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/a59ae10eeac1212e1e56fc7fe5f6a47764269104.png)

The tree has split into two connected components. The first component consists
of two vertices: 1 and 2 . The second connected component consists of three
vertices: 3, 4 and 5 . In both connected components, there are at least two
vertices. It can be shown that the answer 3 is not achievable, so the answer
is 2 .

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 5 : The function reads two integers, `n` and `k`, from the input, where `n` represents the number of vertices in a tree and `k` represents the number of edges to be removed. It then constructs a tree with `n` vertices and `n-1` edges based on additional user inputs. After constructing the tree, it roots the tree non-recursively starting from vertex 0. Finally, it calls another function `func_4` with the constructed tree, `n`, and `k`, and prints the result of this call. The result is the maximum number of connected components that can be formed after removing `k` edges from the tree.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program appears to correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Here's a breakdown of why the program is considered correct:

1. **Tree Representation and Initialization**:
   - The `Tree` class is assumed to be correctly implemented, as it is used to build the tree structure from the input edges and root the tree.
   - The tree is constructed using the `add_edge` method, and the tree is rooted using `root_tree_non_recursive`.

2. **Binary Search for Maximum Component Size**:
   - The `func_4` function uses binary search to find the maximum value `x` such that it is possible to remove exactly `k` edges and ensure each remaining connected component has at least `x` vertices.
   - The binary search is correctly implemented with the condition `while beg < end`, and the midpoint calculation ensures the search space is halved appropriately.

3. **Component Size Calculation**:
   - The `func_1` function calculates the number of good components and the remaining size of the subtree rooted at a given vertex.
   - The function uses a stack-based approach to perform a depth-first search (DFS) and correctly updates the `good_components` and `remaining_size` for each vertex.

4. **Validation of Component Sizes**:
   - The `func_3` function checks if the current value of `x` is valid by calling `func_1` and verifying the conditions specified in the problem statement.
   - The function correctly returns `True` if the number of good components is greater than `k` or if the number of good components equals `k` and the remaining size is at least `x`.

5. **Input Handling and Output**:
   - The `func_5` function reads the input, constructs the tree, and calls `func_4` to compute and print the result.
   - The input handling is consistent with the problem description, and the output is correctly formatted.

Given the above points, the program appears to handle all potential cases correctly and meets the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the program is considered correct.
