Reasoning:

The provided code aims to solve the problem of finding the maximum number \( x \) such that it is possible to remove exactly \( k \) edges from a tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least \( x \).

### Analysis of the Code:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The code reads multiple test cases, each with the number of vertices \( n \) and the number of edges to remove \( k \), followed by the edges of the tree.
   - The edges are stored in a list of tuples.

2. **Graph Construction:**
   - The adjacency list `g` is constructed using the edges provided. This is done correctly, ensuring that each vertex points to its neighbors.

3. **Binary Search:**
   - The function `func_1` uses a binary search to find the maximum \( x \) such that the condition is met.
   - The binary search range is from 1 to \( n // k + 1 \), which is a reasonable upper bound for \( x \).

4. **DFS Function (`dfs`):**
   - The `dfs` function is used to traverse the tree and determine the size of the connected components.
   - It correctly counts the number of vertices in the current component and the number of edges that need to be removed to ensure the component size is at least \( x \).

5. **Check Function (`check`):**
   - The `check` function uses the `dfs` function to verify if it is possible to remove \( k \) edges such that all remaining components have at least \( x \) vertices.
   - It clears the `visited` set before each call to `dfs` to ensure a fresh traversal.

6. **Output:**
   - The function `func_1` prints the largest value of \( x \) for which the `check` function returns `True`.

### Potential Issues and Verification:

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The code handles the edge case where \( k = 1 \) and \( n = 2 \) correctly, as it would return 1.
  - The code also handles larger trees and multiple test cases as expected.

- **Binary Search Logic:**
  - The binary search logic is sound, as it narrows down the possible values of \( x \) efficiently.

- **DFS and Check Function:**
  - The `dfs` function correctly traverses the tree and counts the components.
  - The `check` function ensures that the conditions are met for the given \( x \).

### Conclusion:

The provided code appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem. It handles the input, constructs the graph, performs the necessary checks, and outputs the correct result for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
