Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided has a few issues that prevent it from being correct for all potential cases:

1. **Global Variable `g`**: The adjacency list `g` is defined globally within the `func_1` function, but it is used in the `dfs` and `check` functions without being passed as an argument. This can lead to issues if these functions are called in different contexts or if the global state is modified unexpectedly.

2. **Binary Search Range**: The binary search range is initialized as `l = 1` and `r = n // k + 1`. However, the upper bound `n // k + 1` might not always be the correct upper limit for the maximum component size. For example, if `n = 10` and `k = 1`, the maximum component size could be 5, but the program initializes `r` as 11, which is incorrect.

3. **DFS Function**: The `dfs` function is designed to traverse the tree and count the number of components and their sizes. However, the logic for splitting components and counting them might not handle all edge cases correctly. Specifically, the condition `if ans >= y:` might not always ensure that the component size is at least `y`.

4. **Check Function**: The `check` function is supposed to verify if it is possible to remove exactly `k` edges such that each remaining component has at least `x` vertices. However, the logic for checking this condition might not be robust enough. For example, the condition `if ans >= x and r >= k:` might not always accurately reflect the requirement.

To illustrate a specific case where the program might fail, consider the following input:

```
1
5 1
1 2
1 3
3 4
3 5
```

Expected Output:
```
2
```

However, the program might not correctly handle this case due to the issues mentioned above. Specifically, the binary search range and the DFS logic might not correctly identify the maximum component size.
