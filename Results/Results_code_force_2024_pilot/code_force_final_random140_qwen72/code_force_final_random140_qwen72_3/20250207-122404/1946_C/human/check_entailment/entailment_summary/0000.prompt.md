Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given a tree with n vertices.

Your task is to find the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove
exactly k edges from this tree in such a way that the size of each remaining
connected component^{\dagger} is at least x .

^{\dagger} Two vertices v and u are in the same connected component if there
exists a sequence of numbers t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k of arbitrary length k ,
such that t_1 = v , t_k = u , and for each i from 1 to k - 1 , vertices t_i
and t_{i+1} are connected by an edge.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of sets of input data. This
is followed by a description of the sets of input data.

The first line of each set of input data contains two integers n and k (1 \le
k < n \le 10^5 ) — the number of vertices in the tree and the number of edges
to be removed.

Each of the next n - 1 lines of each set of input data contains two integers v
and u (1 \le v, u \le n ) — the next edge of the tree.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all sets of input data
does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each set of input data, output a single line containing the maximum number
x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree in such a
way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x .

Note

The tree in the first set of input data:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/799bacd3be0dda357800fdfc3eadbf38ab259c51.png)

After removing the edge 1 — 3 , the tree will look as follows:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/a59ae10eeac1212e1e56fc7fe5f6a47764269104.png)

The tree has split into two connected components. The first component consists
of two vertices: 1 and 2 . The second connected component consists of three
vertices: 3, 4 and 5 . In both connected components, there are at least two
vertices. It can be shown that the answer 3 is not achievable, so the answer
is 2 .

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(n, k, edges):
    g = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for (a, b) in edges:

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n` (an integer representing the number of vertices in a tree), `k` (an integer representing the number of edges to be removed such that 1 <= k < n <= 10^5), and `edges` (a list of tuples where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge between vertices a and b). The function constructs an adjacency list representation of the tree and then uses a binary search approach to determine the maximum number of edges that can be removed while ensuring the remaining graph remains connected. The function prints the largest value of `mid` for which the `check(mid)` function returned `False`, indicating the maximum number of edges that can be removed. The function does not return any value explicitly, but it modifies the state of the program by printing the result.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def dfs(x, y):
    c = 1
    r = 0
    visited.add(x)
    for node in g[x]:
        if node not in visited:
            (ans, rn) = dfs(node, y)
            r += rn
            if ans >= y:
                r += 1
            else:
                c += ans
    return (c, r)
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `dfs` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, where `x` is a vertex in the graph `g` and `y` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of the connected component after removing edges. The function performs a depth-first search starting from vertex `x` and updates the `visited` set to include all visited vertices. It returns two values: `c` and `r`. `c` is the total count of vertices in the connected component rooted at `x` that do not meet the minimum size threshold `y`, plus 1 (for the initial vertex `x`). `r` is the total count of edges removed to ensure no connected component exceeds the size `y`, plus the number of times a connected component meets or exceeds the size `y`. After the function concludes, the `visited` set includes all vertices that were part of the DFS traversal starting from `x`.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def check(x):
    visited.clear()
    (ans, r) = dfs(1, x)
    if ans >= x and r >= k:
        return True
    return False
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `check` takes a positive integer `x` as input and determines whether, after removing `k` edges from a graph, all remaining connected components have at least `x` nodes. It returns `True` if this condition is met, and `False` otherwise. The function also clears the `visited` set before performing its checks.
