### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires finding the maximum number `x` such that after removing exactly `k` edges from the tree, each remaining connected component has at least `x` vertices.
   - The tree is represented as a collection of edges, and we need to ensure that the removal of edges results in components of at least size `x`.

2. **Program Structure**:
   - The program is divided into several functions:
     - `func_1`: This function performs a depth-first search (DFS) to calculate the number of "good" components and the remaining size of the subtree rooted at a given vertex.
     - `func_2`: Another DFS function similar to `func_1`, but it prints intermediate results.
     - `func_3`: This function checks if it is possible to achieve the desired condition with a given `x`.
     - `func_4`: This function uses binary search to find the maximum `x` that satisfies the condition.
     - `func_5`: This function reads the input, constructs the tree, and calls `func_4` to get the result.

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1` and `func_2`**: Both functions perform a DFS to calculate the number of "good" components and the remaining size of the subtree. They are essentially the same, with `func_2` printing additional information. The logic is correct for calculating the number of components and their sizes.
     - **Summary**: `func_1` and `func_2` correctly traverse the tree and compute the required values.
   - **`func_3`**: This function checks if it is possible to achieve the desired condition with a given `x`. It uses the results from `func_1` to determine if the number of "good" components is greater than or equal to `k` and if the remaining size is at least `x`. The logic is correct.
     - **Summary**: `func_3` correctly evaluates the condition for a given `x`.
   - **`func_4`**: This function uses binary search to find the maximum `x` that satisfies the condition. The binary search is correctly implemented, and it uses `func_3` to check the condition for each midpoint.
     - **Summary**: `func_4` correctly implements binary search to find the maximum `x`.
   - **`func_5`**: This function reads the input, constructs the tree, and calls `func_4` to get the result. The tree construction and the call to `func_4` are correct.
     - **Summary**: `func_5` correctly handles input and constructs the tree.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases where `k` is 0 or `n-1` correctly. For example, if `k` is 0, the entire tree remains intact, and the maximum `x` is the size of the tree. If `k` is `n-1`, the tree is reduced to isolated vertices, and the maximum `x` is 1.
   - **Summary**: Edge cases are handled correctly.

5. **Overall Correctness**:
   - The program correctly implements the required logic to solve the problem. It uses DFS to explore the tree, binary search to find the maximum `x`, and checks the conditions as specified in the problem statement.
   - **Summary**: The program is logically sound and should produce the correct output for valid inputs.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
