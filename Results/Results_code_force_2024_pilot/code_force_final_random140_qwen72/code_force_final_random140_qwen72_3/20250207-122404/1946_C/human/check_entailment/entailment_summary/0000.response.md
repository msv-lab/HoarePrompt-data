### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the maximum number \( x \) such that it is possible to remove exactly \( k \) edges from a tree in such a way that each remaining connected component has at least \( x \) vertices.
   - The input consists of multiple test cases, each with a tree and a number \( k \).

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1`**:
     - Constructs an adjacency list representation of the tree.
     - Uses binary search to find the maximum \( x \) such that the condition is met.
     - Calls the `check` function to verify if a given \( x \) is valid.
     - Prints the result of the binary search.
   - **`dfs`**:
     - Performs a depth-first search to explore the tree.
     - Counts the number of vertices in each connected component and the number of edges removed.
     - Returns the count of vertices in the current component and the number of edges removed.
   - **`check`**:
     - Clears the `visited` set.
     - Calls `dfs` starting from vertex 1 to check if the tree can be partitioned such that each component has at least \( x \) vertices and exactly \( k \) edges are removed.
     - Returns `True` if the condition is met, otherwise `False`.

3. **Binary Search**:
   - The binary search in `func_1` is used to efficiently find the maximum \( x \).
   - The search range is from 1 to \( n // k + 1 \), which is a reasonable upper bound because the maximum size of a component after removing \( k \) edges is \( n // (k + 1) \).

4. **DFS and Check**:
   - The `dfs` function correctly traverses the tree and counts the vertices and edges.
   - The `check` function ensures that the conditions are met by using the results from `dfs`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The functions handle the constraints and edge cases as specified in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The binary search, DFS, and checking mechanisms are appropriately designed to find the maximum \( x \) for each test case.

**Correctness: **True****
