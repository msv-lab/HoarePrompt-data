### Reasoning:

1. **Tree Representation and Initialization**:
   - The `Tree` class is not explicitly provided, but it is assumed to be correctly implemented based on the context. The tree is constructed using the `add_edge` method, and the tree is rooted using `root_tree_non_recursive`. These methods are essential for setting up the tree structure, which is necessary for the subsequent functions to work correctly.

2. **Binary Search for Maximum Component Size**:
   - The `func_4` function implements a binary search to find the maximum value `x` such that it is possible to remove exactly `k` edges and ensure each remaining connected component has at least `x` vertices. The binary search is correctly implemented with the condition `while beg < end`, and the midpoint calculation ensures the search space is halved appropriately. This approach is efficient and suitable for the problem constraints.

3. **Component Size Calculation**:
   - The `func_1` function calculates the number of good components and the remaining size of the subtree rooted at a given vertex. It uses a stack-based approach to perform a depth-first search (DFS) and correctly updates the `good_components` and `remaining_size` for each vertex. This function is crucial for determining the validity of a given `x` value.

4. **Validation of Component Sizes**:
   - The `func_3` function checks if the current value of `x` is valid by calling `func_1` and verifying the conditions specified in the problem statement. It correctly returns `True` if the number of good components is greater than `k` or if the number of good components equals `k` and the remaining size is at least `x`. This function ensures that the binary search in `func_4` converges to the correct value of `x`.

5. **Input Handling and Output**:
   - The `func_5` function reads the input, constructs the tree, and calls `func_4` to compute and print the result. The input handling is consistent with the problem description, and the output is correctly formatted. This function serves as the main entry point for the program and ensures that the solution is applied to each test case.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the solution for the given problem, handling all potential cases and meeting the requirements specified in the problem description.

Final: **True**
