Each list `g[i]` contains all the vertices that are connected to vertex `i` by an edge, according to the edges defined in the `edges` list, `c` is 0, `visited` is an empty set, `l` is `r + 1`, `r` is the largest value of `mid` for which `check(mid)` returned `False`.
    print(r)
    #This is printed: r (where r is the largest value of mid for which check(mid) returned False)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n` (an integer representing the number of vertices in a tree), `k` (an integer representing the number of edges to be removed such that 1 <= k < n <= 10^5), and `edges` (a list of tuples where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge between vertices a and b). The function constructs an adjacency list representation of the tree and then uses a binary search approach to determine the maximum number of edges that can be removed while ensuring the remaining graph remains connected. The function prints the largest value of `mid` for which the `check(mid)` function returned `False`, indicating the maximum number of edges that can be removed. The function does not return any value explicitly, but it modifies the state of the program by printing the result.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are non-negative integers, where x represents a vertex in the graph g, and y represents the minimum size of the connected component after removing edges. g is a dictionary representing an adjacency list of the tree, and visited is a set of vertices that have already been visited during the DFS traversal.

            if ans >= y:
                r += 1
            else:
                c += ans
        
    #State: `x` and `y` are non-negative integers, `x` represents a vertex in the graph `g`, `y` represents the minimum size of the connected component after removing edges, `g` is a dictionary representing an adjacency list of the tree, `visited` is a set of vertices that have already been visited during the DFS traversal, including `x`, `g[x]` must contain at least one element (i.e., `x` must have at least one neighbor). After all iterations of the loop, `c` is the sum of all `ans` values from the `dfs` calls where `ans` was less than `y`, plus 1 (the initial value of `c`). `r` is the sum of all `rn` values from the `dfs` calls, plus the number of times `ans` was greater than or equal to `y`. The `visited` set will include all nodes that were visited during the loop.
    return c, r
    #The program returns `c` and `r`, where `c` is the sum of all `ans` values from the `dfs` calls where `ans` was less than `y`, plus 1 (the initial value of `c`). `r` is the sum of all `rn` values from the `dfs` calls, plus the number of times `ans` was greater than or equal to `y`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `dfs` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, where `x` is a vertex in the graph `g` and `y` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of the connected component after removing edges. The function performs a depth-first search starting from vertex `x` and updates the `visited` set to include all visited vertices. It returns two values: `c` and `r`. `c` is the total count of vertices in the connected component rooted at `x` that do not meet the minimum size threshold `y`, plus 1 (for the initial vertex `x`). `r` is the total count of edges removed to ensure no connected component exceeds the size `y`, plus the number of times a connected component meets or exceeds the size `y`. After the function concludes, the `visited` set includes all vertices that were part of the DFS traversal starting from `x`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing k edges.
def check(x):
    visited.clear()
    ans, r = dfs(1, x)

        return True
        #The program returns True.
    #State: *`x` is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing k edges, `visited` is an empty set, `ans` and `r` are the values returned by the `dfs` function called with arguments 1 and `x`. Either `ans` is less than `x` or `r` is less than `k` (or both).
    return False
    #The program returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `check` takes a positive integer `x` as input and determines whether, after removing `k` edges from a graph, all remaining connected components have at least `x` nodes. It returns `True` if this condition is met, and `False` otherwise. The function also clears the `visited` set before performing its checks.
