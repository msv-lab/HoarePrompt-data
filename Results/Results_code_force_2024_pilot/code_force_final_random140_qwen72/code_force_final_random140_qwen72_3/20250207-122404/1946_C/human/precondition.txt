t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and k are integers where 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5, representing the number of vertices in the tree and the number of edges to be removed, respectively. Each of the next n - 1 lines contains two integers v and u (1 ≤ v, u ≤ n), representing an edge between vertices v and u. The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
