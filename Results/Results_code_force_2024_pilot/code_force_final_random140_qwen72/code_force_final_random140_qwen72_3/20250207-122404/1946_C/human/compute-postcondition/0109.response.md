The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `tree`, `s`, and `x`. `tree` is a Tree object representing a tree structure with vertices and edges, `s` is a non-negative integer representing the starting vertex, and `x` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of the remaining connected components after edge removals. The function returns two values: the total count of good components starting from vertex `s`, and the size of the remaining component at vertex `s`. A good component is defined as a component where the remaining size is greater than or equal to `x`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a Tree object `tree`, a non-negative integer `s` representing the starting vertex, and a non-negative integer `x` representing the minimum size of the remaining connected components. It returns the total count of good components starting from vertex `s` and the size of the remaining component at vertex `s`. A good component is one where the remaining size is greater than or equal to `x`.**
