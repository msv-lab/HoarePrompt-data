The code snippet `c += ans` updates the value of `c` by adding the value of `ans` to it. Here's the detailed impact:

- `c` is incremented by the value of `ans`.
- All other variables (`x`, `y`, `g`, `visited`, `node`, `ans`, `rn`, `r`) remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `x` and `y` are non-negative integers.
- `x` represents a vertex in the graph `g`.
- `y` represents the minimum size of the connected component after removing edges.
- `g` is a dictionary representing an adjacency list of the tree.
- `visited` is a set of vertices that have already been visited during the DFS traversal, including `x`.
- `g[x]` must contain at least one element.
- `node` is the next neighbor of `x` in `g[x]` after the current `node`.
- If `node` is not in `visited`, `ans` and `rn` are the results returned by the `dfs` function called with arguments `node` and `y`.
- If `node` is in `visited`, `ans` and `rn` remain undefined.
- `r` is now `r_initial + rn_value`.

After executing `c += ans`:
- `c` is updated to `c + ans`.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are non-negative integers, `x` represents a vertex in the graph `g`, `y` represents the minimum size of the connected component after removing edges, `g` is a dictionary representing an adjacency list of the tree, `visited` is a set of vertices that have already been visited during the DFS traversal, including `x`, `g[x]` must contain at least one element, `node` is the next neighbor of `x` in `g[x]` after the current `node`, if `node` is not in `visited`, `ans` and `rn` are the results returned by the `dfs` function called with arguments `node` and `y`, if `node` is in `visited`, `ans` and `rn` remain undefined, `r` is now `r_initial + rn_value`, `c` is now `c + ans`.**
