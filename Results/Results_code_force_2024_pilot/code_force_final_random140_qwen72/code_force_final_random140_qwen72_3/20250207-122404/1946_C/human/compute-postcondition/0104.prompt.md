Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tree` is a Tree object representing a tree structure with vertices and edges, `s` is a non-negative integer representing the starting vertex, `x` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of the remaining connected components after edge removals, `v` is the first element of the tuple that was popped from `stack`, `postorder` is the second element of the tuple that was popped from `stack`, `stack` is the list after popping the top element, `good_components` is a dictionary with `v` as a key and `0` as its value, `remaining_size` is a dictionary with `v` as a key and `1` as its value. `postorder` is true, and `good_components[v]` will be the sum of `good_components[u]` for all children `u` of `v` plus the number of children `u` whose `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`. The `remaining_size[v]` will be the sum of `remaining_size[u]` for all children `u` of `v` whose `remaining_size[u]` is less than `x`, plus 1 (the initial value of `remaining_size[v]`). The `stack`, `postorder`, and `tree` remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
    good_components[v] += good_components[u]
    if remaining_size[u] >= x:
        good_components[v] += 1
    else:
        remaining_size[v] += remaining_size[u]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`tree` is a Tree object with `v` having at least one child, `s` is a non-negative integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `v` is the first element of the tuple that was popped from `stack`, `postorder` is the second element of the tuple that was popped from `stack`, `stack` is the list after popping the top element, `postorder` is true, `good_components` is a dictionary with `v` as a key, and `remaining_size` is a dictionary with `v` as a key. If `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `good_components[v]` is incremented by 1 and `remaining_size[v]` remains 1. If `remaining_size[u]` is less than `x`, then `good_components[v]` remains unchanged and `remaining_size[v]` is updated to `remaining_size[v] + remaining_size[u]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`tree` is a Tree object with `v` having at least one child, `s` is a non-negative integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `v` is the first element of the tuple that was popped from `stack`, `postorder` is true, `stack` is the list after popping the top element, `good_components` is a dictionary with `v` as a key, `remaining_size` is a dictionary with `v` as a key, `u` is the next child of `v` in `tree.vertices[v].children`, `good_components[v]` is updated to `good_components[v] + good_components[u]`. If `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`, `good_components[v]` is further incremented by 1. Otherwise, `remaining_size[v]` is updated to `remaining_size[v] + remaining_size[u]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`tree` is a Tree object with `v` having at least two children, `s` is a non-negative integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `v` is the first element of the tuple that was popped from `stack`, `postorder` is true, `stack` is the list after popping the top element, `good_components` is a dictionary with `v` as a key, `remaining_size` is a dictionary with `v` as a key, `u` is the next child of `v` in `tree.vertices[v].children`, `good_components[v]` is now `good_components[v] + good_components[u]`. If `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `good_components[v]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `remaining_size[v]` is incremented by `remaining_size[u]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
