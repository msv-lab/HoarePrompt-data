The value of `good_components[v]` is incremented by the value of `good_components[u]`. The preconditions that `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least two children and that `u` is the second child in `tree.vertices[v].children` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least two children, `u` is the second child in `tree.vertices[v].children`, `good_components[v]` is increased by `good_components[u]`.**
