Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `good_components[v]` will be the sum of `good_components[u]` for all children `u` of `v` plus the number of children `u` whose `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`. The `remaining_size[v]` will be the sum of `remaining_size[u]` for all children `u` of `v` whose `remaining_size[u]` is less than `x`, plus 1 (the initial value of `remaining_size[v]`). The `stack`, `postorder`, and `tree` remain unchanged.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all iterations:
- `good_components[v]` will include the sum of `good_components` values of all children of `v` and an additional count for each child whose `remaining_size` is at least `x`.
- `remaining_size[v]` will be the sum of the `remaining_size` values of all children of `v` whose `remaining_size` is less than `x`, plus the initial value of 1.
- The `stack`, `postorder`, and the overall structure of `tree` remain the same as they were before the loop started.
