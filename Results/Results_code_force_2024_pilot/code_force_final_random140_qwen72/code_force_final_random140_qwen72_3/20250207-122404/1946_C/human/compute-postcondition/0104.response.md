Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with `v` having any number of children, `s` is a non-negative integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `v` is the first element of the tuple that was popped from `stack`, `postorder` is true, `stack` is the list after popping the top element, `good_components` is a dictionary with `v` as a key, and `remaining_size` is a dictionary with `v` as a key. `good_components[v]` is the sum of `good_components[u]` for all children `u` of `v` plus the number of children `u` whose `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`. `remaining_size[v]` is the sum of `remaining_size[u]` for all children `u` of `v` whose `remaining_size[u]` is less than `x`, plus 1 (the initial value of `remaining_size[v]`).**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `good_components[v]` will contain the total count of "good" components (where a component is considered "good" if its `remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`) plus the sum of `good_components` values of all children. The `remaining_size[v]` will be the sum of the `remaining_size` values of all children whose `remaining_size` is less than `x`, plus the initial value of 1 for `v`. The `tree`, `s`, `x`, `v`, `postorder`, and `stack` remain unchanged from their initial states, except for the updates to `good_components[v]` and `remaining_size[v]` within the loop.
