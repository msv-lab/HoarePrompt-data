Output State: **`tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least one child, `u` is the first child in `tree.vertices[v].children`, `good_components[v]` is now equal to its original value plus `good_components[u]`, `remaining_size[u]` is less than `x`, and `remaining_size[v]` is now equal to its original value plus `remaining_size[u]`.**
