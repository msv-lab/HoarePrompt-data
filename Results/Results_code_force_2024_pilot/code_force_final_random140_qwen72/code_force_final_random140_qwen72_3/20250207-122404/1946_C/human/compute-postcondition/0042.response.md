Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object representing a tree structure with vertices and edges, `s` is a non-negative integer representing the starting vertex, `x` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of the remaining connected components after edge removals, `v` is the first element of the tuple popped from `stack`, `postorder` is the second element of the tuple popped from `stack`, `stack` is the list after popping the top element and now includes the tuple `(v, True)`, `good_components` is a dictionary with `v` as a key and `0` as its value, and `remaining_size` is a dictionary with `v` as a key and `1` as its value.**

Explanation: The line `remaining_size[v] = 1` sets the value of `remaining_size[v]` to `1`. All other variables and their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
