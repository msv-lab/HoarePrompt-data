Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n` (an integer representing the number of vertices in a tree), `k` (an integer representing the number of edges to be removed such that 1 <= k < n <= 10^5), and `edges` (a list of tuples where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge between vertices a and b). The function constructs an adjacency list representation of the tree and then uses a binary search approach to determine the maximum number of edges that can be removed while ensuring the remaining graph remains connected. The function prints the largest value of `mid` for which the `check(mid)` function returned `False`, indicating the maximum number of edges that can be removed. The function does not return any value explicitly, but it modifies the state of the program by printing the result. **
