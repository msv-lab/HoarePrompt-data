Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with `v` having at least two children, `s` is a non-negative integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `v` is the first element of the tuple that was popped from `stack`, `postorder` is true, `stack` is the list after popping the top element, `good_components` is a dictionary with `v` as a key, `remaining_size` is a dictionary with `v` as a key, `u` is the next child of `v` in `tree.vertices[v].children`, `good_components[v]` is now `good_components[v] + good_components[u]`.** 

Explanation: The value of `good_components[v]` has been updated by adding the value of `good_components[u]` to it. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
