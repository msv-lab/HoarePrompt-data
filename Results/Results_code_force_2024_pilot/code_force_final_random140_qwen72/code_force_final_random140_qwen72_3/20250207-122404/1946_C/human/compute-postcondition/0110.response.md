Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes a Tree object `tree`, a non-negative integer `s` representing the starting vertex, and a non-negative integer `x` representing the minimum size of the remaining connected components. It processes the tree to determine the number of "good components" and the size of the remaining component at the starting vertex `s`. A "good component" is defined as a connected part of the tree where the size of the component is greater than or equal to `x`. The function returns a tuple containing two values: the first value is the total count of good components starting from vertex `s`, and the second value is the size of the remaining component at vertex `s`. The size of the remaining component includes the vertex itself and any smaller components that do not meet the minimum size requirement `x`. The original tree structure remains unchanged. **
