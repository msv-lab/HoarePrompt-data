Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: x and y are non-negative integers, where x represents a vertex in the graph g, and y represents the minimum size of the connected component after removing edges. g is a dictionary representing an adjacency list of the tree, and visited is a set of vertices that have already been visited during the DFS traversal, including x. c is 1, r is 0.
Code of the loop:
for node in g[x]:
    if node not in visited:
        ans, rn = dfs(node, y)
        r += rn
        if ans >= y:
            r += 1
        else:
            c += ans


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`x` and `y` are non-negative integers, `x` represents a vertex in the graph `g`, `y` represents the minimum size of the connected component after removing edges, `g` is a dictionary representing an adjacency list of the tree, `visited` is a set of vertices that have already been visited during the DFS traversal, including `x`, `g[x]` must contain at least one element (i.e., `x` must have at least one neighbor). If `node` is not in the `visited` set, `ans` and `rn` are the results returned from the `dfs` function call. If `ans` is greater than or equal to `y`, then `r` is updated to `rn + 1` and `c` remains 1. Otherwise, if `ans` is less than `y`, then `c` is updated to `1 + ans` and `r` remains `rn`. If `node` is in the `visited` set, `c` and `r` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`x` and `y` are non-negative integers, `x` represents a vertex in the graph `g`, `y` represents the minimum size of the connected component after removing edges, `g` is a dictionary representing an adjacency list of the tree, `visited` is a set of vertices that have already been visited during the DFS traversal, including `x`, `g[x]` must contain at least one element (i.e., `x` must have at least one neighbor), `node` is the next neighbor of `x` in `g[x]`. If `node` is not in `visited`, `ans` and `rn` are the results returned by the `dfs` function called with arguments `node` and `y`. If `ans` is greater than or equal to `y`, `r` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `r` is incremented by `rn` and `c` is incremented by `ans`. If `node` is in `visited`, no changes are made to `r` or `c`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`x` and `y` are non-negative integers, `x` represents a vertex in the graph `g`, `y` represents the minimum size of the connected component after removing edges, `g` is a dictionary representing an adjacency list of the tree, `visited` is a set of vertices that have already been visited during the DFS traversal, including `x`, `g[x]` must contain at least one element, `node` is the next neighbor of `x` in `g[x]` after the current `node`. If `node` is not in `visited`, `ans` and `rn` are the results returned by the `dfs` function called with arguments `node` and `y`. If `ans` is greater than or equal to `y`, `r` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `r` is incremented by `rn` and `c` is incremented by `ans`. If `node` is in `visited`, no changes are made to `r` or `c`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
