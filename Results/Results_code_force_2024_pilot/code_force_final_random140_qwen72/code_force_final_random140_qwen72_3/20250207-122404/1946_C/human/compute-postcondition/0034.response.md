To determine what will be printed by the `print(r)` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the context provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree.
   - `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed such that \(1 \leq k < n \leq 10^5\).
   - `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple `(a, b)` represents an edge between vertices `a` and `b`.
   - `g` is a list of lists with length `n + 1`. Each list `g[i]` contains all the vertices that are connected to vertex `i` by an edge, according to the edges defined in the `edges` list.
   - `c` is 0.
   - `visited` is an empty set.
   - `l` is `r + 1`.
   - `r` is the largest value of `mid` for which `check(mid)` returned `False`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `r` is the largest value of `mid` for which the function `check(mid)` returned `False`. This implies that `r` is the result of a binary search or similar algorithm where `check(mid)` is used to determine a condition.

3. **Binary Search Context:**
   - In a typical binary search, `l` and `r` are the left and right bounds of the search range.
   - The condition `l = r + 1` indicates that the search has terminated, and `r` is the last value checked where `check(mid)` was `False`.

4. **Output Determination:**
   - Since `r` is the largest value of `mid` for which `check(mid)` returned `False`, the value of `r` is the result of the search process.

Given this context, the `print(r)` statement will print the value of `r`, which is the largest value of `mid` for which `check(mid)` returned `False`.

Output: **r (where r is the largest value of mid for which check(mid) returned False)**
