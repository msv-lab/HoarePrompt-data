Postcondition: ***`tree` is a Tree object with `v` having at least one child, `s` is a non-negative integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `v` is the first element of the tuple that was popped from `stack`, `postorder` is true, `stack` is the list after popping the top element, `good_components` is a dictionary with `v` as a key, `remaining_size` is a dictionary with `v` as a key, `u` is the next child of `v` in `tree.vertices[v].children`, `good_components[v]` is updated to `good_components[v] + good_components[u]`. If `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`, `good_components[v]` is further incremented by 1. Otherwise, `remaining_size[v]` is updated to `remaining_size[v] + remaining_size[u]`.***
