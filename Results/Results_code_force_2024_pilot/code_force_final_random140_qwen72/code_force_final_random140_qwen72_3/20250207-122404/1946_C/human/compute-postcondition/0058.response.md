Postcondition: ***`tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least one child, `u` is the first child in `tree.vertices[v].children`, `good_components[v]` is now equal to its original value plus `good_components[u]`. If `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`, `good_components[v]` is incremented by 1. If `remaining_size[u]` is less than `x`, `remaining_size[v]` is updated to its original value plus `remaining_size[u]`.***
