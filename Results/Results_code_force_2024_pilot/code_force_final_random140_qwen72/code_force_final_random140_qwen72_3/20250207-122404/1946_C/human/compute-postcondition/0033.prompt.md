Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` remains an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` remains an integer representing the number of edges to be removed such that 1 <= k < n <= 10^5, `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge between vertices a and b, `g` is a list of lists with length `n + 1`. Each list `g[i]` contains all the vertices that are connected to vertex `i` by an edge, according to the edges defined in the `edges` list, `c` is 0, `visited` is an empty set, `l` is 1, `r` is `n // k + 1`.
Code of the loop:
while l <= r:
    mid = l + (r - l) // 2
    if check(mid):
        l = mid + 1
    else:
        r = mid - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` remains an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` remains an integer representing the number of edges to be removed such that 1 <= k < n <= 10^5, `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge between vertices a and b, `g` is a list of lists with length `n + 1`. Each list `g[i]` contains all the vertices that are connected to vertex `i` by an edge, according to the edges defined in the `edges` list, `c` is 0, `visited` is an empty set, `mid` is `1 + (n // k) // 2`. If `check(mid)` returns `True`, then `l` is updated to `1 + (n // k) // 2 + 1` and `r` remains `n // k + 1`. If `check(mid)` returns `False`, then `l` remains 1 and `r` is updated to `mid - 1`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`n` remains an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` remains an integer representing the number of edges to be removed such that 1 <= k < n <= 10^5, `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge between vertices a and b, `g` is a list of lists with length `n + 1`. Each list `g[i]` contains all the vertices that are connected to vertex `i` by an edge, according to the edges defined in the `edges` list, `c` is 0, `visited` is an empty set, `mid` is `l + (r - l) // 2`. If `check(mid)` is true, `l` is updated to `mid + 1` and `r` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `r` is updated to `mid - 1` and `l` remains unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`n` remains an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` remains an integer representing the number of edges to be removed such that 1 <= k < n <= 10^5, `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge between vertices a and b, `g` is a list of lists with length `n + 1`. Each list `g[i]` contains all the vertices that are connected to vertex `i` by an edge, according to the edges defined in the `edges` list, `c` is 0, `visited` is an empty set, `mid` is `l + (r - l) // 2`. If `check(mid)` is true, `l` is updated to `mid + 1` and `r` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `r` is updated to `mid - 1` and `l` remains unchanged.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
