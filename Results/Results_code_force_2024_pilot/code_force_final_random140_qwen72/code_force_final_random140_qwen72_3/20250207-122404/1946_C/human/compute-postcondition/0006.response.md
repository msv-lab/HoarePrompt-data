The function `check` accepts a parameter `x`. `x` is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing k edges. The function evaluates whether, after removing k edges from a graph, all remaining connected components have at least `x` nodes. If this condition is met, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `x` and returns `True` if, after removing k edges from a graph, all remaining connected components have at least `x` nodes. Otherwise, it returns `False`.**
