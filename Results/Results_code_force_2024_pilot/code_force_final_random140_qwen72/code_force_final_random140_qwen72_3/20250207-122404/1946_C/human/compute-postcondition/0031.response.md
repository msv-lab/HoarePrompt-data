Output State: **`n` remains an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` remains an integer representing the number of edges to be removed such that 1 <= k < n <= 10^5, `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge between vertices a and b, `g` is a list of lists with length `n + 1`. Each list `g[i]` contains all the vertices that are connected to vertex `i` by an edge, according to the edges defined in the `edges` list, `c` is 0, `visited` is an empty set, `mid` is `l + (r - l) // 2`, `l` remains unchanged, `r` is now `mid - 1`.**
