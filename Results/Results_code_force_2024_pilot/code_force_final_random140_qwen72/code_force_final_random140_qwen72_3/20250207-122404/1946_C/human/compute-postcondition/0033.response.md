Output State: **`n` remains an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` remains an integer representing the number of edges to be removed such that 1 <= k < n <= 10^5, `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge between vertices a and b, `g` is a list of lists with length `n + 1`. Each list `g[i]` contains all the vertices that are connected to vertex `i` by an edge, according to the edges defined in the `edges` list, `c` is 0, `visited` is an empty set, `l` is `r + 1`, `r` is the largest value of `mid` for which `check(mid)` returned `False`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop continues to execute as long as `l` is less than or equal to `r`.
- In each iteration, `mid` is calculated as the midpoint between `l` and `r`.
- If `check(mid)` returns `True`, `l` is updated to `mid + 1`, effectively narrowing the search range to the upper half.
- If `check(mid)` returns `False`, `r` is updated to `mid - 1`, effectively narrowing the search range to the lower half.
- The loop terminates when `l` becomes greater than `r`.
- At the end of the loop, `l` will be one more than `r`, and `r` will be the largest value of `mid` for which `check(mid)` returned `False`.

Thus, the final state of the variables `l` and `r` reflects the result of the binary search performed by the loop.
