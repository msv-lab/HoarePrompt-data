Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object representing a tree structure with vertices and edges, `s` is a non-negative integer representing the starting vertex, `x` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of the remaining connected components after edge removals, `v` is the first element of the tuple that was popped from `stack`, `postorder` is the second element of the tuple that was popped from `stack`, `stack` is the list after popping the top element and now includes `(v, True)` at the end, `good_components` is a dictionary with `v` as a key and `0` as its value, `remaining_size` is a dictionary with `v` as a key and `1` as its value. If `postorder` is false, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have `n` children where `n` is the total number of children of vertex `v`. The `stack` now includes `(u, False)` for each child `u` of `v` at the end of its list, in the order they were appended. If `postorder` is true, `good_components[v]` will be the sum of `good_components[u]` for all children `u` of `v` plus the number of children `u` whose `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`. The `remaining_size[v]` will be the sum of `remaining_size[u]` for all children `u` of `v` whose `remaining_size[u]` is less than `x`, plus 1 (the initial value of `remaining_size[v]`).**
