Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with `v` having at least one child, `s` is a non-negative integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `v` is the first element of the tuple that was popped from `stack`, `postorder` is the second element of the tuple that was popped from `stack`, `stack` is the list after popping the top element, `good_components` is a dictionary with `v` as a key and `good_components[u] + 1` as its value, `remaining_size` is a dictionary with `v` as a key and `1` as its value, `postorder` is true, and the current value of `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`.**

Explanation: The value of `good_components[v]` is incremented by 1, while all other variables and their values remain unchanged. The updated value of `good_components[v]` is now `good_components[u] + 1`.
