The function `dfs` accepts two parameters: `x` and `y`. `x` represents a vertex in the graph `g`, and `y` represents the minimum size of the connected component after removing edges. The function also implicitly uses `g`, a dictionary representing an adjacency list of the tree, and `visited`, a set of vertices that have already been visited during the DFS traversal.

The function returns two values:
- `c`: This is the sum of all `ans` values from the `dfs` calls where `ans` was less than `y`, plus 1 (the initial value of `c`).
- `r`: This is the sum of all `rn` values from the `dfs` calls, plus the number of times `ans` was greater than or equal to `y`.
