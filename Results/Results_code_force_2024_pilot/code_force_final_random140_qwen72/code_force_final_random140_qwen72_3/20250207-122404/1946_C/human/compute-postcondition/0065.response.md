Output State: **`tree.vertices[v].children` has at least three children, `u` is the third child in `tree.vertices[v].children`, `good_components[v]` is increased by `good_components[u]`. If `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`, `good_components[v]` will be further increased by 1. Otherwise, `remaining_size[v]` will be increased by `remaining_size[u]`.**
