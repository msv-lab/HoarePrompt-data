Postcondition: ***`tree` is a Tree object with `v` having at least one child, `s` is a non-negative integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `v` is the first element of the tuple that was popped from `stack`, `postorder` is the second element of the tuple that was popped from `stack`, `stack` is the list after popping the top element, `postorder` is true, `good_components` is a dictionary with `v` as a key, and `remaining_size` is a dictionary with `v` as a key. If `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `good_components[v]` is incremented by 1 and `remaining_size[v]` remains 1. If `remaining_size[u]` is less than `x`, then `good_components[v]` remains unchanged and `remaining_size[v]` is updated to `remaining_size[v] + remaining_size[u]`.***
