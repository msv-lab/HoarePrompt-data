Postcondition: ***`x` and `y` are non-negative integers, `x` represents a vertex in the graph `g`, `y` represents the minimum size of the connected component after removing edges, `g` is a dictionary representing an adjacency list of the tree, `visited` is a set of vertices that have already been visited during the DFS traversal, including `x`, `g[x]` must contain at least one element, `node` is the next neighbor of `x` in `g[x]` after the current `node`. If `node` is not in `visited`, `ans` and `rn` are the results returned by the `dfs` function called with arguments `node` and `y`. If `node` is in `visited`, `ans` and `rn` remain undefined. If `ans` is greater than or equal to `y`, `r` is now `r_initial + rn_value + 1`. Otherwise, `r` is now `r_initial + rn_value` and `c` is now `c + ans`.***
