Output State: **The program returns the total count of good components starting from vertex `s` and the size of the remaining component at vertex `s`. The total count of good components is the sum of all good components (components where the remaining size is greater than or equal to `x`) and their children's good components, as stored in the `good_components` dictionary. The size of the remaining component at vertex `s` is the sum of the sizes of all components that did not meet the minimum size requirement `x`, plus 1 for the vertex itself, as stored in the `remaining_size` dictionary.**
