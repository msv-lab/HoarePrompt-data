The function reads two integers, `n` and `k`, from the input, where `n` represents the number of vertices in a tree and `k` represents the number of edges to be removed. It then constructs a tree with `n` vertices and `n-1` edges based on additional user inputs. After constructing the tree, it roots the tree non-recursively starting from vertex 0. Finally, it calls another function `func_4` with the constructed tree, `n`, and `k`, and prints the result of this call. The result is the maximum number of connected components that can be formed after removing `k` edges from the tree.
