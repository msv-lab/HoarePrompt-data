Output State: **`k` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input, `a` is the third integer from the input, `s` is the final value after `x` iterations of the loop, and `i` is `x-1`.**

### Explanation:
- **`k`**: Remains the same as the first integer from the input.
- **`x`**: Remains the same as the second integer from the input.
- **`a`**: Remains the same as the third integer from the input.
- **`s`**: This variable is updated in each iteration of the loop. The loop runs `x` times, and in each iteration, `s` is incremented by `s // (k - 1) + 1`. Therefore, after `x` iterations, `s` will be the final value after all these updates.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be `x-1` because the loop runs from `0` to `x-1`.

This is the final state of the variables after the loop has completed all its iterations.
