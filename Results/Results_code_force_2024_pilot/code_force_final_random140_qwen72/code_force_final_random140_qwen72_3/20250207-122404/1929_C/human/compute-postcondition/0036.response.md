Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` is 0, and for each of the `t` test cases, `k`, `x`, and `a` retain their initial values from the input. The variable `s` is the final value after `x` iterations of the inner loop for each test case, and `i` is `x - 1` for each test case.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `t` starts as a positive integer and decreases with each iteration of the outer loop until it reaches 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed.
- For each test case, the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` are read from the input and remain unchanged throughout the processing of that test case.
- The variable `s` is initialized to 1 at the start of each test case and is updated within the inner loop according to the given formula. After `x` iterations of the inner loop, `s` holds its final value for that test case.
- The variable `i` is used as the loop counter in the inner loop and reaches `x - 1` after the last iteration of the inner loop for each test case.
- After all `t` test cases have been processed, the loop terminates, and the final output for each test case is either "YES" or "NO" based on whether `a` is greater than or equal to `s`.
