Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Initial State:
- `k`, `x`, and `a` retain their initial values.
- `s` is the final value after `x` iterations of the loop.
- `i` is `x-1`.

Code Snippet:
```python
k, x, a = map(int, input().split())
```

Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.

The code snippet reads input from the user, splits it into three parts, and converts each part to an integer. These integers are then assigned to the variables `k`, `x`, and `a`.

Impact of the Code:
- `k` is assigned the first integer from the input.
- `x` is assigned the second integer from the input.
- `a` is assigned the third integer from the input.

The values of `s` and `i` remain unchanged because they are not modified by the code.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`k` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input, `a` is the third integer from the input, `s` is the final value after `x` iterations of the loop, and `i` is `x-1`.**
Code of the loop:
for i in range(x):
    s += s // (k - 1) + 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `k` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input and must be greater than 0, `a` is the third integer from the input, `s` is the final value after `x` iterations of the loop plus `s // (k - 1) + 1`, and `i` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `k` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input and must be greater than 1, `a` is the third integer from the input, `s` is the final value after `x` iterations of the loop plus `s // (k - 1) + 1`, and `i` is 1

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `k` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input and must be greater than 2, `a` is the third integer from the input, `s` is the final value after `x` iterations of the loop plus `s // (k - 1) + 1`, `i` is 2, and `s` is updated to `s + s // (k - 1) + 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
