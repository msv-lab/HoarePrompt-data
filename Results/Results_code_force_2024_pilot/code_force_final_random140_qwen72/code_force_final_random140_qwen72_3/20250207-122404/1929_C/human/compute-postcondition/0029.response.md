Output State: **`k` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input and must be greater than 0, `a` is the third integer from the input, `s` is `1 + 1 // (k - 1) + 1`, `i` is 0**

Explanation: The value of `s` is updated to `1 + 1 // (k - 1) + 1`. Since `s` was initially 1, the new value of `s` is calculated as `1 + 1 // (k - 1) + 1`. The values of `k`, `x`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged.
