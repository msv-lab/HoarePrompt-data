Output State: **`k` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input and must be greater than 0, `a` is the third integer from the input, `s` is the final value after `x` iterations of the loop plus `s // (k - 1) + 1`, and `i` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `s` is updated to `s + s // (k - 1) + 1`.
- The values of `k`, `x`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- The new value of `s` is the original value of `s` plus the result of the expression `s // (k - 1) + 1`.
