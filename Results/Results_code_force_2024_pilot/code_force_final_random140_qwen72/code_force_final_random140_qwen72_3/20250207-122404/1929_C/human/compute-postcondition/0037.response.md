The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships given, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts parameters related to the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it accepts `k`, `x`, and `a`. The function processes these inputs according to the specified constraints.

Given the constraints:
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- For each of the `t` test cases, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers where 2 <= k <= 30, 1 <= x <= 100, and 1 <= a <= 10^9.

The function's output is not explicitly described, but typically, such functions would process each test case and return a result for each one. Since the exact output is not specified, I'll assume the function returns a list of results, one for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts three integers `k`, `x`, and `a` within specified ranges. The function processes each test case and returns a list of results, one for each test case.**
