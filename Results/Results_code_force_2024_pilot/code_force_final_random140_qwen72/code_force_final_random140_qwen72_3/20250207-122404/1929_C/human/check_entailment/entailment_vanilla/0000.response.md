### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Sasha starts with `a` coins.
   - He can place a bet of `y` coins, where `y` is a positive integer and `y <= a`.
   - If he wins, his coins increase by `y * (k - 1)`.
   - If he loses, his coins decrease by `y`.
   - He cannot lose more than `x` times in a row.
   - We need to determine if Sasha can guarantee to have at least `n` coins for any integer `n`.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - To ensure that Sasha can always win, he needs a strategy that allows him to recover from losses and still make progress towards his goal.
   - The key is to understand how much he can lose in a row and still have enough coins to continue betting.

3. **Strategy Analysis:**
   - If Sasha loses `x` times in a row, he will lose a total of `y + 2y + 3y + ... + xy` coins.
   - This sum can be calculated as `y * (1 + 2 + 3 + ... + x) = y * (x * (x + 1) / 2)`.
   - After losing `x` times, he must have enough coins left to place another bet and potentially win back his losses.

4. **Mathematical Calculation:**
   - Let's denote the minimum number of coins Sasha needs to start with to ensure he can always recover from `x` consecutive losses as `s`.
   - For each loss, the next bet should be large enough to cover the previous losses and still make progress.
   - The formula `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` is used to calculate the minimum number of coins needed to ensure recovery after `x` losses.

5. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program initializes `s` to 1.
   - It then iterates `x` times, each time increasing `s` by `s // (k - 1) + 1`.
   - Finally, it checks if `a` (initial number of coins) is greater than or equal to `s`.
   - If `a >= s`, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

6. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The program correctly calculates the minimum number of coins needed to ensure recovery after `x` consecutive losses.
   - The logic of the program aligns with the mathematical reasoning and the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
