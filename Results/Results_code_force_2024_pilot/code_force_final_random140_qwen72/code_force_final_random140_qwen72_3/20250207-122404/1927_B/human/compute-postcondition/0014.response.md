The code snippet `a_map[a[i]] += 1` increments the value associated with the key `a[i]` in the dictionary `a_map` by 1. Given the initial state:

- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5)
- `a` is a list of n integers (0 ≤ a_i < n)
- `sam` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz'
- `a_map` is a dictionary mapping each integer from 0 to n-1 to 0 except `a_map[a[0]]` which is now 1, `a_map[a[1]]` which is now 2, and `a_map[a[2]]` which is now 3
- `res` is the string containing the characters at indices `a_map[a[0]] % 27`, `a_map[a[1]] % 27`, and `a_map[a[2]] % 27` in `sam`
- `i` is 2
- `beg` is the value of `a_map[a[2]]` (which is 3)

After executing the code snippet:

- The value of `a_map[a[2]]` is incremented by 1, so `a_map[a[2]]` is now 4.
- The value of `i` remains 2.
- The value of `beg` remains 3.

The other variables (`n`, `a`, `sam`, `res`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `a` is a list of n integers (0 ≤ a_i < n), `sam` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz', `a_map` is a dictionary mapping each integer from 0 to n-1 to 0 except `a_map[a[0]]` which is 1, `a_map[a[1]]` which is 2, and `a_map[a[2]]` which is now 4, `res` is the string containing the characters at indices `a_map[a[0]] % 27`, `a_map[a[1]] % 27`, and `a_map[a[2]] % 27` in `sam`, `i` is 2, `beg` is 3.**
