The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ a_i < n. The function constructs a string `res` by iterating through each element in `a`, using the count of each integer in `a` (stored in a dictionary `a_map`) to determine the index in the string `sam` ('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz'). The character at the index `a_map[a[i]] % 27` in `sam` is appended to `res` for each `i` from 0 to `n-1`. The function returns the constructed string `res`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It returns a string `res` constructed by mapping each integer in `a` to a character in the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz' based on the frequency of that integer in `a`.**
