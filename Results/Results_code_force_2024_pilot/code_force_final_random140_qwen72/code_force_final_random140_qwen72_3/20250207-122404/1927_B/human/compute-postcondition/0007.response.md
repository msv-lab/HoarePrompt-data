To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5)
- `a` is a list of n integers (0 ≤ a_i < n)
- `sam` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz'
- `a_map` is a dictionary mapping each integer from 0 to n-1 to 0 except `a_map[a[0]]` which is now 1
- `res` is the string containing the character at index `a_map[a[0]] % 27` in `sam`
- `i` is 0
- `beg` is 0

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range `range(n)`, which means `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 until it reaches `n-1`.
- The loop condition is `i < n`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- At the start of the next iteration, `i` must be incremented by 1.
- The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is the upper limit of the loop.

### New State:
- `i` is incremented from 0 to 1.
- `n` remains the same (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5).

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `a` is a list of n integers (0 ≤ a_i < n), `sam` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz', `a_map` is a dictionary mapping each integer from 0 to n-1 to 0 except `a_map[a[0]]` which is now 1, `res` is the string containing the character at index `a_map[a[0]] % 27` in `sam`, `i` is 1, `beg` is 0**
