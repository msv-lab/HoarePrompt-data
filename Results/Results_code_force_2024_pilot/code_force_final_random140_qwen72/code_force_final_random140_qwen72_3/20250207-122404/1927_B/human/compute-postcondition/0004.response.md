Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `a` is a list of n integers (0 ≤ a_i < n), `sam` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz', `a_map` is a dictionary mapping each integer from 0 to n-1 to 0, `res` is an empty string, `i` is 0, `beg` is 0.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `a_map[a[i]]` to the variable `beg`. Since `i` is 0, `a[i]` is `a[0]`, which is the first element of the list `a`. According to the initial state, `a_map` maps each integer from 0 to n-1 to 0. Therefore, `a_map[a[0]]` is 0, and `beg` is assigned the value 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
