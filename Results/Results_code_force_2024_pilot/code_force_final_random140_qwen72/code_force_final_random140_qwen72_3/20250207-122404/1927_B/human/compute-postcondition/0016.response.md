Output State: **The program returns the string `res` which is constructed by taking the character at index `a_map[a[i]] % 27` in the string `sam` for each `i` from 0 to `n-1`. Here, `sam` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz', and `a_map` is a dictionary mapping each integer from 0 to n-1 to the number of times that integer appears in the list `a`.**
