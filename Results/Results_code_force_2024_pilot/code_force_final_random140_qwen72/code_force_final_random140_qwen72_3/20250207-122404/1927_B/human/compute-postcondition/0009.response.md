Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `a` is a list of n integers (0 ≤ a_i < n), `sam` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz', `a_map` is a dictionary mapping each integer from 0 to n-1 to 0 except `a_map[a[0]]` which is now 1, `res` is the string containing the characters at indices `a_map[a[0]] % 27` and `a_map[a[1]] % 27` in `sam`, `i` is 1, `beg` is the value of `a_map[a[1]]`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `res` is updated by appending the character at the index `a_map[a[i]] % 27` in the string `sam`.
- Since `i` is 1, the character at the index `a_map[a[1]] % 27` in `sam` is appended to `res`.
- All other variables (`n`, `a`, `sam`, `a_map`, `i`, `beg`) remain unchanged.
