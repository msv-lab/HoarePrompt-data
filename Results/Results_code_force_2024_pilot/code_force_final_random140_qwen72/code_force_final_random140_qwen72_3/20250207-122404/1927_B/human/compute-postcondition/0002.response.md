Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `a` is a list of n integers (0 ≤ a_i < n), `sam` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz', `a_map` is a dictionary mapping each integer from 0 to n-1 to 0, `res` is an empty string.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `res` to an empty string. This does not affect the values of `n`, `a`, `sam`, or `a_map`, which remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions along with the new value of `res`.
