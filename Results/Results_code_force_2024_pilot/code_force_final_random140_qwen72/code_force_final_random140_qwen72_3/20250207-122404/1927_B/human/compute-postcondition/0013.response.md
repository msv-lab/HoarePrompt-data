Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `a` is a list of n integers (0 ≤ a_i < n), `sam` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz', `a_map` is a dictionary mapping each integer from 0 to n-1 to 0 except `a_map[a[0]]` which is now 1, `a_map[a[1]]` which is now 2, and `a_map[a[2]]` which is now 3, `res` is the string containing the characters at indices `a_map[a[0]] % 27`, `a_map[a[1]] % 27`, and `a_map[a[2]] % 27` in `sam`, `i` is 2, `beg` is the value of `a_map[a[2]]`.** 

Explanation: The code appends the character at index `a_map[a[i]] % 27` in the string `sam` to the string `res`. Since `i` is 2, `a_map[a[2]]` is updated to 3, and the character at index `3 % 27` (which is 3) in `sam` is appended to `res`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
