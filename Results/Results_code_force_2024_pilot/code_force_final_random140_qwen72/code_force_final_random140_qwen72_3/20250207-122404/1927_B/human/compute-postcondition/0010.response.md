Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `a` is a list of n integers (0 ≤ a_i < n), `sam` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz', `a_map` is a dictionary mapping each integer from 0 to n-1 to 0 except `a_map[a[0]]` which is now 1 and `a_map[a[1]]` which is now 2, `res` is the string containing the characters at indices `a_map[a[0]] % 27` and `a_map[a[1]] % 27` in `sam`, `i` is 1, `beg` is the value of `a_map[a[1]]` which is now 2.**

Explanation:
- The value of `a_map[a[i]]` is incremented by 1. Since `i` is 1, `a_map[a[1]]` is incremented from 1 to 2.
- All other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and conditions.
