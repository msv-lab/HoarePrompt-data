Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `a` is a list of n integers (0 ≤ a_i < n), `sam` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz', `a_map` is a dictionary mapping each integer from 0 to n-1 to 0 except `a_map[a[0]]` which is now 1, `res` is the string containing the character at index `a_map[a[0]] % 27` in `sam`, `i` is 0, `beg` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `a_map[a[i]] += 1` increments the value of `a_map[a[0]]` by 1.
- Initially, `a_map` maps each integer from 0 to n-1 to 0.
- After the increment, `a_map[a[0]]` is now 1.
- All other variables (`n`, `a`, `sam`, `res`, `i`, `beg`) remain unchanged.
