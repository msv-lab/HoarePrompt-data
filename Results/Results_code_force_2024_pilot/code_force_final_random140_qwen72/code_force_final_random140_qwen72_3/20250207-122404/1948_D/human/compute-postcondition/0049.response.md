Postcondition: ***`k` is 2, `n` is at least 2, `j` is `n // 2 - 1`, `s[k]` is not '?', `s[k + j]` is not '?', and `s[k]` is not equal to `s[k + j]`. Additionally, `count` is 0 if `s[k]` is not '?' and `s[k + j]` is not '?' and `s[k]` is not equal to `s[k + j]`. Otherwise, `count` is 1. `count` is not equal to `j`.***
