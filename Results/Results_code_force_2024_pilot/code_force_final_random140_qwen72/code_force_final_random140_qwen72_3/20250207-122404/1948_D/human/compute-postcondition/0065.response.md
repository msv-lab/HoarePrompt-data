Postcondition: ***`k` is `n - (n // 2 - 2)`, `n` is at least 5, `j` is `n // 2 - 2`, `n - j` is greater than 0. If `s[k]` is '?', `s[k + j]` is '?', or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`, then `count` is 1. Otherwise, `count` remains 0, `s[k]` is not '?', `s[k + j]` is not '?', and `s[k]` is not equal to `s[k + j].` Additionally, `count` is not equal to `j`.***
