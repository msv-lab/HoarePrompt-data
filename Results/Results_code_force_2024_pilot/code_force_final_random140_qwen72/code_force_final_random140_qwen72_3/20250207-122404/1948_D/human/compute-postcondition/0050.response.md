Let's break down the initial state and the conditions to determine the value of `count` and what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `k` is 2.
   - `n` is at least 2.
   - `j` is `n // 2 - 1`.
   - `s[k]` is not '?'.
   - `s[k + j]` is not '?'.
   - `s[k]` is not equal to `s[k + j]`.
   - `count` is 0 if `s[k]` is not '?' and `s[k + j]` is not '?' and `s[k]` is not equal to `s[k + j]`. Otherwise, `count` is 1.
   - `count` is not equal to `j`.

2. **Determine the value of `count`:**
   - According to the conditions, `s[k]` is not '?' and `s[k + j]` is not '?' and `s[k]` is not equal to `s[k + j]`.
   - Therefore, `count` is 0.

3. **Calculate the output of the print statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(count * 2)`.
   - Since `count` is 0, `count * 2` is `0 * 2 = 0`.

Output: **0**
