Postcondition: ***`k` is 1, `n` is at least 3, `j` is `n // 2`. If `count` is equal to `j`, the program returns nothing. Regardless of the if condition, if `s[k] == '?'` or `s[k + j] == '?'` or `s[k] == s[k + j]`, then `count` is incremented by 1 and is not equal to `j`. Otherwise, `count` is set to 0.***
