Postcondition: ***`k` is `n - (n // 2 - 2) + 1`, `n` is at least 5, `j` is `n // 2 - 2`, and `n - j` is greater than `n - (n // 2 - 2) + 1`. If `s[k]` is '?' or `s[k + j]` is '?' or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`, then `count` is 1. Otherwise, `count` is 0. In both cases, `count` is not equal to `j`.***
