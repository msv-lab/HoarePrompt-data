To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `k` is `n - (n // 2 - 2)`
- `n` is at least 5
- `j` is `n // 2 - 2`
- `count` is 0

### Loop Statement:
```python
for k in range(0, n - j):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute if the range `range(0, n - j)` is non-empty. This means `n - j` must be greater than 0.
2. **Initial Values**:
   - `n` is at least 5.
   - `j` is `n // 2 - 2`.
   - `k` is `n - (n // 2 - 2)`.

3. **Calculate `j`**:
   - Since `n` is at least 5, let's calculate `j` for the minimum value of `n`:
     - If `n = 5`, then `j = 5 // 2 - 2 = 2 - 2 = 0`.
     - If `n = 6`, then `j = 6 // 2 - 2 = 3 - 2 = 1`.
     - If `n = 7`, then `j = 7 // 2 - 2 = 3 - 2 = 1`.
     - If `n = 8`, then `j = 8 // 2 - 2 = 4 - 2 = 2`.

4. **Calculate `n - j`**:
   - For `n = 5`, `j = 0`, so `n - j = 5 - 0 = 5`.
   - For `n = 6`, `j = 1`, so `n - j = 6 - 1 = 5`.
   - For `n = 7`, `j = 1`, so `n - j = 7 - 1 = 6`.
   - For `n = 8`, `j = 2`, so `n - j = 8 - 2 = 6`.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - For the loop to execute, `n - j` must be greater than 0. Given the calculations above, this condition is always satisfied for `n` at least 5.
   - The initial value of `k` is not relevant to the loop condition, as `k` is redefined in the loop head.

### Adjusted State:
- The loop will execute if `n - j > 0`, which is always true for `n` at least 5.
- The initial value of `k` is not needed for the loop to execute, but it is given as `k` is `n - (n // 2 - 2)`.
- The initial value of `j` is `n // 2 - 2`.
- The initial value of `count` is 0, which is not relevant to the loop condition.

### Final State:
State: **`k` is `n - (n // 2 - 2)`, `n` is at least 5, `j` is `n // 2 - 2`, `count` is 0, `n - j` must be greater than 0**
