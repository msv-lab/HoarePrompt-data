Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program has a logical error in the placement of the `func_1()` call. The function `func_1()` is called inside the loop that reads the test cases, but it does not pass the string `s` or the length `n` to `func_1()`. As a result, `func_1()` does not have access to these variables, leading to a NameError when it tries to use them.

Additionally, the function `func_1()` should be called within the loop that processes each test case, and it should be passed the necessary parameters. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    s = list(input())
    n = len(s)
    result = func_1(s, n)
    print(result)

def func_1(s, n):
    for j in range(n // 2, 0, -1):
        count = 0
        for k in range(0, n - j):
            if s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]:
                count += 1
            else:
                count = 0
            if count == j:
                return count * 2
    return 0
```

This corrected version ensures that `func_1()` is called with the correct parameters and that the result is printed for each test case. The original program would fail for any input because it does not properly handle the scope of the variables `s` and `n`.
