Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program has a few issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Scope of `n` and `s`:** The variables `n` and `s` are defined inside the loop where test cases are processed, but they are used inside the `func_1` function. However, `func_1` does not have access to these variables because they are not passed as arguments or declared globally. This will result in a `NameError`.

2. **Return Value Handling:** The `func_1` function should return the result, but the main loop should handle printing the result. The current implementation directly prints the result inside `func_1`, which is not ideal for multiple test cases.

3. **Handling No Tandem Repeats:** If no tandem repeat is found, the function should return 0, but the current implementation does not handle this case properly.

4. **Correct Logic for Tandem Repeat:** The logic for checking tandem repeats is not entirely correct. The current implementation checks for a sequence of matching characters, but it does not ensure that the entire substring is a tandem repeat.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def max_tandem_repeat_length(s):
    n = len(s)
    for j in range(n // 2, 0, -1):
        for k in range(0, n - 2 * j + 1):
            if all(s[k + l] == s[k + j + l] or s[k + l] == '?' or s[k + j + l] == '?' for l in range(j)):
                return 2 * j
    return 0

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    s = input()
    print(max_tandem_repeat_length(s))
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Function Definition:** The function `max_tandem_repeat_length` takes a string `s` and returns the maximum length of the longest tandem repeat.
2. **Loop for Tandem Repeat Lengths:** The outer loop iterates over possible lengths of the tandem repeat, starting from the largest possible length down to 1.
3. **Inner Loop for Substrings:** The inner loop checks all possible starting positions for the tandem repeat of the current length.
4. **Check Tandem Repeat:** The `all` function ensures that for each position, the characters in the first half match the characters in the second half, considering the possibility of question marks.
5. **Return Result:** If a valid tandem repeat is found, the function returns its length. If no tandem repeat is found, it returns 0.
6. **Main Loop:** The main loop reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by calling the `max_tandem_repeat_length` function and printing the result.
