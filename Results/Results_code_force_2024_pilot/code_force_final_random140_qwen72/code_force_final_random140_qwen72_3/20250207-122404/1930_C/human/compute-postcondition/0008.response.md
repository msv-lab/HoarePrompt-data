The code snippet adds the value `arr[i] + i + 1` to the set `st`. Given that `i` is 2, the value being added to the set is `arr[2] + 2 + 1`, which simplifies to `arr[2] + 3`.

The initial state specifies that `st` already contains the values `arr[0] + 1` and `arr[1] + 2`. After executing the code, `st` will contain these two values plus the new value `arr[2] + 3`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `arr`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and `n` must be greater than 2, `arr` is a list of `n` integers read from the input, each integer in `arr` is between 1 and 10^9, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `st` is a set containing the values `arr[0] + 1`, `arr[1] + 2`, and `arr[2] + 3`, `i` is 2.**
