The value of `st` is updated by adding the value `arr[i] + i + 1`. Since `i` is 1, the value added to `st` is `arr[1] + 1 + 1`, which simplifies to `arr[1] + 2`. The set `st` now contains both `arr[0] + 1` and `arr[1] + 2`. The value of `i` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and `n` must be greater than 1, `arr` is a list of `n` integers read from the input, each integer in `arr` is between 1 and 10^9, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `st` is a set containing the values `arr[0] + 1` and `arr[1] + 2`, `i` is 1**.
