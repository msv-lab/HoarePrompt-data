Functionality: ** The function `func_1` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and an array `a` of `n` integers. It then constructs a new array `ans` based on the sorted values of `a` in descending order. Each element in `ans` is determined by either the first element of the sorted `a` minus the index (starting from 0) or the corresponding element from `a` if it is less than the previous element in `ans`. Finally, the function prints the elements of `ans` for each test case. The function does not return any value. **
