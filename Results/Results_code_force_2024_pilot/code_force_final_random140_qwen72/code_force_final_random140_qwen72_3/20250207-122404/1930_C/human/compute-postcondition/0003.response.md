To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5.
- `arr` is a list of `n` integers read from the input, each integer in `arr` is between 1 and 10^9.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
- `st` is an empty set.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range defined by `n`.
- For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0.
- The variable `i` is the loop counter, starting from 0.

### Adjustments Needed:
- `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
- `i` should be initialized to 0 before the loop starts.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of `n` integers read from the input, each integer in `arr` is between 1 and 10^9, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `st` is an empty set, `i` is 0**
