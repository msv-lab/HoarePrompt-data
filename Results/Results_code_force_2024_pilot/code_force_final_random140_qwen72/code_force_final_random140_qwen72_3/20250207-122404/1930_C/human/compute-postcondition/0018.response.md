Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `arr` is a sorted list of integers in descending order with at least three elements, `x` is the third element in `arr[1:]`, and `ans` contains the first element of `arr` and either the last element of `ans` minus 1 or `x` depending on the condition. If `x` is greater than or equal to the last element of `ans`, `ans` is updated to contain the first element of `arr`, the last element of `ans` minus 1, and the last element of `ans` minus 1 again. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to contain the first element of `arr`, the last element of `ans` minus 1, and `x`.***
