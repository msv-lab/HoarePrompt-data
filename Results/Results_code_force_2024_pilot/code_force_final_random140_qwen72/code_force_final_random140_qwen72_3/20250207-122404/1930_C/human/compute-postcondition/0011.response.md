The function `func_1` is designed to handle multiple test cases. It accepts no direct parameters but expects input in the form of multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) representing the length of an array `a`, which contains `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The total number of test cases `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.

The function processes each test case and returns a result for each one. However, the specific output or return value for each test case is not provided in the given information.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer `n` and an array `a` of `n` integers. It returns a result for each test case, though the specific nature of the result is not specified.**
