The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the value `n`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the comparison between `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and `n` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1, and `n` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and `n` must be greater than 1, `arr` is a list of `n` integers read from the input, each integer in `arr` is between 1 and 10^9, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `st` is a set containing the value `arr[0] + 1`, `i` is 1**
