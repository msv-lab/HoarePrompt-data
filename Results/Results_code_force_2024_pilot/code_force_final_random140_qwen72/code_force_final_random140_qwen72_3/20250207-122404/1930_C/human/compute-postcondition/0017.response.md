The code appends the value of `x` to the list `ans`. Given that `x` is the third element in `arr[1:]`, which means `x` is the fourth element in the original list `arr`, and `ans` already contains the first element of `arr` and either the last element of `ans` minus 1 or `x` depending on the condition, appending `x` to `ans` updates the list `ans`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `arr` is a sorted list of integers in descending order with at least three elements, `x` is the third element in `arr[1:]`, `ans` now contains the first element of `arr`, either the last element of `ans` minus 1 or `x`, and `x`.**
