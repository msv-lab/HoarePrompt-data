Reasoning:  
1. The program reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case using a loop.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself.
3. It initializes an empty set `st`.
4. It iterates over the array, and for each element at index `i`, it calculates `arr[i] + i + 1` and adds this value to the set `st`.
5. After processing all elements, it sorts the set in descending order and prints the elements.

The key points to verify:
- The program correctly processes each test case independently.
- The calculation `arr[i] + i + 1` is done correctly for each element.
- The set `st` ensures that only unique values are stored.
- The final output is sorted in descending order, which is required to get the lexicographically largest array `b`.

Given the problem statement and the requirements, the program appears to follow the correct logic and steps to achieve the desired output. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
