Reasoning:  
The program appears to follow the problem statement closely. It reads the number of test cases, processes each test case by reading the length of the array and the array itself, and then performs the required operations to generate the set `S`. The key points to verify are:

1. **Operation Implementation**: The program correctly implements the operation of adding `arr[i] + i + 1` to the set `S` for each element in the array. This matches the problem's requirement of inserting `a_i + i` into the set `S`.

2. **Set Uniqueness**: The use of a set ensures that only unique values are stored, which aligns with the problem's note that a set can only contain unique elements.

3. **Sorting and Output**: The program sorts the set in descending order and prints the elements, which is consistent with the requirement to output the lexicographically largest array `b`.

4. **Multiple Test Cases**: The program handles multiple test cases by using a loop to call `func_1()` for each test case, which is appropriate given the input format.

Given these points, the program seems to correctly implement the logic required by the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
