Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function reads the number of test cases `t` from the input. It correctly handles the input and returns an integer, which is expected for the number of test cases.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function reads a line of input and splits it into a list of integers. It is used to read the constraints for each test case. The function correctly handles the input and converts it to the required format.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**: This function is not used in the main logic of the program. It concatenates elements of a list into a string with a specified separator. While it works correctly, it is not relevant to the problem at hand.

4. **Function 4 (`func_4`)**: This function finds all occurrences of a substring in a string and returns their indices. It is not used in the main logic of the program and is not relevant to the problem.

5. **Function 5 (`func_5`)**: This function finds all indices of a specific element in a list. It is not used in the main logic of the program and is not relevant to the problem.

6. **Function 6 (`func_6`)**: This function finds the first sublist in a list of lists where the element at a specific index matches a given value. It is not used in the main logic of the program and is not relevant to the problem.

7. **Function 7 (`func_7`)**: This function processes the constraints for a single test case. It initializes `start` and `end` to appropriate default values, reads the constraints, and updates `start` and `end` based on the constraints. It also collects values that should be excluded from the range. Finally, it calculates the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all constraints and returns the result.

The main logic of the program is correctly implemented in `func_7`. It correctly processes the constraints and calculates the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all constraints. The other functions are either not used or are not relevant to the problem.

Therefore, the program is correct based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions.

Correctness: **True**
