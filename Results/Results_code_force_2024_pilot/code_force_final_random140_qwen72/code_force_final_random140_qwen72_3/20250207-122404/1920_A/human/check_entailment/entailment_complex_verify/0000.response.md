Reasoning:

1. **Initialization**: The variables `start` and `end` are correctly initialized to `-1` and `1000000000` respectively. This ensures that the initial range is wide enough to accommodate any constraints.

2. **Reading Constraints**: The program reads `n` constraints and processes each one appropriately:
   - For type 1 constraints (k must be greater than or equal to some integer x), it updates `start` to the maximum value of `v`. This ensures that `start` is the highest lower bound.
   - For type 2 constraints (k must be less than or equal to some integer x), it updates `end` to the minimum value of `v`. This ensures that `end` is the lowest upper bound.
   - For type 3 constraints (k must be not equal to some integer x), it appends `v` to the `num` list. This collects all the values that k cannot be.

3. **Counting Valid Integers**: After processing all constraints, the program counts the number of integers in the range `[start, end]` that are not in the `num` list. This is done by iterating through the `num` list and checking if each value falls within the range `[start, end]`. The count of such values is stored in `count_num`.

4. **Final Calculation**: The final result is calculated as `end - start + 1 - count_num` if `start <= end`, otherwise it returns `0`. This correctly computes the number of valid integers k that satisfy all constraints.

The program handles all edge cases and constraints as specified in the problem description. The logic is sound and the implementation is correct.

Final: **True**
