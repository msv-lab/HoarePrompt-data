isOne is a boolean value. However, this function definition does not match the problem description provided. The function should take the constraints and the number of test cases as inputs, not a boolean flag. A more appropriate function definition would be: `def count_satisfying_integers(t, constraints):` where `t` is the number of test cases and `constraints` is a list of lists, each containing the number of constraints followed by the constraints themselves.
