To determine the states that need adjustment for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop structure:

### Given Information:
- `n` is an input integer (2 <= n <= 100).
- `start` is the maximum value of `v` encountered when `t` is 1, or remains -1 if no such `v` is found.
- `end` is the minimum value of `v` encountered when `t` is 2, or remains 1000000000 if no such `v` is found.
- `num` is a list containing all values of `v` encountered when `t` is 3 and must have at least one element.
- `i` is the next element in the list `num`.
- `t` and `v` are the last input integers read during the final iteration.
- If `i` is outside the range defined by `start` and `end`, the program continues to the next iteration with `count_num` being 0 or 1 depending on the previous conditions. Otherwise, `count_num` is 1 or 2 depending on the previous conditions.

### Loop Structure:
```python
for i in num:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The only variable in the loop head is `i`.

2. **Determine the Next Value of `i`:**
   - Since `i` is the next element in the list `num`, it will take the value of the next element in the list.

3. **Check the Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements left in the list `num`.

4. **Adjust the State:**
   - The state of `i` needs to be updated to the next element in the list `num`.
   - The other variables (`start`, `end`, `num`, `t`, `v`, `count_num`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head and their values are determined by the loop body or initial conditions.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` will be the next element in the list `num`.
- The list `num` must have at least one more element for the loop to execute again.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is an input integer (2 <= n <= 100), `start` is the maximum value of `v` encountered when `t` is 1, or remains -1 if no such `v` is found, `end` is the minimum value of `v` encountered when `t` is 2, or remains 1000000000 if no such `v` is found, `num` is a list containing all values of `v` encountered when `t` is 3 and must have at least two elements, `i` is the next element in the list `num`, `t` and `v` are the last input integers read during the final iteration. If `i` is outside the range defined by `start` and `end`, the program continues to the next iteration with `count_num` being 0 or 1 depending on the previous conditions. Otherwise, `count_num` is 1 or 2 depending on the previous conditions.**
