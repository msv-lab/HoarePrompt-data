Output State: **n is an input integer (2 <= n <= 100), start is -1, end is 1000000000, num is an empty list.**

The code snippet `num = []` reassigns the variable `num` to an empty list, which was already its initial value. Therefore, no changes occur in the state of the variables. The initial state remains unchanged.
