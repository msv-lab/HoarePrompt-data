Output State: **`n` is an input integer (2 <= n <= 100), `t` is the new input integer, `v` is the new input integer, `i` is 2, `start` remains unchanged unless `t` is 1 and `start` < `v`, in which case `start` is updated to `v`. `end` is updated to `v`. `num` is a list containing `[v]`. If `t` is 3, `num` is a list containing `[v]`. If `t` is 2 and `end` > `v`, `end` is updated to `v`, and `num` is a list containing `[v]`. Otherwise, `end` is now `v`, and `num` is a list containing `[v]`.**
