Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an input integer (2 <= n <= 100), `start` is the maximum value of `v` encountered when `t` is 1, or remains -1 if no such `v` is found, `end` is the minimum value of `v` encountered when `t` is 2, or remains 1000000000 if no such `v` is found, `num` is a list containing all values of `v` encountered when `t` is 3, `i` is `n-1`, `t` and `v` are the last input integers read during the final iteration, `count_num` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in num:
    if i < start or i > end:
        continue
    else:
        count_num += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an input integer (2 <= n <= 100), `start` is the maximum value of `v` encountered when `t` is 1, or remains -1 if no such `v` is found, `end` is the minimum value of `v` encountered when `t` is 2, or remains 1000000000 if no such `v` is found, `num` is a list containing all values of `v` encountered when `t` is 3 and must have at least one element, `i` is `n-1`, `t` and `v` are the last input integers read during the final iteration. If `i` is less than `start` or greater than `end`, `count_num` remains 0 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, if `i` is between `start` and `end` inclusive, `count_num` is set to 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an input integer (2 <= n <= 100), `start` is the maximum value of `v` encountered when `t` is 1, or remains -1 if no such `v` is found, `end` is the minimum value of `v` encountered when `t` is 2, or remains 1000000000 if no such `v` is found, `num` is a list containing all values of `v` encountered when `t` is 3 and must have at least one element, `i` is the next element in the list `num`, `t` and `v` are the last input integers read during the final iteration. If `i` is outside the range defined by `start` and `end`, the program continues to the next iteration with `count_num` being 0 or 1 depending on the previous conditions. Otherwise, `count_num` is 1 or 2 depending on the previous conditions.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is the next element in the list `num`, `start`, `end`, `num`, `t`, `v` remain unchanged. If `i` is outside the range `[start, end]`, the loop continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, `count_num` is increased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
