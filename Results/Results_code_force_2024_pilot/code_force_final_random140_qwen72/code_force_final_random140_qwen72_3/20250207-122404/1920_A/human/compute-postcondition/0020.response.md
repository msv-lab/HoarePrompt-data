The provided code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `t` and `v`. This will update the values of `t` and `v` based on the new input. The other variables (`n`, `start`, `end`, `num`, and `i`) remain unchanged unless their values depend on the new values of `t` or `v`.

Let's break down the impact:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an input integer (2 <= n <= 100)
   - `start` is either `v` if `t` is 1 and `start` was less than `v`, or remains -1 otherwise
   - `end` is 1000000000 unless `t` is 2, in which case `end` is equal to `v` if `end` was greater than `v`, otherwise `end` remains 1000000000
   - `num` is a list containing the value `v` if `t` is 3, otherwise `num` remains an empty list
   - `i` is 1
   - `t` is an input integer
   - `v` is an input integer

2. **Code Execution:**
   - `t, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))` updates `t` and `v` with new input values.

3. **Impact on Variables:**
   - `t` and `v` are updated to the new input values.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `start` remains the same unless `t` is 1 and `start` was less than the new `v`.
   - `end` remains the same unless `t` is 2 and `end` was greater than the new `v`.
   - `num` remains the same unless `t` is 3, in which case `num` becomes a list containing the new `v`.
   - `i` remains the same.

4. **Output State Calculation:**
   - `n` is an input integer (2 <= n <= 100)
   - `start` is either `v` if `t` is 1 and `start` was less than the new `v`, or remains -1 otherwise
   - `end` is 1000000000 unless `t` is 2, in which case `end` is equal to the new `v` if `end` was greater than the new `v`, otherwise `end` remains 1000000000
   - `num` is a list containing the value of the new `v` if `t` is 3, otherwise `num` remains an empty list
   - `i` is 1
   - `t` is the new input integer
   - `v` is the new input integer

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (2 <= n <= 100), `start` is either the new `v` if `t` is 1 and `start` was less than the new `v`, or remains -1 otherwise, `end` is 1000000000 unless `t` is 2, in which case `end` is equal to the new `v` if `end` was greater than the new `v`, otherwise `end` remains 1000000000, `num` is a list containing the value of the new `v` if `t` is 3, otherwise `num` remains an empty list, `i` is 1, `t` is the new input integer, and `v` is the new input integer.**
