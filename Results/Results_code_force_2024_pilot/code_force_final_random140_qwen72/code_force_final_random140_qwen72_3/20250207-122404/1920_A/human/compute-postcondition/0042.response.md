To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given state and the loop head:

### Given State:
- `n` is an input integer (2 <= n <= 100)
- `start` is the maximum value of `v` encountered when `t` is 1, or remains -1 if no such `v` is found
- `end` is the minimum value of `v` encountered when `t` is 2, or remains 1000000000 if no such `v` is found
- `num` is a list containing all values of `v` encountered when `t` is 3
- `i` is `n-1`
- `t` and `v` are the last input integers read during the final iteration
- `count_num` is 0

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in num:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the elements of the list `num`.
- For the loop to execute, `num` must contain at least one element.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The only object in the loop head that can be adjusted is `num`.
- To ensure the loop executes, `num` must have at least one element.

### Final State:
- `num` must have at least one element for the loop to execute.
- The other variables (`n`, `start`, `end`, `i`, `t`, `v`, `count_num`) do not affect the loop's execution directly and do not need to be adjusted.

### State:
**`n` is an input integer (2 <= n <= 100), `start` is the maximum value of `v` encountered when `t` is 1, or remains -1 if no such `v` is found, `end` is the minimum value of `v` encountered when `t` is 2, or remains 1000000000 if no such `v` is found, `num` is a list containing all values of `v` encountered when `t` is 3 and must have at least one element, `i` is `n-1`, `t` and `v` are the last input integers read during the final iteration, `count_num` is 0**
