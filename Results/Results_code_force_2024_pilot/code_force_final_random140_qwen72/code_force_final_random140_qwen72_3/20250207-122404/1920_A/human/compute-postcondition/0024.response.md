Output State: **`n` is an input integer (2 <= n <= 100), `t` is the new input integer, `v` is the new input integer, `i` is 1, `start` remains unchanged, `end` is now `v`, `num` remains an empty list.**

Explanation:
- `n` remains an input integer within the range 2 to 100.
- `t` is updated to the new input integer.
- `v` is updated to the new input integer.
- `i` remains 1.
- `start` remains unchanged because the code snippet does not affect it.
- `end` is updated to the new value of `v`.
- `num` remains an empty list because the condition for adding `v` to `num` (`t` being 3) is not met.
