Output State: **`n` is an input integer (2 <= n <= 100), `start` is the maximum value of `v` encountered when `t` is 1, or remains -1 if no such `v` is found, `end` is the minimum value of `v` encountered when `t` is 2, or remains 1000000000 if no such `v` is found, `num` is a list containing all values of `v` encountered when `t` is 3, `i` is the last element in the list `num`, `t` and `v` are the last input integers read during the final iteration. `count_num` is the total number of elements in `num` that are within the range `[start, end]` inclusive.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each element `i` in the list `num`.
- For each element `i`, if it is within the range `[start, end]` (inclusive), `count_num` is incremented by 1.
- After all iterations, `count_num` will contain the total number of elements in `num` that fall within the specified range.
- The values of `n`, `start`, `end`, `num`, `t`, and `v` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
