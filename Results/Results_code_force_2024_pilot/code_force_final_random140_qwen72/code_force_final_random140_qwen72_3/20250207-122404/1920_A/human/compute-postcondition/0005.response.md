The code snippet `t, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns these integers to the variables `t` and `v`.

- `n` remains an input integer within the range 2 to 100.
- `start` remains -1.
- `end` remains 1000000000.
- `num` remains an empty list.
- `i` remains 0.
- `t` and `v` are now assigned the values from the input.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (2 <= n <= 100), `start` is -1, `end` is 1000000000, `num` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `t` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer.**
