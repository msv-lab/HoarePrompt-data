The function `func_7` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, it operates under the constraints where `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `start` is initialized to -1, `end` is initialized to 1000000000, and `num` is an initially empty list. The function returns the difference between `end` and `start` plus 1, minus the count of elements in `num` that are within the range `[start, end]` inclusive, if `start` is less than or equal to `end`. Otherwise, the function returns 0.

Functionality: **The function returns the difference between `end` and `start` plus 1, minus the count of elements in `num` that are within the range `[start, end]` inclusive, if `start` is less than or equal to `end`. If `start` is greater than `end`, the function returns 0.**
