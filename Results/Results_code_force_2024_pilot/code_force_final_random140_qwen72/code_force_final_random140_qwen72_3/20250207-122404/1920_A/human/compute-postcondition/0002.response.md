Output State: **n is an input integer (2 <= n <= 100), start is -1, end is 1000000000, num is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code snippet `end = int(1000000000.0)` converts the floating-point number `1000000000.0` to the integer `1000000000` and assigns it to the variable `end`. Since the value of `end` was already `1000000000`, there is no change in its value. The other variables (`n`, `start`, and `num`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
