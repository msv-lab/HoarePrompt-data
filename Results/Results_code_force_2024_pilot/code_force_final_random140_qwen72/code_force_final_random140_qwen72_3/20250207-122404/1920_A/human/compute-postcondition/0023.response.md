Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer (2 <= n <= 100). If `t` is 1, and `start` is less than the new `v`, `start` is updated to the new `v`. Otherwise, `start` remains unchanged. `end` is 1000000000 unless `t` is 2, in which case `end` is equal to the new `v` if `end` was greater than the new `v`, otherwise `end` remains 1000000000. `num` is a list containing the value of the new `v` if `t` is 3, otherwise `num` remains an empty list. `i` is 1, `t` is the new input integer, and `v` is the new input integer.***
