The value of `v` is appended to the list `num`. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `t` is 3, the conditions for updating `start` and `end` do not apply. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer (2 <= n <= 100), `start` is either `v` if `t` is 1 and `start` was less than `v`, or remains -1 otherwise, `end` is 1000000000 unless `t` is 2, in which case `end` is equal to `v` if `end` was greater than `v`, otherwise `end` remains 1000000000, `num` is a list containing the value `v`, `i` is 0, `t` is 3, and `v` is an input integer.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (2 <= n <= 100), `start` is either `v` if `t` is 1 and `start` was less than `v`, or remains -1 otherwise, `end` is 1000000000 unless `t` is 2, in which case `end` is equal to `v` if `end` was greater than `v`, otherwise `end` remains 1000000000, `num` is a list containing the value `v`, `i` is 0, `t` is 3, and `v` is an input integer.**
