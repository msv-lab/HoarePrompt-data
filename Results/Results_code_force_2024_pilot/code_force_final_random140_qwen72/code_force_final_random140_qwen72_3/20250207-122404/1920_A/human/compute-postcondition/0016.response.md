Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer (2 <= n <= 100), `start` is either `v` if `t` is 1 and `start` was less than `v`, or remains -1 otherwise, `end` is 1000000000 unless `t` is 2, in which case `end` is equal to `v` if `end` was greater than `v`, otherwise `end` remains 1000000000, `num` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `t` is an input integer, and `v` is an input integer. Additionally, `t` is 3.**
