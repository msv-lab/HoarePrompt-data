The function reads a series of inputs and processes them to determine a range defined by `start` and `end`. It also collects specific values into a list `num`. After processing, the function calculates the number of elements in `num` that fall within the range `[start, end]`. It then returns the difference between `end` and `start` plus 1, minus the count of these elements, if `start` is less than or equal to `end`. If `start` is greater than `end`, the function returns 0.
