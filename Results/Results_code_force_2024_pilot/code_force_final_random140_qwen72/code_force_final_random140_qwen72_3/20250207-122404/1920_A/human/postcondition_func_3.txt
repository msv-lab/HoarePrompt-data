The function `func_4` accepts two parameters, `string` and `substring`, both of which are strings. It returns a list of all the starting indices where `substring` is found within `string`. If `substring` is not found in `string`, the function returns an empty list. After the function concludes, the original `string` and `substring` remain unchanged.
