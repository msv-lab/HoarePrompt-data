The code `num = num // g` performs integer division of `num` by `g`, where `g` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `num` and `den`. This operation reduces `num` to its simplest form relative to `den`.

Let's break down the impact of this code:

- `num` is updated to `num // g`.
- All other variables (`T`, `ans`, `n`, `p`, `k`, `S`, `i`, `C`, `den`, `g`) remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `T` is `T - 1`
- `ans` is `num * den % MOD`
- `n` is an input integer
- `p` is an input integer
- `k` is an input integer
- `S` is the sum of the integer values from the third part of the inputs provided `p` times
- `i` is `p - 1`
- `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`
- `num` is `p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S`
- `den` is `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) * (n * (n - 1) // 2)`
- `g` is the greatest common divisor of `num` and `den`

After executing `num = num // g`, the new value of `num` is `num // g`.

Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `ans` is `num * den % MOD`, `n` is an input integer, `p` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `S` is the sum of the integer values from the third part of the inputs provided `p` times, `i` is `p - 1`, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `num` is `(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S) // g`, `den` is `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) * (n * (n - 1) // 2)`, `g` is the greatest common divisor of `num` and `den`.**
