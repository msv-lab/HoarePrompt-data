The code snippet `S += int(input().split()[2])` updates the value of `S` by adding the integer value of the third part of the new input.

Given the initial state:
- `T` must be greater than 0
- `n` is an input integer
- `p` is an input integer and must be greater than 1
- `k` is an input integer
- `p` must be greater than or equal to its initial value
- `S` is the integer value of the third part of the input plus the integer value of the third part of the new input
- `i` is 2
- `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`
- `num` is now `num // g`
- `den` is now the modular multiplicative inverse of `(2 * C * C) // g` under modulo `MOD`
- `g` is the GCD of `num` and `den`
- `ans` is `num * den % MOD`
- `T` is `T - 1`

After executing the code snippet:
- `S` is updated by adding the integer value of the third part of the new input to its current value.

Output State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `p` is an input integer and must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `p` must be greater than or equal to its initial value, `S` is the integer value of the third part of the input plus the integer value of the third part of the new input, `i` is 2, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `num` is now `num // g`, `den` is now the modular multiplicative inverse of `(2 * C * C) // g` under modulo `MOD`, `g` is the GCD of `num` and `den`, `ans` is `num * den % MOD`, `T` is `T - 1`**.
