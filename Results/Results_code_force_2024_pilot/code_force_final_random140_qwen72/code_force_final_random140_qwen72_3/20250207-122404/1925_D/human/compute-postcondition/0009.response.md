The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `p`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` being less than `p`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `p` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `p` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `p` must be greater than 2, `k` is an input integer, `S` is the sum of its original value and the integer value of the third part of the new input, `i` is 2**
