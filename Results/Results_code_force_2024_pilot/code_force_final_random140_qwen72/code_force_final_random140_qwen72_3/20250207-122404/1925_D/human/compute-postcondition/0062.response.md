The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases, each defined by a set of parameters. Specifically, it accepts no direct parameters but reads from predefined inputs within its scope. For each test case, it processes the following inputs:
- `t`: An integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, indicating the number of test cases.
- `n`: An integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, representing the number of children.
- `m`: An integer where 0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), representing the number of pairs of friends.
- `k`: An integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the number of excursions.
- `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i`: For each of the m pairs of friends, three integers where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, a_i ≠ b_i, and 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9, representing the indices of the pair of children who are friends and their initial friendship value.

The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case. However, the specific output is not detailed in the provided information. Based on common problem structures, it likely returns some form of evaluation or computation involving the friendship values and excursions.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by the number of children (n), pairs of friends (m), and excursions (k). It also takes the friendship values between pairs of children (a_i, b_i, f_i) and returns a result for each test case based on these inputs.**
