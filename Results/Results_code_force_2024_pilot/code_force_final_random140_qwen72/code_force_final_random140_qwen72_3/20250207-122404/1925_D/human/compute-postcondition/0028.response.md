The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `p`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` being less than `p`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `p` is an input integer and must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `p` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `p` is an input integer and must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `p` must be greater than or equal to its initial value, `S` is the integer value of the third part of the input plus the integer value of the third part of the new input, `i` is 2, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `num` is now `num // g`, `den` is now the modular multiplicative inverse of `(2 * C * C) // g` under modulo `MOD`, `g` is the GCD of `num` and `den`, `ans` is `num * den % MOD`, `T` is `T - 1`**
