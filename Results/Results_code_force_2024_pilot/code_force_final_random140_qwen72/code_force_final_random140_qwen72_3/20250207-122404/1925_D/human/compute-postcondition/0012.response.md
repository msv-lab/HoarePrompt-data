Output State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `p` must be greater than or equal to its initial value, `k` is an input integer, `S` is the sum of its original value (0) and the integer values of the third part of all `p` inputs, `i` is `p-1`, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `C` is calculated using the formula `n * (n - 1) // 2`.
- All other variables (`T`, `n`, `p`, `k`, `S`, `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
