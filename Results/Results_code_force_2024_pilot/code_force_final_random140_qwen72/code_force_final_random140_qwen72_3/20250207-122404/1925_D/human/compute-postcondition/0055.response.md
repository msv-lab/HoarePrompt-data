Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `ans` is `num * den % MOD`, `n` is an input integer, `p` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `S` is the sum of the integer values from the third part of the inputs provided `p` times, `i` is `p - 1`, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `num` is `p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S`, `den` is `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) * (n * (n - 1) // 2)`, `g` is the greatest common divisor of `num` and `den`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `g` is assigned the value of the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `num` and `den`.
- All other variables (`T`, `ans`, `n`, `p`, `k`, `S`, `i`, `C`, `num`, `den`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The GCD is calculated using the `math.gcd` function, which takes `num` and `den` as arguments.
