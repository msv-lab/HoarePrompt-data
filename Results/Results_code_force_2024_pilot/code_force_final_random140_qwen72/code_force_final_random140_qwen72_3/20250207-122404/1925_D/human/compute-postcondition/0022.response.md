Output State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `p` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `p` must be greater than or equal to its initial value, `S` is the sum of its original value (0) and the integer values of the third part of all `p` inputs, `i` is `p-1`, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `num` is now `num // g`, `den` is now the modular multiplicative inverse of `(2 * C * C) // g` under modulo `MOD`, `g` is the GCD of `num` and `den`, `ans` is `num * den % MOD`, `T` is `T - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The values of `n`, `p`, and `k` are updated to the integers provided by the user input.
- All other variables (`T`, `S`, `i`, `C`, `num`, `den`, `g`, `ans`) retain their previous conditions and values, as they are not modified by the given code snippet.
