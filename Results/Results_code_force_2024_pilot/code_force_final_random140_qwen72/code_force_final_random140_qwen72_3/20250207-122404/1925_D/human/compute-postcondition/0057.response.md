The value of `den` is updated to `den // g`. This means `den` is divided by `g`, which is the greatest common divisor of `num` and `den`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `ans` is `num * den % MOD`, `n` is an input integer, `p` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `S` is the sum of the integer values from the third part of the inputs provided `p` times, `i` is `p - 1`, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `num` is `(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S) // g`, `den` is `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) * (n * (n - 1) // 2) // g`, `g` is the greatest common divisor of `num` and `den`.**
