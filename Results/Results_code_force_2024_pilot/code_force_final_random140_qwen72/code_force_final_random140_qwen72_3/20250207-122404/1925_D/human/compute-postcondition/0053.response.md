The code snippet updates the value of `num` based on the current values of `p`, `k`, `C`, and `S`. Let's break down the calculation:

- `num` is updated to `p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S`.

Given the initial state:
- `T` is `T - 1`
- `ans` is `num * den % MOD`
- `n` is an input integer
- `p` is an input integer
- `k` is an input integer
- `S` is the sum of the integer values from the third part of the inputs provided `p` times
- `i` is `p - 1`
- `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`

The new value of `num` is calculated as follows:
- `num = p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S`

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `ans` is `num * den % MOD`, `n` is an input integer, `p` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `S` is the sum of the integer values from the third part of the inputs provided `p` times, `i` is `p - 1`, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `num` is `p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S`.**
