Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `ans` is `num * den % MOD`, `n` is an input integer, `p` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `S` is the sum of the integer values from the third part of the inputs provided `p` times, `i` is `p - 1`, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`.**

The variable `C` is calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2`, which represents the number of ways to choose 2 items from `n` items without regard to order. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
