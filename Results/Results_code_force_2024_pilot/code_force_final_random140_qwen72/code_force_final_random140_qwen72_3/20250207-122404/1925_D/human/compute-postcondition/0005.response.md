The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `p`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `p`. For the loop to execute, `p` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` is initialized by the loop itself, starting from 0.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `p` is greater than 0, and `i` will start at 0 when the loop begins.

State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `p` must be greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `S` is 0, `i` is 0**
