The code snippet `den = pow(den, -1, MOD)` computes the modular multiplicative inverse of `den` under modulo `MOD`. This means that the new value of `den` is such that when multiplied by the original value of `den`, the result is congruent to 1 modulo `MOD`.

Given the initial state:
- `T` is `T - 1`
- `ans` is `num * den % MOD`
- `n` is an input integer
- `p` is an input integer
- `k` is an input integer
- `S` is the sum of the integer values from the third part of the inputs provided `p` times
- `i` is `p - 1`
- `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`
- `num` is `(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S) // g`
- `den` is `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) * (n * (n - 1) // 2) // g`
- `g` is the greatest common divisor of `num` and `den`

After executing the code snippet, the value of `den` is updated to its modular multiplicative inverse under modulo `MOD`.

Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `ans` is `num * den % MOD`, `n` is an input integer, `p` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `S` is the sum of the integer values from the third part of the inputs provided `p` times, `i` is `p - 1`, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `num` is `(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S) // g`, `den` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) * (n * (n - 1) // 2) // g` under modulo `MOD`, `g` is the greatest common divisor of `num` and the original `den`.**
