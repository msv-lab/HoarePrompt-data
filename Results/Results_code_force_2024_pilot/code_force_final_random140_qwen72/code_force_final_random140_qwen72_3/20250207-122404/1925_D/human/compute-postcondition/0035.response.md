Output State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `p` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to its initial value, `k` is an input integer, `S` is the sum of the integer values of the third part of each input line over `p` iterations, `i` is `p-1`, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `num` is now `(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S) // g`, `den` is now `2 * C * C`, `g` is the GCD of `num` and `den`, `ans` is `num * den % MOD`, `T` is `T - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `num` is updated to be the result of `num // g`.
- All other variables (`T`, `n`, `p`, `k`, `S`, `i`, `C`, `den`, `g`, `ans`) remain unchanged.
- The new value of `num` is calculated by dividing the original `num` by `g`, which is the greatest common divisor of `num` and `den`.
- The value of `T` is decremented by 1, but it must still be greater than 0.
