Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `T` is 0, `ans` has been printed for each test case, and the values of `n`, `p`, `k`, `S`, `i`, `C`, `num`, `den`, and `g` are recalculated for each test case based on the input provided for that test case.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- After the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `T` will be 0 because it is decremented by 1 with each iteration until it reaches 0.
- For each test case, the value of `ans` is calculated and printed. This means that after the loop finishes, the results for all test cases have been processed and printed.
- The variables `n`, `p`, `k`, `S`, `i`, `C`, `num`, `den`, and `g` are recalculated for each test case based on the input provided for that specific test case. These variables are reset and recomputed for each new test case, so their final values depend on the last test case processed.
- The initial conditions for the loop (such as the constraints on `n`, `m`, and `k`) remain unchanged and are satisfied for each test case.
