Output State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `p` must be greater than or equal to its initial value, `k` is an input integer, `S` is the sum of its original value (0) and the integer values of the third part of all `p` inputs, `i` is `p-1`, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `num` is `p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S`, `den` is `2 * C * C`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `den` is calculated as `2 * C * C`.
- All other variables (`T`, `n`, `p`, `k`, `S`, `i`, `C`, `num`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
