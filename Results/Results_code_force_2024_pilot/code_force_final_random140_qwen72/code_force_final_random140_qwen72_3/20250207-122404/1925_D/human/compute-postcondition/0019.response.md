Output State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `p` must be greater than or equal to its initial value, `k` is an input integer, `S` is the sum of its original value (0) and the integer values of the third part of all `p` inputs, `i` is `p-1`, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `num` is now `num // g`, `den` is now the modular multiplicative inverse of `(2 * C * C) // g` under modulo `MOD`, `g` is the GCD of `num` and `den`, `ans` is `num * den % MOD`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `ans` is calculated as `num * den % MOD`.
- All other variables (`T`, `n`, `p`, `k`, `S`, `i`, `C`, `num`, `den`, `g`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The value of `ans` is the result of the expression `num * den % MOD`, which uses the updated values of `num` and `den` from the initial state.
