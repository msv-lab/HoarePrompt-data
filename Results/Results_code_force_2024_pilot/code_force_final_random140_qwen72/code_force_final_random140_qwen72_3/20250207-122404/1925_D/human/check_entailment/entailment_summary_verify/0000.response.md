### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies a logical error in the program. The formula used to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values is indeed incorrect. Let's break down the issues and the correct approach:

1. **Initial Sum of Friendship Values**:
   - The program correctly reads the friendship values for the pairs of friends and sums them up in `S`.

2. **Probability of Selecting a Friend Pair**:
   - The total number of possible pairs of children is \( C = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \).
   - The probability of selecting a friend pair is \( \frac{p}{C} \).

3. **Expected Increase in Friendship Value**:
   - For each excursion, if a friend pair is selected, their friendship value increases by 1.
   - The expected increase in friendship value for each excursion is \( \frac{p}{C} \times 1 = \frac{p}{C} \).

4. **Summing the Expected Increases**:
   - Over \( k \) excursions, the total expected increase in the sum of friendship values is \( k \times \frac{p}{C} \).
   - Additionally, the initial sum of friendship values \( S \) should be considered.

5. **Final Formula**:
   - The expected value of the sum of friendship values after \( k \) excursions is \( S + k \times \frac{p}{C} \).
   - This needs to be simplified and calculated modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

### Correct Implementation:

```python
import math

def mod_inverse(x, mod):
    return pow(x, mod - 2, mod)

def func():
    MOD = 1000000007
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        (n, p, k) = map(int, input().split())
        S = 0
        for i in range(p):
            S += int(input().split()[2])
        C = n * (n - 1) // 2
        expected_increase = (k * p) % MOD
        expected_increase = (expected_increase * mod_inverse(C, MOD)) % MOD
        ans = (S + expected_increase) % MOD
        print(ans)

func()
```

### Evaluation:

- **Original Assessment**: The original assessment correctly identified the logical error in the formula used to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values. The provided reasoning and example test case are accurate.
- **Corrected Implementation**: The corrected implementation follows the correct approach and should produce the correct results for all test cases.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**

The original program is incorrect, and the original assessment accurately identified the issues. The provided reasoning and the corrected implementation support this conclusion.
