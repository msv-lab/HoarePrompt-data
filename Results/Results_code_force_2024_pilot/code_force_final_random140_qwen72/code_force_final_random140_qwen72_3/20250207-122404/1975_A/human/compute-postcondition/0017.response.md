Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000.
- `n` is a new input integer that must be at least 2.
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `check_all` is `False`.
- `i` is 1.
- `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`.
- `new` is a list containing all elements of `a` starting from index 1 to the end.
- `new_all` is `True` if `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise `new_all` is `False`.
- Either `check_all` is `False` or `new_all` is `False`.

Given these conditions, let's analyze the print statement:

```python
print('NO')
```

### Explanation:
- The print statement simply prints the string `'NO'`.
- The conditions provided do not affect the content of the print statement directly. They only set up the context in which the print statement is executed.
- Since the print statement is a simple string literal, it will always print `'NO'` regardless of the values of the variables and objects described in the initial state.

### Final Output:
Output: **NO**
