Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is a new input integer between 2 and 50, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2. If `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, `check_all` is `True`, `new` is a list containing all elements of `a` starting from index `2` to the end, `new_all` is `False` because `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`. `check_all` is now `True` if all elements in `a` starting from index 0 are greater than the corresponding elements in `new`, otherwise `check_all` is `False`. If both `check_all` and `new_all` are `True`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, either `check_all` is `False` or `new_all` is `False`, and we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
