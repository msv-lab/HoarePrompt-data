The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is a new input integer that must be at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 (so `i` becomes 2), and `n` must still be at least 2 for the condition `i < n` to hold true.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is a new input integer that must be at least 2, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is 2**.
