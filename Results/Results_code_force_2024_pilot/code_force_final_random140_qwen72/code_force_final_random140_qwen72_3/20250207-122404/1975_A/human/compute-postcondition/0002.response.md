The value of `n` is updated to the new input integer provided by the user, which must satisfy the condition 2 ≤ n ≤ 50. The values of `t` and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is a new input integer between 2 and 50, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6.
Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is a new input integer between 2 and 50, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6**
