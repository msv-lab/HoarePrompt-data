Based on the initial state provided:

- `_` is incremented by 1 (though this does not affect the output).
- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000.
- `n` is a new input integer between 2 and 50.
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `check_all` is `True`.
- `new` is a list containing all elements of `a` starting from index `1` to the end.
- `new_all` indicates whether the elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order.
- `i` is 1.
- `n` must be at least 2.
- `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`.
- `new_all` is `False` because `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`.
- Additionally, either `check_all` is `False` or `new_all` is `False`.

Given these conditions, the print statement `print('NO')` will execute because `new_all` is `False`. This means that the elements in the list `new` are not in non-decreasing order, and the condition for printing 'NO' is met.

Output: **NO**
