Based on the initial state provided:

- `_` is incremented by 1, but this does not affect the output of the `print` statement.
- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, but it is not used in the `print` statement.
- `n` is a new input integer between 2 and 50, and it must be at least 3.
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `i` is 3.
- `a[i - 1]` (which is `a[2]`) is greater than `a[i]` (which is `a[3]`).
- `new` is a list containing all elements of `a` starting from index 3 to the end.
- `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `new_all` is `False`.
- `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than `a[0]`, otherwise `check_all` is `False`.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('NO')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
