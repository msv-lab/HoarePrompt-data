The function `func` does not explicitly define its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the given parameter constraints and relationships, it is implied that the function should accept the following parameters:

- `t`: An integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, the function should accept:
  - `n`: An integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, representing the length of the array `a`.
  - `a`: A list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, representing the elements of the array `a`.

The function's output is not specified in the provided information, so I cannot determine what the function returns. However, based on the typical structure of such functions, it is likely that the function processes each test case and returns some result for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. The function processes each test case and returns some result for each test case.**
