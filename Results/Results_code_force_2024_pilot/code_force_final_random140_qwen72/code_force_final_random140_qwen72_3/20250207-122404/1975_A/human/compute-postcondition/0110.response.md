Postcondition: **`_` is incremented by 1, `t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is a new input integer between 2 and 50 and must be greater than 2, `a` is a new list of integers read from the input, `i` is 2. If `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, `new` is the sublist of `a` starting from index 2 to the end, `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than `a[0]`, otherwise `check_all` is `False`, `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `new_all` is `False`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement regardless of whether `check_all` and `new_all` are both `True` or not. If `a[i - 1]` is not greater than `a[i]`, the program continues without breaking out of the loop or if statement.**
