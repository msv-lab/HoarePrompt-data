Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is a new input integer between 2 and 50, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is 3, `n` must be at least 3, `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, `new` is a list containing all elements of `a` starting from index 3 to the end, `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `new_all` is `False`, `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than `a[0]`, otherwise `check_all` is `False`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
