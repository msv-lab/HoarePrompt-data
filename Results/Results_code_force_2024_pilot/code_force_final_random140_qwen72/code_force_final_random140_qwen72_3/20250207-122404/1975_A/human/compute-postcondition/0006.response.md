Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000.
- `n` is a new input integer between 2 and 50.
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `check_all` is `True` because all elements in `a` are in strictly increasing order.

The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement:
```python
print('YES')
```

This statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
