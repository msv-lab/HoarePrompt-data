Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is a new input integer between 2 and 50, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `a` are in strictly increasing order, `new` is a list containing all elements of `a` starting from index `i` to the end if at any point during the loop, `a[i - 1]` was greater than `a[i]`, `check_all` indicates whether the first element of `a` is greater than all elements in `new`, `new_all` indicates whether the elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order.**

Explanation:
- The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and stores them in the list `a`.
- The initial state specifies that `a` is a list of integers read from the input, which is now updated to the new list of integers read from the input.
- All other variables (`_`, `t`, `n`, `check_all`, `new`, `new_all`) remain unchanged or their definitions are still valid as they were in the initial state.
