Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `_` is incremented by 1, `t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is a new input integer between 2 and 50, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `a` are in strictly increasing order, `new` is a list containing all elements of `a` starting from index `i` to the end if at any point during the loop, `a[i - 1]` was greater than `a[i]`, `check_all` indicates whether the first element of `a` is greater than all elements in `new`, `new_all` indicates whether the elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
        new = a[i:]
        check_all = all([(a[0] > new[i]) for i in range(len(new))])
        new_all = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])
        if check_all and new_all:
            print('YES')
            break
        else:
            print('NO')
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`_` is incremented by 1, `t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is a new input integer between 2 and 50, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2. If `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, `check_all` is `True`, `new` is a list containing all elements of `a` starting from index `1` to the end, and `new_all` is `False` because `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`. If both `check_all` and `new_all` are `True`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, either `check_all` is `False` or `new_all` is `False`, and we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `_` is incremented by 1, `t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is a new input integer between 2 and 50, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2. If `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, `check_all` is `True`, `new` is a list containing all elements of `a` starting from index `2` to the end, and `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `new_all` is `False`. Regardless of whether `check_all` and `new_all` are both `True` or not, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`_` is incremented by 1, `t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is a new input integer between 2 and 50, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is 3, `n` must be at least 3. If `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, `new` is a list containing all elements of `a` starting from index 3 to the end, `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `new_all` is `False`, `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than `a[0]`, otherwise `check_all` is `False`. If `check_all` and `new_all` are both `True`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `a[i - 1]` is not greater than `a[i]`, the program continues without breaking out of the loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
