Postcondition: **`_` is incremented by 1, `t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is a new input integer between 2 and 50 and must be greater than 1, `a` is a new list of integers read from the input, `i` is 1, `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, and `new` is the sublist of `a` starting from index `i` to the end. If `check_all` is `True` and `new_all` is `True`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If either `check_all` is `False` or `new_all` is `False`, we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
