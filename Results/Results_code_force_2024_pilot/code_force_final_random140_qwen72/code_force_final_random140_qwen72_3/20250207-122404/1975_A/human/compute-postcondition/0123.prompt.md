Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer between 1 and 1000, n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    check_all = all([(a[i - 1] < a[i]) for i in range(1, n)])
    if check_all:
        print('YES')
    else:
        for i in range(1, n):
            if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
                new = a[i:]
                check_all = all([(a[0] > new[i]) for i in range(len(new))])
                new_all = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len
                    (new))])
                if check_all and new_all:
                    print('YES')
                    break
                else:
                    print('NO')
                    break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is a new input integer between 2 and 50, and `a` is a list of integers read from the input. If `check_all` is `True`, all elements in `a` are in strictly increasing order. If `check_all` is `False`, the loop has completed all iterations, and the final value of `i` is `n-1`. If at any point during the loop, `a[i - 1]` was greater than `a[i]`, `new` was set to a list containing all elements of `a` starting from index `i` to the end. `check_all` indicates whether the first element of `a` is greater than all elements in `new`, and `new_all` indicates whether the elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order. If `check_all` and `new_all` were both true at any point, 'YES' was printed and the loop broke. Otherwise, 'NO' was printed and the loop broke. If the loop completed without breaking, no output was printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `_` is incremented by 1, `t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is a new input integer between 2 and 50, `a` is a list of integers read from the input. If `check_all` is `True`, `check_all` indicates whether all elements in `a` are in strictly increasing order, and `new_all` indicates whether the elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order. If `check_all` is `False`, `i` is `n-1`, and the loop has checked each pair of consecutive elements in `a` from index 1 to `n-1`. If at any point `a[i - 1]` was greater than `a[i]`, `new` is a list containing all elements of `a` starting from that index `i` to the end, and `check_all` and `new_all` were evaluated. If `check_all` and `new_all` were both `True`, 'YES' was printed and the loop broke. If either `check_all` or `new_all` was `False`, 'NO' was printed and the loop broke. If no such pair was found, the loop completes without printing anything.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: _ is incremented by 1, `t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is a new input integer between 2 and 50, `a` is a new list of integers read from the input, `i` is `n-1`. If `check_all` is `True`, then all consecutive elements in `a` are in increasing order, and `new_all` is a boolean value indicating the conditions as described. If `check_all` is `False`, the loop has checked each pair of consecutive elements in `a` from index 1 to `n-1`. Additionally, if any element in `a` at index `i-1` is greater than the element at index `i` for any `i` from 1 to `n-1`, then `new` is the sublist of `a` starting from that index `i` to the end. `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than `a[0]`, otherwise `check_all` is `False`. `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `new_all` is `False`. The loop will break if `a[i-1]` is greater than `a[i]` and either `check_all` or `new_all` is `False`, or if both are `True`. If no such condition is met, the loop completes all iterations.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
