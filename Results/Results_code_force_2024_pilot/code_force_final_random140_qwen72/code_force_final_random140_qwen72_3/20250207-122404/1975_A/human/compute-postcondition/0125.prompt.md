You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, representing the length of the array a. a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, representing the elements of the array a.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        check_all = all([(a[i - 1] < a[i]) for i in range(1, n)])
        
        if check_all:
            print('YES')
        else:
            for i in range(1, n):
                if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
                    new = a[i:]
                    check_all = all([(a[0] > new[i]) for i in range(len(new))])
                    new_all = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])
                    if check_all and new_all:
                        print('YES')
                        break
                    else:
                        print('NO')
                        break
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `_` is equal to `t`, `t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is a new input integer between 2 and 50, and `a` is a list of integers read from the input. For each iteration, if `check_all` is `True`, it means all elements in `a` are in strictly increasing order, and 'YES' is printed. If `check_all` is `False`, the loop checks each pair of consecutive elements in `a` from index 1 to `n-1`. If at any point `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, `new` is set to the sublist of `a` starting from index `i` to the end. `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than `a[0]`, and `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order. If both `check_all` and `new_all` are `True`, 'YES' is printed and the loop breaks. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed and the loop breaks. If no such condition is met, the loop completes all iterations without printing anything.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. The function processes each test case and returns some result for each test case.

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
