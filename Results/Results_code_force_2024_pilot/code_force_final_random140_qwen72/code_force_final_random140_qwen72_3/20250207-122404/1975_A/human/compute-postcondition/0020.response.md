Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is a new input integer that must be at least 2, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is 1. If `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, `new` is a list containing all elements of `a` starting from index 1 to the end. If `check_all` is `True` and `new_all` is `True`, or if `check_all` is `False` or `new_all` is `False`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues as per the original conditions.***
