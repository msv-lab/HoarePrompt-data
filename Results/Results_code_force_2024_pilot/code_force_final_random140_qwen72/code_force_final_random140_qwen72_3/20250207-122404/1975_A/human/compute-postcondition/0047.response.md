To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `_` is incremented by 1.
2. `t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000.
3. `n` is a new input integer between 2 and 50.
4. `a` is a list of integers read from the input.
5. `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `a` are in strictly increasing order.
6. `new` is a list containing all elements of `a` starting from index `i` to the end if at any point during the loop, `a[i - 1]` was greater than `a[i]`.
7. `check_all` indicates whether the first element of `a` is greater than all elements in `new`.
8. `new_all` indicates whether the elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement simply prints the string `'YES'`.
- The initial state provides context about various variables and conditions, but the `print` statement itself does not depend on these variables or conditions. It will always print the string `'YES'`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print the string `'YES'`, regardless of the values of the variables or the conditions described in the initial state.

Output: **YES**
