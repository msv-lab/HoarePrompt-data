The given Python code snippet updates the value of `new_all` based on whether all elements in the `new` sublist are in non-decreasing order.

### Initial State:
- `_` is incremented by 1
- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000
- `n` is a new input integer between 2 and 50 and must be greater than 3
- `a` is a new list of integers read from the input
- `i` is 3
- `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]` if it was true in the previous iteration
- `new` is the sublist of `a` starting from index 3 to the end
- `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than `a[0]`, otherwise `check_all` is `False`
- `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `new_all` is `False`

### Code Execution:
The code snippet:
```python
new_all = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])
```
This line checks if all elements in the `new` sublist are in non-decreasing order. It does this by iterating over the indices of `new` (from 1 to `len(new) - 1`) and checking if each element is less than or equal to the next element. If all these conditions are met, `new_all` is set to `True`; otherwise, it is set to `False`.

### Impact on Variables:
- `new_all` is updated based on the condition described above.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

### Output State:
- `_` is incremented by 1
- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000
- `n` is a new input integer between 2 and 50 and must be greater than 3
- `a` is a new list of integers read from the input
- `i` is 3
- `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]` if it was true in the previous iteration
- `new` is the sublist of `a` starting from index 3 to the end
- `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than `a[0]`, otherwise `check_all` is `False`
- `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `new_all` is `False`

Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is a new input integer between 2 and 50 and must be greater than 3, `a` is a new list of integers read from the input, `i` is 3, `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]` if it was true in the previous iteration, `new` is the sublist of `a` starting from index 3 to the end, `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than `a[0]`, otherwise `check_all` is `False`, `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `new_all` is `False`.**
