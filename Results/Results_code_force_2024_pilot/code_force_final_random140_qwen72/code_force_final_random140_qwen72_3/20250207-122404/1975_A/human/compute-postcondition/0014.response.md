Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000.
- `n` is a new input integer that must be at least 2.
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `check_all` is `False`.
- `i` is 1.
- `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`.
- `new` is a list containing all elements of `a` starting from index 1 to the end.
- `new_all` is `True` if `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise `new_all` is `False`.
- `check_all` is `True`.
- `new_all` is `True`.

Given these conditions, the `print` statement is:

```python
print('YES')
```

### Explanation:
- The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.
- The conditions provided do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the string `'YES'` is hardcoded and does not depend on any variables or conditions.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
