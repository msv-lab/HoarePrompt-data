Based on the initial state provided:

- `_` is incremented by 1, but this does not affect the output of the `print` statement.
- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, but it is not used in the `print` statement.
- `n` is a new input integer between 2 and 50 and must be greater than 2, but it is not used in the `print` statement.
- `a` is a new list of integers read from the input, but it is not directly used in the `print` statement.
- `i` is 2, but it is not used in the `print` statement.
- `new` is the sublist of `a` starting from index 2 to the end.
- `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than `a[0]`, otherwise `check_all` is `False`.
- `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `new_all` is `False`.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'` without any variables or conditions affecting it.

Output: **YES**
