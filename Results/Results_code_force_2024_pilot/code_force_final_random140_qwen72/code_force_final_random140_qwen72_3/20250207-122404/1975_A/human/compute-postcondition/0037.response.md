```python
print('NO')
```

This statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `new`, `check_all`, or `new_all`, the output will always be:

Output: **NO**
