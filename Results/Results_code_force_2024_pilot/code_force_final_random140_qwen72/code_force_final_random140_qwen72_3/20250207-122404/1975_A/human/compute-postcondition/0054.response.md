Based on the initial state and the conditions described:

- `_` is incremented by 1, but this does not affect the print statement.
- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, but it is not used in the print statement.
- `n` is a new input integer between 2 and 50, but it is also not used in the print statement.
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `check_all` is `True`.
- `new` is a list containing all elements of `a` starting from index `1` to the end.
- `new_all` indicates whether the elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order.
- `i` is 1.
- `n` must be at least 2.
- `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`.

Given that `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, `new_all` is `False` because the elements in `new` are not in non-decreasing order. Since `check_all` is `True` but `new_all` is `False`, the condition `(check_all and new_all)` evaluates to `False`. Therefore, the program does not enter the if block.

The print statement `print('YES')` is outside any conditional block and will always execute regardless of the conditions.

Output: **YES**
