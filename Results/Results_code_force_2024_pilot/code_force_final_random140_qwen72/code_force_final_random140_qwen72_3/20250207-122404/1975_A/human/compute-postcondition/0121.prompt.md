Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `_` is incremented by 1, `t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is a new input integer between 2 and 50, `a` is a new list of integers read from the input, `check_all` is `True` if all consecutive elements in `a` are in increasing order, otherwise `False`, `new_all` is a boolean value indicating the conditions as described, and if `check_all` is `False`, `i` is `n-1` and the loop has checked each pair of consecutive elements in `a` from index 1 to `n-1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
        new = a[i:]
        check_all = all([(a[0] > new[i]) for i in range(len(new))])
        new_all = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])
        if check_all and new_all:
            print('YES')
            break
        else:
            print('NO')
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`_` is incremented by 1, `t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is a new input integer between 2 and 50 and must be greater than 1, `a` is a new list of integers read from the input, `i` is 1. If `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, `new` is the sublist of `a` starting from index `i` to the end. If `check_all` is `True` and `new_all` is `True`, or if either `check_all` is `False` or `new_all` is `False`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `_` is incremented by 1, `t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is a new input integer between 2 and 50 and must be greater than 2, `a` is a new list of integers read from the input, `i` is 2. If `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, `new` is the sublist of `a` starting from index 2 to the end, `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than `a[0]`, otherwise `check_all` is `False`, `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `new_all` is `False`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement regardless of whether `check_all` and `new_all` are both `True` or not. If `a[i - 1]` is not greater than `a[i]`, the program continues without breaking out of the loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: _ is incremented by 1, `t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is a new input integer between 2 and 50 and must be greater than 3, `a` is a new list of integers read from the input, `i` is 3, `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]` if it was true in the previous iteration, `new` is the sublist of `a` starting from index 3 to the end, `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than `a[0]`, otherwise `check_all` is `False`, `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `new_all` is `False`. If `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, and `check_all` and `new_all` are both `True`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
