Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is a new input integer between 2 and 50, and `a` is a list of integers read from the input. If `check_all` is `True`, all elements in `a` are in strictly increasing order. If `check_all` is `False`, the loop has completed all iterations, and the final value of `i` is `n-1`. If at any point during the loop, `a[i - 1]` was greater than `a[i]`, `new` was set to a list containing all elements of `a` starting from index `i` to the end. `check_all` indicates whether the first element of `a` is greater than all elements in `new`, and `new_all` indicates whether the elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order. If `check_all` and `new_all` were both true at any point, 'YES' was printed and the loop broke. Otherwise, 'NO' was printed and the loop broke. If the loop completed without breaking, no output was printed.***
