Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is a new input integer between 2 and 50, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `check_all` is `True`, `new` is a list containing all elements of `a` starting from index `1` to the end, `new_all` indicates whether the elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, `i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, and `new_all` is `False` because `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`. Additionally, either `check_all` is `False` or `new_all` is `False`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
