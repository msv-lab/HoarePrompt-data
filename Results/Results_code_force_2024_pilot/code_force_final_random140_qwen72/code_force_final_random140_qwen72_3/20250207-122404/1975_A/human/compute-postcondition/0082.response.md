Postcondition: **`_` is incremented by 1, `t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is a new input integer between 2 and 50, `a` is a list of integers read from the input. If `check_all` is `True`, `check_all` indicates whether all elements in `a` are in strictly increasing order, and `new_all` indicates whether the elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order. If `check_all` is `False`, `i` is `n-1`, and the loop has checked each pair of consecutive elements in `a` from index 1 to `n-1`. If at any point `a[i - 1]` was greater than `a[i]`, `new` is a list containing all elements of `a` starting from that index `i` to the end, and `check_all` and `new_all` were evaluated. If `check_all` and `new_all` were both `True`, 'YES' was printed and the loop broke. If either `check_all` or `new_all` was `False`, 'NO' was printed and the loop broke. If no such pair was found, the loop completes without printing anything.**
