The function `func` reads an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list `a` of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6). It then checks if the list `a` is either strictly increasing or can be split into two parts where the first part is strictly increasing and the second part is non-decreasing and all elements in the second part are less than the first element of the list. If either condition is met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value.
