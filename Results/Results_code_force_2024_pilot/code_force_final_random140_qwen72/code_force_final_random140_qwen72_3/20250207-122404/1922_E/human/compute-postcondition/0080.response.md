Output State: **`t` is the number of iterations it took for `x` to become 1, `X` is an integer where 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18, `i` is 2, `x` is the input integer, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, and `ans` is an empty string.** 

The code snippet `ans = ''` initializes the variable `ans` to an empty string, overriding its previous value. All other variables (`t`, `X`, `i`, `x`, `max`, `min`) remain unchanged.
