The value of `t` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 2, `X` is an integer where 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18, `i` is 1, `x` is an integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1. If `x` is even, `x` is halved, `max` is 99999998, `min` is -100000000, and `ans` is "99999999 100000000". If `x` is odd, `x` remains unchanged, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999998, and `ans` is "-99999999 -100000000".**
