Output State: **`t` is the number of iterations it took for `x` to become 1, `X` is an integer where 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18, `i` is 2, `x` is the input integer, `max` is 100000000 minus the number of even divisions performed, `min` is -100000000 plus the number of odd decrements performed, and `ans` is a string of numbers starting from the final value of `max` or `min` (depending on whether the last operation was a division or decrement) and ending with 100000000 or -100000000 (depending on the initial parity of `x`).**

Explanation:
- The variable `x` is updated to the integer value provided by the user input.
- All other variables (`t`, `X`, `i`, `max`, `min`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
