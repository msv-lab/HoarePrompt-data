The value of `x` is updated to `x // 2`, which means `x` is divided by 2 and the result is truncated to the nearest whole number towards zero. Since `X` is an integer where 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18, dividing `X` by 2 will result in a new integer value that is half of `X`. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `max`, `min`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 2, `X` is an integer where 1 ≤ X ≤ 5 * 10^17, `i` is 0, `max` is 99999998, `min` is -100000000 (or -99999999 depending on the parity of the original `X`), `ans` is "99999999 100000000" (or "99999999 -100000000" depending on the parity of the original `X`).**
