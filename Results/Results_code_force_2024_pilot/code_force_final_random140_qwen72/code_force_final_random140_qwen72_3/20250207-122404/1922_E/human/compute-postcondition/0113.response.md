To determine what will be printed by the `print(t)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is the number of iterations required to reduce `x` to 1.
   - `X` is an integer where 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `x` is 1.
   - `max` is 100000000 - (number of even `x` values encountered).
   - `min` is -100000000 + (number of odd `x` values encountered).
   - `ans` is a string of alternating `max` and `min` values in reverse order of their assignment, with the final value being either `max` or `min` depending on whether the last `x` value before reaching 1 was even or odd.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `x` starts at 1 and is reduced to 1. Since `x` is already 1, no iterations are needed to reduce it further.
   - Therefore, `t` (the number of iterations required to reduce `x` to 1) is 0.

3. **Output Calculation:**
   - The `print(t)` statement will print the value of `t`.

Given that `t` is 0, the output will be:

Output: **0**
