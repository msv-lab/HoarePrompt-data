The value of `x` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `x` is `X`, which is an integer where 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18. After decrementing, the new value of `x` is `X - 1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 2, `X` is an integer where 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18, `i` is 0, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -99999999 or -99999998 depending on the parity of `X`, `ans` is "-100000000 100000000" if `X` is even or "-99999999 -100000000" if `X` is odd, `x` is `X - 1`.**
