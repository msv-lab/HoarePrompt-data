The code concatenates the string representation of `max` with a space and the current value of `ans`. Let's evaluate the output state based on whether `x` is even or odd:

- If `x` is even:
  - `max` is 99999999
  - `ans` is "100000000"
  - After the code executes, `ans` becomes "99999999 100000000"

- If `x` is odd:
  - `max` is 100000000
  - `ans` is "-100000000"
  - After the code executes, `ans` becomes "100000000 -100000000"

The values of `t`, `X`, `i`, `x`, `max`, and `min` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `X` is an integer where 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18, `i` is 2, `x` is an integer and `x` must not be 1. If `x` is even, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -100000000, and `ans` is "99999999 100000000". If `x` is odd, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999999, and `ans` is "100000000 -100000000".**
