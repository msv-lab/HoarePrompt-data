The code snippet updates the variable `ans` by concatenating the string representation of `min` (which is `-100000000`) with a space and the current value of `ans` (which is an empty string). This results in `ans` being set to `'-100000000 '`.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `X` is an integer where 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18, `i` is 0, `x` is an odd integer and `x` must not be 1, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is '-100000000 '.**
