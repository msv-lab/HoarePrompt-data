The value of `x` is updated to `x // 2`, which means `x` is divided by 2 and the result is the integer part of the division (floor division). The other variables remain unchanged.

- If `x` was even before the operation, it will become half of its original value, and it will still be an integer.
- If `x` was odd before the operation, it will also become half of its original value, rounded down to the nearest integer, and it will still be an integer.

The values of `t`, `X`, `i`, `max`, `min`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `X` is an integer where 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18, `i` is 2, `x` is `x // 2`, if `x` is even, `max` is 99999998, `min` is -100000000, and `ans` is "99999999 100000000"; if `x` is odd, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -99999999, and `ans` is "100000000 -100000000".**
