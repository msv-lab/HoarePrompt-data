The value of `x` is updated to `x // 2`, which means `x` is divided by 2 using integer division (floor division). This operation reduces `x` by half, rounding down to the nearest whole number. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `X` is an integer where 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18, `i` is 0, `x` is `x // 2`, `max` is 99999998 if `x` is even or 99999999 if `x` is odd, `min` is -99999999 if `x` is odd or -100000000 if `x` is even, `ans` is "99999999 100000000" if `x` is even or "100000000 -100000000" if `x` is odd.**
