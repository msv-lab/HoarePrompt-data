The only variable in the loop head is `x`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. If `x` is not equal to 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` must not be 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must still not be 1.

State: **`t` is 1, `X` is an integer where 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18, `i` is 2, `x` is an integer and `x` must not be 1. If `x` is even, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -100000000, and `ans` is "100000000 ". If `x` is odd, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999999, and `ans` is '-100000000'.**
