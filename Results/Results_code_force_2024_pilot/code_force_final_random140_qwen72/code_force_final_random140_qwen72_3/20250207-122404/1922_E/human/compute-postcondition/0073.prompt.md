Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is 0, `X` is an integer where 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18, `i` is 1, `x` is the input integer, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is an empty string, `int(input())` must be greater than 0.
Code of the loop:
while x != 1:
    if x % 2 == 0:
        ans = f'{max}' + ' ' + ans
        max -= 1
        x = x // 2
    else:
        ans = f'{min}' + ' ' + ans
        min += 1
        x -= 1
    t += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is 1, `X` is an integer where 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18, `i` is 1, `x` is an integer greater than 0. If `x` is even, `x` is halved, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -100000000, and `ans` is "100000000". If `x` is odd, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999999, and `ans` is '-100000000'.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is 2, `X` is an integer where 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18, `i` is 1, `x` is an integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1. If `x` is even, `x` is halved, `max` is 99999998, `min` is -100000000, and `ans` is "99999999 100000000". If `x` is odd, `x` remains unchanged, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999998, and `ans` is "-99999999 -100000000".
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is 3, `X` is an integer where 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18, `i` is 1, `x` is an integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1. If `x` is even, `x` is halved, `max` is 99999997, `min` is -100000000, and `ans` is "99999998 99999999 100000000". If `x` is odd, `x` remains unchanged, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999999, and `ans` is "-100000000 99999999 100000000".


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
