The value of `t` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`X`, `i`, `max`, `min`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 2, `X` is an integer where 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18, `i` is 0. If `X` is even, `X` is updated to `X // 2`, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -100000000, and `ans` is "100000000". If `X` is odd, `X` is updated to `X - 1`, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999999, and `ans` is '-100000000'.**
