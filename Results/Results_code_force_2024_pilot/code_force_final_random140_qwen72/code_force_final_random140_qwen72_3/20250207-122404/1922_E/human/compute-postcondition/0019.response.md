The value of `max` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `max` is 99999999 if `x` is even or 100000000 if `x` is odd. After decrementing, the new value of `max` will be 99999998 if `x` is even or 99999999 if `x` is odd. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `X` is an integer where 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18, `i` is 0, `x` is an integer and `x` must not be 1, `max` is 99999998 if `x` is even or 99999999 if `x` is odd, `min` is -99999999 if `x` is odd or -100000000 if `x` is even, `ans` is "99999999 100000000" if `x` is even or "100000000 -100000000" if `x` is odd.**
