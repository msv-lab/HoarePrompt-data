To determine what will be printed by the `print(*ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is the number of iterations it takes for `x` to become 1.
- `X` is an integer where 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18.
- `i` is 0.
- `x` is 1.
- `max` is 100000000 - (number of even iterations).
- `min` is -100000000 + (number of odd iterations).
- `ans` is a string containing alternating values of `max` and `min` in reverse order of their updates, ending with the last value that made `x` equal to 1.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initialization:**
   - `x` starts at 1.
   - `i` starts at 0.
   - `max` starts at 100000000.
   - `min` starts at -100000000.
   - `ans` is initially an empty string.

2. **Iteration Process:**
   - The loop continues until `x` becomes 1.
   - In each iteration, `x` is updated, and `i` is incremented.
   - If `i` is even, `max` is updated.
   - If `i` is odd, `min` is updated.
   - The updated value of `max` or `min` is appended to `ans`.

3. **Termination:**
   - The loop terminates when `x` becomes 1.
   - The final value of `ans` contains the alternating values of `max` and `min` in reverse order of their updates, ending with the last value that made `x` equal to 1.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume `X = 10` (for simplicity, though the actual value of `X` can be any integer between 2 and 10^18).

- **Iteration 1:**
  - `x = 10 / 2 = 5` (odd iteration)
  - `i = 1`
  - `min = -100000000 + 1 = -99999999`
  - `ans = "-99999999"`

- **Iteration 2:**
  - `x = 5 * 3 + 1 = 16` (even iteration)
  - `i = 2`
  - `max = 100000000 - 1 = 99999999`
  - `ans = "99999999 -99999999"`

- **Iteration 3:**
  - `x = 16 / 2 = 8` (even iteration)
  - `i = 3`
  - `max = 99999999 - 1 = 99999998`
  - `ans = "99999998 99999999 -99999999"`

- **Iteration 4:**
  - `x = 8 / 2 = 4` (even iteration)
  - `i = 4`
  - `max = 99999998 - 1 = 99999997`
  - `ans = "99999997 99999998 99999999 -99999999"`

- **Iteration 5:**
  - `x = 4 / 2 = 2` (even iteration)
  - `i = 5`
  - `max = 99999997 - 1 = 99999996`
  - `ans = "99999996 99999997 99999998 99999999 -99999999"`

- **Iteration 6:**
  - `x = 2 / 2 = 1` (even iteration)
  - `i = 6`
  - `max = 99999996 - 1 = 99999995`
  - `ans = "99999995 99999996 99999997 99999998 99999999 -99999999"`

### Final Output:
The `print(*ans)` statement will print the values in `ans` separated by spaces.

Output: **99999995 99999996 99999997 99999998 99999999 -99999999**
