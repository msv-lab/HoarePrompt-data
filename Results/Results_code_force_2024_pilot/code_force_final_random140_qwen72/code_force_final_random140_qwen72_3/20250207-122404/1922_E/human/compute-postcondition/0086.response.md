Output State: **`t` is 0, `X` is an integer where 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18, `i` is 2, `x` is an even integer divided by 2, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is "100000000 ".**

Explanation: The value of `x` is updated to `x // 2`, which means `x` is now half of its original value (integer division). All other variables remain unchanged. Since `x` was originally an even integer, after dividing by 2, it remains an integer.
