The value of `x` is decremented by 1. Since `x` was initially an integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1, after decrementing, `x` will be a non-negative integer and could potentially be 0 or any positive integer less than its initial value. The other variables remain unchanged.

- If `x` was even before the decrement, it will now be odd.
- If `x` was odd before the decrement, it will now be even.

Therefore, the values of `max`, `min`, and `ans` will change based on the new parity of `x`.

Output State: **`t` is 2, `X` is an integer where 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18, `i` is 1, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and not equal to 1, `max` is 100000000 if `x` is even or 99999998 if `x` is odd, `min` is -99999997 if `x` is even or -99999999 if `x` is odd, and `ans` is "-99999998 -99999999 -100000000" if `x` is even or "-100000000 99999999 100000000" if `x` is odd.**
