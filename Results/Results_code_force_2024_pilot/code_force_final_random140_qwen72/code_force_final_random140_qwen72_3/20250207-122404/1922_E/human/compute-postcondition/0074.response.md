To determine what will be printed by the `print(t)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the operations described:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `X` is an integer where \(2 \leq X \leq 10^{18}\).
   - `i` is 1.
   - `x` is 1.
   - `max` is 100000000 minus the number of even divisions performed.
   - `min` is -100000000 plus the number of odd decrements performed.
   - `ans` is a string of numbers starting from the final value of `max` or `min` (depending on whether the last operation was a division or decrement) and ending with 100000000 or -100000000 (depending on the initial parity of `x`).

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop continues until `x` becomes 1.
   - During each iteration, if `x` is even, it is divided by 2, and `max` is decremented.
   - If `x` is odd, it is decremented by 1, and `min` is incremented.
   - The variable `t` counts the number of iterations it takes for `x` to become 1.

3. **Final State:**
   - Since `x` starts at 1, it is already 1, and no iterations are needed to make it 1.
   - Therefore, `t` will be 0 because no iterations were performed.

Given this analysis, the `print(t)` statement will print the value of `t`, which is 0.

Output: **0**
