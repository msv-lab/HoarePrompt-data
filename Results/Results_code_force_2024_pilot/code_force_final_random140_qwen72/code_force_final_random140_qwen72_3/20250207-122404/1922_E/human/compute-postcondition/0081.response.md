Output State: **`t` is 0, `X` is an integer where 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18, `i` is 2, `x` is the input integer, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, and `ans` is an empty string.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is set to 0, updating its initial value from the number of iterations it took for `x` to become 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
