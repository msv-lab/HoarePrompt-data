The value of `x` is decremented by 1. Since `x` is an integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1, after decrementing, `x` will be an integer greater than or equal to 0 and not equal to 1. The values of `t`, `X`, `i`, `max`, `min`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

If `x` was even before the operation, it is now odd, and the values of `max`, `min`, and `ans` will change accordingly to reflect the new state of `x`. If `x` was odd before the operation, it remains odd, and the values of `max`, `min`, and `ans` do not change.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `X` is an integer where 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18, `i` is 1, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and not equal to 1, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999998, and `ans` is "-99999999 -100000000" if `x` was odd before the operation; otherwise, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -99999999, and `ans` is "-100000000 100000000".**
