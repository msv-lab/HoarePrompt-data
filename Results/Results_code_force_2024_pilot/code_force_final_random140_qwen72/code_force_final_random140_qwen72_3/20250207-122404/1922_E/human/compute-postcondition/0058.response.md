The code snippet `x = x // 2` performs integer division of `x` by 2, which means `x` is halved and the result is truncated towards zero (since `x` is an integer).

Given the initial state:
- `t` is 1
- `X` is an integer where 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18
- `i` is 1
- `x` is an integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1
- If `x` is even, `x` is halved, `max` is 99999998, `min` is -100000000, and `ans` is "99999999 100000000"
- If `x` is odd, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -99999999, and `ans` is "100000000 -100000000"

After executing `x = x // 2`:
- If `x` was even, it is now halved, and the new value of `x` is `x // 2`.
- If `x` was odd, it is also halved using integer division, and the new value of `x` is `(x - 1) // 2`.

Since the initial state specifies that `x` is an integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1, the new value of `x` will be an integer that is half of the original value (or the largest integer less than or equal to half the original value if `x` was odd).

The other variables (`t`, `X`, `i`, `max`, `min`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `X` is an integer where 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18, `i` is 1, `x` is `x // 2`, `max` is 99999998 if `x` was even or 99999999 if `x` was odd, `min` is -100000000 if `x` was even or -99999999 if `x` was odd, and `ans` is "99999999 100000000" if `x` was even or "100000000 -100000000" if `x` was odd.**
