Output State: **`t` is 1, `X` is an integer where 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18, `i` is 2, `x` is an integer and `x` must not be 1, `x` is now `x - 1`. If the original `x` was even, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -99999999, and `ans` is "-100000000 100000000 ". If the original `x` was odd, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999998, and `ans` is "-99999999 -100000000".**

Explanation: The value of `x` is decremented by 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged. If the original `x` was even, it is now odd, and vice versa. However, the specific values of `max`, `min`, and `ans` depend on the original parity of `x`.
