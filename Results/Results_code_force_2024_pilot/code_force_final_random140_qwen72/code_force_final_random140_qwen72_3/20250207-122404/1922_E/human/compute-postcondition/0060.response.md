Output State: **`t` is 1, `X` is an integer where 2 â‰¤ X â‰¤ 10^18, `i` is 1, `x` is an integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1. If `x` is even, `x` is halved, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -99999999, and `ans` is "-100000000 100000000". If `x` is odd, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999998, and `ans` is "-99999999 -100000000".**
