The code snippet `ans = f'{min}' + ' ' + ans` concatenates the string representation of `min` with a space and the current value of `ans`. 

- If `x` is even, `min` is `-100000000` and `ans` is `"100000000"`.
- If `x` is odd, `min` is `-99999999` and `ans` is `'-100000000'`.

Therefore, the new value of `ans` will be:

- If `x` is even: `ans` becomes `"-100000000 100000000"`.
- If `x` is odd: `ans` becomes `"-99999999 -100000000"`.

The values of `t`, `X`, `i`, `x`, `max`, and `min` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `X` is an integer where 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18, `i` is 1, `x` is an integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1. If `x` is even, `x` is halved, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -100000000, and `ans` is "-100000000 100000000". If `x` is odd, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999999, and `ans` is "-99999999 -100000000".**
