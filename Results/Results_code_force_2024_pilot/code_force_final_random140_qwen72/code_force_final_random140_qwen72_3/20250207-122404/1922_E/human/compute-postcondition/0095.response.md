The value of `max` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `max` depends on whether `x` is even or odd. If `x` is even, `max` is 99999999, and if `x` is odd, `max` is 100000000. After decrementing, `max` will be 99999998 if `x` is even, and 99999999 if `x` is odd. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `X` is an integer where 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18, `i` is 2, `x` is an integer and `x` must not be 1. If `x` is even, `max` is 99999998, `min` is -100000000, and `ans` is "99999999 100000000". If `x` is odd, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -99999999, and `ans` is "100000000 -100000000".**
