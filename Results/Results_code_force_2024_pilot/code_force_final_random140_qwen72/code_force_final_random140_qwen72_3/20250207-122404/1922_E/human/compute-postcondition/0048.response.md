Output State: **`t` is 0, `X` is an integer where 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18, `i` is 1, `x` is an integer greater than 0 and `x` is even (specifically, `x` is now half of its original value), `max` is 99999999, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is "100000000 ".**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is updated to `x // 2`, which means `x` is now half of its original value. Since `x` was originally an even integer greater than 1, the new value of `x` is still an integer and is also even.
- All other variables (`t`, `X`, `i`, `max`, `min`, `ans`) remain unchanged.
