The value of `max` is decremented by 1. Depending on whether `x` is even or odd, the initial value of `max` is either 99999999 or 100000000. After decrementing by 1, `max` becomes 99999998 if `x` is even, or 99999999 if `x` is odd. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `X` is an integer where 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18, `i` is 1, `x` is an integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1. If `x` is even, `x` is halved, `max` is 99999998, `min` is -100000000, and `ans` is "99999999 100000000". If `x` is odd, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -99999999, and `ans` is "100000000 -100000000".**
