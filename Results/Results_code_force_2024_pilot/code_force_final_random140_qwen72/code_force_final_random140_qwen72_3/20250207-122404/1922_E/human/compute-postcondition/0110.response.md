Postcondition: ***`t` is 2, `X` is an integer where 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18, `i` is 2. If `x` is even, `x` is updated to `x // 2`, `max` is 99999998 or 99999999, `min` is -100000000 or -99999999, and `ans` is one of the following: "99999998 99999999 100000000", "99999999 100000000 -100000000", "99999999 -100000000 100000000", or "100000000 -99999999 -100000000" depending on the value of `x`. If `x` is odd, `x` is updated to `X - 1`, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -99999998, and `ans` is one of the following: "-99999999 99999999 100000000", "-99999999 -100000000 100000000", "-99999999 100000000 -100000000", or "-99999999 -99999999 -100000000" depending on the value of `x`.***
