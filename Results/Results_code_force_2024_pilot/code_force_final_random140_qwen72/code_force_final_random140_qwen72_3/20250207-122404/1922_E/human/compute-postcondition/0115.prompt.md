Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and X is an integer where 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    x = int(input())
    max = 100000000
    min = -100000000
    ans = ''
    t = 0
    while x != 1:
        if x % 2 == 0:
            ans = f'{max}' + ' ' + ans
            max -= 1
            x = x // 2
        else:
            ans = f'{min}' + ' ' + ans
            min += 1
            x -= 1
        t += 1
    print(t)
    print(*ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is the number of iterations it takes for `x` to become 1, `X` is an integer where 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18, `i` is 0, `x` is 1, `max` is 100000000 - (number of even iterations), `min` is -100000000 + (number of odd iterations), `ans` is a string containing alternating values of `max` and `min` in reverse order of their updates, ending with the last value that made `x` equal to 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the loop executes all iterations, `t` is the number of iterations it took for `x` to become 1, `X` is an integer where 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18, `i` is 1, `x` is 1, `max` is 100000000 minus the number of even divisions performed, `min` is -100000000 plus the number of odd decrements performed, and `ans` is a string of numbers starting from the final value of `max` or `min` (depending on whether the last operation was a division or decrement) and ending with 100000000 or -100000000 (depending on the initial parity of `x`).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is the number of iterations required to reduce `x` to 1, `X` is an integer where 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18, `i` is 2, `x` is 1, `max` is 100000000 - (number of even `x` values encountered), `min` is -100000000 + (number of odd `x` values encountered), and `ans` is a string of alternating `max` and `min` values in reverse order of their assignment, with the final value being either `max` or `min` depending on whether the last `x` value before reaching 1 was even or odd.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
