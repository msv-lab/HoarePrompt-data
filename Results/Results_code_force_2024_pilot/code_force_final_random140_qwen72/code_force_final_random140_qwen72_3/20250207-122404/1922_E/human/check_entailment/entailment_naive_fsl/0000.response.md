Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where \(X\) is a large odd number correctly. For example, consider \(X = 1000000000000000001\). According to the program, it will keep subtracting 1 from \(X\) and adding the minimum value to the array until \(X\) becomes even. However, this process will take a very long time and may exceed the limit of 200 elements in the array. Additionally, the program does not check if the length of the array exceeds 200, which is a requirement in the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect for this case.
