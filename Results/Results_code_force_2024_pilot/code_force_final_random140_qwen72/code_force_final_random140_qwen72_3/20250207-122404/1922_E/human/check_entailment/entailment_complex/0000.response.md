Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly handles the input by reading the number of test cases and then iterating over each test case to read the value of `X`.

2. **Algorithm Logic**:
   - The function uses a loop to reduce `x` to 1 by either dividing it by 2 if it is even or decrementing it by 1 if it is odd.
   - It maintains two variables, `max` and `min`, which are used to generate the sequence of numbers. These values are adjusted based on whether `x` is even or odd.
   - The sequence is built in reverse order by prepending the current `max` or `min` value to the string `ans`.

3. **Output**:
   - The function prints the length of the generated sequence (`t`).
   - It then prints the sequence itself.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function does not handle the case where it is impossible to find a valid sequence for a given `X`. According to the problem statement, if it is impossible to find the required array, the function should print `-1`. However, the function does not check for this condition and always prints a sequence.
   - The function does not ensure that the length of the generated sequence is at most 200, which is a requirement of the problem.

5. **Correctness Issues**:
   - **Length Constraint**: The function does not enforce the constraint that the length of the array should be at most 200. If `X` is very large, the sequence could exceed this limit.
   - **Impossibility Check**: The function does not check if it is impossible to find a valid sequence for a given `X`. For example, if `X` is a prime number greater than 200, it might be impossible to generate a valid sequence of length at most 200.

Given these issues, the function is not fully correct according to the problem requirements.

Correctness: **False**
