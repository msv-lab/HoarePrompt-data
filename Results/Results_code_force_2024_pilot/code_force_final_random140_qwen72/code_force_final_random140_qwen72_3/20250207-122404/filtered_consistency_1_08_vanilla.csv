1930_B,1930_B_Adith1000_100%,codeforces2024,human,qwen2.5-72b-instruct,"You are given a positive integer n .

Find a permutation^\dagger p of length n such that there do not exist two
distinct indices i and j (1 \leq i, j < n ; i \neq j ) such that p_i divides
p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1} .

Refer to the Notes section for some examples.

Under the constraints of this problem, it can be proven that at least one p
exists.

^\dagger A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \leq n \leq
10^5 ) — the length of the permutation p .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

In the first test case, p=[4,1,2,3] is a valid permutation. However, the
permutation p=[1,2,3,4] is not a valid permutation as we can choose i=1 and
j=3 . Then p_1=1 divides p_3=3 and p_2=2 divides p_4=4 . Note that the
permutation p=[3, 4, 2, 1] is also not a valid permutation as we can choose
i=3 and j=2 . Then p_3=2 divides p_2=4 and p_4=1 divides p_3=2 .

You are given the indices of its prefix maximums and suffix maximums.

Recall that a permutation of length k is an array of size k such that each
integer from 1 to k occurs exactly once.

Prefix maximums are the elements that are the maximum on the prefix ending at
that element. More formally, the element a_i is a prefix maximum if a_i > a_j
for every j < i .

Similarly, suffix maximums are defined, the element a_i is a suffix maximum if
a_i > a_j for every j > i .

You need to output the number of different permutations that could have been

As this number can be very large, output the answer modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single

the cats in the boxes in a specific way. Of course, they would like to test
the hypothesis and publish a sensational article as quickly as possible,
because they are too engrossed in the next hypothesis about the phone's
battery charge.

Scientists have n boxes in which cats may or may not sit. Let the current
state of the boxes be denoted by the sequence b_1, \dots, b_n : b_i = 1 if
there is a cat in box number i , and b_i = 0 otherwise.

Fortunately, the unlimited production of cats has already been established, so
in one day, the scientists can perform one of the following operations:

  * Take a new cat and place it in a box (for some i such that b_i = 0 , assign b_i = 1 ). 
  * Remove a cat from a box and send it into retirement (for some i such that b_i = 1 , assign b_i = 0 ). 
  * Move a cat from one box to another (for some i, j such that b_i = 1, b_j = 0 , assign b_i = 0, b_j = 1 ). 

It has also been found that some boxes were immediately filled with cats.
Therefore, the scientists know the initial position of the cats in the boxes

Due to the large amount of paperwork, the scientists do not have time to solve
this problem. Help them for the sake of science and indicate the minimum

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^5
) — the number of boxes.

The second line of each test case contains a string s of n characters, where
the i -th character is '1' if there is a cat in the i -th box and '0'
otherwise.

The third line of each test case contains a string f of n characters, where
the i -th character is '1' if there should be a cat in the i -th box and '0'
otherwise.

It is guaranteed that in a test the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the minimum
number of operations required to obtain the desired position from the initial
position. It can be shown that a solution always exists.

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

1957_C,1957_C_Phyber_Optik_2.78%,codeforces2024,human,qwen2.5-72b-instruct,"You are given an n \times n chessboard where you and the computer take turns
alternatingly to place white rooks & black rooks on the board respectively.
While placing rooks, you have to ensure that no two rooks attack each other.
Two rooks attack each other if they share the same row or column regardless of
color.

A valid move is placing a rook on a position (r , c ) such that it doesn't
attack any other rook.

You start first, and when you make a valid move in your turn, placing a white
rook at position (r , c ), the computer will mirror you and place a black rook
at position (c , r ) in its turn. If r = c , then the computer can't mirror
your move, and skips its turn.

You have already played k moves with the computer (the computer tries to
mirror these moves too), and you must continue playing the game until there
are no valid moves remaining. How many different final configurations are
possible when you continue the game after the k moves? It is guaranteed that
the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid. Since the answer may be
large, print it modulo 10^9+7 .

Two configurations are considered different if there exists a coordinate (r ,
c ) which has a rook in one configuration, but not in the other or the color
of the rook on the coordinate is different.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq
3 \cdot 10^5 , 0 \leq k \leq n ) — the size of the chessboard and the number
of moves you have already played respectively.

Each of the next k lines of the test case contains two integers r_i and c_i ,
denoting the i -th move you made.

It is guaranteed that the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the total number
of possible final configurations modulo 10^9+7 .

Note

In the first test case, we have a 4 \times 4 grid and you've already played 1
move. After you and the computer play a turn, we have a white rook at (1 , 2
), and a black rook at (2 , 1 ). There are three possible configurations from
this state —

  1. You place a white rook at (3 , 4 ) and the computer places a black rook at (4 , 3 ) as a response. 
  2. You place a white rook at (4 , 3 ) and the computer places a black rook at (3 , 4 ) as a response. 
  3. You place a white rook at (3 , 3 ) and then at (4 , 4 ), or the other way around. They both result in the same configuration.
