The code snippet `ans.append(sums)` appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. The value of `sums` is calculated as `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]` before this operation, but the exact value of `sums` is not specified in the initial state. However, the value of `sums` is updated and then appended to `ans`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `_` is a placeholder
- `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input
- `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input
- `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`
- `ans` now contains one element, which is the value of `sums` (calculated as `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`)
- `i` is not 0
- `k` must be at least 0
- `i + x - 1` is less than `n`
- `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `ans` now contains one element which is the value of `sums` (calculated as `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`), `i` is not 0, `k` must be at least 0, `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.**
