Output State: **`a` is now sorted in non-increasing order, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the original `a`, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is `k + 1`.** 

The code snippet `ans = []` reassigns the variable `ans` to an empty list, overriding its previous value which was a list containing `k + 1` elements. All other variables remain unchanged.
