The code snippet updates the value of `sums` by adding the element at index `i - 1` of the list `a` to it. Since `a` is a reversed list of integers, the element at index `i - 1` is the `i`-th element from the end of the original list.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is a reversed list of integers.
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `_` is a placeholder.
- `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input.
- `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the original `a`.
- `ans` is an empty list.
- `i` is not 0.
- `k` is at least 0.
- `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`.

After executing the code snippet:
- `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.

The rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a reversed list of integers, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the original `a`, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is not 0, `k` is at least 0, `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.**
