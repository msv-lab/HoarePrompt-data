Output State: **`a` is sorted in non-decreasing order, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the original `a`, `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements, `i` is `k + 1`.** 

The list `a` is now sorted in ascending order, while all other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
