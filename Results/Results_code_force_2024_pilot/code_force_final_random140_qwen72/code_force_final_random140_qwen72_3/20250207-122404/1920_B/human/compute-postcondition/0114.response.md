Output State: **`a` is now sorted in non-increasing order, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the original `a`, `ans` is a list containing two elements where the first element is the updated value of `sums` and the second element is the current value of `sums`, `i` is incremented by 1, `k` must be at least the new value of `i`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.** 

Explanation: The code snippet updates the value of `sums` by adding the element at index `i - 1` of the list `a` to the current value of `sums`. All other variables remain unchanged, except for the value of `sums` which is now the sum of its previous value and the value at `a[i - 1]`. The condition that `k` must be at least the new value of `i` remains valid.
