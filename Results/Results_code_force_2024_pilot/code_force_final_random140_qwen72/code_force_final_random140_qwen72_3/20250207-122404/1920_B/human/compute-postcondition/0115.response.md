The code snippet `ans.append(sums)` appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. The value of `sums` is the sum of the elements in the original `a` up to the index `i-1`.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is now sorted in non-increasing order.
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `_` is a placeholder.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `x` is an input integer.
- `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the original `a`.
- `ans` is a list containing two elements where the first element is the updated value of `sums` and the second element is the current value of `sums`.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `k` must be at least the new value of `i`.
- `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.

After executing the code snippet:
- The list `ans` will have a third element, which is the current value of `sums`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is now sorted in non-increasing order, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the original `a`, `ans` is a list containing three elements where the first element is the updated value of `sums` before the last append, the second element is the current value of `sums` before the last append, and the third element is the current value of `sums`, `i` is incremented by 1, `k` must be at least the new value of `i`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.**
