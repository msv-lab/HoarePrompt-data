Output State: **`sums` is appended to `ans`, `i` is incremented by 1, `a` is a reversed list of integers, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the original `a`, `ans` is a list containing three elements. If `i == 1`, the first element of `ans` is the value of `sum1`, the second element is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`, and the third element is the current value of `sums`. If `i != 1`, the first element of `ans` is the initial value of `sums`, the second element is the current value of `sums`, and the third element is the current value of `sums`. `k` is at least 0. If `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. Otherwise, if `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`. `i` is now `i + 1` and `i` must be less than `k + 1` for the loop to continue.**
