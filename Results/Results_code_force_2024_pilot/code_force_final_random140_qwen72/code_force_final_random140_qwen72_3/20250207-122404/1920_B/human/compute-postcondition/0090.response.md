The code snippet `ans.append(sums)` appends the value of `sums` to the list `ans`. The value of `sums` is calculated as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`, where `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the original `a`, and `a[:x + 1]` is a slice of the first `x + 1` elements of the list `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is now sorted in non-increasing order.
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `_` is a placeholder.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `x` is an input integer.
- `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the original `a`.
- `ans` is an empty list.
- `i` is 0.
- `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`.

After executing the code snippet:
- The list `ans` now contains one element, which is the value of `sums`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is now sorted in non-increasing order, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the original `a`, `ans` is a list containing one element which is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`, `i` is 0, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`.**
