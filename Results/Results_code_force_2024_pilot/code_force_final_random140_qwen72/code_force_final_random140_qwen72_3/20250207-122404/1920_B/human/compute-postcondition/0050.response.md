Output State: **`a` is a reversed list of integers, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the original `a`, `ans` is a list containing the value `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`, `i` is 0, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`.** 

Explanation: The code appends the value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Since `sums` is calculated as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`, the list `ans` now contains this value. All other variables remain unchanged.
