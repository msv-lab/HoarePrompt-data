Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n, k, and x are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ k, x ≤ n, representing the number of elements in the array, the maximum number of elements Alice can remove, and the maximum number of elements Bob can multiply by -1, respectively. a_1, a_2, ..., a_n are integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000, representing the elements of the array. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k, x = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort()
    a.reverse()
    sum1 = sum(a)
    ans = []
    for i in range(k + 1):
        if i == 0:
            sums = sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])
            ans.append(sums)
        elif i + x - 1 < n:
            sums = sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]
            ans.append(sums)
        else:
            sums = sums + a[i - 1]
            ans.append(sums)
    print(max(ans))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements, `i` is `k + 1`, and `k` is at least 0. The first element in `ans` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`. For each subsequent element in `ans` (from index 1 to `k`), if `i + x - 1 < n`, the element is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. If `i + x - 1 >= n`, the element is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a reversed list of integers, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the original `a`, `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements. Each element in `ans` represents the value of `sums` at each iteration of the loop. The first element of `ans` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`. For each subsequent element in `ans` (from index 1 to `k`), if `i + x - 1 < n`, the element is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. If `i + x - 1 >= n`, the element is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`. The variable `i` is `k + 1`, and `k` is at least 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is now sorted in non-increasing order, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the original `a`, `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements, each element representing the updated value of `sums` at each iteration of the loop, `i` is `k + 1`, `k` is at least `k`. If `i == 0`, `sums` was initially set to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`. For each subsequent iteration, if `i + x - 1 < n`, `sums` was updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. If `i + x - 1 >= n`, `sums` was updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
