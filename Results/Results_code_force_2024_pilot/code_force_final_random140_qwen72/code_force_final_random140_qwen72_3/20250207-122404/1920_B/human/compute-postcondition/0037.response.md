Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `ans` is a list, `i` is incremented by 1, `k` is at least 0, and `i` is less than `k + 1`. If `i == 0`, `sums` is initialized to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])` and appended to `ans`. Otherwise, `sums` is updated as follows: if `i + x - 1 < n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`; otherwise, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`. In both cases, the updated `sums` is appended to `ans`.***
