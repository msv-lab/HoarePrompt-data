Postcondition: ***`a` is a reversed list of integers, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the original `a`, `ans` is a list containing two elements. If `i == 0`, the first element of `ans` is the value of `sum1` and the second element is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`, and `sums` is updated to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`. If `i != 0`, the first element of `ans` is the initial value of `sums`, and the second element is the current value of `sums`. In both cases, `i` is incremented by 1, `k` is at least 0. If `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. Otherwise, if `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.***
