Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is not 0, `k` must be at least 0, `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `sums` is updated by adding the value of `a[i - 1]` and subtracting twice the value of `a[i + x - 1]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
