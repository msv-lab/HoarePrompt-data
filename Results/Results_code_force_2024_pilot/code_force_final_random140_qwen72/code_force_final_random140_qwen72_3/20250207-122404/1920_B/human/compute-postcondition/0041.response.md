Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements, `i` is `k + 1`, and `k` is at least 0. The first element in `ans` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`. For each subsequent element in `ans` (from index 1 to `k`), if `i + x - 1 < n`, the element is updated to `sum1 + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. If `i + x - 1 >= n`, the element is updated to `sum1 + a[i - 1]`.** 

Explanation: The code snippet `n, k, x = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `x`. The initial state already specifies that these variables are integers read from the input, so their values are now updated accordingly. All other variables and conditions specified in the initial state remain unchanged.
