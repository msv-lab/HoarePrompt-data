Postcondition: ***`a` is now sorted in non-increasing order, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the original `a`, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is not 0, `k` must be at least 0, and `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`.***
