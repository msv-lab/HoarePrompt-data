Output State: **`a` is a reversed list of integers, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the original `a`, `ans` is a list containing one element which is the value of `sums`, `i` is incremented by 1, `k` is at least 0, `sums` is updated to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`.**

Explanation:
- The code updates the value of `sums` to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`.
- `sum1` remains the sum of the elements in the original `a`.
- `a` is still a reversed list of integers.
- `t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, and `x` remain unchanged.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `k` is still at least 0.
- `ans` still contains one element, which is now the updated value of `sums`.
