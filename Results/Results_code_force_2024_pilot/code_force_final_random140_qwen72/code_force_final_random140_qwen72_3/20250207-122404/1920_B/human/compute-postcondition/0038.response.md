Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements, `i` is `k + 1`, and `k` is at least 0. The first element in `ans` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`. For each subsequent element in `ans` (from index 1 to `k`), if `i + x - 1 < n`, the element is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. If `i + x - 1 >= n`, the element is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.**

### Explanation:
- **Initial State**: The loop starts with `i` set to 0 and `ans` as an empty list.
- **First Iteration**: When `i` is 0, `sums` is initialized to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])` and appended to `ans`.
- **Subsequent Iterations**: For each subsequent iteration (from `i = 1` to `i = k`):
  - If `i + x - 1 < n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.
  - If `i + x - 1 >= n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.
  - The updated `sums` is appended to `ans`.
- **Final State**: After `k + 1` iterations, `i` is `k + 1`, and `ans` contains `k + 1` elements, each representing the value of `sums` at each step of the loop.
