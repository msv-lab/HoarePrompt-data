The provided Python code snippet reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `x` from the input and assigns them to the respective variables. This operation does not affect any other variables mentioned in the initial state.

Let's break down the changes:

- `n`, `k`, and `x` are now assigned specific integer values based on the input.
- The initial state mentions that `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input, which is consistent with the code.
- The other variables (`a`, `t`, `_`, `sum1`, `ans`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`a` is a reversed list of integers, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the original `a`, `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements, `i` is `k + 1`.**
