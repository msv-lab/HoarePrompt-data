The value of `sums` is calculated as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`. This value is then appended to the list `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `ans` now includes the value `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`, `i` is incremented by 1, `k` is at least 0, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`.**
