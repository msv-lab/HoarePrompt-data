To determine what will be printed by the `print(max(ans))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `a` is a reversed list of integers.
   - `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `_` is a placeholder.
   - `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input.
   - `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the original `a`.
   - `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements.
   - The first element of `ans` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`.
   - For each subsequent element in `ans` (from index 1 to `k`):
     - If `i + x - 1 < n`, the element is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.
     - If `i + x - 1 >= n`, the element is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.
   - The variable `i` is `k + 1`, and `k` is at least 0.

2. **Understanding the List `ans`:**
   - The first element of `ans` is calculated as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`.
   - Subsequent elements are updated based on the conditions:
     - If `i + x - 1 < n`, the element is `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.
     - If `i + x - 1 >= n`, the element is `sums + a[i - 1]`.

3. **Calculating `max(ans)`:**
   - The `max(ans)` function will return the maximum value among all elements in the list `ans`.

Given the complexity of the conditions and the calculations involved, the exact numerical value of `max(ans)` cannot be determined without specific values for `a`, `n`, `k`, and `x`. However, we can describe the process and the expected output in a general form.

Output: **max(ans) (where ans is a list of k + 1 elements, with the first element being sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]), and subsequent elements calculated based on the conditions provided)**

This output describes the maximum value in the list `ans`, which is constructed according to the given rules.
