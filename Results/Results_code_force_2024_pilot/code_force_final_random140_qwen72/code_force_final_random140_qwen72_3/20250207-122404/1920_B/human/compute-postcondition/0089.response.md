Output State: **`a` is now sorted in non-increasing order, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the original `a`, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`.**

Explanation:
- The code calculates the value of `sums` as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`.
- `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the original `a`.
- `a` is sorted in non-increasing order, so the first `x + 1` elements are the largest elements in `a`.
- `sum(a[:x + 1])` is the sum of the first `x + 1` elements of `a`.
- `sums` is then calculated as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
