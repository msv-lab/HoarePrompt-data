Output State: **`a` is a list of integers read from the input, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements, `i` is `k + 1`, and `k` is at least 0. The first element in `ans` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`. For each subsequent element in `ans` (from index 1 to `k`), if `i + x - 1 < n`, the element is updated to `sum1 + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. If `i + x - 1 >= n`, the element is updated to `sum1 + a[i - 1]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input and splits it into a list of integers, which is then assigned to `a`.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `sum1`, `ans`, `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The structure and conditions for updating the elements in `ans` remain as described in the initial state.
