Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `ans` is a list containing one element which is the value of `sums`, `i` is not 0, `k` must be at least 0. If `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]` and `ans` contains this new value of `sums`. If `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]` and `ans` contains this new value of `sums`.***
