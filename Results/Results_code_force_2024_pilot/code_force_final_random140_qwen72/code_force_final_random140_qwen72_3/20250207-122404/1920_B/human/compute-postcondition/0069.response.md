The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the expression `k + 1`, so we can only adjust these.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `a` is a reversed list of integers.
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `_` is a placeholder.
- `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input.
- `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the original `a`.
- `ans` is a list containing two elements.
  - If `i == 0`, the first element of `ans` is the value of `sum1` and the second element is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`, and `sums` is updated to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`.
  - If `i != 0`, the first element of `ans` is the initial value of `sums`, and the second element is the current value of `sums`.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `k` is at least 0.
- If `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.
- Otherwise, if `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and the condition `i < k + 1` must still hold true.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- The condition `i < k + 1` must still hold true.

State: **`a` is a reversed list of integers, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the original `a`, `ans` is a list containing two elements. If `i == 1`, the first element of `ans` is the value of `sum1` and the second element is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`, and `sums` is updated to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`. If `i != 1`, the first element of `ans` is the initial value of `sums`, and the second element is the current value of `sums`. `i` is incremented by 1, `k` is at least 0. If `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. Otherwise, if `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`. `i` is now `i + 1` and `i` must be less than `k + 1` for the loop to continue.**
