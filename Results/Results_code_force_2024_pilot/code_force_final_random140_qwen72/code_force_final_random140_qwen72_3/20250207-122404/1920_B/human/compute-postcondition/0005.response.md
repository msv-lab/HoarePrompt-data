Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`.** 

Explanation: The code calculates the sum of the elements in the list `a` and assigns it to the variable `sum1`. The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, and `x` remain unchanged. The list `a` remains a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input.
