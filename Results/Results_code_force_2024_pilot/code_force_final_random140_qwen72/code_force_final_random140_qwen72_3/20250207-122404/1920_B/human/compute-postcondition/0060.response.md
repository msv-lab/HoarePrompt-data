The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is not 0, and `k` is at least 0.

At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must still be less than `k + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`a` is a reversed list of integers, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the original `a`, `ans` is a list containing one element which is the value of `sums`, `i` is incremented by 1, `k` is at least 0. If `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. Otherwise, if `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.**
