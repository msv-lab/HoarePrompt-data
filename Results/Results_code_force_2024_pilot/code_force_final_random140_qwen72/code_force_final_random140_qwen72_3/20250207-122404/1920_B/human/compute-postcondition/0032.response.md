Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `ans` is a list, `i` is incremented by 1, `k` is at least 0, `i` is less than `k + 1`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.** 

Explanation:
- The value of `sums` is updated by adding `a[i - 1]` and subtracting `2 * a[i + x - 1]`.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`, `ans`) remain unchanged.
- The condition `i` is incremented by 1 and `i` is less than `k + 1` remains valid.
