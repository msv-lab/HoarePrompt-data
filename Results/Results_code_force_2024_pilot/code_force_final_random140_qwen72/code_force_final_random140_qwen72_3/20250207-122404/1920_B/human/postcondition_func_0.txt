The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by three integers `n`, `k`, and `x`, and an array `a` of integers. For each test case, it calculates the maximum possible sum of the array after performing two operations: removing up to `k` elements and multiplying up to `x` elements by -1. The function prints the maximum sum for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value.
