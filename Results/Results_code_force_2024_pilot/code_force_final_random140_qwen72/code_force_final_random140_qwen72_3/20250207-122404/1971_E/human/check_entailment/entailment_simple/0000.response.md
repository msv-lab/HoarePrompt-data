### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `q` and initializes the lists `a` and `b` with the given positions and times, respectively.
   - It also initializes `ad` and `bd` to store the differences between consecutive elements of `a` and `b`.

2. **Speed Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the speed `v` for each segment between two consecutive signs using the formula `ad[i] / bd[i]`.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, it uses `bisect_left` to find the segment where the query point `ql` lies.
   - If the query point `ql` is exactly at one of the known positions `a[s]`, it directly prints the corresponding time `b[s]`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the time taken to reach `ql` by adding the time taken to reach the previous known position `a[s-1]` and the additional time to travel from `a[s-1]` to `ql` at the constant speed of the segment.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases such as `ql` being exactly at a known position or being between two known positions correctly.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the results for each query in the correct format, ensuring that the time is rounded down to the nearest integer.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. It handles all the constraints and edge cases appropriately.

**Correctness: True**
