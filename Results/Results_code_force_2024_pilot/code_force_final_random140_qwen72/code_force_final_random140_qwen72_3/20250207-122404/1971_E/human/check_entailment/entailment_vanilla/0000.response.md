### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `q` which represent the final destination, the number of known points, and the number of queries, respectively.
   - It then reads the positions `a` and the corresponding times `b` for these points.
   - It initializes lists `ad` and `bd` to store the differences in positions and times between consecutive points, respectively.
   - It also initializes a list `v` to store the speeds between consecutive points.

2. **Speed Calculation**:
   - The speed `v[i]` between points `a[i-1]` and `a[i]` is calculated as `(a[i] - a[i-1]) / (b[i] - b[i-1])`.

3. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, it reads the distance `ql` and uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the segment where `ql` lies.
   - If `ql` is exactly at one of the known points, it directly prints the corresponding time.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the time taken to reach `ql` by adding the time to reach the previous known point and the time to travel the remaining distance within the current segment.

4. **Time Calculation**:
   - The time to reach `ql` is calculated as `m = b[s-1] + (ql - a[s-1]) * bd[s] // ad[s]`, where `s` is the index of the segment found by `bisect_left`.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the input and output formats.
- It uses binary search to efficiently find the segment where the query point lies.
- The time calculation is done correctly by considering the time to reach the previous known point and the additional time to travel the remaining distance within the current segment.
- The program rounds down the time as required by the problem statement.
