The code appends the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` to the list `ad`. Given that `i` is 2, the code calculates `a[2] - a[1]` and appends this value to `ad`.

- `i` remains 2.
- `a` still has at least 3 elements.
- `ad` now contains the differences between `a[1]` and `a[0]`, and between `a[2]` and `a[1]`.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `a` must have at least 3 elements, `ad` contains the differences `a[1] - a[0]` and `a[2] - a[1]`.**
