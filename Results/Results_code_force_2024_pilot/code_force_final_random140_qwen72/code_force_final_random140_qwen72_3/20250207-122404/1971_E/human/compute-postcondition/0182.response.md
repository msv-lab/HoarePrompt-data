To determine what will be printed by the `print(b[s], end=' ')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the context:

### Initial State:
- `q` must be greater than 1.
- `l` is 1.
- `m` is 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `ql` is an input integer.
- `s` is the index where `ql` should be inserted in the list `a` to maintain sorted order.

### Analysis:
1. **List `a`**: The list `a` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is implied that `a` is a sorted list of integers.
2. **Variable `s`**: The variable `s` is the index where `ql` should be inserted in the list `a` to maintain sorted order. This means `s` is determined by the position in `a` where `ql` fits in the sorted sequence.
3. **List `b`**: The list `b` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is referenced in the `print` statement. We need to assume that `b` is a list that exists and has elements at the index `s`.

### What is Printed:
- The `print(b[s], end=' ')` statement will print the element at index `s` of the list `b`.
- Since `s` is the index where `ql` should be inserted in the list `a` to maintain sorted order, `b[s]` is the element in `b` at the same index.

### Final Output:
Output: **b[s] (where s is the index where ql should be inserted in the list a to maintain sorted order)**

This output describes the value that will be printed, which is the element at index `s` in the list `b`, where `s` is determined by the position of `ql` in the sorted list `a`.
