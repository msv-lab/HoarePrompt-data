Output State: **`i` is `len(b) + 1`, `a` must have more than `len(b)` elements, `ad` contains the differences `a[1] - a[0]`, `a[2] - a[1]`, ..., `a[len(a) - 1] - a[len(a) - 2]`, `b` has `len(b)` elements, `bd` now includes the differences `b[1] - b[0]`, `b[2] - b[1]`, ..., `b[len(b) - 1] - b[len(b) - 2]`, `v` is `[0, ad[len(b) - 1] / bd[len(b) - 1], ad[len(b)] / bd[len(b)], ad[i] / bd[i]]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains `len(b) + 1`.
- The lists `a` and `b` retain their properties and lengths.
- The list `ad` retains its differences.
- The list `bd` retains its differences.
- The list `v` is updated by appending the value `ad[i] / bd[i]` to it. Since `i` is `len(b) + 1`, the new element appended to `v` is `ad[len(b) + 1] / bd[len(b) + 1]`.
