Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the input and must have at least 2 elements, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the new input, `ad` is a list containing the integers 0 and `a[1] - a[0]`, `bd` is a list containing only the integer 0, `i` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The code `ad.append(a[i] - a[i - 1])` appends the difference between the second element (`a[1]`) and the first element (`a[0]`) of the list `a` to the list `ad`.
- Since `i` is 1, `a[i]` is `a[1]` and `a[i - 1]` is `a[0]`.
- The initial value of `ad` is `[0]`, so after appending `a[1] - a[0]`, `ad` becomes `[0, a[1] - a[0]]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
