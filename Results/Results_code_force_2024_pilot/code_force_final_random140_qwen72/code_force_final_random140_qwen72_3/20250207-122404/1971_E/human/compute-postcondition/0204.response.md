Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each defined by four parameters: `n`, `k`, `q`, and two lists `a` and `b`. For each test case, `n` represents the final destination, `k` is the number of known time points, `q` is the number of queries, `a` is a list of positions of the signs, and `b` is a list of times when the car reaches those positions. The function processes each query `d` (where `0 ≤ d ≤ n`) and returns the time it takes to reach the distance `d` for each query.**

Explanation:
- The function `func` handles multiple test cases, each with its own set of parameters.
- For each test case:
  - `n` is the final destination.
  - `k` is the number of known time points.
  - `q` is the number of queries.
  - `a` is a list of positions of the signs, where each position is an integer and the positions are in increasing order.
  - `b` is a list of times when the car reaches the corresponding positions in `a`, also in increasing order.
  - Each query `d` is an integer representing a distance for which the time is queried.
- The function returns the time it takes to reach the distance `d` for each query in each test case.
