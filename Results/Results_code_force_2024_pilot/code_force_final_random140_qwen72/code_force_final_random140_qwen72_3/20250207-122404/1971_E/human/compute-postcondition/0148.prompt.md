Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ad` is `[0]`, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the input, `i` is 1, `bd` is `[0]`, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the input, `v` is a list containing `len(a)` elements: 0 and the results of `ad[i] / bd[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `len(a) - 1`, `q` is the total number of iterations the loop has executed, `l` is `q - 1`, `m` is updated to `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) // ad[s]`, `ql` is updated to the integer value input by the user minus `a[s - 1]`, `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not less than the original `ql`, if `a[s] == ql`, the program prints `b[s]` and skips the rest of the current iteration, `_` is `q`, `t` must be greater than `q`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(a)):
    ad.append(a[i] - a[i - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 1, `a` must have at least 2 elements, `ad` contains the difference between `a[1]` and `a[0]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 2, `a` must have at least 3 elements, `ad` contains the differences `a[1] - a[0]` and `a[2] - a[1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 3, `a` must have at least 4 elements, `ad` contains the differences `a[1] - a[0]`, `a[2] - a[1]`, `a[3] - a[2]`, and `a[3] - a[2]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
