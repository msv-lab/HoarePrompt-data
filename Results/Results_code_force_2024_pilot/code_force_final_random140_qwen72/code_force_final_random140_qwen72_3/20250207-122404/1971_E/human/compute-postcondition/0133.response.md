To determine what will be printed by the `print(m, end=' ')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the calculations step by step:

### Initial State:
- `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers read from the input.
- `i` is 1.
- `ad` is a list containing the differences between consecutive elements of `a` starting from the second element.
- `b` must have at least `len(a)` elements.
- `bd` now includes the differences between consecutive elements of `b` starting from the second element.
- `v` is a list containing `len(a)` elements: 0 and the results of `ad[i] / bd[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `len(a) - 1`.
- `q` must be at least 3.
- `l` is 2.
- `m` is calculated as `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) // ad[s]`.
- `ql` is updated to `ql - a[s - 1]`.
- `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not less than the original `ql`.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Determine `s`:**
   - `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not less than the original `ql`.
   - For example, if `a = [0, 1, 3, 5]` and `ql = 4`, then `s` would be 3 because `a[3] = 5` is the first element not less than 4.

2. **Calculate `ql`:**
   - `ql` is updated to `ql - a[s - 1]`.
   - Using the same example, if `s = 3`, then `a[s - 1] = a[2] = 3`, so `ql` becomes `4 - 3 = 1`.

3. **Calculate `m`:**
   - `m` is calculated as `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) // ad[s]`.
   - Let's assume `b = [0, 2, 4, 6]` and `bd = [2, 2, 2]` (differences between consecutive elements of `b`).
   - If `s = 3`, then `b[s - 1] = b[2] = 4`.
   - `bd[s] = bd[3] = 2`.
   - `a[s - 1] = a[2] = 3`.
   - `ad[s] = ad[3] = 2`.
   - So, `m` becomes `4 + 2 * (1 - 3) // 2 = 4 + 2 * (-2) // 2 = 4 + (-4) // 2 = 4 - 2 = 2`.

### Final Output:
The `print(m, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `m` followed by a space.

Output: **2 **

This is the precise description of what will be printed based on the given initial state and the calculations.
