Postcondition: ***`q` must be greater than 0, `l` is 0, `m` is 0, `i` is 1, `ql` is an input integer, `s` is the index where `ql` should be inserted in the list `a` to maintain sorted order. If the element at index `s` in the list `a` is equal to `ql`, we continue to the next iteration of the loop.***
