Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` must have at least `len(a)` elements, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `v` is a list that now includes the values `ad[1] / bd[1]`, `ad[2] / bd[2]`, ..., `ad[len(a)-1] / bd[len(a)-1]`.
Code of the loop:
for l in range(q):
    m = 0
    i = 1
    ql = int(input())
    s = bisect_left(a, ql)
    if a[s] == ql:
        print(b[s], end=' ')
        continue
    ql -= a[s - 1]
    m += b[s - 1]
    m += bd[s] * ql // ad[s]
    print(m, end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` must have at least `len(a)` elements, `i` is 1, `v` is a list that now includes the values `ad[1] / bd[1]`, `ad[2] / bd[2]`, ..., `ad[len(a)-1] / bd[len(a)-1]`, `q` must be greater than 0, `l` is 0, `m` is `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) // ad[s]`, `ql` is `ql - a[s - 1]`, `s` is the index where `ql` would fit in the sorted list `a` while maintaining the sorted order. If `a[s]` is equal to `ql`, we continue to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement in the sequence.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` must have at least `len(a)` elements, `i` is 1, `v` is a list that now includes the values `ad[1] / bd[1]`, `ad[2] / bd[2]`, ..., `ad[len(a)-1] / bd[len(a)-1]`, `q` must be greater than 1, `l` is 1, `m` is `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql // ad[s])`, `ql` is the integer input by the user minus `a[s - 1]`, `s` is the index where `ql` (after being updated) would fit in the sorted list `a` while maintaining the sorted order. If `a[s]` is equal to `ql` (after being updated), the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement in the sequence.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` must have at least `len(a)` elements, `i` is 1, `v` is a list that now includes the values `ad[1] / bd[1]`, `ad[2] / bd[2]`, ..., `ad[len(a)-1] / bd[len(a)-1]`, `q` must be greater than 2, `l` is 2, `m` is `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql // ad[s])`, `ql` is the integer input by the user minus `a[s - 1]`, `s` is the index where the original `ql` would fit in the sorted list `a` while maintaining the sorted order. If `a[s]` is equal to the original `ql`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement in the sequence. Otherwise, the program continues as usual with the updated value of `ql`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
