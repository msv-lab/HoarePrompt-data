The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of the list `a`. If `i` is less than the length of `a`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `a` must have at least 3 elements. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3, and `a` must have at least 4 elements to allow the loop to continue.

State: **`i` is 3, `a` must have at least 4 elements, `ad` contains the differences `a[1] - a[0]`, `a[2] - a[1]`, and `a[3] - a[2]`.**
