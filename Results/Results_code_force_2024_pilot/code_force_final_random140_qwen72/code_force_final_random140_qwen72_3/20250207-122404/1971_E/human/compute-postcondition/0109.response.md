To determine what will be printed by the `print(m, end=' ')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the operations step by step:

### Initial State:
1. **`a`**: A list starting with 0 followed by integers read from the input, with at least `len(a)` elements.
2. **`i`**: Set to 1.
3. **`ad`**: A list containing the differences between consecutive elements of `a` starting from the second element to the last element of `a`.
4. **`b`**: A list with at least `len(a)` elements.
5. **`bd`**: A list containing the differences between consecutive elements of `b` starting from the second element to the last element of `b`.
6. **`v`**: A list containing `len(a)` elements: 0 and the results of `ad[i] / bd[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `len(a) - 1`.
7. **`q`**: Must be greater than 0.
8. **`l`**: Set to 0.
9. **`m`**: Updated to `m + b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql // ad[s]`.
10. **`ql`**: Updated to `ql - a[s - 1]`.
11. **`s`**: The index of the first element in `a` that is not less than `ql`. If `a[s]` is equal to `ql`, the program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop or conditional block.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `s`**:
   - `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not less than `ql`.
   - If `a[s]` is equal to `ql`, the program skips the rest of the current iteration.

2. **Update `m`**:
   - `m` is updated to `m + b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql // ad[s]`.

3. **Update `ql`**:
   - `ql` is updated to `ql - a[s - 1]`.

4. **Print `m`**:
   - The `print(m, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `m` followed by a space.

### Final Output:
Given the complexity of the initial state and the operations, the exact numerical value of `m` depends on the specific values of `a`, `b`, `ad`, `bd`, `ql`, and `s`. However, based on the provided information, the output will be the value of `m` after the specified updates.

Output: **m (where m is the updated value of m based on the given operations)**
