The code snippet `b = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and then creates a list `b` that starts with 0 followed by these integers.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `_` is 0
- `n` is an input integer
- `k` is an input integer
- `q` is an input integer
- `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the input

After executing the code snippet, the list `b` is updated to start with 0 followed by the integers read from the new input. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the input, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the new input.**
