Output State: **`a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the input and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `ad` is a list containing the differences between consecutive elements of `a` starting from the second element to the last element of `a`, `b` must have at least `len(a)` elements, `bd` now includes the differences between consecutive elements of `b` starting from the second element to the last element of `b`, `v` is a list containing three elements: 0, `ad[1] / bd[1]`, and `ad[2] / bd[2]`.** 

Explanation: The code appends the value of `ad[i] / bd[i]` to the list `v`. Since `i` is 2, the new element added to `v` is `ad[2] / bd[2]`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
