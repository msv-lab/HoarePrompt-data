Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
1. **`a`**: A list starting with 0 followed by integers read from the input. It must have at least `len(a)` elements.
2. **`i`**: Set to 1.
3. **`ad`**: A list containing the differences between consecutive elements of `a` starting from the second element to the last element of `a`.
4. **`b`**: Must have at least `len(a)` elements.
5. **`bd`**: A list containing the differences between consecutive elements of `b` starting from the second element to the last element of `b`.
6. **`v`**: A list containing `len(a)` elements: 0 and the results of `ad[i] / bd[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `len(a) - 1`.
7. **`q`**: Must be greater than 0.
8. **`l`**: Set to 0.
9. **`m`**: Set to 0.
10. **`ql`**: An input integer.
11. **`s`**: The index of the first element in `a` that is not less than `ql`. Additionally, the element at index `s` in `a` is equal to `ql`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(b[s], end=' ')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `s`**:
   - `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not less than `ql`.
   - This means `a[s] == ql`.

2. **Access `b[s]`**:
   - Since `s` is the index in `a` where `a[s] == ql`, we need to access the corresponding element in `b` at the same index `s`.

3. **Output**:
   - The print statement will print the value of `b[s]` followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

### Final Output:
Based on the initial state and the print statement, the output will be the value of `b[s]` followed by a space.

Output: **b[s] (where b[s] is the element in list b at the index s, and s is the index of the first element in list a that is not less than ql)**
