The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`q` is greater than 1, `l` is 2, `m` is 0, `i` is 1, `s` is the index where `ql` should be inserted in the list `a` to maintain sorted order, and `ql` is an input integer.**
