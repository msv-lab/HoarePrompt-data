To determine what will be printed by the `print(m, end=' ')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

### Initial State:
- `a` is a list with at least `len(a)` elements.
- `i` is 1.
- `v` is a list that includes the values `ad[1] / bd[1]`, `ad[2] / bd[2]`, ..., `ad[len(a)-1] / bd[len(a)-1]`.
- `q` is greater than 0.
- `l` is 0.
- `m` is calculated as `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) // ad[s]`.
- `ql` is updated to `ql - a[s - 1]`.
- `s` is the index where `ql` would fit in the sorted list `a` while maintaining the sorted order. If `a[s]` is equal to `ql`, the next iteration or statement is continued.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `m`**:
   - `m` is calculated using the formula: `m = b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) // ad[s]`.
   - Here, `s` is the index where `ql` fits in the sorted list `a`.
   - `ql` is updated to `ql - a[s - 1]`.

2. **Understanding `s`**:
   - `s` is the index where `ql` would fit in the sorted list `a`.
   - This means `a[s-1] <= ql < a[s]` (or `a[s-1] == ql` if `a[s]` is equal to `ql`).

3. **Understanding `ql`**:
   - `ql` is initially set to some value and then updated to `ql - a[s - 1]`.

4. **Calculating `m`**:
   - Given the formula, `m` depends on the values of `b[s - 1]`, `bd[s]`, `ql`, `a[s - 1]`, and `ad[s]`.
   - Since the exact values of these variables are not provided, we can only describe `m` in terms of these variables.

### Final Output:
The `print(m, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `m` followed by a space. The value of `m` is calculated as `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) // ad[s]`, where `s` is the index where `ql` fits in the sorted list `a`.

Output: **m (where m is calculated as b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) // ad[s], and s is the index where ql fits in the sorted list a)**
