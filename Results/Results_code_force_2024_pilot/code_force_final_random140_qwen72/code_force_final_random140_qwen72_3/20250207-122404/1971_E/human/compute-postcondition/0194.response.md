To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

### Initial State:
- `q` is greater than 1.
- `l` is 2.
- `m` is 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `s` is the index where `ql` should be inserted in the list `a` to maintain sorted order.
- `ql` is an input integer.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(b[s], end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Understanding `s`**:
   - `s` is the index where `ql` should be inserted in the list `a` to maintain sorted order. This means `s` is determined by the position of `ql` in the sorted list `a`.

2. **Understanding `b[s]`**:
   - The `print` statement is printing the element at index `s` of the list `b`.
   - Since `s` is the index where `ql` should be inserted in `a`, it implies that `b` must have elements that correspond to the indices of `a`.

3. **Output**:
   - The exact value of `b[s]` depends on the contents of the list `b` and the value of `s`.
   - Without the actual values of `a` and `b`, we can only describe the output in terms of the given variables.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will print the element at index `s` of the list `b`, followed by a space. Since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the given variables.

Output: **b[s] (where s is the index where ql should be inserted in the list a to maintain sorted order)**
