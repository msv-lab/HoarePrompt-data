Output State: **`a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the input and must have at least `len(a)` elements, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `ad` is a list containing the differences between consecutive elements of `a` starting from the second element to the last element of `a`.**

### Explanation:
- **`a`**: The list `a` remains unchanged throughout the loop. It starts with 0 followed by the integers read from the input.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be equal to `len(a) - 1` because the loop iterates from 1 to `len(a) - 1`.
- **`ad`**: The list `ad` initially contains only `[0]`. After each iteration, it appends the difference between the current element `a[i]` and the previous element `a[i - 1]`. By the end of the loop, `ad` will contain the differences between all consecutive elements of `a` starting from the second element to the last element of `a`.

All other variables (`v`, `q`, `l`, `m`, `ql`, `s`, `n`, `k`, `_`, `b`, `bd`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
