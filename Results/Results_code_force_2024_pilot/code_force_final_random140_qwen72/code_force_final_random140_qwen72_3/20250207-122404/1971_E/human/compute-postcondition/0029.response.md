Output State: **`a` must have at least `len(a)` elements, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `v` is a list that now includes the values `ad[1] / bd[1]`, `ad[2] / bd[2]`, ..., `ad[len(a)-1] / bd[len(a)-1]`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The list `a` must still have at least as many elements as it started with.
- The variable `i` will be equal to `len(a) - 1`.
- The list `v` will contain the results of dividing each corresponding element of `ad` by `bd` for all indices from 1 to `len(a) - 1`.
