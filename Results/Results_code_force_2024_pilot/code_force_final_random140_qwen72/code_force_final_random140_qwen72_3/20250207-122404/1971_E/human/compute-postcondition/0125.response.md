Output State: **`a` remains a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the input and must have at least `len(a)` elements, `i` is 1, `ad` is a list containing the differences between consecutive elements of `a` starting from the second element to the last element of `a`, `b` must have at least `len(a)` elements, `bd` now includes the differences between consecutive elements of `b` starting from the second element to the last element of `b`, `v` is a list containing `len(a)` elements: 0 and the results of `ad[i] / bd[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `len(a) - 1`, `q` must be at least 3, `l` is 2, `m` is 0, `ql` is the integer value input by the user minus `a[s - 1]`, `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not less than the original `ql`.** 

Explanation:
- The code `ql = int(input())` updates the value of `ql` to the integer value input by the user.
- The rest of the variables (`a`, `i`, `ad`, `b`, `bd`, `v`, `q`, `l`, `m`, `s`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The new value of `ql` is calculated as the integer input by the user minus `a[s - 1]`, where `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not less than the original `ql`.
