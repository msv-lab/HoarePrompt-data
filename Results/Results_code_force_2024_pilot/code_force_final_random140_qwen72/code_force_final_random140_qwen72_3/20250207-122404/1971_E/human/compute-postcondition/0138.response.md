Output State: **`a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the input, `i` is 1, `ad` is a list containing the differences between consecutive elements of `a` starting from the second element to the last element of `a`, `b` must have at least `len(a)` elements, `bd` now includes the differences between consecutive elements of `b` starting from the second element to the last element of `b`, `v` is a list containing `len(a)` elements: 0 and the results of `ad[i] / bd[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `len(a) - 1`, `q` is the total number of iterations the loop has executed, `l` is `q - 1`, `m` is updated to `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) // ad[s]`, `ql` is updated to the integer value input by the user minus `a[s - 1]`, `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not less than the original `ql`, if `a[s] == ql`, the program prints `b[s]` and skips the rest of the current iteration, `_` is `q`, `t` must be greater than `q`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer.**

Explanation:
- The code `a = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))` updates the list `a` to start with 0 followed by the integers read from the input.
- All other variables (`i`, `ad`, `b`, `bd`, `v`, `q`, `l`, `m`, `ql`, `s`, `_`, `t`, `n`, `k`) remain unchanged or are defined based on the new value of `a`.
- The initial state conditions for these variables are still valid, and their definitions and relationships remain the same.
