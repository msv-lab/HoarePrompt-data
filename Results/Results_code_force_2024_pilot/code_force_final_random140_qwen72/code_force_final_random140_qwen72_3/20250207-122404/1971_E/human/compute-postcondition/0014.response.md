Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the input and must have at least `len(a)` elements, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the new input, `ad` is a list containing the integers 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `a` (i.e., `a[i] - a[i-1]` for each `i` from 1 to `len(a)-1`), `bd` is a list containing only the integer 0, `i` is `len(a) - 1`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the indices of the list `a` starting from 1 up to `len(a) - 1`.
- For each iteration, the difference between the current element `a[i]` and the previous element `a[i-1]` is calculated and appended to the list `ad`.
- After the loop completes, `ad` will contain the initial value 0 followed by the differences between consecutive elements of `a`.
- The variable `i` will be equal to `len(a) - 1` after the loop finishes, as it will have incremented to the last index of the range.
- The other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `q`, `b`, and `bd`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
