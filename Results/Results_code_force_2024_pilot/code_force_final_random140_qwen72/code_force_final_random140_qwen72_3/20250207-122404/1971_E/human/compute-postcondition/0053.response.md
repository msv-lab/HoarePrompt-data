Output State: **`a` must have at least `len(a)` elements, `i` is 1, `v` is a list that now includes the values `ad[1] / bd[1]`, `ad[2] / bd[2]`, ..., `ad[len(a)-1] / bd[len(a)-1]`, `q` must be greater than 1, `l` is 1, `m` is `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql // ad[s])`, `ql` is the integer input by the user minus `a[s - 1]`, `s` is the index where `ql` (after being updated) would fit in the sorted list `a` while maintaining the sorted order. If `a[s]` is equal to `ql` (after being updated), the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement in the sequence.**
