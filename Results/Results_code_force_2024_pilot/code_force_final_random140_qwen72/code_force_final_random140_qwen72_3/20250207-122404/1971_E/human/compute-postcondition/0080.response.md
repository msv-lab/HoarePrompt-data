Output State: **`a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers read from the input and must have at least 4 elements, `i` is 3, `ad` is a list containing the first integer read from the input, the difference between the third element and the second element of `a`, and the difference between the fourth element and the third element of `a`.** 

Explanation: The code appends the difference between the fourth element (`a[3]`) and the third element (`a[2]`) of the list `a` to the list `ad`. The initial state specifies that `a` starts with 0 followed by integers read from the input and has at least 4 elements, and `i` is 3. The list `ad` initially contains the first integer read from the input and the difference between the third and second elements of `a`. After executing the code, `ad` now includes an additional element, which is the difference between the fourth and third elements of `a`. The values of `a` and `i` remain unchanged.
