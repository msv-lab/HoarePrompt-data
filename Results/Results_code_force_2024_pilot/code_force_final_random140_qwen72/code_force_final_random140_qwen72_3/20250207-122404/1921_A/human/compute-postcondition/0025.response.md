The code snippet `a, b = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100
- `steps` is 2
- `a` and `b` are input integers (these will be updated)
- `c` and `d` are new input integers
- `e` and `f` are new input integers
- `g` and `h` are new input integers
- `n` is `(a - c) * (a - c) + (b - d) * (b - d)`
- `x` is `(a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)`
- If `x` > `n`, then `x` is greater than `n`. Otherwise, `x` is less than or equal to `n`

After executing the code snippet:
- `a` and `b` are now assigned new values from the input.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100
- `steps` is 2
- `a` and `b` are new input integers
- `c` and `d` are new input integers
- `e` and `f` are new input integers
- `g` and `h` are new input integers
- `n` is `(a - c) * (a - c) + (b - d) * (b - d)` (with the new values of `a` and `b`)
- `x` is `(a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)` (with the new values of `a` and `b`)
- If `x` > `n`, then `x` is greater than `n`. Otherwise, `x` is less than or equal to `n`

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `steps` is 2, `a` and `b` are new input integers, `c` and `d` are new input integers, `e` and `f` are new input integers, `g` and `h` are new input integers, `n` is `(a - c) * (a - c) + (b - d) * (b - d)`, `x` is `(a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)`, if `x` > `n`, then `x` is greater than `n`. Otherwise, `x` is less than or equal to `n`.**
