To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `steps` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. Given that `t` is already defined as an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive, and it is assigned the value of an input integer, we can assume `t` is valid for the loop to run at least once.

The variable `steps` is initialized by the `range(t)` function, starting from 0 up to `t-1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1, and `steps` will start at 0.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, and it is assigned the value of an input integer.
- The function `func` is expected to process multiple test cases, each consisting of four pairs of integers representing the coordinates of the corners of a square.

The adjusted state for the loop to execute is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `steps` is 0**
