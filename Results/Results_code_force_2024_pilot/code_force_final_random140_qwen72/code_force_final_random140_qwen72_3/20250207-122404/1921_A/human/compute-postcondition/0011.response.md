Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100.
- `steps` is 0.
- `a` and `b` are input integers.
- `c` and `d` are input integers.
- `e` and `f` are input integers.
- `g` and `h` are input integers.
- `n` is calculated as \((a - c) * (a - c) + (b - d) * (b - d)\).
- `x` is calculated as \((a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)\).
- `x` is less than or equal to `n`.

Given the initial state, the `print(x)` statement will print the value of `x`.

Explanation:
- `x` is the Euclidean distance squared between the points \((a, b)\) and \((e, f)\).
- `n` is the Euclidean distance squared between the points \((a, b)\) and \((c, d)\).
- It is given that `x` is less than or equal to `n`.

Therefore, the value of `x` is the result of the formula \((a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)\), and it is guaranteed to be less than or equal to `n`.

Output: **x (where x is the value of (a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f) and x is less than or equal to n)**
