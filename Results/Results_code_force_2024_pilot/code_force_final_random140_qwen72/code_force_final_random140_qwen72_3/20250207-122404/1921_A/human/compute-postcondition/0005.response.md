The code snippet `g, h = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns these integers to the variables `g` and `h`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100
- `steps` is 0
- `a` and `b` are input integers
- `c` and `d` are input integers
- `e` and `f` are input integers

After executing the code snippet:
- `g` and `h` are assigned the values from the input, which are integers.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `steps` is 0, `a` and `b` are input integers, `c` and `d` are input integers, `e` and `f` are input integers, `g` and `h` are input integers.**
