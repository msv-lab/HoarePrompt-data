The code snippet `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This integer represents the number of test cases.

Given the initial state:
- The function `func` is expected to take no arguments directly but should be designed to process multiple test cases.
- Each test case consists of four pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square, where -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000.
- The number of test cases, t, is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
- It is guaranteed that the given points form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and with a positive area.

After executing the code snippet:
- The variable `t` is assigned the value of an integer input by the user, which must be between 1 and 100 inclusive.

Output State: **The function `func` is expected to take no arguments directly but should be designed to process multiple test cases. Each test case consists of four pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square, where -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000. The number of test cases, `t`, is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, and `t` is now assigned the value of an input integer. It is guaranteed that the given points form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and with a positive area.**
