To determine what will be printed by the `print(x)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100.
   - `steps` is 2.
   - `a` and `b` are new input integers.
   - `c` and `d` are new input integers.
   - `g` and `h` are new input integers.
   - `e` and `f` are new input integers.
   - `n` is calculated as `(a - c) * (a - c) + (b - d) * (b - d)`.
   - `x` is calculated as `(a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)`.
   - If `x` > `n`, then `x` is greater than `n`. Otherwise, `x` is less than or equal to `n`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `n` represents the squared Euclidean distance between the points `(a, b)` and `(c, d)`.
   - `x` represents the squared Euclidean distance between the points `(a, b)` and `(e, f)`.

3. **Condition:**
   - The condition `if x > n` determines whether `x` is greater than `n`. If it is, then `x` is greater than `n`. Otherwise, `x` is less than or equal to `n`.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print(x)` statement will print the value of `x`, which is the squared Euclidean distance between the points `(a, b)` and `(e, f)`.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, `e`, and `f` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `x`. However, based on the given conditions, we know that `x` is either greater than `n` or less than or equal to `n`.

Output: **x (where x is the squared Euclidean distance between the points (a, b) and (e, f))**
