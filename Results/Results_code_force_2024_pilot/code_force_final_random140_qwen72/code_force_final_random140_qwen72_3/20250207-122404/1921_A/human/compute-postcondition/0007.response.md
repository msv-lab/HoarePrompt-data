Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `steps` is 0, `a` and `b` are input integers, `c` and `d` are input integers, `e` and `f` are input integers, `g` and `h` are input integers, `n` is `(a - c) * (a - c) + (b - d) * (b - d)`, `x` is `(a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is calculated as `(a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)`.
- All other variables (`t`, `steps`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, `h`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
