The code snippet `a, b = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into two parts, and converts each part into an integer. These integers are then assigned to the variables `a` and `b`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100
- `steps` is 0

After executing the code snippet, the variables `a` and `b` will be assigned the values read from the input. The values of `t` and `steps` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `steps` is 0, `a` and `b` are input integers.**
