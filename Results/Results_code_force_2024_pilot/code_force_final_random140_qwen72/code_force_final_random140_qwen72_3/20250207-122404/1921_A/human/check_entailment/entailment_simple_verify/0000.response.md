Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly calculate the area of the square in all cases. The program computes the squared Euclidean distance between pairs of points and prints the smaller of these distances, which is not the correct method for determining the area of a square. 

To correctly determine the area of the square, the program should identify the side length of the square by finding the minimum difference in the x-coordinates and y-coordinates among the given points, and then square this value to get the area. The current logic in the program does not account for this, leading to incorrect results.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
0 0
0 2
2 0
2 2
```
The expected output is `4` because the side length of the square is 2, and the area is \(2^2 = 4\). However, the program outputs `2` because it incorrectly calculates the squared distance between two points and prints the smaller value.

Therefore, the original assessment is correct, and the program is indeed incorrect.

Final: **False**
