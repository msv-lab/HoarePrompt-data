Reasoning:

The program aims to calculate the area of a square given the coordinates of its corners. However, the method used in the program to determine the side length of the square is flawed. The program calculates the squared distances between two pairs of points (`n` and `x`) and then prints the smaller of these two values. This approach does not guarantee that the correct side length of the square is being used to compute the area.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to identify the side length of the square. Since the square has sides parallel to the coordinate axes, the side length can be determined by finding the maximum difference in the x-coordinates and the y-coordinates among the given points. The side length will be the same for both dimensions because it's a square.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the logic:

1. Collect all x-coordinates and y-coordinates separately.
2. Find the maximum difference between any two x-coordinates and any two y-coordinates.
3. The side length of the square will be the minimum of these two differences (since they should be equal).
4. Compute the area by squaring the side length.

However, the current program does not follow this logic. Instead, it computes the squared distance between two pairs of points and prints the smaller value, which is not a reliable way to determine the side length of the square.

Given the example inputs and outputs:
- For the first test case, the points are (1, 2), (4, 5), (1, 5), (4, 2). The side length is 3, so the area is \(3^2 = 9\).
- For the second test case, the points are (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1), (-1, -1). The side length is 2, so the area is \(2^2 = 4\).
- For the third test case, the points are (45, 11), (45, 39), (17, 11), (17, 39). The side length is 28, so the area is \(28^2 = 784\).

The current program does not correctly handle these cases, as it does not ensure that the side length is calculated correctly.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
