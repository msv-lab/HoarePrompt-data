### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given the coordinates of the four corners of a square.
   - The square has sides parallel to the coordinate axes.
   - We need to calculate the area of the square.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - Since the square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, the distance between any two adjacent corners will be the side length of the square.
   - The area of the square is the side length squared.

3. **Analyzing the Provided Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the coordinates of the four corners.
   - It calculates the squared distances between the first corner and the other three corners.
   - It prints the minimum of these squared distances.

4. **Identifying the Flaw:**
   - The code assumes that the minimum squared distance between the first corner and the other three corners will always be the side length of the square.
   - This assumption is incorrect because the minimum distance could be the diagonal of the square, which is not the side length.
   - The correct approach should involve finding the maximum difference in the x-coordinates and the maximum difference in the y-coordinates, and then taking the minimum of these two differences as the side length.

5. **Function Summary Analysis:**
   - The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of four pairs of integers representing the coordinates of the corners of a square.
   - It calculates two distances: one between the first and second pair of coordinates, and another between the first and third pair of coordinates.
   - It prints the smaller of these two squared distances.
   - This approach is flawed because it does not consider the correct way to determine the side length of the square.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The provided code is incorrect because it does not correctly identify the side length of the square. It assumes the minimum distance between the first corner and the other three corners is the side length, which is not always true.
   - The correct approach should involve finding the maximum difference in the x-coordinates and the maximum difference in the y-coordinates, and then taking the minimum of these two differences as the side length.

### Final Evaluation:
