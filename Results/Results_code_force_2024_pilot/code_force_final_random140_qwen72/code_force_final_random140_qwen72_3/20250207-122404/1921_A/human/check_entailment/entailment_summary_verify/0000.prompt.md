You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A square of positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area is located on the
coordinate plane, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. You are given
the coordinates of its corners, in random order. Your task is to find the area
of the square.

Input

Each test consists of several testcases. The first line contains one integer t
(1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of testcases. The following is a description
of the testcases.

Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i
(-1000\le x_i, y_i\le 1000 ), coordinates of the corners of the square.

It is guaranteed that there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate
axes, with positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area, with corners in given
points.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the area of the square.

- Program:
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for steps in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        (c, d) = map(int, input().split())
        (e, f) = map(int, input().split())
        (g, h) = map(int, input().split())
        n = (a - c) * (a - c) + (b - d) * (b - d)
        x = (a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)
        if x > n:
            print(n)
        else:
            print(x)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of four pairs of integers representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. For each test case, it calculates two distances: one between the first and second pair of coordinates, and another between the first and third pair of coordinates. It then prints the smaller of these two squared distances. The function does not return any value; instead, it outputs the result directly to the console. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without modifying any global state or variables outside its scope.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the area of the square in all cases. Specifically, it calculates the squared distance between two points and prints the smaller of two such distances, which is not the correct approach to finding the area of the square.

A correct approach would involve identifying the side length of the square by finding the minimum difference in the x-coordinates and y-coordinates among the given points, and then squaring this value to get the area. Here's a case where the program fails:

Input:
```
1
0 0
0 2
2 0
2 2
```

Expected Output:
```
4
```

Actual Output:
```
2
```

The program outputs `2` instead of `4`, which is incorrect. The correct side length of the square is 2, and thus the area should be \(2^2 = 4\).
