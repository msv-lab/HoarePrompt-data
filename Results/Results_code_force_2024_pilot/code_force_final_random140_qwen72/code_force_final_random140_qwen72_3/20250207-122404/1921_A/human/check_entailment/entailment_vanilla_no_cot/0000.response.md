Correctness: **False**

The provided solution does not correctly calculate the area of the square. The logic used in the program to determine the side length of the square is flawed. Specifically, it calculates the squared distance between two points and then compares these distances to determine the smaller one, which is not a reliable method to find the side length of the square.

To correctly solve this problem, you should:

1. Identify the unique x-coordinates and y-coordinates from the four points.
2. Calculate the differences between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates and y-coordinates.
3. Since the square has sides parallel to the axes, the side length will be the same for both dimensions. Therefore, the area can be calculated as the square of the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (or y-coordinates).

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        points = []
        for _ in range(4):
            x, y = map(int, input().split())
            points.append((x, y))
        
        # Extract all x and y coordinates
        x_coords = [point[0] for point in points]
        y_coords = [point[1] for point in points]
        
        # Calculate the side length of the square
        side_length = max(x_coords) - min(x_coords)
        
        # Calculate the area of the square
        area = side_length ** 2
        print(area)

# Example usage
func()
```

This corrected program will correctly compute the area of the square for the given test cases.
