Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` remains an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `q` remains an input integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5, `c` remains a list of n integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9, `nums` remains a list of integers obtained from the input, `ones` is a list of length n + 1 where `ones[i]` is the cumulative count of 1s in `nums` up to index `i-1`, `sum` is a list of length n + 1 where `sum[i]` is the cumulative sum of elements in `nums` up to index `i-1`, `i` is `n`, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.**
