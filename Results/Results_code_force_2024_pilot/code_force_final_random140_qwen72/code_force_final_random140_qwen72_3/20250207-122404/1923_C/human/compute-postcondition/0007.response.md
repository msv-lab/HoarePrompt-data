To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5.
- `q` is an input integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5.
- `c` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9.
- `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `ones` is a list of length n + 1, initialized with all elements set to 0, except `ones[1]` which is 1 if `nums[0]` is 1, otherwise `ones[1]` is 0.
- `sum` is a list of length n + 1, initialized with all elements set to 0, `sum[1]` is now `nums[0]`.
- `i` is 1.
- `n` must be greater than 0.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive).
- The loop variable `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
- The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

### State Adjustment:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
- The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than or equal to `n`.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is incremented to 2.
- `n` must still be greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to execute one more time.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `q` is an input integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5, `c` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `ones` is a list of length n + 1, initialized with all elements set to 0, except `ones[1]` which is 1 if `nums[0]` is 1, otherwise `ones[1]` is 0, `sum` is a list of length n + 1, initialized with all elements set to 0, `sum[1]` is now `nums[0]`, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.**
