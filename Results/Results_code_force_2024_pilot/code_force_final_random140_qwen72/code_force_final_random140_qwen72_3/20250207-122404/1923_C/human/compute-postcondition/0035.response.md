Based on the initial state provided:

- `onesInRange` is set to `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`
- `sumInRange` is set to `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `q`, `c`, `nums`, `ones`, `sum`, `i`, `l`, `r`) remain unchanged.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print('NO')
```

This `print` statement simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Since the `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables mentioned in the initial state, it will always print the same string regardless of the values of those variables.

Output: **NO**
