The provided code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `l` and `r`. These values are taken from the user input and split by spaces, then converted to integers.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5
- `q` is an input integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5
- `c` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9
- `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input
- `ones` is a list of length n + 1 where `ones[i]` is the cumulative count of 1s in `nums` up to index `i-1`
- `sum` is a list of length n + 1 where `sum[i]` is the cumulative sum of elements in `nums` up to index `i-1`
- `i` is `n`
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1
- `q` must be greater than 0

After executing the code:
- `l` and `r` are assigned the values from the input, which are integers.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `q` is an input integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5, `c` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `ones` is a list of length n + 1 where `ones[i]` is the cumulative count of 1s in `nums` up to index `i-1`, `sum` is a list of length n + 1 where `sum[i]` is the cumulative sum of elements in `nums` up to index `i-1`, `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `q` must be greater than 0, `l` and `r` are input integers.**
