Based on the initial state provided:

- `onesInRange` is set to `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`
- `sumInRange` is set to `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `q`, `c`, `nums`, `ones`, `sum`, `i`, `l`, `r`) remain unchanged.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print('YES')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Since the `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or objects mentioned in the initial state, it will always print the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
