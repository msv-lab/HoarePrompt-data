The provided code snippet reads a line of input and splits it into a list of integers, which is then assigned to the variable `nums`. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `q`, or `c`, but it introduces a new list `nums` based on the input.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5
- `q` is an input integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5
- `c` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9
- For each of the q queries, l_i and r_i are integers where 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n

After executing the code snippet:
- `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input, where each element is converted to an integer using `map(int, input().split(' '))`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `q` is an input integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5, `c` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9, for each of the q queries, l_i and r_i are integers where 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
