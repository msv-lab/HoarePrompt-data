Output State: **`onesInRange` is set to `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`, `sumInRange` remains `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`, `l` and `r` are updated to the integers provided by the user input, `_` is incremented by 1, and the loop will execute again if `_` is less than `q`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `q`, `c`, `nums`, `ones`, `sum`, `i`) remain unchanged. If `l` equals `r`, the current iteration of the loop ends immediately, and the next iteration begins.**
