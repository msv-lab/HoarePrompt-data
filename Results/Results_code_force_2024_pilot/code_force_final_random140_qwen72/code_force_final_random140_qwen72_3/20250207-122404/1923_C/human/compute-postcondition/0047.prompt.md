Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After the loop executes all iterations, `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` remains an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `q` remains an input integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5, `c` remains a list of n integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9, `nums` remains a list of integers obtained from the input, `ones` is a list of length n + 1 where `ones[i]` is the cumulative count of 1s in `nums` up to index `i-1`, `sum` is a list of length n + 1 where `sum[i]` is the cumulative sum of elements in `nums` up to index `i-1`, `i` is `n`, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(q):
    l, r = map(int, input().split(' '))
    if l == r:
        print('NO')
        continue
    onesInRange = ones[r] - ones[l - 1]
    sumInRange = sum[r] - sum[l - 1]
    if 2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `q` is an input integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5, `c` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `ones` is a list of length n + 1 where `ones[i]` is the cumulative count of 1s in `nums` up to index `i-1`, `sum` is a list of length n + 1 where `sum[i]` is the cumulative sum of elements in `nums` up to index `i-1`, `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `q` must be greater than 0, `l` and `r` are input integers, `onesInRange` is the number of 1s in the range from index `l-1` to `r-1` in the `nums` list, `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`. If `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange`, the condition holds true. Otherwise, `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange` is greater than `sumInRange`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`onesInRange` is set to `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`, `sumInRange` is set to `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`; all other variables (`t`, `n`, `q`, `c`, `nums`, `ones`, `sum`, `i`, `l`, `r`) remain unchanged. If `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange` is less than or equal to `sumInRange`, the condition holds true. Otherwise, the condition does not hold.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `onesInRange` is set to `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`, `sumInRange` is updated to `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`, `l` and `r` are updated to the integers provided by the user input, `_` is incremented by 1, and the loop will execute again if `_` is less than `q`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `q`, `c`, `nums`, `ones`, `sum`, `i`) remain unchanged. If `l` equals `r`, the current iteration of the loop ends immediately, and the next iteration begins. If `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange` is less than or equal to `sumInRange`, the same updates occur as described above.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
