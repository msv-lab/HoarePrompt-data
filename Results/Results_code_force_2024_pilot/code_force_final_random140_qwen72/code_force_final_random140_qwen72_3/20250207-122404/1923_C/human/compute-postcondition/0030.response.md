The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. Since there is no loop mentioned in the initial state, the `continue` statement would typically be used within a loop context. However, without a loop, the `continue` statement would cause an error if executed in isolation. Assuming this is part of a larger loop context, the `continue` statement will simply skip the rest of the current iteration.

Given that the `continue` statement does not change any variables or conditions, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except for the fact that the program control moves to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `q` is an input integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5, `c` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `ones` is a list of length n + 1 where `ones[i]` is the cumulative count of 1s in `nums` up to index `i-1`, `sum` is a list of length n + 1 where `sum[i]` is the cumulative sum of elements in `nums` up to index `i-1`, `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `q` must be greater than 1, `l` and `r` are input integers, `onesInRange` is the number of 1s in the range from index `l-1` to `r-1` in the `nums` list, `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`. If `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange`, the condition holds true. Otherwise, `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange` is greater than `sumInRange`. The program control moves to the next iteration of the loop.**
