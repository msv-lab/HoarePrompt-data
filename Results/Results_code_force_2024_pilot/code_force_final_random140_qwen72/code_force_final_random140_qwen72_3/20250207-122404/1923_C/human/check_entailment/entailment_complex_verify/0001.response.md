### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires determining if a subarray `c[l...r]` is "good" based on the criteria:
     1. The sum of elements in the subarray equals the sum of elements in another array `b` of the same length.
     2. No element in `c` should be equal to the corresponding element in `b`.
     3. All elements in `b` must be positive.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - If a subarray has only one element (`l == r`), it cannot be "good" because there is no way to create a different positive array `b` with the same sum.
   - For a subarray to be "good", we need to ensure that the sum of the subarray is at least twice the number of 1s in the subarray plus the number of non-1 elements. This is because each 1 in `c` must be replaced by a different positive number, and each non-1 element must also be replaced by a different positive number.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the number of queries `q`.
   - It then reads the array `nums` and initializes two prefix sum arrays: `ones` and `sum`.
     - `ones[i]` stores the count of 1s up to index `i-1`.
     - `sum[i]` stores the sum of elements up to index `i-1`.
   - For each query, it calculates the number of 1s and the sum of the subarray `c[l...r]`.
   - It checks if the subarray is "good" using the condition:
     - If `l == r`, it prints "NO".
     - Otherwise, it checks if `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange`. If true, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where the subarray has only one element.
   - The condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` ensures that the subarray can be transformed into a "good" array `b` by replacing each 1 with a different positive number and ensuring the sum remains the same.
   - The use of prefix sums allows efficient computation of the number of 1s and the sum of the subarray for each query.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem statement.

Final: **True**
