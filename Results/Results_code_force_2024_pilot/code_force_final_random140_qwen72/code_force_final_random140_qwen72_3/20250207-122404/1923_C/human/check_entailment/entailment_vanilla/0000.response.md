### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if a subarray \( c_{l_i}, c_{l_i+1}, \dots, c_{r_i} \) is "good."
   - A subarray is "good" if there exists another array \( b \) of the same length such that:
     1. The sum of elements in \( a \) equals the sum of elements in \( b \).
     2. No element in \( a \) is equal to the corresponding element in \( b \).
     3. All elements in \( b \) are positive.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - If the subarray has only one element (\( l_i = r_i \)), it cannot be "good" because \( a_i \) must be different from \( b_i \), but \( b_i \) must also be positive.
   - For a subarray to be "good," we need to ensure that the sum of the subarray can be split into two parts where each part is positive and different from the original elements.

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program uses prefix sums to efficiently calculate the sum of any subarray.
   - It also uses a prefix count array to count the number of 1s in any subarray.
   - For a subarray to be "good," the sum of the subarray must be at least twice the number of 1s plus the number of non-1s in the subarray. This ensures that we can always find a valid \( b \) array.

4. **Code Breakdown:**
   - **Input Handling:**
     - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case separately.
   - **Prefix Sum and Count Arrays:**
     - `ones` array keeps track of the cumulative count of 1s up to each index.
     - `sum` array keeps track of the cumulative sum of elements up to each index.
   - **Query Processing:**
     - For each query, it calculates the number of 1s and the sum in the subarray.
     - It checks if the subarray can be "good" using the condition \( 2 \times \text{onesInRange} + (r - l + 1) - \text{onesInRange} \leq \text{sumInRange} \).

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where the subarray has only one element.
   - It also correctly handles the case where the subarray has multiple elements and checks the condition for being "good."

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is "good" based on the given conditions. It efficiently uses prefix sums and counts to handle the queries within the constraints.

**Correctness: True**
