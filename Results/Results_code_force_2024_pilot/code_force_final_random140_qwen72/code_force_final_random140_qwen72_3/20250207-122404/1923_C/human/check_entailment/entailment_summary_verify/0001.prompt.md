You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

testCases = int(input())
for i in range(testCases):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, q) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    nums = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    ones = [0 for i in range(n + 1)]
    sum = [0 for i in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        ones[i] = ones[i - 1] + (1 if nums[i - 1] == 1 else 0)
        sum[i] = sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1]
    for _ in range(q):
        (l, r) = map(int, input().split(' '))
        if l == r:
            print('NO')
            continue
        onesInRange = ones[r] - ones[l - 1]
        sumInRange = sum[r] - sum[l - 1]
        if 2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads the length of a list `n` and the number of queries `q`. It then reads a list of integers `nums` of length `n`. The function calculates two auxiliary lists: `ones`, which stores the cumulative count of 1s in `nums` up to each index, and `sum`, which stores the cumulative sum of elements in `nums` up to each index. For each of the `q` queries, it reads a range `[l, r]` and checks if the condition \(2 \times \text{onesInRange} + (r - l + 1) - \text{onesInRange} \leq \text{sumInRange}\) holds, where `onesInRange` and `sumInRange` are the counts of 1s and the sum of elements in the range `[l, r]` respectively. If the condition is true, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all queries, the function completes without returning any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to determine if a subarray `c[l...r]` is "good" based on the criteria:
     1. The sum of elements in the subarray equals the sum of elements in another array `b` of the same length.
     2. No element in `c` should be equal to the corresponding element in `b`.
     3. All elements in `b` must be positive.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - If a subarray has only one element (`l == r`), it cannot be "good" because there is no way to create a different positive array `b` with the same sum.
   - For a subarray to be "good", we need to ensure that the sum of the subarray is at least twice the number of 1s in the subarray plus the number of non-1 elements. This is because each 1 in `c` must be replaced by a different positive number, and each non-1 element must also be replaced by a different positive number.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the number of queries `q`.
   - It then reads the array `nums` and initializes two prefix sum arrays: `ones` and `sum`.
     - `ones[i]` stores the count of 1s up to index `i-1`.
     - `sum[i]` stores the sum of elements up to index `i-1`.
   - For each query, it calculates the number of 1s and the sum of the subarray `c[l...r]`.
   - It checks if the subarray is "good" using the condition:
     - If `l == r`, it prints "NO".
     - Otherwise, it checks if `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange`. If true, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where the subarray has only one element.
   - The condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` ensures that the subarray can be transformed into a "good" array `b` by replacing each 1 with a different positive number and ensuring the sum remains the same.
   - The use of prefix sums allows efficient computation of the number of 1s and the sum of the subarray for each query.

The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem statement.
