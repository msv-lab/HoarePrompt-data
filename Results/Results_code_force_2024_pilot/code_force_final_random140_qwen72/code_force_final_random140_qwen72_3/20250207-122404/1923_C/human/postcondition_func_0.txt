The function `func_1` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads the length of a list `n` and the number of queries `q`. It then reads a list of integers `nums` of length `n`. The function calculates two auxiliary lists: `ones`, which stores the cumulative count of 1s in `nums` up to each index, and `sum`, which stores the cumulative sum of elements in `nums` up to each index. For each of the `q` queries, it reads a range `[l, r]` and checks if the condition \(2 \times \text{onesInRange} + (r - l + 1) - \text{onesInRange} \leq \text{sumInRange}\) holds, where `onesInRange` and `sumInRange` are the counts of 1s and the sum of elements in the range `[l, r]` respectively. If the condition is true, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all queries, the function completes without returning any value.
