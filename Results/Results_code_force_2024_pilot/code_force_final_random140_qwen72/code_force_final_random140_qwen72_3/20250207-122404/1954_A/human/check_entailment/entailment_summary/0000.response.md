Reasoning:

To determine if the program is correct, we need to verify if it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. The key points to consider are:

1. **Test Case Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Input Parsing**: For each test case, the program reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` which represent the number of parts, the number of colors, and the number of parts Bob can repaint, respectively.
3. **Logic for Determining Output**:
   - The program checks two conditions:
     - `n <= k`: If the number of parts `n` is less than or equal to the number of parts Bob can repaint `k`, then Bob can always repaint all parts to the same color. Hence, the answer should be 'NO'.
     - `n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k`: This condition checks if the number of parts that need to be repainted to make all parts the same color is within the limit `k`. The expression `math.ceil(n / m)` calculates the minimum number of parts that must be the same color to ensure that Bob cannot make all parts the same color. If the difference between `n` and this value is less than or equal to `k`, then Bob can still achieve his goal, and the answer should be 'NO'.

Let's analyze the logic with the provided examples:

- **Example 1**: `n = 1, m = 1, k = 1`
  - `n <= k` is true (1 <= 1), so the answer is 'NO'.
- **Example 2**: `n = 5, m = 1, k = 1`
  - `n <= k` is false (5 > 1).
  - `n - math.ceil(n / m) = 5 - math.ceil(5 / 1) = 5 - 5 = 0 <= k` is true (0 <= 1), so the answer is 'NO'.
- **Example 3**: `n = 5, m = 2, k = 1`
  - `n <= k` is false (5 > 1).
  - `n - math.ceil(n / m) = 5 - math.ceil(5 / 2) = 5 - 3 = 2 > k` is true (2 > 1), so the answer is 'YES'.
- **Example 4**: `n = 5, m = 2, k = 2`
  - `n <= k` is false (5 > 2).
  - `n - math.ceil(n / m) = 5 - math.ceil(5 / 2) = 5 - 3 = 2 <= k` is true (2 <= 2), so the answer is 'NO'.
- **Example 5**: `n = 5, m = 5, k = 3`
  - `n <= k` is false (5 > 3).
  - `n - math.ceil(n / m) = 5 - math.ceil(5 / 5) = 5 - 1 = 4 > k` is true (4 > 3), so the answer is 'YES'.

The program correctly handles all these cases and produces the expected output.

Therefore, the program is correct.
