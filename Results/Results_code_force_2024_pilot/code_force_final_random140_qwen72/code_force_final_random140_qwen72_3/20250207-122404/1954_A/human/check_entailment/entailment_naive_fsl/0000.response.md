Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the program works:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.

2. **Condition Checking**:
   - The condition `if n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k:` checks two scenarios:
     - **`n <= k`**: If the number of parts `n` is less than or equal to the number of parts Bob can repaint `k`, then Bob can always repaint all parts to the same color. Hence, Alice cannot prevent this, and the output should be 'NO'.
     - **`n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k`**: This condition ensures that if the number of distinct colors used by Alice is such that Bob can still repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color, then the output should be 'NO'. Specifically, `math.ceil(n / m)` calculates the minimum number of parts that must be different to ensure Bob cannot repaint all parts to the same color. If the remaining parts after this calculation are less than or equal to `k`, Bob can still achieve his goal.

3. **Output**: The program prints 'NO' if either of the above conditions is true, and 'Yes' otherwise.

The logic in the program correctly handles all edge cases and potential inputs within the constraints provided in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
