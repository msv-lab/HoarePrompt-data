Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the program, we need to verify if the logic implemented matches the problem requirements and handles all edge cases correctly.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n`, `m`, and `k`.

2. **Logic for Determining Output**:
   - The condition `if n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k:` is used to determine if Alice can paint the ribbon such that Bob cannot make all parts the same color.
   - **Case 1**: `n <= k`
     - If `n` is less than or equal to `k`, Bob can repaint all parts of the ribbon, making it possible for him to achieve his goal. Therefore, the output should be 'NO'.
   - **Case 2**: `n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k`
     - This condition checks if the number of distinct colors Alice can use (which is at least `math.ceil(n / m)`) is such that Bob can still repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color. If `n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k`, Bob can repaint the necessary parts to achieve his goal, so the output should be 'NO'.
   - If neither condition is met, Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color, so the output should be 'YES'.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge cases where `n` is very small (e.g., `n = 1`).
   - It also handles cases where `m` or `k` are at their minimum or maximum values within the constraints.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The program outputs 'NO' or 'Yes' for each test case, which matches the problem's requirement. Note that the problem statement allows for different capitalizations of 'Yes' and 'No', so 'Yes' is acceptable.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem and handle all specified cases.

Correctness: **True**
