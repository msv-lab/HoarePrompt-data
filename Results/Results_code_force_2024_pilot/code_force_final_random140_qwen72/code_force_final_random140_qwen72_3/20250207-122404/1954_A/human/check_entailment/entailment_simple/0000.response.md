Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether it correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis:
- **Objective**: Determine if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.
- **Constraints**:
  - \(1 \le t \le 1000\) (number of test cases)
  - \(1 \le m, k \le n \le 50\) (number of parts, colors, and repaints)

### Key Conditions:
1. **If \( n \le k \)**: 
   - If the number of parts \( n \) is less than or equal to the number of parts Bob can repaint \( k \), Bob can always repaint all parts to the same color. Therefore, the answer is "NO".
2. **If \( n - \left\lceil \frac{n}{m} \right\rceil \le k \)**:
   - This condition checks if the number of parts that are not the most frequent color is less than or equal to \( k \). If this is true, Bob can repaint those parts to the most frequent color, making all parts the same color. Therefore, the answer is "NO".
3. **Otherwise**:
   - If neither of the above conditions is true, Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color. Therefore, the answer is "YES".

### Program Analysis:
- The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
- For each test case, it reads \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \).
- It then checks the two key conditions:
  - If \( n \le k \) or \( n - \left\lceil \frac{n}{m} \right\rceil \le k \), it prints "NO".
  - Otherwise, it prints "Yes".

### Verification:
- The program correctly implements the logic for the conditions.
- The use of `math.ceil` ensures that the ceiling function is applied correctly.
- The output format matches the problem requirements (case-insensitive "YES" or "NO").

### Conclusion:
The program correctly solves the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
