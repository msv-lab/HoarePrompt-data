Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `itest` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the third integer from the input, and either `n` is less than or equal to `k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is less than or equal to `k`.**
