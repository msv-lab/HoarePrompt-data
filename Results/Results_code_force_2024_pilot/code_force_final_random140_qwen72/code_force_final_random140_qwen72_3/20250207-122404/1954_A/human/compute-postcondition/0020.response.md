Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, where `1 ≤ t ≤ 1000`. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` (where `1 ≤ m, k ≤ n ≤ 50`). It then checks if `n` is less than or equal to `k` or if `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is less than or equal to `k`. If either condition is true, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the program state is unchanged except for the output produced. **
