The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `itest` is 2.
- `n` is the first integer from the new input.
- `m` is the second integer from the new input.
- `k` is the third integer from the new input.

None of these variables are used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output of the code snippet is:
Output: **NO**
