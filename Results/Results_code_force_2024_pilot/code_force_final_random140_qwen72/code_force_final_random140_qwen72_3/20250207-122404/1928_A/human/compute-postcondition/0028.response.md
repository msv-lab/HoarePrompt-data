Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `n` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input. It then checks the following conditions for each pair of `a` and `b`: if both `a` and `b` are odd, it prints 'NO'; if `a / 2 == b` and `b` is odd, or if `b / 2 == a` and `a` is odd, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. After processing all `n` test cases, the function completes without returning any value. The final state of the program is that `n` test cases have been processed, and the appropriate 'YES' or 'NO' output has been printed for each test case. **
