Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, a and b are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9; n is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    a, b = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
        print('NO')
    elif a / 2 == b and b % 2 != 0 or b / 2 == a and a % 2 != 0:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` and `b` are integers read from the input, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` is 0. If both `a` and `b` are odd, the condition is met. If at least one of `a` or `b` is even, the condition is met if `a / 2 == b` and `b` is odd, or if `b / 2 == a` and `a` is odd. Otherwise, the condition is not met if either `a / 2` is not equal to `b` or `b` is even, and either `b / 2` is not equal to `a` or `a` is even.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` and `b` are integers read from the input, `n` must be greater than 1, and `i` is 1. If both `a` and `b` are odd, the values of `a`, `b`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged. If either `a` or `b` is even, and if `a / 2 == b` and `b % 2 != 0` or `(b / 2 == a` and `a % 2 != 0), the values of `a`, `b`, `n`, and `i` also remain unchanged. Otherwise, the values of `a`, `b`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` and `b` are integers read from the input, `n` must be greater than 2, and `i` is 2. If `a % 2 != 0` and `b % 2 != 0`, the condition is met. Otherwise, if `a / 2 == b` and `b % 2 != 0` or (`b / 2 == a` and `a % 2 != 0`), the condition is met. If none of these conditions are met, the condition is not met.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
