Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` and `b` are integers read from the input, `n` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations executed, and `i` is `n - 1`. For each iteration, if both `a` and `b` are odd, the output is 'NO'. If `a / 2 == b` and `b` is odd, or if `b / 2 == a` and `a` is odd, the output is 'NO'. Otherwise, the output is 'YES'. The values of `a` and `b` are updated with new inputs for each iteration, and the final value of `i` is `n - 1`.**

This means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n - 1`, indicating that the loop has run `n` times. The values of `a` and `b` will have been updated with new inputs for each iteration, and the output for each iteration will depend on whether the conditions specified in the loop are met. The total number of iterations is determined by the value of `n`, which must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations executed. The initial value of `t` and the constraints on `a` and `b` remain unchanged throughout the loop's execution.
