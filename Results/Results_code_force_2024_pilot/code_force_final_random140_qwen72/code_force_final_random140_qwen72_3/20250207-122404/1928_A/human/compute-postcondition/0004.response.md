Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `a` and `b` are integers read from the input.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- Both `a` and `b` are odd integers.

The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement:

```python
print('NO')
```

This statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **NO**
