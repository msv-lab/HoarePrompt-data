Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` and `b` are integers read from the input, `n` must be greater than 1, and `i` is 1. If `a / 2 == b` and `b % 2 != 0` or `(b / 2 == a` and `a % 2 != 0), the values of `a`, `b`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged. Otherwise, the values of `a`, `b`, `n`, and `i` also remain unchanged.***
