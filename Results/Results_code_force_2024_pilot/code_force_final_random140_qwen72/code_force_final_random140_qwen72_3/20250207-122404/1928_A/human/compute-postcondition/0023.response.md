The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `n`, and `i`) but does not influence the content of the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is solely determined by the string literal within it.

Output: **YES**
