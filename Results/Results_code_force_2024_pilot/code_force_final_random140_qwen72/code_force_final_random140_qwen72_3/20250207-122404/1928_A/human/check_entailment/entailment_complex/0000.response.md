Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem of determining whether a rectangle of dimensions \(a \times b\) can be cut into two smaller rectangles, which can then be rearranged to form a new rectangle that is not identical to the original (considering rotations).

### Key Points:
1. **Odd Dimensions**: If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, the rectangle cannot be cut into two smaller rectangles with integer sides. Therefore, it is impossible to form a new rectangle, and the output should be "NO".
2. **Special Cases**: If one dimension is exactly half of the other and the other dimension is odd, the resulting smaller rectangles will be squares, and they cannot form a new rectangle that is different from the original. For example, if \(a = 2\) and \(b = 1\), cutting the rectangle results in two \(1 \times 1\) squares, which can only form a \(1 \times 2\) rectangle, which is the same as the original when considering rotations. Similarly, if \(a = 3\) and \(b = 6\), cutting the rectangle results in two \(3 \times 3\) squares, which can only form a \(3 \times 6\) rectangle, which is the same as the original.
3. **General Case**: If neither of the above conditions is met, it is possible to form a new rectangle. For example, if \(a = 2\) and \(b = 6\), cutting the rectangle results in two \(2 \times 3\) rectangles, which can be rearranged to form a \(4 \times 3\) rectangle, which is different from the original.

### Analysis of the Program:
- **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases \(n\) and processes each test case by reading the dimensions \(a\) and \(b\).
- **Condition Checking**:
  - The first condition checks if both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd. If true, it prints "NO".
  - The second condition checks if \(a / 2 == b\) and \(b\) is odd, or if \(b / 2 == a\) and \(a\) is odd. If true, it prints "NO".
  - If neither of the above conditions is true, it prints "YES".

### Edge Cases:
- The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when both dimensions are odd or when one dimension is exactly half of the other and the other dimension is odd.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a new rectangle can be formed from the given dimensions \(a\) and \(b\). The conditions and logic are sound and cover all necessary cases.

Correctness: **True**
