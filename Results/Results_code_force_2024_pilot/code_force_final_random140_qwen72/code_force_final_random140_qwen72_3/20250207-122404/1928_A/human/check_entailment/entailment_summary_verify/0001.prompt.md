You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bob has a rectangle of size a \times b . He tries to cut this rectangle into
two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides
of the original rectangle. Then Bob tries to form some other rectangle from
the two resulting rectangles, and he can rotate and move these two rectangles
as he wishes.

Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90^{\circ} rotation, they are
considered the same. For example, the rectangles 6 \times 4 and 4 \times 6 are
considered the same.

Thus, from the 2 \times 6 rectangle, another rectangle can be formed, because
it can be cut into two 2 \times 3 rectangles, and then these two rectangles
can be used to form the 4 \times 3 rectangle, which is different from the 2
\times 6 rectangle.

However, from the 2 \times 1 rectangle, another rectangle cannot be formed,
because it can only be cut into two rectangles of 1 \times 1 , and from these,
only the 1 \times 2 and 2 \times 1 rectangles can be formed, which are
considered the same.

Help Bob determine if he can obtain some other rectangle, or if he is just
wasting his time.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed
by the description of the test cases.

The single line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le a, b
\le 10^9 ) — the size of Bob's rectangle.

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the
a \times b rectangle. Otherwise, output "No".

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive answers.

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 1
    
    2 1
    
    2 6
    
    3 2
    
    2 2
    
    2 4
    
    6 3

Output

    No
    No
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    No
    
Note

In the first test case, the 1 \times 1 rectangle cannot be cut into two
rectangles, so another rectangle cannot be obtained from it.

In the fourth test case, the 3 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 3 \times
1 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 6 rectangle can be formed.

In the fifth test case, the 2 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 1 \times
2 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 4 rectangle can be formed.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif a / 2 == b and b % 2 != 0 or (b / 2 == a and a % 2 != 0):
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `n` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input. It then checks the following conditions for each pair of `a` and `b`: if both `a` and `b` are odd, it prints 'NO'; if `a / 2 == b` and `b` is odd, or if `b / 2 == a` and `a` is odd, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. After processing all `n` test cases, the function completes without returning any value. The final state of the program is that `n` test cases have been processed, and the appropriate 'YES' or 'NO' output has been printed for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if a rectangle of size \(a \times b\) can be cut into two smaller rectangles and then recombined to form a new rectangle that is different from the original.
   - The key condition is that the new rectangle must not be a 90-degree rotation of the original rectangle.

2. **Conditions for Forming a New Rectangle:**
   - If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, it is impossible to cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides, and thus no new rectangle can be formed.
   - If one of \(a\) or \(b\) is even, we can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides.
   - However, we need to ensure that the new rectangle formed is not a 90-degree rotation of the original rectangle.

3. **Checking the Conditions in the Code:**
   - The code first checks if both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd (`if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0`). If true, it prints 'NO' because no new rectangle can be formed.
   - Next, it checks if cutting the rectangle results in a new rectangle that is a 90-degree rotation of the original. Specifically, it checks if \(a / 2 == b\) and \(b\) is odd, or if \(b / 2 == a\) and \(a\) is odd. If either condition is true, it prints 'NO'.
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints 'YES'.

4. **Verification of the Conditions:**
   - The first condition correctly identifies when both dimensions are odd, ensuring no new rectangle can be formed.
   - The second condition correctly identifies when the new rectangle would be a 90-degree rotation of the original, ensuring that such cases are excluded.
   - The third condition ensures that all other cases where a new rectangle can be formed are correctly identified.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a new rectangle can be formed from the given \(a \times b\) rectangle. Therefore, the program is correct.
