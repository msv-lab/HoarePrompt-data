Reasoning:

1. **Odd Dimensions Check**: If both dimensions `a` and `b` are odd, it is impossible to cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides, as any cut would result in at least one dimension being non-integer. Therefore, the condition `if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:` correctly identifies such cases and outputs 'NO'.

2. **Special Case Check**: The condition `elif a / 2 == b and b % 2 != 0 or (b / 2 == a and a % 2 != 0):` handles a special case where one dimension is exactly half of the other, but the other dimension is odd. In such cases, cutting the rectangle results in two smaller rectangles that can only form the original rectangle or its 90-degree rotation, which are considered the same. Thus, the output 'NO' is correct for these cases.

3. **General Case**: If neither of the above conditions is met, the program outputs 'YES'. This covers all other cases where it is possible to cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and form a new rectangle that is not the same as the original or its 90-degree rotation.

4. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and processes each test case by reading the dimensions `a` and `b`.

5. **Output Format**: The program outputs 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case, which matches the required output format.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to handle all specified cases correctly and produces the expected output.

Correctness: **True**
