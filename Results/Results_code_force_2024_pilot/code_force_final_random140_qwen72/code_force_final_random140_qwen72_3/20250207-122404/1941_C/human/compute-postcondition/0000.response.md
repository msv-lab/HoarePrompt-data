The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder for the loop counter. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`.

For the loop to execute, the input must be a positive integer, as this will determine the number of iterations. Since `t` represents the number of test cases and is given as an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, the input should be equal to `t` for the loop to execute the correct number of times.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the input is a positive integer and that it equals `t`.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the input is a positive integer equal to `t`**
