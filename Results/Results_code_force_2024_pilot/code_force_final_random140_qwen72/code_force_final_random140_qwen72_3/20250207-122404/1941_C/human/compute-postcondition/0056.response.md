Postcondition: ***`t` remains an integer where \(100 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is the string representation of the new input and must have a length greater than 2, `s` is the substring of `a` starting from index `i` and having a length of 3. If `s` is 'map' or 'pie', `i` is now either 5, 7, or 9, and `ans` is either 1, 2, or 3. Otherwise, `i` is either 3, 5, or 7, and `ans` is either 0, 1, or 2.***
