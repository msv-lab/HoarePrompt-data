The code snippet `s = a[i:i + 3]` updates the value of `s` to be a substring of `a` starting from the index `i` (which is 2) and spanning the next 3 characters. Given that `a` is a string representation of the integer `t` and has a length of 5, the substring `s` will consist of the characters from index 2 to index 4 of `a`.

Therefore, the updated value of `s` is the substring of `a` from the third character to the fifth character.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where \(100 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is a string representation of the positive integer `t` with `len(a) = 5`, `s` is the substring of `a` from the third character to the fifth character, and `i` is 2.**
