Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, representing the length of the string s, and s is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    a = input()
    ans = 0
    i = 0
    while i < len(a) - 2:
        s = a[i:i + 3]
        print(s)
        if s == 'map' or s == 'pie':
            i += 3
            ans += 1
        else:
            i += 1
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After the loop has executed all iterations, `t` remains an integer where \(100 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is the string representation of `t`, `i` is equal to the length of `a` (since the loop exits when `i` is no longer less than `len(a) - 2`), and `ans` is the total count of occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' found in `a` during the loop's execution.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` remains an integer where \(100 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is the string representation of the new input, `i` is equal to the length of `a` minus 2 (or greater, if the last few characters do not form a valid 3-character substring), and `ans` is the total number of occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` remains an integer where \(100 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is the same string, `i` is equal to the length of `a` minus 2 or more (indicating the loop has completed its iterations), and `ans` is the total count of occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in `a` that were found during the loop's execution.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
