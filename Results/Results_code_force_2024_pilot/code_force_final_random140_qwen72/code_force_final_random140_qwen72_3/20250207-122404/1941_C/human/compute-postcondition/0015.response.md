The code snippet updates the value of `s` to be the substring of `a` starting from index `i` (which is 1) and spanning the next 3 characters.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where \(100 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `a` is a string representation of the positive integer `t`
- `s` is the first 3 characters of `a`
- If `s` is 'map' or 'pie', `ans` is 1 and `i` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `i` is 1.

After executing the code:
- `s` is now the substring of `a` starting from index 1 and spanning the next 3 characters.

Since `i` is 1, `s` will now be the substring of `a` starting from the second character and spanning the next 3 characters.

The values of `t`, `a`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where \(100 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is a string representation of the positive integer `t`, `s` is the substring of `a` starting from the second character and spanning the next 3 characters, if `s` is 'map' or 'pie', `ans` is 1 and `i` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `i` is 1.**
