To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition:

```python
while i < len(a) - 2:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `len(a) - 2`.

### Current State:
- `t` remains an integer where \(100 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `a` is the string representation of the new input and must have a length greater than 2
- `s` is the first three characters of `a`
- If `s` is 'map' or 'pie', `i` is 3 and `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `i` is 1 and `ans` is 0.

### Analysis:
- The loop condition depends on `i` and `len(a)`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(a) - 2`.

### Adjustments:
- `i` is already defined based on the value of `s`.
- `len(a)` must be greater than `i + 2` for the loop to execute one more time.

### Conclusion:
- Since `a` must have a length greater than 2, and `i` is either 1 or 3, we need to ensure that `len(a)` is at least 4 (if `i` is 1) or 6 (if `i` is 3).

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `len(a)` is at least 4 if `i` is 1, or at least 6 if `i` is 3.

### Final State:
State: **`t` remains an integer where \(100 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is the string representation of the new input and must have a length greater than 2, `s` is the first three characters of `a`. If `s` is 'map' or 'pie', `i` is 3 and `ans` is 1, and `len(a)` must be greater than 5. Otherwise, `i` is 1 and `ans` is 0, and `len(a)` must be greater than 3.**
