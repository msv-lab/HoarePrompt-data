Output State: **`t` remains an integer where \(100 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is the same string, `s` is the substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`, `i` is now either 4 or 2, and `ans` remains the same (either 1 or 0).** 

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1. If `i` was initially 3, it is now 4. If `i` was initially 1, it is now 2. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `s`, and `ans`) remain unchanged. The substring `s` is still defined as the substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`, but the actual substring will change based on the new value of `i`.
