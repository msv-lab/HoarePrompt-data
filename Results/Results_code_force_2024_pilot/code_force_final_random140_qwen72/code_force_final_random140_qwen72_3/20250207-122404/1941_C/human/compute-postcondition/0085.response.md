Postcondition: ***`t` remains an integer where \(100 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is the same string and `len(a)` must be greater than 6, `s` is the substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`. If `s` is 'map' or 's' is 'pie', `i` is updated to either 7 or 5, and `ans` is updated to either 3, 2, or 1. Otherwise, `i` is updated to either 5 or 3, and `ans` remains either 2, 1, or 0.***
