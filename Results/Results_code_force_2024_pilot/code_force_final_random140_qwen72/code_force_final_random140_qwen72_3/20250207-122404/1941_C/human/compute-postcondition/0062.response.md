Output State: **`t` remains an integer where \(100 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is the string representation of the new input, `i` is 0, and `ans` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` is set to 0, overriding its previous value which was the length of the new input minus 2 (or greater).
- The values of `t`, `a`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
- `t` remains an integer within the range \(100 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `a` remains the string representation of the new input.
- `ans` remains 0.
