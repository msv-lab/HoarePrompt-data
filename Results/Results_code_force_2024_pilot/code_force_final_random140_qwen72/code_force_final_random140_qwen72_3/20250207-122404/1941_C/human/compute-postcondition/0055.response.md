Output State: **`t` remains an integer where \(100 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is the string representation of the new input and must have a length greater than 2, `s` is the substring of `a` starting from index `i` and having a length of 3, `i` is either 3, 5, or 7, and `ans` is either 0, 1, or 2.** 

The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so if `i` was 2, it is now 3; if `i` was 4, it is now 5; and if `i` was 6, it is now 7. All other variables remain unchanged.
