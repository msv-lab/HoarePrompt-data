To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the given program state and the `while` loop condition:

### Program State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `a` is a string representation of the positive integer `t`
- `ans` is 0
- `i` is 0

### Loop Condition:
```python
while i < len(a) - 2:
```

### Analysis:
- The loop will execute if the condition `i < len(a) - 2` is true.
- `i` is 0, so the condition simplifies to `0 < len(a) - 2`.
- For the loop to execute, `len(a) - 2` must be greater than 0, which means `len(a) > 2`.

### Adjusting the State:
- The length of `a` (which is the string representation of `t`) must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute.
- Since `a` is a string representation of `t`, `t` must be a number whose string representation has more than 2 characters.

### Conclusion:
- The smallest integer `t` that has a string representation of more than 2 characters is 100 (since "100" has 3 characters).
- Therefore, `t` must be at least 100 for the loop to execute.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer where \(100 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is a string representation of the positive integer `t`, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0**
