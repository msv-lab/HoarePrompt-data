The code snippet updates the value of `s` to be the substring of `a` starting from index `i` and spanning 3 characters.

- Initially, `t` is an integer within the range \(100 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `a` is the string representation of `t`.
- `s` is the first 3 characters of `a`.
- If `s` is 'map' or 'pie', `ans` is 1 and `i` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `i` is 1.

After executing the code:
- `s` is updated to the substring of `a` starting from index `i` (which is 1) and spanning 3 characters.
- The value of `t`, `a`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is an integer where \(100 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is a string representation of the positive integer `t`, `s` is the substring of `a` starting from index 1 and spanning 3 characters, if `s` is 'map' or 'pie', `ans` is 1 and `i` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `i` is 1.**
