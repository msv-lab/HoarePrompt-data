Postcondition: ***`t` remains an integer where \(100 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is the string representation of the new input and must have a length greater than 2, `s` is the first three characters of `a`. If `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', then `i` is 3 and `ans` is 1. Otherwise, if `s` is neither 'map' nor 'pie', then `i` is 1 and `ans` is 0.***
