To determine what will be printed by the `print(s)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant variables:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where \(100 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This value is not directly used in the `print(s)` statement.
   - `a` is a string. The exact content of `a` is not specified, but it is consistent throughout the context.
   - `s` is a substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`.
   - `i` is either 3 or 1.
   - `ans` is either 1 or 0. This value is not directly used in the `print(s)` statement.

2. **Determine the Substring `s`:**
   - The substring `s` is defined as `a[i:i+3]`.
   - Depending on the value of `i`, the substring `s` will be different:
     - If `i = 1`, then `s` will be the substring of `a` starting at index 1 and ending at index 3 (inclusive).
     - If `i = 3`, then `s` will be the substring of `a` starting at index 3 and ending at index 6 (inclusive).

3. **Possible Values of `s`:**
   - Since `a` is not explicitly defined, we cannot determine the exact characters in `s` without knowing the content of `a`.
   - However, we can describe `s` based on the given indices.

Given the initial state and the definition of `s`, the output will be the substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`.

Output: **s (where s is the substring of a from index i to i + 3, and i is either 3 or 1)**
