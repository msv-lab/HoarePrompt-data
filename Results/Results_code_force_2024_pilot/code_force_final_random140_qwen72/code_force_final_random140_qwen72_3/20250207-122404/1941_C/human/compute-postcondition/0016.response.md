Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where \(100 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `a` is a string representation of the positive integer `t`.
   - `s` is the substring of `a` starting from the second character and spanning the next 3 characters.
   - If `s` is 'map' or 'pie', `ans` is 1 and `i` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `i` is 1.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(s)
   ```

3. **Determine the Value of `s`:**
   - Since `a` is the string representation of `t`, and `t` is an integer between 100 and 10,000, `a` will be a string with a length of at least 3 characters.
   - `s` is the substring of `a` starting from the second character and spanning the next 3 characters. This means `s` will be the characters at indices 1, 2, and 3 of the string `a`.

4. **Possible Values of `s`:**
   - The value of `s` depends on the specific value of `t`.
   - For example, if `t = 1234`, then `a = "1234"` and `s = "234"`.
   - If `t = 1000`, then `a = "1000"` and `s = "000"`.
   - If `t = 12345`, then `a = "12345"` and `s = "234"`.
   - The exact value of `s` cannot be determined without knowing the specific value of `t`, but it will always be a substring of `a` starting from the second character and spanning the next 3 characters.

5. **Output:**
   - The `print(s)` statement will print the substring `s` of the string `a` starting from the second character and spanning the next 3 characters.
   - Since the exact value of `t` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `s`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the substring `s`.

Output: **s (where s is the substring of a starting from the second character and spanning the next 3 characters)**
