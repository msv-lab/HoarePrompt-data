Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a string `s` and counts the occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' within `s`. It prints the count for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but the state includes `t` remaining an integer within the range [1, 10^4], `a` being the last input string, `i` being the length of `a`, and `ans` being the count of 'map' or 'pie' substrings found in `a` for the last test case. **
