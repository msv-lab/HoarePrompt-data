Output State: **`t` is an integer where \(100 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is a string representation of the positive integer `t`, `s` is the substring of `a` starting from the second character and spanning the next 3 characters, if `s` is 'map' or 'pie', `ans` is 1 and `i` is 2. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `i` is 2.** 

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. All other variables (`t`, `a`, `s`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.
