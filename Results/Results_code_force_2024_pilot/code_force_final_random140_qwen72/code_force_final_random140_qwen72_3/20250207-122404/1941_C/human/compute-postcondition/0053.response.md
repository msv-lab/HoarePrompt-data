The value of `i` is incremented by 3. Since `i` was initially either 2, 4, or 6, after the increment, `i` will be either 5, 7, or 9. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `s`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` remains an integer where \(100 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is the string representation of the new input and must have a length greater than 2, `s` is the substring of `a` starting from index `i` and having a length of 3, `i` is now either 5, 7, or 9, and `ans` is either 0, 1, or 2.**
