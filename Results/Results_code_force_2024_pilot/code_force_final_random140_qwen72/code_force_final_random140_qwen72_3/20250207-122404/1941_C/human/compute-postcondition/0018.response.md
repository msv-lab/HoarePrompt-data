The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `ans` was 1 if `s` is 'map' or 'pie', and 0 otherwise. After incrementing, `ans` will be 2 if `s` is 'map' or 'pie', and 1 otherwise. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where \(100 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is a string representation of the positive integer `t`, `s` is the substring of `a` starting from the second character and spanning the next 3 characters, if `s` is 'map' or 'pie', `ans` is 2; otherwise, `ans` is 1, `i` is 4.**
