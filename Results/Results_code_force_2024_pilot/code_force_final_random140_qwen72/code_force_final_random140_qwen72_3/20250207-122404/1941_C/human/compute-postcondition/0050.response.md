To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition and the current state:

### Loop Condition:
```python
while i < len(a) - 2:
```
This condition checks if the index `i` is less than the length of the string `a` minus 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(a) - 2`.

### Current State:
- `t` remains an integer where \(100 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `a` is the string representation of the new input and must have a length greater than 2.
- `s` is the substring of `a` starting from index `i` and having a length of 3.
- If `s` is 'map' or 's` is 'pie', `i` is either 4 or 6, and `ans` is now 1 or 2.
- Otherwise, `i` is either 2 or 4 depending on the initial conditions, `ans` is either 0 or 1 depending on the initial conditions, and `len(a)` must be greater than 5 if `i` is 4 or greater than 3 if `i` is 2.

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`**: The loop condition depends on `i` and `len(a)`. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `i` must be less than `len(a) - 2`.
2. **Variable `len(a)`**: The length of `a` must be such that `i < len(a) - 2` holds true.

### Adjustments:
- If `i` is 4, then `len(a)` must be greater than 6 (since `4 < len(a) - 2` implies `len(a) > 6`).
- If `i` is 6, then `len(a)` must be greater than 8 (since `6 < len(a) - 2` implies `len(a) > 8`).
- If `i` is 2, then `len(a)` must be greater than 4 (since `2 < len(a) - 2` implies `len(a) > 4`).

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state of `len(a)` based on the current value of `i`.

State: **`t` remains an integer where \(100 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is the string representation of the new input and must have a length greater than 2, `s` is the substring of `a` starting from index `i` and having a length of 3. If `s` is 'map' or 's` is 'pie', `i` is either 4 or 6, and `ans` is now 1 or 2. Otherwise, `i` is either 2 or 4 depending on the initial conditions, `ans` is either 0 or 1 depending on the initial conditions, and `len(a)` must be greater than 6 if `i` is 4, greater than 8 if `i` is 6, or greater than 4 if `i` is 2.**
