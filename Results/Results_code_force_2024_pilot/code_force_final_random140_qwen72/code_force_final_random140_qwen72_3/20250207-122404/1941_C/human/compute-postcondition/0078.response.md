Postcondition: ***`t` remains an integer where \(100 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is the same string, `s` is the substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`, `i` is now either 4 or 2, and `ans` is either 2, 1, or 0. If `s` is 'map' or 'pie', `i` is set to 4 and `ans` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `i` is set to 2 and `ans` remains unchanged.***
