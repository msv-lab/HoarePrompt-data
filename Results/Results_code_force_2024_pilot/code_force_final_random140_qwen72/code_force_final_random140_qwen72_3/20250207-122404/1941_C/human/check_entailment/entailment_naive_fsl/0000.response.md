Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the program increments `i` by 3 when it finds a substring "map" or "pie", which means it skips over the next two characters without checking them. This can lead to incorrect results in cases where the string contains overlapping occurrences of "map" or "pie".

For example, consider the string "mappie". The program will:

1. Find "map" at index 0, increment `i` by 3, and set `ans` to 1.
2. Skip the next two characters ("pp") and move to index 3.
3. Find "pie" at index 3, increment `i` by 3, and set `ans` to 2.
4. The final output will be 2.

However, the correct output should be 3 because the string "mappie" can be made beautiful by removing 3 characters (either "map" or "pie" and one additional character).

Thus, the program does not handle overlapping substrings correctly, leading to incorrect results.
