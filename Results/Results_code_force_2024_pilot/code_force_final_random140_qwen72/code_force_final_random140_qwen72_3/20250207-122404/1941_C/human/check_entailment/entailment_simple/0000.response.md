Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of deletions required to make a string beautiful by avoiding the substrings "pie" and "map". However, the current implementation has a flaw that affects its correctness:

1. **Substring Removal Logic**: The program increments `i` by 3 when it finds a substring "map" or "pie" and increments `ans` by 1. This logic assumes that removing one character from each occurrence of "map" or "pie" will suffice to make the string beautiful. However, this is incorrect because:
   - Removing one character from "map" or "pie" might still leave a part of the substring in the string, which could form another "map" or "pie" with adjacent characters.
   - For example, in the string "mmapnapie", the program would only remove one character from each "map" and "pie", but this would not necessarily result in the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful.

2. **Correct Approach**: To correctly solve this problem, we need to ensure that the removal of characters completely eliminates the substrings "map" and "pie". A more appropriate approach would involve:
   - Using a dynamic programming or greedy algorithm to track the minimum deletions required to avoid forming "map" or "pie".
   - Ensuring that after each deletion, the remaining string is checked again to avoid forming new instances of "map" or "pie".

Given the current implementation, the program does not correctly handle the requirement to minimize deletions, leading to potential incorrect results.

Correctness: **False**
