Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The program indeed fails to handle overlapping occurrences of the substrings "map" or "pie" correctly. When the program finds a substring "map" or "pie", it increments the index `i` by 3, which causes it to skip the next two characters without checking them. This can lead to missing overlapping substrings, as demonstrated in the example "mappie". In this case, the program would only count 2 deletions instead of the correct 3 deletions needed to make the string beautiful.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description, which necessitates handling overlapping substrings correctly.

Final: **False**
