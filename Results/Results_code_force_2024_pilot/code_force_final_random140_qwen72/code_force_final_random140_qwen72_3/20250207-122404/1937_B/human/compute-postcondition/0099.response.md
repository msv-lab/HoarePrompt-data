Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` and `b` are new stripped input strings each having a length of at least 2, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, `counter` is the number of times the condition `a[j + 1] == b[j]` was true, reset to 1 whenever `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1', `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t` for the loop to execute again, `i` is 3, `ans` is the first two characters of `a`, and `work` is True.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing from 2 to 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
