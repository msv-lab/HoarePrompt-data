Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped input string and must be non-empty, `b` is the stripped input string, `i` is 2 or 3 depending on the condition, `work` is either True or False depending on the conditions, `ans` is the string containing the first character of `a` followed by the character at index 2 of `a` if `work` is True, otherwise `ans` is the first character of `b` followed by the character at index 2 of `a` and `work` is False. If `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, then `i` remains 2 and `work` is False. Otherwise, `i` is incremented to 3, and if `i + 1 == len(a)`, `ans` also includes the character at index 2 of `b` if `work` is True, otherwise `ans` includes the character at index 2 of `b` and `work` is False, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
