Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped input string and must be non-empty with `len(a) > 3`, `b` is the stripped input string, and `i` is 2 or 3 depending on the initial conditions. If `work` is True, `ans` is updated by appending the character at index `i` of `a` or `b` depending on the condition. If `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, `work` is set to False. Otherwise, if `i + 1 == len(a)`, `ans` is updated by appending the character at index `i` of `b`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. If `i + 1 < len(a)`, `i` is incremented to 3 or 4, and `ans` is updated by appending the character at index `i-1` of `a`. If `work` is False, `i` is 3 or 4 depending on the initial value of `i`, and `ans` is updated by appending the character at index `i-1` from `b`.***
