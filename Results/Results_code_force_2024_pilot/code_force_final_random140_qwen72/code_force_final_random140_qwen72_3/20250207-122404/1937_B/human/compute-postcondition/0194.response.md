The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and the length of `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and the length of `a`. The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `len(a) - 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `a` must have at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making it 1, and `a` must still have at least 2 elements (so that `len(a) - 1` is at least 1).

State: **`j` is 1, `a` is the stripped version of the user input and must have at least 2 elements, if the second element of `a` is '0' and the first element of `b` is '1', `counter` is 1. Otherwise, `counter` remains unchanged.**
