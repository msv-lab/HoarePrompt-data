Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped input string, `b` is the stripped input string, `ans` is an empty string, `i` is 0, `work` is True.
Code of the loop:
while i < len(a):
    if work:
        ans += a[i]
        if i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]:
            work = False
        elif i + 1 == len(a):
            ans += b[i]
            break
        else:
            i += 1
    else:
        ans += b[i]
        i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped input string and must be non-empty, `b` is the stripped input string, `i` is 1, and `work` is either True or False depending on the conditions. If `work` is True, `ans` is the string containing the first character of `a`. If `i + 1` is less than the length of `a` and the character at index `i` in `b` is less than the character at index `i + 1` in `a`, then `work` is False. If `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, then `ans` is the string containing the first character of `a` followed by the character `b[0]`. If `work` is False, `ans` is the first character of `b` and `work` is False.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped input string and must be non-empty, `b` is the stripped input string, `i` is 2 or 3 depending on the conditions, and `work` is either True or False. If `work` is True, `ans` is the string containing the first character of `a` followed by the character at index 2 of `a`. If `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, then `i` remains 2 and `work` is False. Otherwise, `i` is incremented to 3, and if `i + 1 == len(a)`, `ans` also includes the character at index 2 of `b` if `work` is True. If `work` is False, `ans` is the first character of `b` followed by the character at index 2 of `a` and `work` is False. If `work` is False from the start, `ans` is the string containing the first character of `a` followed by the character `b[0]` and the character `b[2]`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped input string and must be non-empty with `len(a) > 3`, `b` is the stripped input string, and `i` is 2 or 3 depending on the initial conditions. If `work` is True, `ans` is updated by appending the character at index `i` of `a` or `b` depending on the condition. If `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, `work` is set to False. Otherwise, if `i + 1 == len(a)`, `ans` is updated by appending the character at index `i` of `b`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. If `i + 1 < len(a)`, `i` is incremented to 3 or 4, and `ans` is updated by appending the character at index `i-1` of `a`. If `work` is False, `i` is 3 or 4 depending on the initial value of `i`, and `ans` is updated by appending the character at index `i-1` from `b`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
