Output State: **`j` is 0, `a` is the stripped version of the user input and must have at least 2 elements. The second element of `a` is '0'. The first element of `b` is '1'. `counter` is 1.** 

Explanation: The code snippet `counter = 1` sets the value of `counter` to 1. All other conditions and variable values from the initial state remain unchanged.
