Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` and `b` are new stripped input strings each having a length of at least 2, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, `counter` is the number of times the condition `a[j + 1] == b[j]` was true, reset to 1 whenever `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1', `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t` for the loop to execute again. If `work` is True, `i` is 2 or 3, `ans` is the first two characters of `a`, and `work` is either True or False. If `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, then `work` is False. Otherwise, `i` is 3, and if `i + 1 == len(a)`, `ans` is the first two characters of `a` followed by the third character of `b`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `work` is False, `i` is 2, `ans` is the first character of `a` followed by the second character of `b`, and `work` is True.**
