Postcondition: ***`j` is `len(a) - 2`, `counter` reflects the final count, `_` is the next value in the range of `t`, `t` remains unchanged, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped version of the user input, `b` is the stripped version of the new user input, `work` is as previously determined, and `ans` is the first two characters of `a` or `b` as previously determined. If `i + 1 == len(a)`, then `i` is 0, `ans` is updated to the first three characters of `a` or `b`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `i` is 1.***
