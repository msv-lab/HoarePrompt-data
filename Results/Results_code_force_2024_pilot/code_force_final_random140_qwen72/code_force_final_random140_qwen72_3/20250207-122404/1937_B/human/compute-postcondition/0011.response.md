The code snippet `ans += a[i]` appends the first character of the string `a` (since `i` is 0) to the string `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped input string and must be non-empty, `b` is the stripped input string, `ans` is the string containing the first character of `a`, `i` is 0, and `work` is True.**
