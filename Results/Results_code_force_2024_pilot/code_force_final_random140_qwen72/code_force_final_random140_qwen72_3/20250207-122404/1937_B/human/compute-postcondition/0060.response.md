Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped input string and must have a length of at least 2, `b` is the stripped input string, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `work` is either True or False depending on the final iteration's conditions, `ans` is a string constructed by alternating characters from `a` and `b` based on the conditions within the loop, `j` is 1, and if `a[j + 1]` is equal to `b[j]`, then `counter` is 2 or 3. Otherwise, `counter` remains 2.***
