Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped input string and must be non-empty, `b` is the stripped input string, `ans` is the string containing the first character of `a`, `i` is 0, `work` is False, and `i + 1` is less than the length of `a`, and the character at index `i` in `b` is less than the character at index `i + 1` in `a`.** 

The variable `work` has been set to False, while all other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
