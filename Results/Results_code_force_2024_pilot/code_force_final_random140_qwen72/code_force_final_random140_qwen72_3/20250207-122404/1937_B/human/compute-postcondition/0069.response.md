To determine what will be printed by the `print(counter)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic leading up to it:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is the stripped input string and must have a length of at least 2.
   - `b` is the stripped input string.
   - `i` is equal to the length of `a`.
   - `work` is either True or False depending on the final iteration's conditions.
   - `ans` is a string constructed by alternating characters from `a` and `b` based on the conditions within the loop.
   - `j` is `len(a) - 2`.
   - `counter` is the number of times the condition `a[j + 1] == b[j]` was true, reset to 1 whenever `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1'.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `a` and `b` are strings, and `a` must have a length of at least 2.
   - `i` is the length of `a`.
   - `j` is `len(a) - 2`, which means `j` is the second-to-last index of `a`.
   - `counter` is incremented each time `a[j + 1] == b[j]` is true, and it is reset to 1 if `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1'.

3. **Logic of the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates through the characters of `a` and `b` to construct `ans` and update `counter`.
   - The condition `a[j + 1] == b[j]` is checked, and if true, `counter` is incremented.
   - If `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1', `counter` is reset to 1.

4. **Final Value of `counter`:**
   - The value of `counter` depends on the specific characters in `a` and `b` and how many times the condition `a[j + 1] == b[j]` is true.
   - Without the exact values of `a` and `b`, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `counter`.

However, based on the given information, we can describe the value of `counter` as follows:

Output: **counter (where counter is the number of times the condition `a[j + 1] == b[j]` was true, reset to 1 whenever `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1')**
