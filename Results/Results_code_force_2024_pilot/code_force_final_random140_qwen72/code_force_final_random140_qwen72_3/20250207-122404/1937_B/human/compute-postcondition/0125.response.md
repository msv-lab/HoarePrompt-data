Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string of length at least 2, `b` is a string of length at least 2, `j` is 0, `counter` is 1 if `a[j + 1]` is not equal to `b[j]`, otherwise `counter` is 2, `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t` for the loop to execute again, `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `ans` is a string that contains characters from `a` and `b` based on the conditions specified in the loop, and `work` is either True or False depending on the last iteration's condition. If `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1', `counter` is set to 1. Otherwise, `counter` is set to 2.***
