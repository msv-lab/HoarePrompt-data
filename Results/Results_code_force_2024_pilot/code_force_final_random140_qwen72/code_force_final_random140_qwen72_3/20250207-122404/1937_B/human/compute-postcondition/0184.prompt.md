Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `j` is `len(a) - 2`, `counter` reflects the final count, `_` is the next value in the range of `t`, `work` is True, `t` remains unchanged, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped version of the user input, `b` is the stripped version of the new user input, `i` is 0, `ans` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
while i < len(a):
    if work:
        ans += a[i]
        if i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]:
            work = False
        elif i + 1 == len(a):
            ans += b[i]
            break
        else:
            i += 1
    else:
        ans += b[i]
        i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`j` is `len(a) - 2`, `counter` reflects the final count, `_` is the next value in the range of `t`, `t` remains unchanged, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped version of the user input, `b` is the stripped version of the new user input. If `work` is True and `i + 1` is less than `len(a)` and `b[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]`, then `work` is False, `i` is 0, and `ans` is the first character of `a`. If `work` is True and `i + 1` equals `len(a)`, `i` is 0, `ans` is the first character of `a` followed by the first character of `b`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `work` is True and `i + 1` is less than `len(a)` but `b[i]` is not less than `a[i + 1]`, then `i` is 1, and `ans` is the first character of `a`. If `work` is False, `i` is 1, and `ans` is the first character of `b`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`j` is `len(a) - 2`, `counter` reflects the final count, `_` is the next value in the range of `t`, `t` remains unchanged, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped version of the user input, `b` is the stripped version of the new user input, and `work` is as previously determined. If `work` is `True`: If `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, then `work` is `False`. Otherwise, `work` is as previously determined. If `i + 1 == len(a)`, then `i` is 0, `ans` is updated to the first three characters of `a` or `b`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `i` is 1. If `work` is `False`, then `i` is 1, and `ans` is the concatenation of the first character of `a` or `b` and the first character of `b`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`j` is `len(a) - 2`, `counter` reflects the final count, `_` is the next value in the range of `t`, `t` remains unchanged, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped version of the user input, `b` is the stripped version of the new user input, `i` is either 1 or 2, and `ans` is updated based on the following conditions: If `work` is `True`, `ans` includes the second character of `a`. If `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, `work` becomes `False`. If `i + 1 == len(a)`, `ans` includes the second character of `a` followed by the second character of `b`, and the loop or if statement is exited. If `i + 1 < len(a)` but `b[i] >= a[i + 1]`, `i` is set to 2, and `ans` includes the second character of `a`. If `work` is `False`, `i` is 2, and `ans` includes the second character of `b`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
