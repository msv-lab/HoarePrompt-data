The value of `counter` is incremented by 1. The conditions `a[j + 1] == '0'` and `b[j] == '1'` are not checked in the given code snippet, so `counter` is incremented regardless of these conditions. The values of `j`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is 2, `a` is a string of length at least 3, `len(a) - 1` is at least 2, `counter` is incremented by 1.**
