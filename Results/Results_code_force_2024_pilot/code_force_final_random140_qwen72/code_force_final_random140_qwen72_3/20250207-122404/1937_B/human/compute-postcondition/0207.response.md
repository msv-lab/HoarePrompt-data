The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the parameter constraints and relationships described, it is clear that the function processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes two binary strings of equal length, and the function likely accepts these as part of its input. Given the constraints, the function would accept the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, the length of the binary strings `n` and the two binary strings themselves.

The output of the function is not specified in the provided context, but typically, such functions would return some form of result or analysis based on the input binary strings for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it accepts the length of the binary strings `n` and two binary strings of length `n`. It processes each test case and returns a result based on the analysis of the two binary strings for each test case.**
