Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped input string and must be non-empty, `b` is the stripped input string, `ans` is now the first character of `b`, `i` is 0, `work` is False**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans += b[i]` appends the character at index `i` (which is 0) of the string `b` to the string `ans`. Since `ans` was initially an empty string, it now contains the first character of `b`. All other variables remain unchanged.
