The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the list `a`. The loop can execute again if `j` is less than `len(a) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `a` must have at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `a` must have at least 3 elements.

State: **`j` is 2, `a` is the stripped version of the user input and must have at least 3 elements. If the third element of `a` is equal to the second element of `b`, `counter` is 2. If `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1', `counter` is 1. Otherwise, `counter` remains unchanged.**
