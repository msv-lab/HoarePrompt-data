The code snippet `ans += b[i]` appends the character at index `i` of the string `b` to the variable `ans`. Given the initial state, let's determine the output state:

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` remains an input integer.
- `a` remains the stripped input string and must be non-empty with `len(a) > 3`.
- `b` remains the stripped input string.
- `i` is 2 or 3 depending on the conditions.
- `work` remains either True or False.
- `ans` is updated by appending the character at index `i` of `b`.

Since `i` is 2 or 3, the character at index `i` of `b` is appended to `ans`. The exact value of `ans` depends on the current value of `ans` and the character at index `i` of `b`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped input string and must be non-empty with `len(a) > 3`, `b` is the stripped input string, `i` is 2 or 3 depending on the conditions, `work` is either True or False, `ans` is updated by appending the character at index `i` of `b`.**
