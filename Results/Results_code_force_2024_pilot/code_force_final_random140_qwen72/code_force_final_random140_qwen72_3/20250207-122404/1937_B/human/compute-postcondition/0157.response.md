Postcondition: ***`j` is `len(a) - 2`, `counter` reflects the final count, `_` is the next value in the range of `t`, `t` remains unchanged, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped version of the user input, `b` is the stripped version of the new user input. If `i + 1` is less than `len(a)` and `b[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]`, then `work` is False, `i` is 0, and `ans` is the first character of `a`. Otherwise, `work` is True, and if `i + 1` equals `len(a)`, `i` is 0, `ans` is the first character of `a` followed by the first character of `b`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i + 1` is less than `len(a)` but `b[i]` is not less than `a[i + 1]`, then `i` is 1, and `ans` is the first character of `a`.***
