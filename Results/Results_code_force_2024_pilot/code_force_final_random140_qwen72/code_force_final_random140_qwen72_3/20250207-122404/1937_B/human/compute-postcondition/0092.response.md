Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the new stripped input string and must have a length of at least 2, `b` is the new stripped input string, `i` is 1, `work` is False, `ans` is the first character of `b`, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, and `counter` is the number of times the condition `a[j + 1] == b[j]` was true, reset to 1 whenever `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1'. `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t` for the loop to execute again.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing from 0 to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
