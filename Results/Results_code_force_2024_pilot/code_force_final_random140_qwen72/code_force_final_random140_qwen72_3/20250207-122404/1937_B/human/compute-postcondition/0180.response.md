Postcondition: ***`j` is `len(a) - 2`, `counter` reflects the final count, `_` is the next value in the range of `t`, `t` remains unchanged, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped version of the user input, `b` is the stripped version of the new user input, `i` is 1, `ans` is updated to include the second character of `a`. If `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, `work` is `False`. Otherwise, if `i + 1 == len(a)`, `ans` is updated to include the second character of `a` followed by the second character of `b`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i + 1 < len(a)` but `b[i] >= a[i + 1]`, `i` is 2, and `ans` is updated to include the second character of `a`.***
