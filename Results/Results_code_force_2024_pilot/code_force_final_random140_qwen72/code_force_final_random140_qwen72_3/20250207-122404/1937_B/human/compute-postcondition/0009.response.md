To determine if the loop can execute at least once, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop head, which is `i < len(a)`.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (not relevant to the loop condition)
- `n` is an input integer (not relevant to the loop condition)
- `a` is the stripped input string (relevant to the loop condition)
- `b` is the stripped input string (not relevant to the loop condition)
- `ans` is an empty string (not relevant to the loop condition)
- `i` is 0 (relevant to the loop condition)
- `work` is True (not relevant to the loop condition)

For the loop to execute at least once, the condition `i < len(a)` must be true. Since `i` is 0, the loop will execute if `len(a)` is greater than 0. Therefore, we need to ensure that `a` is a non-empty string.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped input string and must be non-empty, `b` is the stripped input string, `ans` is an empty string, `i` is 0, `work` is True**
