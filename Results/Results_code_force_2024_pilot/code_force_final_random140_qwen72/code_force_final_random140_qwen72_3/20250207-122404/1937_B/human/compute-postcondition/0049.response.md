To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic leading up to the print statement:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is the stripped input string and must be non-empty.
   - `b` is the stripped input string.
   - `i` is equal to the length of `a`.
   - `work` is either `True` or `False` depending on the final iteration's conditions.
   - `ans` is a string constructed by alternating characters from `a` and `b` based on the conditions within the loop.

2. **Understanding the Construction of `ans`:**
   - The string `ans` is built by alternating characters from `a` and `b`.
   - The exact pattern of alternation depends on the lengths of `a` and `b` and the conditions within the loop.
   - If `a` and `b` are of different lengths, the remaining characters of the longer string are appended to `ans` after the alternating part.

3. **Final Output:**
   - The `print(ans)` statement will print the string `ans` which is constructed by the described alternating process.

Given the initial state and the construction logic, the output will be the string `ans` which is the result of alternating characters from `a` and `b` until one of the strings is exhausted, followed by appending the remaining characters of the longer string.

Output: **ans (where ans is the string constructed by alternating characters from a and b, and appending any remaining characters from the longer string)**
