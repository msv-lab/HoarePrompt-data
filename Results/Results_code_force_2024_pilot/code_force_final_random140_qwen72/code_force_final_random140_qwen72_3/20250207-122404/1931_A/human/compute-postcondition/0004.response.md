Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts an integer `num` within the range 3 ≤ num ≤ 78. If `num` is within the range 1 to 26, it returns the corresponding lowercase letter from 'a' to 'z' based on the ASCII value of `num + 96`. For values of `num` outside the range 1 to 26, the function does not return anything (i.e., it implicitly returns `None`). **
