You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is an integer such that 3 ≤ num ≤ 78.
def func_1(num):
    if (1 <= num <= 26) :
        return chr(num + 96)
        #The program returns a lowercase letter corresponding to the ASCII value of `num + 96`. Since `num` is an integer between 3 and 26, the returned letter will be between 'c' and 'z'.
    #State: num is an integer such that 27 ≤ num ≤ 78.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `num` within the range 3 ≤ num ≤ 78. If `num` is within the range 1 to 26, it returns the corresponding lowercase letter from 'a' to 'z' based on the ASCII value of `num + 96`. For values of `num` outside the range 1 to 26, the function does not return anything (i.e., it implicitly returns `None`).


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word whose sum of character positions equals a given integer `n`.
   - The sum of the positions of the characters in the word should equal `n`.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and attempts to construct the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that sums to `n`.

3. **Breaking Down the Logic:**
   - The program uses a series of conditions to determine the values of the three characters `a`, `b`, and `c`:
     - If `n // 26 == 0`, it sets `a` and `b` to 'a' and `c` to the character corresponding to `n - 2`.
     - If `n // 26 == 1`, it sets `a` to 'a', `b` to the character corresponding to `n - 27`, and `c` to 'z'.
     - If `n // 26 == 2`, it sets `a` to the character corresponding to `n - 52`, and both `b` and `c` to 'z'.

4. **Checking the Conditions:**
   - The conditions are designed to handle different ranges of `n`:
     - `n // 26 == 0` covers the range `3 <= n <= 26`.
     - `n // 26 == 1` covers the range `27 <= n <= 52`.
     - `n // 26 == 2` covers the range `53 <= n <= 78`.

5. **Evaluating the Output:**
   - The program constructs the word by converting the calculated values to characters using `chr(96 + value)`.
   - The program prints the constructed word for each test case.

6. **Testing Edge Cases:**
   - For `n = 3`, the program correctly outputs "aaa".
   - For `n = 24`, the program correctly outputs "aav".
   - For `n = 70`, the program correctly outputs "rzz".
   - For `n = 55`, the program correctly outputs "czz".
   - For `n = 48`, the program correctly outputs "auz".

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly handles all the given test cases and produces the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word for each `n` within the specified range.

### Correctness:
**True**

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem statement.
