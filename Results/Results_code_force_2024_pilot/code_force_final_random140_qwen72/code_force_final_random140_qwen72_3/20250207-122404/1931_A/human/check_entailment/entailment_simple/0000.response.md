### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` which represents the encoded value of the word.

2. **Character Assignment**:
   - The program attempts to construct the lexicographically smallest word by assigning values to `a`, `b`, and `c`.
   - The logic for assigning values to `a`, `b`, and `c` is based on the value of `n` and its relationship with 26 (the number of letters in the alphabet).

3. **Cases Analysis**:
   - **Case 1**: `if n // 26 == 0`
     - This means `n` is between 3 and 26. The program sets `a` and `b` to 'a' (which is correct) and `c` to the character corresponding to `n - 2`. This is correct because the smallest possible word in this range is `aav` for `n = 24`.
   - **Case 2**: `elif n // 26 == 1`
     - This means `n` is between 27 and 52. The program sets `a` to 'a', `b` to the character corresponding to `n - 27`, and `c` to 'z'. This is correct because the smallest possible word in this range is `azz` for `n = 52`.
   - **Case 3**: `elif n // 26 == 2`
     - This means `n` is between 53 and 78. The program sets `a` to the character corresponding to `n - 52`, and both `b` and `c` to 'z'. This is correct because the smallest possible word in this range is `rzz` for `n = 78`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program correctly prints the constructed word `a + b + c` for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the cases and constructs the lexicographically smallest word for the given encoded value `n`. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
