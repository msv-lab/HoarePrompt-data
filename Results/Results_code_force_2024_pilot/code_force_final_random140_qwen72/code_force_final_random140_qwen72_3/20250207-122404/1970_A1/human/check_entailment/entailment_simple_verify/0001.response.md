### Reasoning:

1. **Balance Calculation**:
   - The program correctly calculates the balance of the prefix at each position in the input string `s`. This is achieved by iterating through the string and incrementing the balance for an opening parenthesis `'('` and decrementing it for a closing parenthesis `')'`.

2. **Positions List Construction**:
   - The program constructs a list of tuples `positions`, where each tuple contains the balance, the position, and the character at that position. This is essential for keeping track of the balance and the original position of each character, which is necessary for the sorting step.

3. **Sorting**:
   - The program sorts the `positions` list based on the balance in ascending order and the position in descending order (to break ties). This sorting ensures that the characters are rearranged according to the rules of the balanced shuffle operation. Specifically, it ensures that characters with the same balance are ordered by their original position in reverse order, which is crucial for maintaining the correct order of characters in the shuffled sequence.

4. **Result Construction**:
   - After sorting, the program constructs the result string by extracting the characters from the sorted `positions` list and joining them together. This step is correctly implemented and ensures that the final string is the balanced shuffle of the input string.

5. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the input string `s` using `input().strip()` and calls the function `func_1` to perform the balanced shuffle operation. This is a standard way to handle input in Python and is appropriate for the problem.

6. **Output**:
   - The result of the balanced shuffle operation is printed, which is the expected output format.

### Annotations Verification:
- The annotations confirm that the program maintains the correct state throughout its execution. The balance is correctly calculated, the positions list is correctly constructed, and the sorting and result construction steps are performed as intended.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. It handles the input and output as required and follows the steps to compute the balanced shuffle of the input string.

### Correctness:
**True**

Final: **True**
