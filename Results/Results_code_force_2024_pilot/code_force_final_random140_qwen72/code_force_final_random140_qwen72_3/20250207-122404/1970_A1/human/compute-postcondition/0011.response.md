The value of `balance` is incremented by 1. Since `balance` was initially 1 if `char` is '(', or -1 if `char` is ')', the new value of `balance` will be 2 if `char` is '(', or 0 if `char` is ')'. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000, `n` is the length of `s`, `i` is 1, `positions` is a list containing the tuple `(balance, 0, first_char)`, `char` is the second character of `s`, and if `char` is '(', then `balance` is 2. Otherwise, `balance` is 0.**
