The function `func_1` takes a non-empty string `s` consisting only of balanced parentheses "(", ")" with a maximum length of 500,000. It processes the string to generate a new string `result` where the characters are rearranged based on a specific sorting criteria: the characters are first sorted by their balance (the difference between the number of opening and closing parentheses encountered up to that point) in ascending order, and for characters with the same balance, they are sorted by their original index in descending order. The function returns this newly arranged string `result`. After the function concludes, `s` remains unchanged, and `result` is the transformed string.
