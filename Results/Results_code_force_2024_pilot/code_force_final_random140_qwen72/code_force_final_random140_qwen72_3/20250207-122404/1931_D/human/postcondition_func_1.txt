The function reads input from standard input, processes a specified number of test cases, and prints the results. Specifically, it reads a series of lines from the input, where the first line indicates the number of test cases (`t`). For each test case, it reads two lines: the first line contains three integers (`n`, `x`, `y`), and the second line contains a list of integers (`arr`). These values are collected into a list of tuples (`test_cases`). The function then calls another function (`func_1`) with `test_cases` as an argument and prints each result returned by `func_1`. After the function completes, the input data (`data`), the number of test cases (`t`), and the index (`idx`) remain unchanged, while the `test_cases` list and the results printed to the console reflect the processed test cases.
