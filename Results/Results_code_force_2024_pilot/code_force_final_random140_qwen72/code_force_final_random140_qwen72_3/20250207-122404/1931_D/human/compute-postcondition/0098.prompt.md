Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of a tuple (n, x, y) where n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and x, y are integers such that 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9. The array a for each test case is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for case in test_cases:
    n, x, y = case['params']
    a = case['array']
    freq = defaultdict(int)
    beautiful_count = 0
    for num in a:
        mod_x = num % x
        mod_y = num % y
        required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x
        required_mod_y = mod_y
        if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq:
            beautiful_count += freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]
        freq[mod_x, mod_y] += 1
    results.append(beautiful_count)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After the loop has executed all iterations, the variable `beautiful_count` will contain the total count of pairs `(i, j)` in the array `a` such that `(a[i] + a[j]) % x == 0` and `(a[i] + a[j]) % y == 0`. The dictionary `freq` will contain the frequency of each pair `(mod_x, mod_y)` for every element in the array `a`, where `mod_x` is the remainder when the element is divided by `x`, and `mod_y` is the remainder when the element is divided by `y`. The list `results` now includes the value of `beautiful_count` appended to it. All other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `case`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`) remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `beautiful_count` is the total count of pairs `(i, j)` where `i < j` and `a[j] + k * x == a[i] + l * y` for some integers `k` and `l`. `freq` is a dictionary where each key `(mod_x, mod_y)` represents the frequency of numbers in `a` that have the same remainders when divided by `x` and `y`, respectively. `results` now includes the final value of `beautiful_count` for the current test case appended to it. `test_cases` must have at least one more element, `case` is the next element in `test_cases`, `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]`, `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]`, `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]`, `a` has been fully iterated over, and `num` is the last element in `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `beautiful_count` is appended to `results`, `results` now includes the final value of `beautiful_count` for the current test case, `test_cases` still has at least one more element, `case` is the next element in `test_cases`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `a` retain their initial values, and `num` is the last element processed from `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
