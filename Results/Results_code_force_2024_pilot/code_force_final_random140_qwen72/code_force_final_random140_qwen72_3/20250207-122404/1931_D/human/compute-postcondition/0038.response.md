Output State: **`beautiful_count` is 0, `freq` is initialized as an empty defaultdict with default value 0, `results` now includes the value of `beautiful_count` from the previous test case appended to it, `test_cases` must have at least one more element, `case` is the next element in `test_cases`, `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]`, `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]`, `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]`, `a` is the value of `case['array']`.** 

The code resets `beautiful_count` to 0, while the other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
