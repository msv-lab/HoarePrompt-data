To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the state of the objects mentioned in the loop head, which are `case` and `test_cases`.

1. **`test_cases`**: This is the collection of test cases that the loop will iterate over. For the loop to execute, `test_cases` must contain at least one test case.
2. **`case`**: This variable will take on the value of each element in `test_cases` during each iteration of the loop. Initially, it should be set to the first element of `test_cases`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of a tuple (n, x, y) where n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and x, y are integers such that 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9.
- The array `a` for each test case is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
- The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
- `results` is an empty list.

For the loop to execute:
- `test_cases` must be a non-empty list of test cases.
- `case` should be the first element of `test_cases`.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples (n, x, y) where each n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and x, y are integers such that 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, `case` is the first element of `test_cases`, `results` is an empty list**.
