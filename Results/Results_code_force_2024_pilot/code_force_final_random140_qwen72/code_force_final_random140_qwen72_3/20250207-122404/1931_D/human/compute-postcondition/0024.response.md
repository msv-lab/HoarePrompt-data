The only object in the loop head is the variable `num` and the list `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If there are more elements in `a`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num` was the next element in the list `a`. For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must have at least one more element, and `num` will be set to the next element in `a`.

State: **All other variables remain unchanged. `num` is the next element in the list `a`. `a` must have at least one more element.**
