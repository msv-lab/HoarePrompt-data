The value of `required_mod_y` is updated to be equal to the value of `mod_y`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **All other variables remain unchanged. `num` is the next element in the list `a`. `mod_x` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`. `mod_y` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`. `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`. `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`.**
