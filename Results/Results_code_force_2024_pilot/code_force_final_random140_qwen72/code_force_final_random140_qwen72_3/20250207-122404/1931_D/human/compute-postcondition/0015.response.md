The only object in the loop head is the variable `num`, which is being iterated over the list `a`. Therefore, the state of `num` needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

At the end of the previous iteration, `num` was set to the current element in the list `a`. For the loop to execute one more time, `num` must be set to the next element in the list `a`.

Since the list `a` is not explicitly stated to change, we assume it remains the same. The next element in the list `a` will be the one following the current `num`.

State: **All other variables remain unchanged. `num` is the next element in the list `a`.**
