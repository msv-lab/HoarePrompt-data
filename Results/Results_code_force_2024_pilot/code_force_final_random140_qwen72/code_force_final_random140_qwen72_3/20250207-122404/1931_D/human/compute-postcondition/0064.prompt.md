Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `beautiful_count` is 0, `freq` is initialized as an empty defaultdict with default value 0, `results` now includes the value of `beautiful_count` from the previous test case appended to it, `test_cases` must have at least one more element, `case` is the next element in `test_cases`, `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]`, `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]`, `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]`, `a` is the value of `case['array']`.
Code of the loop:
for num in a:
    mod_x = num % x
    mod_y = num % y
    required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x
    required_mod_y = mod_y
    if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq:
        beautiful_count += freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]
    freq[mod_x, mod_y] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `beautiful_count` is 0, `freq` is updated with the key `(mod_x, mod_y)` incremented by 1, `results` now includes the value of `beautiful_count` from the previous test case appended to it, `test_cases` must have at least one more element, `case` is the next element in `test_cases`, `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]`, `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]`, `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]`, `a` must have at least one element, `num` is the first element in `a`, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `beautiful_count` is 0, `freq` is updated with the key `(mod_x, mod_y)` incremented by 1, `results` now includes the value of `beautiful_count` from the previous test case appended to it, `test_cases` must have at least one more element, `case` is the next element in `test_cases`, `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]`, `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]`, `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]`, `a` must have at least one element, `num` is the next element in `a`, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `mod_y` is the new value of `num % y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `beautiful_count` is 0, `freq` is updated with the key `(mod_x, mod_y)` incremented by 1, `results` now includes the value of `beautiful_count` from the previous test case appended to it, `test_cases` must have at least one more element, `case` is the next element in `test_cases`, `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]`, `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]`, `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]`, `a` must have at least two elements, `num` is the next element in `a`, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `mod_y` is the new value of `num % y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`. If `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in `freq`, `beautiful_count` is incremented by the value of `freq[(x - (num % x)) % x, num % y]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
