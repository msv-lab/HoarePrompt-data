Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples (n, x, y) where each n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and x, y are integers such that 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, `case` is the first element of `test_cases`, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `x` is the second element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `y` is the third element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `a` is the value of `case['array']`, `freq` is an empty defaultdict with default type int, `beautiful_count` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for num in a:
    mod_x = num % x
    mod_y = num % y
    required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x
    required_mod_y = mod_y
    if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq:
        beautiful_count += freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]
    freq[mod_x, mod_y] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: All other variables remain unchanged. `required_mod_y` is now equal to `y`. If the tuple `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is present in the dictionary `freq`, then `beautiful_count` is increased by the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`. The value of `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: All other variables remain unchanged. `num` is the next element in the list `a`. `mod_x` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`. `mod_y` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`. `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`. `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`. If `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in `freq`, `beautiful_count` is incremented by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`. The value of `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: All other variables remain unchanged, `num` is the next element in the list `a`, `a` must have at least one more element, `mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`, `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is increased by 1, if `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in `freq`, `beautiful_count` is increased by the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
