You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of a tuple (n, x, y) where n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and x, y are integers such that 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9. The array a for each test case is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        n, x, y = case['params']
        
        a = case['array']
        
        freq = defaultdict(int)
        
        beautiful_count = 0
        
        for num in a:
            mod_x = num % x
            mod_y = num % y
            required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x
            required_mod_y = mod_y
            if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq:
                beautiful_count += freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]
            freq[mod_x, mod_y] += 1
        
        results.append(beautiful_count)
        
    #State: After the loop has executed all iterations, the list `results` contains the final value of `beautiful_count` for each test case in `test_cases`. Each `beautiful_count` represents the total count of pairs `(i, j)` in the corresponding array `a` such that `(a[i] + a[j]) % x == 0` and `(a[i] + a[j]) % y == 0`. The dictionary `freq` for each test case will contain the frequency of each pair `(mod_x, mod_y)` for every element in the array `a`, where `mod_x` is the remainder when the element is divided by `x`, and `mod_y` is the remainder when the element is divided by `y`. All other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `case`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `num`) retain their initial values or are reset for each new test case.
    return results
    #The program returns the list `results` which contains the final value of `beautiful_count` for each test case in `test_cases`. Each `beautiful_count` is the total count of pairs `(i, j)` in the corresponding array `a` such that `(a[i] + a[j]) % x == 0` and `(a[i] + a[j]) % y == 0`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a positive integer `t` and a list of test cases `test_cases`. Each test case is a tuple `(n, x, y)` where `n` is the length of an array `a`, and `x` and `y` are integers. The function returns a list `results` containing the count of pairs `(i, j)` in each array `a` such that `(a[i] + a[j]) % x == 0` and `(a[i] + a[j]) % y == 0` for each test case.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the list `results` which contains the final value of `beautiful_count` for each test case in `test_cases`. Each `beautiful_count` is the total count of pairs `(i, j)` in the corresponding array `a` such that `(a[i] + a[j]) % x == 0` and `(a[i] + a[j]) % y == 0`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
