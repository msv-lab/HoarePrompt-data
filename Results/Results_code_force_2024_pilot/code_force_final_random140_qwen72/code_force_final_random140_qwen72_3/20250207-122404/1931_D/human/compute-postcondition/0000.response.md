Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of a tuple (n, x, y) where n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and x, y are integers such that 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9. The array a for each test case is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `results` is an empty list.**
