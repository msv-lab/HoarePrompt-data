The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t` and `test_cases`. 

- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple `(n, x, y)` represents a test case. In each tuple:
  - `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the length of the array `a`.
  - `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9.
  - The array `a` for each test case is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.

The function returns a list `results` which contains the final value of `beautiful_count` for each test case in `test_cases`. Each `beautiful_count` is the total count of pairs `(i, j)` in the corresponding array `a` such that `(a[i] + a[j]) % x == 0` and `(a[i] + a[j]) % y == 0`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `t` and a list of test cases `test_cases`. Each test case is a tuple `(n, x, y)` where `n` is the length of an array `a`, and `x` and `y` are integers. The function returns a list `results` containing the count of pairs `(i, j)` in each array `a` such that `(a[i] + a[j]) % x == 0` and `(a[i] + a[j]) % y == 0` for each test case.**
