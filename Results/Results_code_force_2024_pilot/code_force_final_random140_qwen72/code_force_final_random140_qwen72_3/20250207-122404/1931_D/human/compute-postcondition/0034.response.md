The only object in the loop head is the variable `case` and the list `test_cases`. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another element in `test_cases` to assign to `case`.

At the end of the last iteration, the variable `beautiful_count` contains the total count of pairs `(i, j)` for the current test case, and the dictionary `freq` contains the frequency of each pair `(mod_x, mod_y)` for the current test case. The list `results` now includes the value of `beautiful_count` appended to it.

For the loop to execute one more time, the list `test_cases` must have at least one more element, and `case` will be set to the next element in `test_cases`.

State: **`beautiful_count` will contain the total count of pairs `(i, j)` for the next test case, `freq` will contain the frequency of each pair `(mod_x, mod_y)` for the next test case, `results` now includes the value of `beautiful_count` from the previous test case appended to it, `test_cases` must have at least one more element, `case` is the next element in `test_cases`**
