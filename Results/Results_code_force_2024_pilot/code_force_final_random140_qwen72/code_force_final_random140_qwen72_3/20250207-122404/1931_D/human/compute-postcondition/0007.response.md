The code snippet `mod_x = num % x` calculates the remainder of `num` divided by `x` and assigns it to the variable `mod_x`. However, the variable `num` is not defined in the initial state, which means the code will raise a `NameError` because `num` is not recognized.

Given the initial state, the only variables that could potentially be used in the calculation are `n`, `x`, and `y`, but none of these are named `num`. Therefore, the code cannot execute successfully without defining `num`.

Since the code does not run due to the undefined variable `num`, no changes are made to the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples (n, x, y) where each n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and x, y are integers such that 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, `case` is the first element of `test_cases`, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `x` is the second element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `y` is the third element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `a` is the value of `case['array']` and must contain at least one element, `freq` is an empty defaultdict with default type int, `beautiful_count` is 0**.
