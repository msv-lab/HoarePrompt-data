Output State: **`beautiful_count` is 0, `freq` is updated with the key `(mod_x, mod_y)` incremented by 1, `results` now includes the value of `beautiful_count` from the previous test case appended to it, `test_cases` must have at least one more element, `case` is the next element in `test_cases`, `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]`, `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]`, `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]`, `a` must have at least two elements, `num` is the next element in `a`, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `mod_y` is the new value of `num % y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `mod_y = num % y` updates the value of `mod_y` to be the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`.
- All other variables (`beautiful_count`, `freq`, `results`, `test_cases`, `case`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `num`, `mod_x`, `required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`) remain unchanged or retain their previous values and conditions as specified in the initial state.
