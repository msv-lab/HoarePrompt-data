The value of `required_mod_x` is calculated as `(x - mod_x) % x`. This means that `required_mod_x` is the remainder when `x - mod_x` is divided by `x`.

Given that `mod_x` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`, the expression `(x - mod_x) % x` effectively calculates the difference needed to reach the next multiple of `x` from `num`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **All other variables remain unchanged. `num` is the next element in the list `a`. `mod_x` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`. `mod_y` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`. `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`.**
