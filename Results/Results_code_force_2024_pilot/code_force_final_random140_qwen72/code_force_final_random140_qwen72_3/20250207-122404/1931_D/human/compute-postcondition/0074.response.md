Output State: **`beautiful_count` is 0, `freq` is an empty dictionary (defaultdict(int)), `results` now includes the final value of `beautiful_count` for the current test case appended to it, `test_cases` must have at least one more element, `case` is the next element in `test_cases`, `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]`, `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]`, `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]`, `a` is a list from `case['array']` that must have at least one element, `num` is the first element of `a`, `mod_x` is the result of `num % x`, `mod_y` is the result of `num % y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`.** 

The code calculates `required_mod_x` as `(x - mod_x) % x` and updates the state accordingly. All other variables remain unchanged.
