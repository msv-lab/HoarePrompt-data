Output State: **All other variables remain unchanged, `num` is the next element in the list `a`, `a` must have at least one more element, `mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`, `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is increased by 1, if `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in `freq`, `beautiful_count` is increased by the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`.**
