You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Polycarp has two favorite integers x and y (they can be equal), and he has
found an array a of length n .

Polycarp considers a pair of indices \langle i, j \rangle (1 \le i < j \le n )
beautiful if:

  * a_i + a_j is divisible by x ; 
  * a_i - a_j is divisible by y . 

For example, if x=5 , y=2 , n=6 , a= [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6 ], then the only
beautiful pairs are:

  * \langle 1, 5 \rangle : a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8 (-8 is divisible by 2 ); 
  * \langle 4, 6 \rangle : a_4 + a_6 = 4 + 6 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_4 - a_6 = 4 - 6 = -2 (-2 is divisible by 2 ). 

Find the number of beautiful pairs in the array a .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , x , and y (2 \le
n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le x, y \le 10^9 ) — the size of the array and
Polycarp's favorite integers.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of beautiful pairs in
the array a .

    return results



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` takes two parameters: a positive integer `t` and a list of test cases `test_cases`. Each test case is a dictionary containing a tuple `('params')` with three integers `(n, x, y)` and a list `('array')` of `n` integers. The function returns a list `results` where each element corresponds to the count of pairs `(i, j)` in the respective array `a` such that `(a[i] + a[j]) % x == 0` and `(a[i] + a[j]) % y == 0`. The original input parameters `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times to read the parameters `(n, x, y)` and the array `a` for each test case. It stores these in a list `test_cases`.

2. **Function Call**: The program calls the function `func_1` with the number of test cases `t` and the list of test cases `test_cases`. This is appropriate as it processes each test case individually.

3. **Frequency Dictionary**: Inside `func_1`, a `defaultdict` named `freq` is used to keep track of the frequency of pairs `(mod_x, mod_y)` where `mod_x` is `num % x` and `mod_y` is `num % y`. This is a good approach to efficiently count the occurrences of specific remainders.

4. **Beautiful Pairs Calculation**:
   - For each number `num` in the array `a`, it calculates `mod_x` and `mod_y`.
   - It then calculates the required remainders `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y` that would make a pair beautiful.
   - If the required pair `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` exists in the frequency dictionary, it adds the count of such pairs to `beautiful_count`.
   - Finally, it updates the frequency dictionary with the current pair `(mod_x, mod_y)`.

5. **Output**: The program appends the count of beautiful pairs for each test case to the `results` list and prints each result.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the constraints well, including large values of `n` and multiple test cases.
   - It correctly handles the case where no beautiful pairs exist (e.g., the second test case in the example).

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.
