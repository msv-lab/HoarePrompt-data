Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the number of beautiful pairs in an array `a` for multiple test cases. A pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) is considered beautiful if \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\) and \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

### Key Points:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading the values of `n`, `x`, and `y`, followed by the array `a`.

2. **Frequency Dictionary:**
   - The program uses a `defaultdict` named `freq` to keep track of the frequency of pairs \((\text{mod}_x, \text{mod}_y)\) where \(\text{mod}_x = a_i \% x\) and \(\text{mod}_y = a_i \% y\).

3. **Beautiful Pair Counting:**
   - For each element `num` in the array `a`, it calculates the required mod values \(\text{required\_mod}_x = (x - \text{mod}_x) \% x\) and \(\text{required\_mod}_y = \text{mod}_y\).
   - It checks if the pair \((\text{required\_mod}_x, \text{required\_mod}_y)\) exists in the `freq` dictionary. If it does, it adds the frequency of this pair to the `beautiful_count`.

4. **Result Collection:**
   - After processing all elements in the array, the `beautiful_count` for the current test case is appended to the `results` list.

5. **Output:**
   - Finally, the program prints the results for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The logic for calculating the required mod values and checking the frequency dictionary is correct.
- The program correctly handles the constraints and edge cases as specified in the problem description.
- The use of a `defaultdict` ensures efficient counting and lookup operations.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically sound and correctly implements the solution to the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
