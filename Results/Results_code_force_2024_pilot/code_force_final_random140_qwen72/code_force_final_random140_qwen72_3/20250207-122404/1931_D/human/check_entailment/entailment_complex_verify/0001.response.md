Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times to read the parameters `(n, x, y)` and the array `a` for each test case. It stores these in a list `test_cases`. This part is accurate and matches the problem description.

2. **Function Call**: The program calls the function `func_1` with the number of test cases `t` and the list of test cases `test_cases`. This is appropriate as it processes each test case individually. This part is also correct.

3. **Frequency Dictionary**: Inside `func_1`, a `defaultdict` named `freq` is used to keep track of the frequency of pairs `(mod_x, mod_y)` where `mod_x` is `num % x` and `mod_y` is `num % y`. This is a good approach to efficiently count the occurrences of specific remainders. This part is accurate.

4. **Beautiful Pairs Calculation**:
   - For each number `num` in the array `a`, it calculates `mod_x` and `mod_y`.
   - It then calculates the required remainders `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y` that would make a pair beautiful.
   - If the required pair `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` exists in the frequency dictionary, it adds the count of such pairs to `beautiful_count`.
   - Finally, it updates the frequency dictionary with the current pair `(mod_x, mod_y)`.

   However, there is a critical mistake in the calculation of `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y`. The condition for a pair to be beautiful is:
   - \( a_i + a_j \) is divisible by \( x \)
   - \( a_i - a_j \) is divisible by \( y \)

   The program correctly calculates `mod_x` and `mod_y` for each number `num`. However, the required remainders should be calculated as follows:
   - For \( a_i + a_j \) to be divisible by \( x \), we need \( (a_i + a_j) \% x = 0 \). This implies \( a_j \% x = (x - a_i \% x) \% x \).
   - For \( a_i - a_j \) to be divisible by \( y \), we need \( (a_i - a_j) \% y = 0 \). This implies \( a_j \% y = a_i \% y \).

   Therefore, the correct required remainders should be:
   - `required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x`
   - `required_mod_y = mod_y`

   The program correctly calculates `required_mod_x` but incorrectly uses `mod_y` for `required_mod_y`. It should use `mod_y` directly, not `(x - mod_y) % y`.

5. **Output**: The program appends the count of beautiful pairs for each test case to the `results` list and prints each result. This part is correct.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the constraints well, including large values of `n` and multiple test cases.
   - It correctly handles the case where no beautiful pairs exist (e.g., the second test case in the example).

Given the above reasoning, the program has a logical error in the calculation of `required_mod_y`. This error affects the correctness of the solution.

Final: **False**
