Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates `t` times to read the parameters `(n, x, y)` and the array `a` for each test case. It stores these in a list `test_cases`. This part is correct and aligns with the problem description.

2. **Function Call**: The program calls the function `func_1` with the number of test cases `t` and the list of test cases `test_cases`. This is appropriate as it processes each test case individually.

3. **Frequency Dictionary**: Inside `func_1`, a `defaultdict` named `freq` is used to keep track of the frequency of pairs `(mod_x, mod_y)` where `mod_x` is `num % x` and `mod_y` is `num % y`. This is a good approach to efficiently count the occurrences of specific remainders.

4. **Beautiful Pairs Calculation**:
   - For each number `num` in the array `a`, it calculates `mod_x` and `mod_y`.
   - It then calculates the required remainders `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y` that would make a pair beautiful.
   - The calculation of `required_mod_x` as `(x - mod_x) % x` is correct because it finds the complement of `mod_x` under modulo `x`.
   - However, the calculation of `required_mod_y` as `mod_y` is incorrect. According to the problem, `a_i - a_j` should be divisible by `y`, which means `a_i % y - a_j % y` should be 0. Therefore, `required_mod_y` should be `(y - mod_y) % y` to find the complement of `mod_y` under modulo `y`.

5. **Output**: The program appends the count of beautiful pairs for each test case to the `results` list and prints each result. The logic for updating the frequency dictionary and counting the pairs is mostly correct, but the incorrect calculation of `required_mod_y` will lead to incorrect results.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the constraints well, including large values of `n` and multiple test cases.
   - It correctly handles the case where no beautiful pairs exist (e.g., the second test case in the example).

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect due to the incorrect calculation of `required_mod_y`.

Final: **False**
