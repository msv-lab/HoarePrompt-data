Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times to read the parameters `(n, x, y)` and the array `a` for each test case. It stores these in a list `test_cases`. This part is accurate and follows the problem description.

2. **Function Call**: The program calls the function `func_1` with the number of test cases `t` and the list of test cases `test_cases`. This is appropriate as it processes each test case individually. The function call is correct.

3. **Frequency Dictionary**: Inside `func_1`, a `defaultdict` named `freq` is used to keep track of the frequency of pairs `(mod_x, mod_y)` where `mod_x` is `num % x` and `mod_y` is `num % y`. This is a good approach to efficiently count the occurrences of specific remainders. The use of `defaultdict` is efficient and appropriate.

4. **Beautiful Pairs Calculation**:
   - For each number `num` in the array `a`, it calculates `mod_x` and `mod_y`.
   - It then calculates the required remainders `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y` that would make a pair beautiful. Specifically, `required_mod_x` is calculated as `(x - mod_x) % x` and `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`.
   - If the required pair `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` exists in the frequency dictionary, it adds the count of such pairs to `beautiful_count`.
   - Finally, it updates the frequency dictionary with the current pair `(mod_x, mod_y)`.

   However, there is a subtle issue in the calculation of `required_mod_x`. The condition for a pair `(i, j)` to be beautiful is that both `a_i + a_j` and `a_i - a_j` should be divisible by `x` and `y` respectively. The current implementation only checks if `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x` and `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`. To correctly handle the condition for `a_i - a_j` being divisible by `y`, we need to consider both `mod_y` and `(y - mod_y) % y`.

5. **Output**: The program appends the count of beautiful pairs for each test case to the `results` list and prints each result. This part is correct.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the constraints well, including large values of `n` and multiple test cases.
   - It correctly handles the case where no beautiful pairs exist (e.g., the second test case in the example).

Given the above reasoning, the program has a logical error in the calculation of `required_mod_y`. The correct approach should consider both `mod_y` and `(y - mod_y) % y` to ensure that both conditions for a beautiful pair are met.

Final: **False**
