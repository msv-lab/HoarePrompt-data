You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Stepan is a very busy person. Today he needs to send n messages at moments
m_1, m_2, \dots m_n (m_i < m_{i + 1} ). Unfortunately, by the moment 0 , his
phone only has f units of charge left. At the moment 0 , the phone is turned
on.

The phone loses a units of charge for each unit of time it is on. Also, at any
moment, Stepan can turn off the phone and turn it on later. This action
consumes b units of energy each time. Consider turning on and off to be
instantaneous, so you can turn it on at moment x and send a message at the
same moment, and vice versa, send a message at moment x and turn off the phone
at the same moment.

If at any point the charge level drops to 0 (becomes \le 0 ), it is impossible
to send a message at that moment.

Since all messages are very important to Stepan, he wants to know if he can
send all the messages without the possibility of charging the phone.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. This is followed by the descriptions of the test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains four integers n , f , a , and b (1
\le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le f, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of messages,
the initial phone's charge, the charge consumption per unit of time, and the
consumption when turned off and on sequentially.

The second line of each test case contains n integers m_1, m_2, \dots, m_n (1
\le m_i \le 10^9 , m_i < m_{i + 1} ) — the moments at which messages need to
be sent.

It is guaranteed that in a test the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if Stepan can send all the messages, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the first test case of the example, at moment 0 , the phone's charge is 3 .
When sending a message at moment 3 without turning it off, (3 - 0) \cdot 1 = 3
units of charge will be spent. In this case, the charge will drop to 0 and
Stepan will not be able to send the message. When turning off and on, the
phone's charge will decrease by 5 , so it will not be possible to send the
message in this way.

In the third test case of the example, at moment 0 , the phone's charge is 10
. The phone loses 1 unit of charge per unit of time, and when turned off and
on, it loses 2 units of charge. To send all messages, the following actions
can be taken:

  * Turn off the phone at moment 0 and turn it on at moment 1 , after which 10 - 2 = 8 units of charge will remain; 
  * send a message at moment 1 ; 
  * send a message at moment 2 , after which 8 - (2 - 1) \cdot 1 = 7 units of charge will remain; 
  * Turn off the phone at moment 2 and turn it on at moment 3 , after which 7 - 2 = 5 units of charge will remain; 
  * send a message at moment 3 ; 
  * Turn off the phone at moment 3 and turn it on at moment 4 , after which 5 - 2 = 3 units of charge will remain; 
  * send a message at moment 4 ; 
  * Turn off the phone at moment 4 and turn it on at moment 5 , after which 3 - 2 = 1 unit of charge will remain; 
  * send a message at moment 5 . 

The last (sixth) test set of the example may fail if there is an integer
overflow in your solution.

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of four integers n, f, a, b where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ f, a, b ≤ 10^9, representing the number of messages, the initial phone's charge, the charge consumption per unit of time, and the consumption when turned off and on sequentially, respectively. Additionally, there is a list of n integers m_1, m_2, ..., m_n where 1 ≤ m_i ≤ 10^9 and m_i < m_{i+1}, representing the moments at which messages need to be sent. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, f, a, b = map(int, input().split())

            f -= energy_cost
        
        print('YES' if possible else 'NO')
        
    #State: After all iterations, `possible` is `True` or `False` depending on whether the phone's charge `f` is sufficient to handle all the message sending operations. If at any point `f` becomes less than or equal to the energy cost required to either keep the phone on or turn it off and on, `possible` is set to `False` and the loop breaks. Otherwise, `possible` remains `True`. The variable `f` is reduced by the cumulative sum of the minimum energy costs (`energy_cost`) for each iteration, where `energy_cost` is the smaller of `a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1])` and `b` for each `i` from 1 to `n`. The variable `i` is `n + 1` after the loop completes. The variables `arr`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `_` retain their original values. The variables `time_diff`, `energy_keep_on`, `energy_turn_off_on`, and `energy_cost` hold the values computed in the last iteration of the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function starts by reading the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`, and the list of message times `arr`.

2. **Initialization**: The function initializes a variable `possible` to `True`, which will be used to determine if it is possible to send all messages.

3. **Loop Through Messages**: The function iterates through each message time from `1` to `n` (inclusive).

4. **Calculate Time Difference**: For each message, it calculates the time difference `time_diff` between the current message time `arr[i]` and the previous message time `arr[i-1]`.

5. **Calculate Energy Costs**:
   - `energy_keep_on`: The energy cost if the phone remains on for the entire duration `time_diff`.
   - `energy_turn_off_on`: The energy cost if the phone is turned off and then turned back on.

6. **Determine Minimum Energy Cost**: The function determines the minimum energy cost between keeping the phone on and turning it off and on.

7. **Check Energy Sufficiency**: If the remaining charge `f` is less than or equal to the minimum energy cost, it sets `possible` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.

8. **Update Remaining Charge**: If the remaining charge is sufficient, it subtracts the minimum energy cost from `f`.

9. **Output Result**: After processing all messages, it prints "YES" if `possible` is still `True`, otherwise it prints "NO".

### Analysis:
- The logic correctly handles the decision between keeping the phone on and turning it off and on.
- The energy calculations are accurate and consider both scenarios.
- The function correctly updates the remaining charge and checks if it is sufficient to send the next message.
- The function handles multiple test cases as required.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct based on the problem description and the provided reasoning.

Correctness: **True**
