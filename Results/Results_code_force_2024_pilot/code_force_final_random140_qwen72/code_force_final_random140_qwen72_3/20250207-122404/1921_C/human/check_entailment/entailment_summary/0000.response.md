### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`, and the list of message times `arr`.

2. **Initialization**: The function initializes `possible` to `True`, which will be used to determine if it's possible to send all messages without the phone running out of charge.

3. **Loop Through Messages**: The function iterates through each message time from `1` to `n` (inclusive). For each message, it calculates:
   - `time_diff`: The difference in time between the current message and the previous one.
   - `energy_keep_on`: The energy cost if the phone remains on during this time.
   - `energy_turn_off_on`: The energy cost if the phone is turned off and then on again.

4. **Energy Cost Calculation**: The function then determines the minimum energy cost between keeping the phone on and turning it off and on. This is a crucial step because it ensures that the phone uses the least amount of energy possible to send the message.

5. **Check Energy**: If the remaining charge `f` is less than or equal to the minimum energy cost, the function sets `possible` to `False` and breaks out of the loop. This indicates that it's not possible to send all messages.

6. **Update Remaining Charge**: If the phone has enough charge, the function subtracts the minimum energy cost from the remaining charge `f`.

7. **Output Result**: After processing all messages, the function prints 'YES' if `possible` is still `True`, otherwise it prints 'NO'.

### Correctness:
The function appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately, ensuring that the phone can send all messages without running out of charge. The logic for determining the minimum energy cost and updating the remaining charge is sound.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **True**
