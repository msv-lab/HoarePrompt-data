### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. It reads the necessary parameters `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b` for each test case, and the list of message times `arr`.

2. **Initialization**: The program initializes `arr` with a leading zero to simplify the calculation of time differences. This is a good practice as it avoids special handling for the first message.

3. **Loop Through Messages**: The program iterates through each message time, calculating the time difference between consecutive messages and the corresponding energy costs:
   - `time_diff = arr[i] - arr[i - 1]`: This calculates the time difference between the current message and the previous one.
   - `energy_keep_on = a * time_diff`: This calculates the energy cost if the phone is kept on during the time difference.
   - `energy_turn_off_on = b`: This is the fixed energy cost for turning the phone off and on.
   - `energy_cost = min(energy_keep_on, energy_turn_off_on)`: This determines the minimum energy cost between keeping the phone on and turning it off and on.

4. **Check Energy Sufficiency**: The program checks if the remaining charge `f` is sufficient to cover the minimum energy cost. If not, it sets `possible` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
   - `if f <= energy_cost`: This condition ensures that the phone has enough charge to send the message.
   - `f -= energy_cost`: This updates the remaining charge by subtracting the minimum energy cost.

5. **Output Result**: After processing all messages, the program prints "YES" if `possible` is `True` (i.e., the phone had enough charge to send all messages), otherwise it prints "NO".

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if Stepan can send all messages without running out of charge. It handles all edge cases and follows the problem constraints.

**Correctness: **True****
