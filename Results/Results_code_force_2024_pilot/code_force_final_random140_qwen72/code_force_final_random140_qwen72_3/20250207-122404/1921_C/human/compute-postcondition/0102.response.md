To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic of the code:

### Initial State:
- `possible` is a boolean variable that is set to `True` initially.
- `f` is a variable that represents some form of energy or resource.
- `energy_cost` is calculated as `min(a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]), b)` for each iteration of the loop.
- The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n`.
- In each iteration, `f` is reduced by the cumulative sum of `energy_cost`.
- If at any point `f` becomes less than or equal to `energy_cost`, `possible` is set to `False` and the loop breaks.
- If the loop completes without `f` becoming less than or equal to `energy_cost`, `possible` remains `True`.

### Analysis:
- The loop checks if the remaining energy `f` is sufficient to cover the `energy_cost` for each step.
- If `f` is always greater than `energy_cost` throughout the loop, `possible` remains `True`.
- If `f` becomes less than or equal to `energy_cost` at any point, `possible` is set to `False` and the loop breaks.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('YES' if possible else 'NO')
```

### Explanation:
- The `print` statement will output `'YES'` if `possible` is `True`.
- The `print` statement will output `'NO'` if `possible` is `False`.

### Conclusion:
Based on the initial state and the logic described, the output will depend on whether `f` was sufficient to cover the `energy_cost` for all iterations of the loop.

Output: **'YES' if `f` was always greater than `energy_cost` throughout the loop, otherwise 'NO'**.
