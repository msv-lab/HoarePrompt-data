Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `i`, `time_diff` is `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is the minimum of `a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1])` and `b`, `possible` is `False`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
