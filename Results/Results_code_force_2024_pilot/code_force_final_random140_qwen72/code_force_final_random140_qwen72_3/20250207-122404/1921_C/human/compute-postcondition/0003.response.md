The code snippet `arr = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and then creates a new list `arr` that starts with 0 followed by these integers.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `arr` is a list starting with 0 followed by the input integers.**
