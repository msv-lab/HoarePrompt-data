Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `arr` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers input by the user, `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b` retain their original values, `i` is `n + 1`, `f` is reduced by the sum of `energy_cost` for each iteration, `energy_cost` is the minimum of `a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1])` and `b` for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `possible` is `True`, `_` is incremented by 1, and the values of `a`, `b`, and `arr` remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    time_diff = arr[i] - arr[i - 1]
    energy_keep_on = a * time_diff
    energy_turn_off_on = b
    energy_cost = min(energy_keep_on, energy_turn_off_on)
    if f <= energy_cost:
        possible = False
        break
    f -= energy_cost


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `arr` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers input by the user, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `f` is `f - min(a * arr[1], b)`, `a`, `b`, and `arr` retain their original values, `_` is incremented by 1, `time_diff` is `arr[1]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * arr[1]`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * arr[1], b)`. If `f` is less than or equal to `energy_cost`, `possible` is `False` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `possible` remains `True`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `arr` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers input by the user, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `f` is `f - min(a * (arr[2] - arr[1]), b)`, `a`, `b`, and `arr` retain their original values, `_` is incremented by 1, `time_diff` is `arr[2] - arr[1]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[2] - arr[1])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[2] - arr[1]), b)`. If `f` is less than or equal to `energy_cost`, `possible` is `False`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `possible` remains `True`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `arr` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers input by the user, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `f` is `f - min(a * (arr[3] - arr[2]), b)`, `a`, `b`, and `arr` retain their original values, `_` is incremented by 1, `time_diff` is `arr[3] - arr[2]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[3] - arr[2])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[3] - arr[2]), b)`. If `f` is less than or equal to `energy_cost`, `possible` is `False`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `possible` remains `True`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
