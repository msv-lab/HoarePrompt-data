The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i`, `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than or equal to 1. Since the loop iterates from 1 to `n` (inclusive), for the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 1. The variable `i` will start at 1.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is 1.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `f` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `arr` is a list starting with 0 followed by the input integers, `possible` is True, `i` is 1**
