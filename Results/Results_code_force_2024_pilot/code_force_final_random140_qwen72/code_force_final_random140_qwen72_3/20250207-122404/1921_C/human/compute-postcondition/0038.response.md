Output State: **`arr` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers input by the user, `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b` retain their original values, `i` is `n + 1`, `f` is reduced by the sum of `energy_cost` for each iteration, `energy_cost` is the minimum of `a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1])` and `b` for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `possible` is `True`, `_` is incremented by 1, and the values of `a`, `b`, and `arr` remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The variable `possible` is set to `True`.
- All other variables (`arr`, `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `_`) retain their original values or are updated as described in the initial state.
- The value of `possible` is now explicitly `True`.
- The value of `_` is incremented by 1.
- The rest of the conditions and values remain as specified in the initial state.
