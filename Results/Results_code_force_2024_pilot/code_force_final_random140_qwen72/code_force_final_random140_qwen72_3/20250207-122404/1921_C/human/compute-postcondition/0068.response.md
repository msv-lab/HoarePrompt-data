To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `arr` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers input by the user.
   - `n` retains its original value.
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `f` is reduced by the total of the minimum of `a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1])` and `b` for each `i` from 1 to `n`.
   - `a`, `b`, and `arr` retain their original values.
   - `_` is incremented by `n`.
   - `time_diff` is the last computed difference between consecutive elements in `arr`.
   - `energy_keep_on` is the last computed energy cost for keeping the device on.
   - `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`.
   - `energy_cost` is the last computed minimum energy cost.
   - `possible` is `False` if at any point `f` becomes less than or equal to `energy_cost`, otherwise `possible` remains `True`.

2. **Key Variables:**
   - `possible`: This variable determines whether the condition `f > energy_cost` holds true throughout the iterations. If `f` becomes less than or equal to `energy_cost` at any point, `possible` is set to `False`; otherwise, it remains `True`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('YES' if possible else 'NO')
   ```

4. **Determination:**
   - The `print` statement checks the value of `possible`.
   - If `possible` is `True`, it prints 'YES'.
   - If `possible` is `False`, it prints 'NO'.

Given the initial state, the key factor is the value of `possible` after all iterations of the loop. The value of `possible` depends on whether `f` ever becomes less than or equal to `energy_cost` during the iterations.

**Conclusion:**
- If `f` never becomes less than or equal to `energy_cost`, `possible` remains `True`, and the output will be 'YES'.
- If `f` becomes less than or equal to `energy_cost` at any point, `possible` is set to `False`, and the output will be 'NO'.

Output: **'YES' if `f` remains greater than `energy_cost` throughout the iterations, otherwise 'NO'**.
