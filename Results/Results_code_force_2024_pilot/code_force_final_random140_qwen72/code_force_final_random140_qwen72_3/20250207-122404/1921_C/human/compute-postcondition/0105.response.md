Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads four integers `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`, and a list of `n` integers representing moments when messages need to be sent. The function determines whether the phone can send all messages without running out of charge, considering the initial charge `f`, charge consumption per unit of time `a`, and charge consumption when turning the phone off and on `b`. It prints 'YES' if the phone can send all messages, otherwise 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function ends. **
