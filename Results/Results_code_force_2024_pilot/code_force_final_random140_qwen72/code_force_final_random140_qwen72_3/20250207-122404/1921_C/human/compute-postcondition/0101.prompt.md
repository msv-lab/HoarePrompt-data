Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `possible` is `True`, `arr` is updated to a list starting with 0 followed by the integers input by the user, `n` is updated to the first integer input by the user, `f` is updated to the second integer input by the user, `a` is updated to the third integer input by the user, `b` is updated to the fourth integer input by the user, `i` is `n + 1`, `f` is reduced by the total of the minimum of `a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1])` and `b` for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `a`, `b`, and `arr` retain their original values, `_` is 0, `time_diff` is the last computed difference between consecutive elements in `arr`, `energy_keep_on` is the last computed energy cost for keeping the device on, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is the last computed minimum energy cost, and `possible` is `False` if at any point `f` becomes less than or equal to `energy_cost`, otherwise `possible` remains `True`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    time_diff = arr[i] - arr[i - 1]
    energy_keep_on = a * time_diff
    energy_turn_off_on = b
    energy_cost = min(energy_keep_on, energy_turn_off_on)
    if f <= energy_cost:
        possible = False
        break
    f -= energy_cost


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `possible` is `True` or `False` depending on whether `f` is greater than `energy_cost` or not. If `f` is less than or equal to `energy_cost`, `possible` is set to `False`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `possible` remains `True`, and the program continues. `arr` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers input by the user, `n` is the first integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, `f` is the second integer input by the user, `a` is the third integer input by the user, `b` is the fourth integer input by the user, `i` is 1, `f` is now reduced by `energy_cost`, which is `min(a * (arr[1] - arr[0]), b)`, `a`, `b`, and `arr` retain their original values, `_` is 0, `time_diff` is `arr[1] - arr[0]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[1] - arr[0])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, and `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[1] - arr[0]), b)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `possible` is `True` or `False` depending on whether `f` is greater than `energy_cost` or not. `arr` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers input by the user. `n` is the first integer input by the user and must be greater than 0. `f` is the second integer input by the user reduced by `energy_cost` twice, where `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[1] - arr[0]), b)`. `a` is the third integer input by the user, and `b` is the fourth integer input by the user. `i` is 2, and `f` is now reduced by `energy_cost` twice. `a`, `b`, and `arr` retain their original values. `_` is 0, `time_diff` is `arr[1] - arr[0]` and also `arr[2] - arr[1]`. `energy_keep_on` is `a * time_diff`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, and `energy_cost` is `min(a * time_diff, b)`. If `f` is less than or equal to `energy_cost`, `possible` is set to `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `possible` is `True` or `False` depending on whether `f` is greater than `energy_cost` or not. If `f` is less than or equal to `energy_cost`, `possible` is set to `False` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `possible` remains `True`. `arr` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers input by the user, `n` is the first integer input by the user and must be greater than or equal to 3, `f` is the second integer input by the user reduced by `energy_cost` three times, `a` is the third integer input by the user, `b` is the fourth integer input by the user, `i` is 3, `a`, `b`, and `arr` retain their original values, `_` is 0, `time_diff` is `arr[3] - arr[2]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[3] - arr[2])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[3] - arr[2]), b)`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
