Output State: **`possible` is `True`, `arr` is updated to a list starting with 0 followed by the integers input by the user, `n` is updated to the first integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, `f` is updated to the second integer input by the user, `a` is updated to the third integer input by the user, `b` is updated to the fourth integer input by the user, `i` is 1, `f` is reduced by the total of the minimum of `a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1])` and `b` for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `a`, `b`, and `arr` retain their original values, `_` is 0, `time_diff` is `arr[1] - arr[0]`, `energy_keep_on` is the last computed energy cost for keeping the device on, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is the last computed minimum energy cost, and `possible` is `False` if at any point `f` becomes less than or equal to `energy_cost`, otherwise `possible` remains `True`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `time_diff` is calculated as `arr[1] - arr[0]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
