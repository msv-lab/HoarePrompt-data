Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `i`, `time_diff` is `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is the minimum of `a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1])` and `b`, `possible` is `False`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `possible` is set to `False`.
- All other variables (`i`, `n`, `time_diff`, `energy_keep_on`, `energy_turn_off_on`, `energy_cost`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
