Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `i + 1`, `time_diff` is `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is the minimum of `a * (arr[i + 1] - arr[i])` and `b`. If `f` is less than or equal to `energy_cost`, `possible` is `False`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. `f` is reduced by `energy_cost`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `energy_turn_off_on = b` assigns the value of `b` to `energy_turn_off_on`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
- Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `energy_turn_off_on` while keeping all other variables and conditions the same as in the initial state.
