Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `arr` remains a list starting with 0 followed by the integers input by the user, `n` retains its original value, `i` is `n + 1`, `f` is reduced by the total of the minimum of `a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1])` and `b` for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `a`, `b`, and `arr` retain their original values, `_` is incremented by `n`, `time_diff` is the last computed difference between consecutive elements in `arr`, `energy_keep_on` is the last computed energy cost for keeping the device on, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is the last computed minimum energy cost, and `possible` is `False` if at any point `f` becomes less than or equal to `energy_cost`, otherwise `possible` remains `True`.**
