Output State: **`arr` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers input by the user, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `f`, `a`, `b`, and `arr` retain their original values, `possible` is `True`, `_` is incremented by 1, `time_diff` is `arr[1]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * arr[1]`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * arr[1], b)`**. 

The `energy_cost` is calculated as the minimum value between `energy_keep_on` (which is `a * arr[1]`) and `energy_turn_off_on` (which is `b`). All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
