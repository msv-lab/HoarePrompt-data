Output State: **`arr` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers input by the user, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `f`, `a`, `b`, and `arr` retain their original values, `possible` is `True`, `_` is incremented by 1, `time_diff` is `arr[1] - arr[0]` (which simplifies to `arr[1]` since `arr[0]` is 0).**

Explanation:
- `time_diff` is calculated as `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]`.
- Given `i` is 1, `time_diff` becomes `arr[1] - arr[0]`.
- Since `arr[0]` is 0, `time_diff` simplifies to `arr[1]`.
- All other variables retain their original values as specified in the initial state.
