Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `f` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `arr` is a list starting with 0 followed by the input integers, `possible` is True, `i` is 1, `time_diff` is `a`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * a`.**

Explanation: The variable `energy_keep_on` is assigned the value of `a * time_diff`. Since `time_diff` is `a`, `energy_keep_on` becomes `a * a`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
