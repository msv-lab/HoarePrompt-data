Postcondition: **`possible` is `True`, `arr` is updated to a list starting with 0 followed by the integers input by the user, `n` is updated to the first integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, `f` is updated to the second integer input by the user, `a` is updated to the third integer input by the user, `b` is updated to the fourth integer input by the user, `i` is 1, `f` is reduced by the total of the minimum of `a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1])` and `b` for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `a`, `b`, and `arr` retain their original values, `_` is 0, `time_diff` is `arr[1] - arr[0]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[1] - arr[0])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[1] - arr[0]), b)`, and `f` is less than or equal to `energy_cost`, so `possible` is now `False`.**
