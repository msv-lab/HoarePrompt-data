To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic of the code:

### Initial State:
- `i` is `n + 1` after all iterations.
- `f` is reduced by the sum of `energy_cost` for each iteration, where `energy_cost` is the minimum of `a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1])` and `b` for each `i` from 1 to `n`.
- If at any point `f` becomes less than or equal to `energy_cost`, `possible` is set to `False` and the loop breaks.
- Otherwise, `possible` remains `True`.
- The values of `a`, `b`, and `arr` remain unchanged.

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Iteration**:
   - For each `i` from 1 to `n`, the `energy_cost` is calculated as the minimum of `a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1])` and `b`.
   - `f` is then reduced by this `energy_cost`.

2. **Condition Check**:
   - If at any point `f` becomes less than or equal to `energy_cost`, `possible` is set to `False` and the loop breaks.
   - If the loop completes without `f` becoming less than or equal to `energy_cost`, `possible` remains `True`.

3. **Final State**:
   - After the loop, `i` is `n + 1`.
   - The value of `possible` will be either `True` or `False` based on the conditions described.

### Print Statement:
- The `print` statement checks the value of `possible` and prints 'YES' if `possible` is `True`, otherwise it prints 'NO'.

### Conclusion:
- If `f` was always greater than `energy_cost` throughout the loop, `possible` will be `True` and the output will be 'YES'.
- If `f` became less than or equal to `energy_cost` at any point, `possible` will be `False` and the output will be 'NO'.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, `arr`, and `f` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact outcome. However, based on the logic described, the output will be determined by the final value of `possible`.

Output: **'YES' if possible is True, otherwise 'NO' (where possible is determined by the conditions described in the initial state)**
