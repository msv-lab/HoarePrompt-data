Postcondition: **`possible` is `True` or `False` depending on whether `f` is greater than `energy_cost` or not. `arr` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers input by the user. `n` is the first integer input by the user and must be greater than 0. `f` is the second integer input by the user reduced by `energy_cost`, where `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[1] - arr[0]), b)`. `a` is the third integer input by the user, and `b` is the fourth integer input by the user. `i` is 2, and `f` is now reduced by `energy_cost`. `a`, `b`, and `arr` retain their original values. `_` is 0, `time_diff` is `arr[1] - arr[0]` and also `arr[2] - arr[1]`. `energy_keep_on` is `a * time_diff`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, and `energy_cost` is `min(a * time_diff, b)`. If `f` is less than or equal to `energy_cost`, `possible` is set to `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
