Output State: **After all iterations, `possible` is `True` or `False` depending on whether `f` is greater than `energy_cost` or not throughout the loop. If at any point `f` becomes less than or equal to `energy_cost`, `possible` is set to `False` and the loop breaks. Otherwise, `possible` remains `True`. The variable `f` is reduced by the cumulative sum of `energy_cost` for each iteration, where `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]), b)` for each `i` from 1 to `n`. The variable `i` is `n + 1` after the loop completes. The variables `arr`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `_` retain their original values. The variables `time_diff`, `energy_keep_on`, `energy_turn_off_on`, and `energy_cost` hold the values computed in the last iteration of the loop.**
