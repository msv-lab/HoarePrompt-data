The value of `f` is reduced by `energy_cost`. All other variables remain unchanged. Since `energy_cost` is defined as `min(a * (arr[3] - arr[2]), b)`, the new value of `f` is `f - min(a * (arr[3] - arr[2]), b)`.

Output State: **`possible` is `True` or `False` depending on whether `f` is greater than `energy_cost` or not. If `f` is less than or equal to `energy_cost`, `possible` is set to `False` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `possible` remains `True`. `arr` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers input by the user, `n` is the first integer input by the user and must be greater than or equal to 3, `f` is the second integer input by the user reduced by `energy_cost` three times, `a` is the third integer input by the user, `b` is the fourth integer input by the user, `i` is 3, `a`, `b`, and `arr` retain their original values, `_` is 0, `time_diff` is `arr[3] - arr[2]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[3] - arr[2])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[3] - arr[2]), b)`.**
