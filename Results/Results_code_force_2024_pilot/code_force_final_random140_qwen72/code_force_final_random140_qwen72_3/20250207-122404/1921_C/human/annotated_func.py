#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of four integers n, f, a, b where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ f, a, b ≤ 10^9, representing the number of messages, the initial phone's charge, the charge consumption per unit of time, and the consumption when turned off and on sequentially, respectively. Additionally, there is a list of n integers m_1, m_2, ..., m_n where 1 ≤ m_i ≤ 10^9 and m_i < m_{i+1}, representing the moments at which messages need to be sent. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, f, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        arr = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        possible = True
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            time_diff = arr[i] - arr[i - 1]
            energy_keep_on = a * time_diff
            energy_turn_off_on = b
            energy_cost = min(energy_keep_on, energy_turn_off_on)
            if f <= energy_cost:
                possible = False
                break
            f -= energy_cost
        
        print('YES' if possible else 'NO')
        
    #State: After all iterations, `possible` is `True` or `False` depending on whether the phone's charge `f` is sufficient to handle all the message sending operations. If at any point `f` becomes less than or equal to the energy cost required to either keep the phone on or turn it off and on, `possible` is set to `False` and the loop breaks. Otherwise, `possible` remains `True`. The variable `f` is reduced by the cumulative sum of the minimum energy costs (`energy_cost`) for each iteration, where `energy_cost` is the smaller of `a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1])` and `b` for each `i` from 1 to `n`. The variable `i` is `n + 1` after the loop completes. The variables `arr`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `_` retain their original values. The variables `time_diff`, `energy_keep_on`, `energy_turn_off_on`, and `energy_cost` hold the values computed in the last iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads four integers `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`, and a list of `n` integers representing moments when messages need to be sent. The function determines whether the phone can send all messages without running out of charge, considering the initial charge `f`, charge consumption per unit of time `a`, and charge consumption when turning the phone off and on `b`. It prints 'YES' if the phone can send all messages, otherwise 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function ends.
