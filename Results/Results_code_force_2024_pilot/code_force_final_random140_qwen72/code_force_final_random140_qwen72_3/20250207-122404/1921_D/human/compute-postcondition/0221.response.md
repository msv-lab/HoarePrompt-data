The value of `ans` is incremented by the value of `dif1`. Since `dif1` is defined as `abs(a[a1] - b[b1])`, the new value of `ans` is the previous value of `ans` plus `abs(a[a1] - b[b1])`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a1` is less than or equal to `a2`, `a2` retains its value from the previous iteration, `b1`, `b2`, `ans` is updated to `ans + abs(a[a1] - b[b1])`, `t` is decremented by 1 and remains greater than or equal to 0, `dif1` is now `abs(a[a1] - b[b1])`, `dif2` is now `abs(a[a1] - b[b2])`, `dif3` is now `abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`, `dif4` is now `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`.**
