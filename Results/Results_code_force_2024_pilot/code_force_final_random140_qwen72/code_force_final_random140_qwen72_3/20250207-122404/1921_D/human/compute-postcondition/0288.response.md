Output State: **`a1` is 0, `a2` is `n - 1`, `b1` is 0, `b2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences between elements of `a` and `b` for each iteration, `t` is `t - 1`, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `b` is a list of integers provided by the user input.**

Explanation: The code snippet `b2 = m - 1` updates the value of `b2` to `m - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
