Postcondition: ***`a1` is less than or equal to `a2`, `a2` retains its value from the previous iteration (but may be decremented by 1 if `dif4 > dif2`), `b1`, `b2`, `ans`, and `t` are updated based on the comparisons between `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4`. If `dif4 > dif2`, `ans` is increased by `dif4`, and `b2` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `a1` is incremented by 1, `ans` is increased by `dif2`, and `b2` is decremented by 1.***
