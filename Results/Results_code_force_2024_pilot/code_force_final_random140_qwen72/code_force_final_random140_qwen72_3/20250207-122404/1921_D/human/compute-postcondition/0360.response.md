Output State: **`dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1+1]` and `b[b1]`; `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1+1]` and `b[b2]`; `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`; `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`; `a1` is `a1 + 1`; `a2`, `b2`, and `t` remain unchanged; `b1` is `b1 + 1`; `ans` is now `ans + dif1`.**
