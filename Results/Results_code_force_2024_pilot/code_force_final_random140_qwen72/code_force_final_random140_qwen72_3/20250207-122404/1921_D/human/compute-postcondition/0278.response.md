Output State: **`a1` is `n`, `a2` is `n - 1`, `b1` is `m`, `b2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences between elements of `a` and `b` for each iteration, and `t` is `t - k` where `k` is the number of iterations executed.**

### Explanation:
- **`a1` and `a2`**: After all iterations, `a1` will be equal to `n` (since it increments until it exceeds `a2`). Similarly, `a2` will be `n - 1` (it starts at `n - 1` and decrements until `a1` exceeds it).
- **`b1` and `b2`**: `b1` will be equal to `m` (since it increments until it exceeds `b2`). Similarly, `b2` will be `m - 1` (it starts at `m - 1` and decrements until `b1` exceeds it).
- **`ans`**: This variable accumulates the sum of the maximum absolute differences (`dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, `dif4`) chosen during each iteration of the loop.
- **`t`**: The value of `t` is decremented by the number of iterations `k` that the loop executes. Since `t` is initially `t - 1` and it is decremented by 1 for each iteration, after `k` iterations, `t` will be `t - k`.

This final state reflects the complete execution of the loop, where all possible comparisons and updates have been performed, and the loop has terminated because `a1` is no longer less than or equal to `a2`.
