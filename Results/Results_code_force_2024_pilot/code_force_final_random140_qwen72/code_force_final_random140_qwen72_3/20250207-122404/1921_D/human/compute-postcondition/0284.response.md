The code `b = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `b`.

Given the initial state:
- `a1` is the new value of `n`
- `a2` is the new value of `n - 1`
- `b1` is the new value of `m`
- `b2` is the new value of `m - 1`
- `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences between elements of `a` and `b` for each iteration
- `t` is `t - 1`
- `a` is a list of integers provided by the user input

After executing the code:
- `b` is now a list of integers provided by the user input.

The values of `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, `b2`, `ans`, and `t` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a1` is the new value of `n`, `a2` is the new value of `n - 1`, `b1` is the new value of `m`, `b2` is the new value of `m - 1`, `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences between elements of `a` and `b` for each iteration, `t` is `t - 1`, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `b` is a list of integers provided by the user input.**
