Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer input by the user, where 0 ≤ t ≤ 99; `n` and `m` are integers input by the user, where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a_i` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `b_i` is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9; the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user; `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `a1` is 0; `a2` is `n - 1`; `b1` is 0; `b2` is `m - 1`; `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while a1 <= a2:
    dif1 = abs(a[a1] - b[b1])
    dif2 = abs(a[a1] - b[b2])
    dif3 = abs(a[a2] - b[b1])
    dif4 = abs(a[a2] - b[b2])
    if dif1 > dif2:
        if dif3 > dif4:
            if dif3 > dif1:
                ans += dif3
                a2 -= 1
                b1 += 1
            else:
                ans += dif1
                a1 += 1
                b1 += 1
        elif dif4 > dif1:
            ans += dif4
            a2 -= 1
            b2 -= 1
        else:
            ans += dif1
            a1 += 1
            b1 += 1
    elif dif3 > dif4:
        if dif3 > dif2:
            ans += dif3
            a2 -= 1
            b1 += 1
        else:
            ans += dif2
            a1 += 1
            b2 -= 1
    elif dif4 > dif2:
        ans += dif4
        a2 -= 1
        b2 -= 1
    else:
        ans += dif2
        a1 += 1
        b2 -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Given the initial conditions, after the execution of the if-else block, the following holds: `t` is an integer input by the user, where 0 ≤ t ≤ 99; `n` and `m` are integers input by the user, where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a_i` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `b_i` is a list of `m` integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9; the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user; `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `dif1` is the absolute difference between the first elements of `a` and `b`; `dif2` is the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the last element of `b`; `dif3` is the absolute difference between the last element of `a` and the first element of `b`; `dif4` is the absolute difference between the last elements of `a` and `b`. If `dif1 > dif2`: 
- If `dif3 > dif4`, then:
  - If `dif3 > dif1`, `a1` is 0, `a2` is `n - 2`, `b1` is 1, `b2` is `m - 1`, and `ans` is `dif3`.
  - Otherwise, `a1` is 1, `a2` is `n - 1`, `b1` is 1, `b2` is `m - 1`, and `ans` is `dif1`.
- If `dif3 ≤ dif4`, then:
  - If `dif4 > dif1`, `a1` is 0, `a2` is `n - 2`, `b1` is 0, `b2` is `m - 2`, and `ans` is `dif4`.
  - Otherwise, `a1` is 1, `a2` is `n - 1`, `b1` is 1, `b2` is `m - 1`, and `ans` is `dif1`.
If `dif1 ≤ dif2`:
- If `dif3 > dif4`, then `a1` is 0, `a2` is `n - 2`, `b1` is 1, `b2` is `m - 1`, and `ans` is `dif3`.
- If `dif3 ≤ dif4`, then:
  - If `dif4 ≤ dif2`, `a1` is 1, `a2` is `n - 1`, `b1` is 0, `b2` is `m - 2`, and `ans` is `dif2`.
  - If `dif4 > dif2`, `a1` is 0, `a2` is `n - 2`, `b1` is 0, `b2` is `m - 2`, and `ans` is `dif4`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` are the absolute differences between elements at specified indices of lists `a` and `b`. If `dif1 > dif2`, and `dif3 > dif4`, and `dif3 > dif1`, `ans` is increased by the value of `dif3`, `a2` is decreased by 1, and `b1` is increased by 1. If `dif1 > dif2`, and `dif3 > dif4`, but `dif3 ≤ dif1`, `ans` is incremented by `dif1`, `a1` is incremented by 1, and `b1` is incremented by 1. If `dif1 > dif2`, and `dif3 ≤ dif4`, and `dif4 > dif1`, `ans` is increased by `dif4`, `a2` is decreased by 1, and `b2` is decreased by 1. If `dif1 > dif2`, and `dif3 ≤ dif4`, and `dif4 ≤ dif1`, `a1` is increased by 1, `dif3` is the absolute difference between the element at index `a2` of list `a` and the element at index `b1 + 1` of list `b`, `ans` is increased by the value of `dif1`, and `b1` is increased by 1. If `dif1 ≤ dif2`, and `dif3 > dif4`, `ans` is increased by the value of `dif3`, `a2` is decreased by 1, and `b1` is increased by 1. If `dif1 ≤ dif2`, and `dif4 > dif2`, `ans` is increased by `dif4`, `a2` is decreased by 1, and `b2` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `a1` is increased by 1, `b2` is decreased by 1, and `ans` is increased by the original `dif2`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` are the absolute differences between the specified elements of arrays `a` and `b`. After the if-else block executes, `ans` is updated based on the maximum of `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4`. If `dif1 > dif2`, `ans` is increased by either `dif3` or `dif4` depending on which is greater, and the indices `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, and `b2` are adjusted accordingly. If `dif1 <= dif2`, `ans` is increased by either `dif2` or `dif4` depending on which is greater, and the indices `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, and `b2` are adjusted accordingly. In all cases, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` are updated to reflect the new values of `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, and `b2`, and `a1` must be less than or equal to `a2` for the loop to execute one more time.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
