The value of `b1` is incremented by 1. The values of `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, `dif4`, `a1`, `a2`, and `ans` remain unchanged. The conditions `a1` is less than or equal to `a2` and `ans` is increased by the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]` are still valid. 

Output State: **`dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`, `a1` is less than or equal to `a2`, `ans` is increased by the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`, `a2` is decreased by 1, `b1` is increased by 1.**
