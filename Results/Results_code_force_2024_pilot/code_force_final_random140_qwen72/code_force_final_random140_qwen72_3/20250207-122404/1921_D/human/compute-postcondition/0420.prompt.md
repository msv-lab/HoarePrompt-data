You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; for each test case, n and m are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5; a_i is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; b_i is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9.

    #State: *t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; for each test case, n and m are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5; a_i is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; b_i is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. If the script is executed as the main module, `a1` is set to `n`, `a2` is set to -1, `b1` is set to `m`, `b2` is set to -1, and `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences between elements of `a` and `b` chosen during the loop for all test cases.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `t` (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100) indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `m` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the sizes of two lists, and two lists `a_i` and `b_i` of integers (where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9). The function returns a result based on the processing of these inputs, with the constraint that the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
