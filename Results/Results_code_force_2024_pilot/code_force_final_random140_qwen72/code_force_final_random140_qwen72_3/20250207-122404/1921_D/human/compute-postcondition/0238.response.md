Output State: **`a1` is incremented by 1, `a1` is now less than or equal to `a2`, `a2` retains its value from the previous iteration, `b1`, `b2`, `ans`, and `t` are updated based on the comparisons between `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` as described, `t` is decremented by 1 and remains greater than or equal to 0, `dif1` is now `abs(a[a1] - b[b1])`, `dif2` is now `abs(a[a1] - b[b2])`, `dif3` is now `abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`, `dif4` is now `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`, `ans` is increased by `abs(a[a1] - b[b2])`, `b2` is decremented by 1.**

Explanation:
- `b2` is decremented by 1, so its new value is `b2 - 1`.
- All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged as specified in the initial state.
