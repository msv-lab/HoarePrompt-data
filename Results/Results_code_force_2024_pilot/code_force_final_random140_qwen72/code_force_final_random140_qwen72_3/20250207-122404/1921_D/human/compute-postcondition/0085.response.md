Postcondition: ***`dif2` is the absolute difference between the element at index `a1` of list `a` and the element at index `b2` of list `b`; `dif3` is the absolute difference between the element at index `a2` of list `a` and the element at index `b1` of list `b`; `dif4` is the absolute difference between the element at index `a2` of list `a` and the element at index `b2` of list `b`. If `dif4` > `dif1`, `ans` is increased by `dif4`, `a2` is decreased by 1, and `b2` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `a1` is increased by 1, `dif3` is the absolute difference between the element at index `a2` of list `a` and the element at index `b1 + 1` of list `b`, `ans` is increased by the value of `dif1`, and `b1` is increased by 1.***
