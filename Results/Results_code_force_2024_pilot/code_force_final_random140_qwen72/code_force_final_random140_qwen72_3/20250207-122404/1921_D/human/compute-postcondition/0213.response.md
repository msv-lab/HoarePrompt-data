Output State: **`a1` is less than or equal to `a2 - 1`, `a2` is decremented by 1, `b1` is incremented by 1, `b2` retains its value, `ans` is now `ans + abs(a[a2 - 1] - b[b1])`, `t` is decremented by 1 and remains greater than or equal to 0, `dif1` is now `abs(a[a1] - b[b1])`, `dif2` is now `abs(a[a1] - b[b2])`, `dif3` is now `abs(a[a2 - 1] - b[b1])`, `dif4` is now `abs(a[a2 - 1] - b[b2])`.**

Explanation:
- `b1` is incremented by 1.
- All other variables (`a1`, `a2`, `b2`, `ans`, `t`, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, `dif4`) retain their values or are updated based on the conditions described in the initial state.
