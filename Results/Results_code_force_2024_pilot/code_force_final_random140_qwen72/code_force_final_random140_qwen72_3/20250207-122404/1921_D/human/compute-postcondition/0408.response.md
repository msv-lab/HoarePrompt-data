Output State: **`dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2 + 1]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2 - 1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2 - 1]` and `b[b2 + 1]`, `a1` is less than or equal to `a2 - 1`, `ans` is increased by `dif4`, `a2` is decreased by 1, `b2` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `b2` is decremented by 1.
- All other variables (`dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, `dif4`, `a1`, `a2`, and `ans`) remain unchanged except for their dependencies on `b2`.
- Since `b2` is now `b2 - 1`, the expressions involving `b2` (specifically `dif2` and `dif4`) now refer to the new value of `b2`. Therefore, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2 + 1]`, and `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2 - 1]` and `b[b2 + 1]`.
- The conditions `a1` is less than or equal to `a2 - 1` and `ans` is increased by `dif4` remain valid.
