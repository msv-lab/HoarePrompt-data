Output State: **`a1` is 0, `a2` is `n - 1`, `b1` is 0, `b2` is -1, `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences between elements of `a` and `b` as determined by the loop logic, `t` is `t - 1` (which is still greater than or equal to 0), `n` is the first integer from input, `m` is the second integer from input, `a` is a list of integers from the new input, `b` is a list of integers from the new input.**

Explanation:
- The value of `b1` is updated to 0.
- All other variables (`a1`, `a2`, `b2`, `ans`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
