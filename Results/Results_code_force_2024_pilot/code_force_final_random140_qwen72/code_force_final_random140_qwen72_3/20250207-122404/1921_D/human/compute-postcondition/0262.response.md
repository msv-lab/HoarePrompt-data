Output State: **`a1` is less than or equal to `a2`, `a2` retains its value from the previous iteration, `b1`, `b2`, `ans`, and `t` are updated based on the comparisons between `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`, `ans` is now `ans + dif3`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is incremented by the value of `dif3`.
- `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`.
- All other variables (`a1`, `a2`, `b1`, `b2`, `t`, `dif1`, `dif2`, and `dif4`) remain unchanged.
- The conditions and relationships between the variables specified in the initial state are still valid.
