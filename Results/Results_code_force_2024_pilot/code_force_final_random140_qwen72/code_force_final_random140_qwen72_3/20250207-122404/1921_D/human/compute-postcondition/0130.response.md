The value of `ans` is incremented by the value of `dif4`. The values of `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, `a1`, and `a2` remain unchanged. The condition that `a1` must be less than or equal to `a2` for the loop to execute one more time remains valid.

Output State: **`dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`; `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`; `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`; `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`; `a1` must be less than or equal to `a2` for the loop to execute one more time; `ans` is increased by `dif4`.**
