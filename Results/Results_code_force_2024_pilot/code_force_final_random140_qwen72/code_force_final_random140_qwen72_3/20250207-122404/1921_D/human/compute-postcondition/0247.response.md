The code snippet `ans += dif3` updates the value of `ans` by adding the value of `dif3` to it. `dif3` is defined as the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`.

Given the initial state:
- `a1` is less than or equal to `a2`
- `a2` retains its value from the previous iteration
- `b1`, `b2`, `ans`, and `t` are updated based on the comparisons between `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4`
- `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`
- `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`
- `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`
- `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`

After executing the code snippet:
- `ans` is updated to `ans + dif3`
- All other conditions and values remain unchanged

Output State: **`a1` is less than or equal to `a2`, `a2` retains its value from the previous iteration, `b1`, `b2`, `ans` is updated to `ans + dif3`, and `t` are updated based on the comparisons between `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`.**
