Postcondition: ***`dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` are the absolute differences between the specified elements of arrays `a` and `b`. After the if-else block executes, `ans` is updated based on the maximum of `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4`. If `dif1 > dif2`, `ans` is increased by either `dif3` or `dif4` depending on which is greater, and the indices `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, and `b2` are adjusted accordingly. If `dif1 <= dif2`, `ans` is increased by either `dif2` or `dif4` depending on which is greater, and the indices `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, and `b2` are adjusted accordingly. In all cases, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` are updated to reflect the new values of `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, and `b2`, and `a1` must be less than or equal to `a2` for the loop to execute one more time.***
