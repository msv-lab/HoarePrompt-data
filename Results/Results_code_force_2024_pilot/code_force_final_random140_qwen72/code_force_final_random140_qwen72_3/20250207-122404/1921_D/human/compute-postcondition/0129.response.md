Postcondition: **`dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` are updated based on the new values of `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, and `b2`. If `dif3 > dif2`, `a2` is decremented by 1, `ans` is incremented by the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`, and `b1` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `a1` is incremented by 1, `ans` is incremented by `dif2`, and `b2` is decremented by 1. In both cases, `a1` must be less than or equal to `a2` for the loop to execute one more time.**
