Output State: **`a1` is incremented by 1, `a1` is now less than or equal to `a2`, `a2` retains its value from the previous iteration, `b1` is incremented by 1, `b2` retains its value from the previous iteration, `ans` is now `ans + abs(a[a1] - b[b1])`, `t` is decremented by 1 and remains greater than or equal to 0, `dif1` is now `abs(a[a1] - b[b1])`, `dif2` is now `abs(a[a1] - b[b2])`, `dif3` is now `abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`, `dif4` is now `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`.**
