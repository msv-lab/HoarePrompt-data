Postcondition: ***`a1`, `a2`, `b1`, `b2`, `ans`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` retain their initial properties as described in the precondition. If `dif3` > `dif1`, then `a1` is 0, `a2` is `n - 2`, `b1` is 1, `b2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is `dif3`, and `t` is `t - 1`. Otherwise, `a1` is 1, `a2` is `n - 1`, `b1` is 1, `b2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is `dif1`, and `t` is `t - 1`.***
