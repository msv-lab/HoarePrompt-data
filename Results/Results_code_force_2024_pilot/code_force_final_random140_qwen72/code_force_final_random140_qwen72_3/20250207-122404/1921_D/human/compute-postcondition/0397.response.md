Postcondition: ***`dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` are the absolute differences as initially defined. If `dif4 > dif1`, then `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2+1]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2-1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2-1]` and `b[b2+1]`, `a1` is less than or equal to `a2-1`, `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus the absolute difference between `a[a2-1]` and `b[b2+1]`, and `b2` is `b2 - 1`. Otherwise, `a1` is `a1 + 1`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1-1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1-1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`, `a1` is less than or equal to `a2`, `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus the absolute difference between `a[a1-1]` and `b[b1]`, and `b1` is `b1 + 1`.***
