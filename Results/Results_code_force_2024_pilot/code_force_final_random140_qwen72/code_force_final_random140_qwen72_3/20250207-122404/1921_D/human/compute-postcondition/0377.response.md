Postcondition: ***`dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` are updated based on the new values of `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, and `b2`. If `dif3 > dif4`, and `dif3 > dif2`, `a1` and `b1` are increased by 1, `a2` is decreased by 1, and `ans` is increased by the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1+1]`. If `dif3 > dif4`, but `dif3 <= dif2`, `a1` is increased by 1, `b2` is decreased by 1, and `ans` is increased by `dif2`. If `dif3 <= dif4`, and `dif4 > dif2`, `a1` and `a2` are decreased by 1, `b1` and `b2` are decreased by 1, `t` remains unchanged, and `ans` is increased by `dif4`. If `dif3 <= dif4`, but `dif4 <= dif2`, `a1` is increased by 1, `a2`, `b1`, and `t` remain unchanged, `ans` is increased by the absolute difference between `a[a1-1]` and `b[b2]`, and `b2` is decreased by 1.***
