Output State: **`a1` is incremented by 1, `a1` is now greater than its previous value, `a2` retains its value from the previous iteration, `b1` is incremented by 1, `b2` retains its value from the previous iteration, `ans` is increased by `dif1`, `t` retains its value from the previous iteration, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`.**
