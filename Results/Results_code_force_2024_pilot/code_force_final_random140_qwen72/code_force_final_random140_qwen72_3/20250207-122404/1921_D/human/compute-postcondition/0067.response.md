To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop head, which is `a1 <= a2`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `a1` and `a2` are the indices used to control the loop.
- The loop will continue as long as `a1` is less than or equal to `a2`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the values of `a1` and `a2` are:
- `a1` is either 0 or 1.
- `a2` is either `n - 2` or `n - 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `a1 <= a2` must still hold true. This means that `a1` should not exceed `a2`.

Since the loop condition is based solely on `a1` and `a2`, no other variables need to be adjusted. The current values of `a1` and `a2` already satisfy the condition `a1 <= a2`, so no changes are necessary.

Therefore, the state remains the same:
State: **`t` is an integer input by the user, where 0 ≤ t ≤ 99; `n` and `m` are integers input by the user, where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a_i` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `b_i` is a list of `m` integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9; the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user; `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `dif1` is the absolute difference between the first elements of `a` and `b`; `dif2` is the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the last element of `b`; `dif3` is the absolute difference between the last element of `a` and the first element of `b`; `dif4` is the absolute difference between the last elements of `a` and `b`; `a1` is either 0 or 1, `a2` is either `n - 2` or `n - 1`, and `ans` is set according to the conditions described.**
