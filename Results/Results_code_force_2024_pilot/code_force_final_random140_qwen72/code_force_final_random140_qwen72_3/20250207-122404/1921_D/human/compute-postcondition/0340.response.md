Postcondition: ***`a1`, `a2`, `b1`, `b2`, `ans`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` retain their initial properties as described in the precondition. If `dif4` is greater than `dif2`, then `a1` is 0, `a2` is `n - 2`, `b1` is 0, `b2` is `m - 2`, and `ans` is set to `dif4`. If `dif4` is less than or equal to `dif2`, then `a1` is 1, `a2` is `n - 1`, `b1` is 0, `b2` is `m - 2`, and `ans` is set to `dif2`. In both cases, `t` is decremented by 1.***
