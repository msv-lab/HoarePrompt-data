The value of `t` is decremented by 1. Since `t` must be greater than 0 initially, after decrementing, `t` will be one less than its initial value. The other variables (`a1`, `a2`, `b1`, `b2`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a1` is `n`, `a2` is `-1`, `b1` is `m`, `b2` is `-1`, `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences between elements of `a` and `b` as determined by the loop logic, and `t` is `t - 1` (which is still greater than or equal to 0).**
