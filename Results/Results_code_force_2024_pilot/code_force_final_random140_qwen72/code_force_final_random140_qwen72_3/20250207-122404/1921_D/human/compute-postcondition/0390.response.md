Postcondition: ***`dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`, `a1` is less than or equal to `a2`. If `dif3` > `dif1`, `ans` is increased by the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`, `a2` is decreased by 1, and `b1` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is increased by the absolute difference between `a[a1-1]` and `b[b1-1]`, `a1` is increased by 1, and `b1` is increased by 1.***
