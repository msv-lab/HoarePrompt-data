Output State: **`dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`, `dif4` is unchanged, `a1` is less than or equal to `a2`.** 

The code assigns the absolute difference between the elements `a[a2]` and `b[b1]` to `dif3`. The values of `dif1`, `dif2`, and `dif4` remain unchanged, and `a1` is still less than or equal to `a2`.
