The value of `ans` is incremented by the value of `dif2`. The value of `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`. The other variables (`dif1`, `dif3`, `dif4`, `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, `b2`) remain unchanged. The condition that `a1` is less than or equal to `a2` still holds.

Output State: **`ans` is increased by the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`; `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`; `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`; `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`; `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`; `a1` is less than or equal to `a2`.**
