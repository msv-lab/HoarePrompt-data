Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user, where 0 ≤ t ≤ 99; `n` and `m` are integers input by the user, where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a_i` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `b_i` is a list of `m` integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9; the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user; `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `dif1` is the absolute difference between the first elements of `a` and `b`; `dif2` is the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the last element of `b`; `dif3` is the absolute difference between the last element of `a` and the first element of `b`; `dif4` is the absolute difference between the last elements of `a` and `b`; `a1` is either 0 or 1, `a2` is either `n - 2` or `n - 1`, and `ans` is set according to the conditions described.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet updates the value of `dif1` to be the absolute difference between the elements `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`.
- Since `a1` is either 0 or 1, `a[a1]` will be either the first or second element of the list `a`.
- Similarly, `b1` is not defined in the initial state, but assuming it is similar to `a1` (either 0 or 1), `b[b1]` will be either the first or second element of the list `b`.
- The value of `dif1` is now the absolute difference between these two elements.
- All other variables and their properties remain unchanged.
