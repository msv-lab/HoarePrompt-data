Output State: **`a1` is `n`, `a2` is `-1`, `b1` is `m`, `b2` is `-1`, and `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences between elements of `a` and `b` as determined by the loop logic.**

### Explanation:
- The loop continues to execute as long as `a1` is less than or equal to `a2`. This means that the loop will terminate when `a1` becomes greater than `a2`.
- During each iteration, the loop updates the indices `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, and `b2` based on the maximum absolute difference (`dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, `dif4`) between the current elements of `a` and `b`.
- As the loop progresses, `a1` and `b1` are incremented, while `a2` and `b2` are decremented, effectively moving through the lists `a` and `b`.
- When the loop terminates, `a1` will be `n` (one past the end of the list `a`), and `a2` will be `-1` (one before the start of the list `a`). Similarly, `b1` will be `m` (one past the end of the list `b`), and `b2` will be `-1` (one before the start of the list `b`).
- The variable `ans` will contain the sum of the maximum absolute differences calculated during each iteration of the loop. This sum represents the total accumulated value of the largest differences between the elements of `a` and `b` as determined by the loop logic.
