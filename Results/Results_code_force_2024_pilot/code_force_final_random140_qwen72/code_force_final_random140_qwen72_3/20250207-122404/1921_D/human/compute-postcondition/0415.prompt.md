Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a1` is 0, `a2` is `n - 1`, `b1` is 0, `b2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `t` is `t - 1`, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user input, `b` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user input.
Code of the loop:
while a1 <= a2:
    dif1 = abs(a[a1] - b[b1])
    dif2 = abs(a[a1] - b[b2])
    dif3 = abs(a[a2] - b[b1])
    dif4 = abs(a[a2] - b[b2])
    if dif1 > dif2:
        if dif3 > dif4:
            if dif3 > dif1:
                ans += dif3
                a2 -= 1
                b1 += 1
            else:
                ans += dif1
                a1 += 1
                b1 += 1
        elif dif4 > dif1:
            ans += dif4
            a2 -= 1
            b2 -= 1
        else:
            ans += dif1
            a1 += 1
            b1 += 1
    elif dif3 > dif4:
        if dif3 > dif2:
            ans += dif3
            a2 -= 1
            b1 += 1
        else:
            ans += dif2
            a1 += 1
            b2 -= 1
    elif dif4 > dif2:
        ans += dif4
        a2 -= 1
        b2 -= 1
    else:
        ans += dif2
        a1 += 1
        b2 -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a1`, `a2`, `b1`, `b2`, `ans`, and `t` are updated based on the comparisons between `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4`. If `dif1` > `dif2`, then: 
- If `dif3` > `dif4`:
  - If `dif3` > `dif1`, then `a1` is 0, `a2` is `n - 2`, `b1` is 1, `b2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is `dif3`, and `t` is `t - 1`.
  - Otherwise, `a1` is 1, `a2` is `n - 1`, `b1` is 1, `b2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is `dif1`, and `t` is `t - 1`.
- If `dif3` ≤ `dif4`:
  - If `dif4` > `dif1`, then `a1` remains 0, `a2` is updated to `n - 2`, `b1` remains 0, `b2` is updated to `m - 2`, `ans` is set to `dif4`, and `t` is decremented by 1.
  - Otherwise, if `dif4` ≤ `dif1`, then `a1` is updated to 1, `a2` remains `n - 1`, `b1` is updated to 1, `b2` remains `m - 1`, `ans` is set to `dif1`, and `t` is decremented by 1.
If `dif1` ≤ `dif2`, then:
- If `dif3` > `dif4`, then `a1` remains 0, `a2` is updated to `n - 2`, `b1` is updated to 1, `b2` remains `m - 1`, `ans` is set to `dif3`, and `t` is decremented by 1.
- If `dif3` ≤ `dif4`, then `a1` is updated to 1, `a2` remains `n - 1`, `b1` remains 0, `b2` is updated to `m - 2`, `ans` is set to `dif2`, and `t` is decremented by 1.
- If `dif4` > `dif2`, then `a1` is 0, `a2` is `n - 2`, `b1` is 0, `b2` is `m - 2`, and `ans` is set to `dif4`.
- If `dif4` ≤ `dif2`, then `a1` is 1, `a2` is `n - 1`, `b1` is 0, `b2` is `m - 2`, and `ans` is set to `dif2`.
In all cases, `t` is decremented by 1, and the lists `a` and `b` remain sorted lists of integers provided by the user input, and the relationships between `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` are preserved as described in the precondition.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` are updated based on the new indices of `a` and `b`. If `dif1 > dif2`, the following updates occur: If `dif3 > dif4`, and `dif3 > dif1`, then `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2-1]` and `b[b1+1]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2-1]` and `b[b2]`, `a2` is decreased by 1, `b1` is increased by 1, and `ans` is increased by the absolute difference between `a[a2-1]` and `b[b1+1]`. If `dif3 > dif4`, but `dif3 <= dif1`, then `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1+1]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`, `a1` is increased by 1, `b1` is increased by 1, and `ans` is increased by the absolute difference between `a[a1-1]` and `b[b1-1]`. If `dif3 <= dif4`, and `dif4 > dif1`, then `a2` is decreased by 1, `ans` is increased by `dif4`, and `b2` is decreased by 1. If `dif3 <= dif4`, but `dif4 <= dif1`, then `a1` is increased by 1, `ans` is increased by `dif1`, and `b1` is increased by 1. If `dif1 <= dif2`, the following updates occur: If `dif3 > dif4`, and `dif3 > dif2`, then `a1` and `b1` are increased by 1, `a2` is decreased by 1, and `ans` is increased by the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1+1]`. If `dif3 > dif4`, but `dif3 <= dif2`, then `a1` is increased by 1, `b2` is decreased by 1, and `ans` is increased by `dif2`. If `dif3 <= dif4`, and `dif4 > dif2`, then `a1` and `a2` are decreased by 1, `b1` and `b2` are decreased by 1, `t` remains unchanged, and `ans` is increased by `dif4`. If `dif3 <= dif4`, but `dif4 <= dif2`, then `a1` is increased by 1, `a2`, `b1`, and `t` remain unchanged, `ans` is increased by the absolute difference between `a[a1-1]` and `b[b2]`, and `b2` is decreased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` are the absolute differences between the specified elements of arrays `a` and `b`, and `a1` remains less than or equal to `a2`. If `dif1 > dif2`, and `dif3 > dif4`, and `dif3 > dif1`, `ans` is increased by the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`, `a2` is decreased by 1, and `b1` is increased by 1. If `dif1 > dif2`, and `dif3 > dif4`, and `dif3 <= dif1`, `ans` is increased by the absolute difference between `a[a1-1]` and `b[b1-1]`, `a1` is increased by 1, and `b1` is increased by 1. If `dif1 > dif2`, and `dif3 <= dif4`, and `dif4 > dif1`, `ans` is increased by the absolute difference between `a[a2-1]` and `b[b2+1]`, `b2` is decreased by 1, and the new `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` are recalculated based on the updated indices. If `dif1 > dif2`, and `dif3 <= dif4`, and `dif4 <= dif1`, `ans` is increased by the absolute difference between `a[a1-1]` and `b[b1]`, `a1` is increased by 1, and `b1` is increased by 1, and the new `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` are recalculated based on the updated indices. If `dif1 <= dif2`, and `dif3 > dif4`, `ans` is increased by the absolute difference between `a[a2-1]` and `b[b1-1]`, `a2` is decreased by 1, and `b1` is increased by 1. If `dif1 <= dif2`, and `dif4 > dif2`, `ans` is increased by `dif4`, `a2` is decreased by 1, and `b2` is decreased by 1. If `dif1 <= dif2`, and `dif4 <= dif2`, `a1` is increased by 1, `ans` is increased by the absolute difference between `a[a1-1]` and `b[b2+1]`, and `b2` is decreased by 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
