Postcondition: ***`dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`; `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`; `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`; `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`. If `dif4` > `dif2`, `a1` and `a2` are decreased by 1, `b1` and `b2` are decreased by 1, `t` remains unchanged, and `ans` is increased by `dif4`. Otherwise, `a1` is increased by 1, `a2`, `b1`, and `t` remain unchanged, `ans` is increased by the absolute difference between `a[a1-1]` and `b[b2]`, and `b2` is decreased by 1.***
