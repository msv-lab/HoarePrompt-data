Output State: **`dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`; `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2+1]`; `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2-1]` and `b[b1]`; `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2-1]` and `b[b2+1]`; `a1` must be less than or equal to `a2-1` for the loop to execute one more time; `ans` is increased by `dif4`; `a2` is decreased by 1; `b2` is decreased by 1.**
