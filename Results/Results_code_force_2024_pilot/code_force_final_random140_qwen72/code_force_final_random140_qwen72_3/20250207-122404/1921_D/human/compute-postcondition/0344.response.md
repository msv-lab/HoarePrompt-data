Output State: **`dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`; `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, `b2`, `ans`, and `t` remain unchanged.** 

This means that the variable `dif1` now holds the value of the absolute difference between the elements at the indices `a1` and `b1` of the lists `a` and `b`, respectively. All other variables (`a1`, `a2`, `b1`, `b2`, `ans`, and `t`) retain their original values as they are not modified by the given code snippet.
