The value of `a1` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`ans`, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, `dif4`, `a2`, `b1`, `b2`) remain unchanged. The condition that `a1` must be less than or equal to `a2` for the loop to execute one more time is still valid.

Output State: **`a1` is increased by 1, `ans` is increased by the absolute difference between `a[a1-1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1-1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1-1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`, `a1` must be less than or equal to `a2` for the loop to execute one more time.**
