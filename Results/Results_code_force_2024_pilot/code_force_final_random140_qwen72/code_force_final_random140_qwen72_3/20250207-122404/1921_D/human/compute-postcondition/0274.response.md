Output State: **`a1` is incremented by 1, `a1` is now one more than its previous value, `a2` retains its value from the previous iteration, `b1`, `b2`, `ans`, and `t` are updated based on the comparisons between `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`, `ans` is increased by `dif2`, `b2` is decremented by 1.**
