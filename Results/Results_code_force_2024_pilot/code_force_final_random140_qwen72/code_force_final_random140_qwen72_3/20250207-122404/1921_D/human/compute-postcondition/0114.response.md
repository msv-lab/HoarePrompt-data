Postcondition: ***`dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` are the absolute differences between the specified elements of arrays `a` and `b`. If `dif3` is greater than `dif1`, `ans` is increased by `dif3`, `a2` is decreased by 1, and `b1` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `a1` is increased by 1, `ans` is increased by the absolute difference between `a[a1-1]` and `b[b1-1]`, and `b1` is increased by 1. In both cases, `a1` must be less than or equal to `a2` for the loop to execute one more time.***
