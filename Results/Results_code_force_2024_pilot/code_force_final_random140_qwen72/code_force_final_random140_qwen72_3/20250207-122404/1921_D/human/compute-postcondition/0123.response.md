The value of `ans` is incremented by the value of `dif3`. The value of `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`. The conditions for the loop to execute one more time (that `a1` must be less than or equal to `a2`) remain unchanged. The values of `dif1`, `dif2`, and `dif4` are not affected.

Output State: **`ans` is incremented by the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`; `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`; `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`; `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`; `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`; `a1` must be less than or equal to `a2` for the loop to execute one more time.**
