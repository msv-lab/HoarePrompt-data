Postcondition: **`dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` are updated based on the new indices of `a` and `b`. If `dif1 > dif2`, the following updates occur: If `dif3 > dif4`, and `dif3 > dif1`, then `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2-1]` and `b[b1+1]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2-1]` and `b[b2]`, `a2` is decreased by 1, `b1` is increased by 1, and `ans` is increased by the absolute difference between `a[a2-1]` and `b[b1+1]`. If `dif3 > dif4`, but `dif3 <= dif1`, then `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1+1]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`, `a1` is increased by 1, `b1` is increased by 1, and `ans` is increased by the absolute difference between `a[a1-1]` and `b[b1-1]`. If `dif3 <= dif4`, and `dif4 > dif1`, then `a2` is decreased by 1, `ans` is increased by `dif4`, and `b2` is decreased by 1. If `dif3 <= dif4`, but `dif4 <= dif1`, then `a1` is increased by 1, `ans` is increased by `dif1`, and `b1` is increased by 1. If `dif1 <= dif2`, the following updates occur: If `dif3 > dif4`, and `dif3 > dif2`, then `a1` and `b1` are increased by 1, `a2` is decreased by 1, and `ans` is increased by the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1+1]`. If `dif3 > dif4`, but `dif3 <= dif2`, then `a1` is increased by 1, `b2` is decreased by 1, and `ans` is increased by `dif2`. If `dif3 <= dif4`, and `dif4 > dif2`, then `a1` and `a2` are decreased by 1, `b1` and `b2` are decreased by 1, `t` remains unchanged, and `ans` is increased by `dif4`. If `dif3 <= dif4`, but `dif4 <= dif2`, then `a1` is increased by 1, `a2`, `b1`, and `t` remain unchanged, `ans` is increased by the absolute difference between `a[a1-1]` and `b[b2]`, and `b2` is decreased by 1.**
