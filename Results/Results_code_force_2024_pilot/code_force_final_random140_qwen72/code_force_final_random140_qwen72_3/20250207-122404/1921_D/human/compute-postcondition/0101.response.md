Postcondition: ***`dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` are the absolute differences between elements at specified indices of lists `a` and `b`. If `dif3` > `dif4`, `ans` is increased by the value of `dif3`, `a2` is decreased by 1, and `b1` is increased by 1. If `dif4` > `dif2`, `ans` is increased by `dif4`, `a2` is decreased by 1, and `b2` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `a1` is increased by 1, `b2` is decreased by 1, and `ans` is increased by the original `dif2`.***
