Postcondition: ***`dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` are the absolute differences between the specified elements of arrays `a` and `b`. If `dif3 > dif4`, then `ans` is increased by the absolute difference between `a[a2-1]` and `b[b1-1]`, `a2` is decreased by 1, and `b1` is increased by 1. If `dif4 > dif2`, `ans` is increased by `dif4`, `a2` is decreased by 1, and `b2` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `a1` is increased by 1, `ans` is increased by the absolute difference between `a[a1-1]` and `b[b2+1]`, and `b2` is decreased by 1. In all cases, `a1` remains less than or equal to `a2`.***
