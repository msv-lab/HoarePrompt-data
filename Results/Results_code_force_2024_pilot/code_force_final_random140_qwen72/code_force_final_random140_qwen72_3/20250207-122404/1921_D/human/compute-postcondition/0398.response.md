Postcondition: ***`dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` are the absolute differences as initially defined, and `a1` is less than or equal to `a2`. If `dif3 > dif4`, and `dif3 > dif1`, `ans` is increased by the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`, `a2` is decreased by 1, and `b1` is increased by 1. If `dif3 > dif4`, and `dif3 <= dif1`, `ans` is increased by the absolute difference between `a[a1-1]` and `b[b1-1]`, `a1` is increased by 1, and `b1` is increased by 1. If `dif3 <= dif4`, and `dif4 > dif1`, `ans` is increased by the absolute difference between `a[a2-1]` and `b[b2+1]`, `b2` is decreased by 1, and the new `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` are recalculated based on the updated indices. If `dif3 <= dif4`, and `dif4 <= dif1`, `ans` is increased by the absolute difference between `a[a1-1]` and `b[b1]`, `a1` is increased by 1, and `b1` is increased by 1, and the new `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` are recalculated based on the updated indices.***
