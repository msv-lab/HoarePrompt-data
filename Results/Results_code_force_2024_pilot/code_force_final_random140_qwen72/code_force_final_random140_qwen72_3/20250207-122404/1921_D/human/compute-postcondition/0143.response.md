Output State: **`a1` is `n`, `a2` is `-1`, `b1` is `m`, `b2` is `-1`, `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences between elements of `a` and `b` as determined by the loop logic, `t` is `t - 1` (which is still greater than or equal to 0), `n` is the first integer from input, `m` is the second integer from input.**

Explanation:
- The variables `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, `b2`, `ans`, and `t` remain unchanged.
- The values of `n` and `m` are updated to the integers provided by the user input. The input is split into two parts, and each part is converted to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`.
- The new values of `n` and `m` are the first and second integers from the input, respectively.
