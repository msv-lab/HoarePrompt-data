Output State: **t is 0, `a1` is `n`, `a2` is `-1`, `b1` is `m`, `b2` is `-1`, and `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences between elements of `a` and `b` chosen during the loop for all test cases.**

### Explanation:
- **t**: After all iterations of the loop, `t` will be 0 because the loop decrements `t` by 1 each time it runs, and it stops when `t` becomes 0.
- **a1 and a2**: These indices will be `n` and `-1` respectively, indicating that all elements in the list `a` have been processed.
- **b1 and b2**: These indices will be `m` and `-1` respectively, indicating that all elements in the list `b` have been processed.
- **ans**: This variable will hold the sum of the maximum absolute differences between elements of `a` and `b` for each test case, as determined by the loop logic. This value is accumulated over all iterations of the loop.

This output state reflects the final state of the variables after the loop has completed all its iterations.
