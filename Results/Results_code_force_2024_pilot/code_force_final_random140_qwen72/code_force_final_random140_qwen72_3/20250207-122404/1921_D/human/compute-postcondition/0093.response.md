Postcondition: ***`dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` are the absolute differences as initially defined. If `dif3` > `dif2`, `ans` is increased by the value of `dif3`, `a2` is decreased by 1, and `b1` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `a1` is increased by 1, `dif2` is updated to the absolute difference between the new element at index `a1` and the element at index `b2`, `ans` is increased by the value of `dif2`, and `b2` is decreased by 1.***
