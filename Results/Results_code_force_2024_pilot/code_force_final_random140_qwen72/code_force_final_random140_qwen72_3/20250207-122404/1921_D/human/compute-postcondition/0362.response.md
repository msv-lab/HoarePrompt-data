Postcondition: ***`dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` are updated based on the new indices of `a` and `b`. If `dif3 > dif4`, then: if `dif3 > dif1`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2-1]` and `b[b1+1]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2-1]` and `b[b2]`, `a2` is decreased by 1, `b1` is increased by 1, and `ans` is increased by the absolute difference between `a[a2-1]` and `b[b1+1]`. Otherwise, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1+1]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`, `a1` is increased by 1, `b1` is increased by 1, and `ans` is increased by the absolute difference between `a[a1-1]` and `b[b1-1]`. If `dif3 <= dif4`, then: if `dif4 > dif1`, `a2` is decreased by 1, `ans` is increased by `dif4`, and `b2` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `a1` is increased by 1, `ans` is increased by `dif1`, and `b1` is increased by 1. `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, `b2`, and `t` retain their respective changes as described.***
