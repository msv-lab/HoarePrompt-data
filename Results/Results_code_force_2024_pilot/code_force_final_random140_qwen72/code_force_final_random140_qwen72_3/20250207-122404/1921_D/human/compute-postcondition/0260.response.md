Postcondition: **`a1` is less than or equal to `a2`, `a2` retains its value from the previous iteration, `b1`, `b2`, `ans`, and `t` are updated based on the comparisons between `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4`. If `dif4` > `dif1`, `a2` is decremented by 1, `b2` is decremented by 1, and `ans` is increased by `dif4`. Otherwise, `a1` is incremented by 1, `b1` is incremented by 1, and `ans` is increased by `dif1`. `t` remains unchanged, and the new values of `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` are the absolute differences between the updated indices of arrays `a` and `b`.**
