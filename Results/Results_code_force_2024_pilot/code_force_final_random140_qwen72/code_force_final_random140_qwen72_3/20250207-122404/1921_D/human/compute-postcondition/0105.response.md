Output State: **`dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`; `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`; `dif3` and `dif4` are the absolute differences between elements at specified indices of lists `a` and `b`; `a1` must be less than or equal to `a2` for the loop to execute one more time.**
