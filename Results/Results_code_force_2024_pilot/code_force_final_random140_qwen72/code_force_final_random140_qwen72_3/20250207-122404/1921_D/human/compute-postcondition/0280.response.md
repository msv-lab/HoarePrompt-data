The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is `t - k` where `k` is the number of iterations executed. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0.

State: **`a1` is `n`, `a2` is `n - 1`, `b1` is `m`, `b2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences between elements of `a` and `b` for each iteration, and `t` must be greater than 0**
