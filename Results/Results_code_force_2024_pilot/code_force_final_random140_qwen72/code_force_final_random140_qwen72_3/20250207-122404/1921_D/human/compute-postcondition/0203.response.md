Postcondition: ***`a1`, `a2`, `b1`, `b2`, `ans`, and `t` are updated based on the comparison between `dif4` and `dif2`. If `dif4` is greater than `dif2`, then `a1` remains 0, `a2` is updated to `n - 2`, `b1` remains 0, `b2` is updated to `m - 2`, `ans` is set to `dif4`, and `t` is decremented by 1 (still greater than or equal to 0). Otherwise, if `dif4` is less than or equal to `dif2`, then `a1` is updated to 1, `a2` remains `n - 1`, `b1` remains 0, `b2` is updated to `m - 2`, `ans` is set to `dif2`, and `t` is decremented by 1 (still greater than or equal to 0). In both cases, `n` is the first integer from input and must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from input, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the new input, `b` is a sorted list of integers from the new input, `dif1` is the absolute difference between the first elements of lists `a` and `b`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between the first element of list `a` and the last element of list `b`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between the last element of list `a` and the first element of list `b`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between the last elements of lists `a` and `b`, and `dif1` is less than or equal to `dif2`, and `dif3` is less than or equal to `dif4`.***
