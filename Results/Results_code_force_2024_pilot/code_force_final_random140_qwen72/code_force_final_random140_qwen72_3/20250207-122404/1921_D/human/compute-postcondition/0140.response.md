To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic described:

### Initial State:
- `a1` is `n`
- `a2` is `-1`
- `b1` is `m`
- `b2` is `-1`
- `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences between elements of `a` and `b` as determined by the loop logic.

### Explanation:
1. **Variables `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, and `b2`:**
   - `a1` is set to `n`.
   - `a2` is set to `-1`.
   - `b1` is set to `m`.
   - `b2` is set to `-1`.

2. **Variable `ans`:**
   - `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences between elements of `a` and `b` as determined by the loop logic.
   - The loop logic is not explicitly provided, but we can infer that it involves calculating the maximum absolute differences between pairs of elements from `a` and `b`.

3. **Loop Logic:**
   - Since the loop logic is not explicitly provided, we need to make an assumption based on common practices.
   - Typically, such a loop would iterate over the elements of `a` and `b`, compute the absolute difference for each pair, and then take the maximum of these differences.
   - The sum of these maximum differences would be stored in `ans`.

### Calculation:
- Without the explicit loop logic, we can only describe the process in general terms.
- The maximum absolute difference between `a1` and `b1` is `|n - m|`.
- The maximum absolute difference between `a2` and `b2` is `|-1 - (-1)| = 0`.
- If there are more elements in `a` and `b`, the loop would continue to compute the maximum absolute differences and sum them up.

### Final Output:
- Since the exact loop logic is not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the given variables and the general process.
- The value of `ans` will be the sum of the maximum absolute differences between the elements of `a` and `b`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of the maximum absolute differences between elements of a and b as determined by the loop logic)**
