Output State: **`a1` is less than or equal to `a2` (decremented by 1), `a2` retains its value from the previous iteration (decremented by 1), `b1` is unchanged, `b2` is decremented by 1, `ans` is increased by `dif4`, `t` is decremented by 1 and remains greater than or equal to 0, `dif1` is now `abs(a[a1] - b[b1])`, `dif2` is now `abs(a[a1] - b[b2])`, `dif3` is now `abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`, `dif4` is now `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`.**
