Postcondition: ***`a1` is less than or equal to `a2`, `a2` retains its value from the previous iteration (but may be decremented by 1 if `dif4 > dif2`), `b1`, `b2`, `ans`, and `t` are updated based on the comparisons between `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4`. If `dif3 > dif4` and `dif3 > dif2`, `a1` is less than or equal to `a2 - 1`, `a2` is decremented by 1, `b1` is incremented by 1, `b2`, `ans`, and `t` retain their values, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2 - 1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2 - 1]` and `b[b2]`, and `ans` is now `ans + dif3`. If `dif3 > dif4` and `dif3 <= dif2`, `a1` is incremented by 1, `a1` is now greater than or equal to `a2`, `a2` retains its value from the previous iteration, `b1`, `b2`, `ans`, and `t` are updated based on the comparisons between `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4`, `dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`, `ans` is increased by `dif2`, and `b2` is decremented by 1. If `dif3 <= dif4` and `dif4 > dif2`, `ans` is increased by `dif4`, and `b2` is decremented by 1. If `dif3 <= dif4` and `dif4 <= dif2`, `a1` is incremented by 1, `ans` is increased by `dif2`, and `b2` is decremented by 1.***
