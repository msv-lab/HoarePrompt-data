Output State: **`a1` is 0, `a2` is `n - 1`, `b1` is 0, `b2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `t` is `t - 1`, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user input, `b` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user input, `dif1` is the absolute difference between the first elements of lists `a` and `b`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between the first element of list `a` and the last element of list `b`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between the last element of list `a` and the first element of list `b`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between the last elements of lists `a` and `b`.**

Explanation: The code snippet calculates `dif4` as the absolute difference between the last elements of lists `a` and `b`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The new value of `dif4` is added to the output state.
