Output State: **`dif1` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`; `dif2` is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`; `dif3` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`; `dif4` is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`; `a1` is increased by 1; `ans` is increased by `dif2`.** 

Explanation: The value of `a1` is incremented by 1, while the other variables (`dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, `dif4`, and `ans`) remain unchanged except that `ans` is increased by the value of `dif2`. The condition that `a1` must be less than or equal to `a2` for the loop to execute one more time remains valid.
