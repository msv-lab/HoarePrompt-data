### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. It reads the values of `n` and `m`, and the lists `a` and `b` for each test case.

2. **Sorting**: Both lists `a` and `b` are sorted. Sorting is a crucial step because it allows us to efficiently find the maximum possible difference between elements of `a` and `b`.

3. **Two-Pointer Technique**: The program uses a two-pointer technique to iterate through the sorted lists `a` and `b`. The pointers `a1` and `a2` are used to traverse the list `a` from both ends, and `b1` and `b2` are used to traverse the list `b` from both ends.

4. **Maximizing Differences**: For each element in `a`, the program calculates four possible differences:
   - `dif1`: Difference between the smallest element in `a` and the smallest element in `b`.
   - `dif2`: Difference between the smallest element in `a` and the largest element in `b`.
   - `dif3`: Difference between the largest element in `a` and the smallest element in `b`.
   - `dif4`: Difference between the largest element in `a` and the largest element in `b`.

   The program then selects the maximum of these differences and adds it to the result `ans`.

5. **Updating Pointers**: After selecting the maximum difference, the program updates the pointers accordingly to ensure that the next comparison is made with the next available elements in the lists.

6. **Output**: The program prints the result `ans` for each test case, which is the sum of the maximum absolute differences.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum total difference `D` for each test case. The use of sorting and the two-pointer technique ensures that the solution is efficient and correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
