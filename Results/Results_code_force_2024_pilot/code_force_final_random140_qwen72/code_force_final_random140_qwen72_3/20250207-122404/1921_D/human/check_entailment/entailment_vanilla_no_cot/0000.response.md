Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It processes multiple test cases, sorts the arrays `a` and `b`, and then iteratively selects elements from `b` to maximize the total difference `D`. The logic for choosing the best differences (`dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, `dif4`) and updating the indices (`a1`, `a2`, `b1`, `b2`) is designed to ensure that the maximum possible difference is achieved for each element in `a`. The program correctly handles the constraints and outputs the maximum total difference for each test case.
