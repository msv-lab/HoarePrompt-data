The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `t` (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100) indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the sizes of two lists, followed by the lists `a` and `b` of integers (where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9). The function calculates the sum of the maximum absolute differences between elements of `a` and `b` chosen during the loop for all test cases and prints this sum. After processing all test cases, the function exits, leaving `t` as 0 and the internal loop indices (`a1`, `a2`, `b1`, `b2`) in their final states.
