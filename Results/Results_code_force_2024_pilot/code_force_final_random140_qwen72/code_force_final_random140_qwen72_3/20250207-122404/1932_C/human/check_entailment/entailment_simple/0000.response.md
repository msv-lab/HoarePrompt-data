Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, the array `arr`, and the command string `s`.

2. **Initial Setup**: The program initializes `l` to 0 and `r` to `n-1`, which represent the left and right pointers of the array, respectively.

3. **Command Processing**:
   - The first loop iterates through the command string `s` and updates the pointers `l` and `r` based on whether the command is 'L' or 'R'. This part is used to determine the final positions of the pointers after all commands have been processed.
   - The second loop processes the commands in reverse order. It updates the product `p` by multiplying it with the appropriate element from the array `arr` and taking the result modulo `m`. The product `p` is then appended to the answer list `ans`.

4. **Output**: The program prints the results in the correct order by reversing the `ans` list before printing.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as single-element arrays and commands that only contain 'L' or 'R'.
   - The program ensures that the product `p` is always taken modulo `m` to prevent overflow and maintain correctness.

6. **Efficiency**:
   - The program efficiently processes each test case within the constraints, ensuring that the time complexity is manageable even for the maximum allowed input sizes.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required by the problem statement and handles all specified edge cases and constraints.

Correctness: **True**
