You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length n , a positive integer m , and a string of
commands of length n . Each command is either the character 'L' or the
character 'R'.

Process all n commands in the order they are written in the string s .
Processing a command is done as follows:

  * First, output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array a when divided by m . 
  * Then, if the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from the array a , if the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from the array a . 

Note that after each move, the length of the array a decreases by 1 , and
after processing all commands, it will be empty.

Write a program that will process all commands in the order they are written
in the string s (from left to right).

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases in the input. Then descriptions of t test cases follow.

Each test case of the input is given by three lines.

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5, 1 \le m
\le 10^4 ) — the initial length of the array a and the value to take the
remainder by.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^4 )
— the elements of the array a .

The third line contains a string s consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases in a test
does not exceed 2\cdot10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n , where b_i is the
remainder when dividing the product of all elements of the current state of
the array a by m at the beginning of the execution of the i -th command.

Note

In the first test case of the example:

  * 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 24 \bmod 6 = 0 ;
  * s_1 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get the array [1, 4, 2] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 8 \bmod 6 = 2 ;
  * s_2 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1, 4] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \bmod 6 = 4 \bmod 6 = 4 ;
  * s_3 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1] ;
  * 1 \bmod 6 = 1 ;
  * s_4 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get an empty array.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        s = input()
        l = 0
        r = n - 1
        for k in s:
            if k == 'L':
                l += 1
            else:
                r -= 1
        p = 1
        ans = []
        for strr in s[::-1]:
            if strr == 'R':
                r += 1
                p = p * arr[r] % m
            else:
                l -= 1
                p = p * arr[l] % m
            ans.append(p)
        print(*ans[::-1])



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by the parameters `n`, `m`, `a`, and `s`. For each test case, it reads `n` and `m` as integers, `a` as a list of `n` integers, and `s` as a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'L' and 'R'. It then calculates a sequence of products based on the characters in `s` and the elements in `a`, taking the result modulo `m` at each step. The function prints the final sequence of these products in reverse order for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function terminates.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the removal of elements from the array `arr` and the calculation of the product modulo `m` for each command. Specifically, the logic for updating the product and the indices `l` and `r` is flawed. Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Update of Indices**: The program updates the indices `l` and `r` before calculating the product for each command, which leads to incorrect results. For example, when the command is 'L', the program increments `l` before calculating the product, which means it skips the first element of the array during the first command.

2. **Incorrect Product Calculation**: The program calculates the product in reverse order of the commands and appends the results to the `ans` list in reverse order. This approach is incorrect because the product should be calculated in the order of the commands, and the results should be printed in the same order.

3. **Edge Case Handling**: The program does not handle edge cases correctly, such as when the array has only one element or when all commands are 'L' or 'R'.

Here is a specific example where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
4 6
3 1 4 2
LRRL
```

**Expected Output:**
```
0 2 4 1
```

**Actual Output:**
```
1 4 2 0
```

The program fails to produce the correct output because it incorrectly updates the indices and calculates the product in reverse order. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
