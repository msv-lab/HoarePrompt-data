Reasoning:  
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why it works:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes variables `l` and `r` to represent the left and right indices of the array `arr`. These indices are used to track the current subarray being considered.

2. **First Loop (Adjust Indices)**: The first loop iterates over the string `s` and adjusts the indices `l` and `r` based on whether the command is 'L' or 'R'. This loop effectively simulates the removal of elements from the array without actually modifying the array itself.

3. **Second Loop (Calculate Products)**: The second loop iterates over the string `s` in reverse order. For each command:
   - If the command is 'R', it increments the right index `r` and multiplies the current product `p` by the element at the new right index.
   - If the command is 'L', it decrements the left index `l` and multiplies the current product `p` by the element at the new left index.
   - The product `p` is taken modulo `m` at each step to ensure it remains within the required range.
   - The result is appended to the list `ans`.

4. **Output**: Finally, the results are printed in reverse order to match the order of the commands in the original string `s`.

The program correctly handles the constraints and edge cases mentioned in the problem statement. It processes each test case independently and produces the expected output.

Correctness: **True**
