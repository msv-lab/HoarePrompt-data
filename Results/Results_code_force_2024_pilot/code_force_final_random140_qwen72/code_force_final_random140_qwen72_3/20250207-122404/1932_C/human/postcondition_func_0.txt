The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by the parameters `n`, `m`, `a`, and `s`. For each test case, it reads `n` and `m` as integers, `a` as a list of `n` integers, and `s` as a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'L' and 'R'. It then calculates a sequence of products based on the characters in `s` and the elements in `a`, taking the result modulo `m` at each step. The function prints the final sequence of these products in reverse order for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function terminates.
