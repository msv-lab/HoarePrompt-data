Output State: **`s` must be a non-empty string, `strr` is the last character of `s` and its current value is 'R', `ans` is an empty list, `r` is increased by 1, `p` is updated to `p * arr[r] % m`, and the values of `l`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `arr` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The value of `p` is updated to the result of `p * arr[r] % m`. The value of `r` is increased by 1, and the values of `l`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `arr` remain unchanged. The string `s` is still non-empty, `strr` is still the last character of `s` and its value is 'R', and `ans` remains an empty list.
