To determine what will be printed by the `print(*ans[::-1])` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `_` is `t - 1`, where `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
   - `n` and `m` are integers provided by user input.
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4.
   - `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'L' and 'R'.
   - `arr` is a list of integers provided by user input.
   - `p` is the final value of `p` after all iterations, which is the product of the elements in `arr` indexed by the positions determined by the 'L' and 'R' characters in `s`, modulo `m`.
   - `ans` is a list of length `n` containing the intermediate values of `p` after each iteration.
   - `l` is -1.
   - `r` is `n - 1`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `ans` is a list that stores the intermediate values of `p` after each iteration.
   - `p` is updated based on the characters in `s` and the corresponding elements in `arr`.
   - The indices `l` and `r` are used to track the positions in `s` and `arr`.

3. **Logic of the Code:**
   - The `print(*ans[::-1])` statement prints the elements of the list `ans` in reverse order, separated by spaces.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - Since `ans` contains the intermediate values of `p` after each iteration, the `print` statement will print these values in reverse order.
   - The exact values in `ans` depend on the specific values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `s`, and `arr`.

Given the initial state and the logic, the output will be the elements of the list `ans` in reverse order. Each element in `ans` represents the value of `p` after processing each character in `s`.

Output: **[p_n, p_(n-1), ..., p_1] (where p_i is the value of p after the i-th iteration, and n is the length of the list s)**

This means the output will be the intermediate values of `p` in reverse order, starting from the last value to the first value.
