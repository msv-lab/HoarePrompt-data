Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `_` is `t`, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers provided by user input, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, `s` is a string provided by user input, `arr` is a list of integers provided by user input, `p` is the final value of `p` after all iterations, which is the product of the elements in `arr` indexed by the positions determined by the 'L' and 'R' characters in `s`, modulo `m`, `ans` is a list of length `n` containing the intermediate values of `p` after each iteration, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `n` is an integer provided by user input, `m` is an integer provided by user input.
Code of the loop:
for k in s:
    if k == 'L':
        l += 1
    else:
        r -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`s` is a non-empty string, and `k` is set to the first character of `s`. If `k` is 'L', `l` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `r` is decreased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`s` is a non-empty string, and `k` is set to the second character of `s`. If `k` is 'L', `l` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `r` is decreased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`s` is a non-empty string, and `k` is the third character of `s`. If `k` is 'L', `l` is incremented by 1 and `r` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `r` is decreased by 1 and `l` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
