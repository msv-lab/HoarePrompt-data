The value of `r` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `r` depends on the second character `k` in the string `s`. If `k` is 'L', `r` was initially `n - 1`, and if `k` is 'R', `r` was initially `n - 2`. After decrementing, `r` will be `n - 2` if `k` is 'L', and `n - 3` if `k` is 'R'. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers provided by user input, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, `s` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'L' and 'R' provided by user input, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5, `t` must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers provided by user input, `s` must have at least two characters, `k` is the second character in `s`. If `k` is 'L', `l` is 1 and `r` is `n - 2`. If `k` is 'R', `l` is 0 and `r` is `n - 3`.**
