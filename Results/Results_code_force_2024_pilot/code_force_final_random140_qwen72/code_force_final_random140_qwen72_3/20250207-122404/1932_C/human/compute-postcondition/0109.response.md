The value of `l` is incremented by 1. The values of `s` and `k` remain unchanged. If `k` is 'L', `l` was already incremented by 1 before this code snippet, so now `l` is incremented by 1 again. If `k` is not 'L', `r` was decreased by 1 before this code snippet, and `l` is now incremented by 1.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `k` is the second character of `s`, if `k` is 'L' then `l` is incremented by 2, otherwise `l` is incremented by 1 and `r` is decreased by 1.**
