Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `_` is `t - 1`, `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers provided by user input, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, `s` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'L' and 'R' provided by user input, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5, `t` must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers provided by user input, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `p` is the final product of the elements from `arr` based on the sequence of 'L' and 'R' in `s` modulo `m`, and `ans` is a list containing the values of `p` after each iteration of the loop.
Code of the loop:
for k in s:
    if k == 'L':
        l += 1
    else:
        r -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `_` is `t - 1`, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers provided by user input, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, `s` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'L' and 'R' and must have at least 1 character, `arr` is a list of integers provided by user input, `p` is the final product of the elements from `arr` based on the sequence of 'L' and 'R' in `s` modulo `m`, `ans` is a list containing the values of `p` after each iteration of the loop, `k` is the first character in `s`. If `k` is 'L', then `l` is 1 and `r` is `n - 1`. If `k` is 'R', then `l` is 0 and `r` is `n - 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`_` is `t - 1`, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers provided by user input, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, `s` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'L' and 'R' and must have at least 1 character, `arr` is a list of integers provided by user input, `p` is the final product of the elements from `arr` based on the sequence of 'L' and 'R' in `s` modulo `m`, `ans` is a list containing the values of `p` after each iteration of the loop, `k` is the next character in `s`. If the next `k` is 'L', then `l` is 2 and `r` is `n - 1`. If the next `k` is 'R', then `l` is 0 and `r` is `n - 3`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `_` is `t - 1`, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers provided by user input, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, `s` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'L' and 'R' and must have at least 1 character, `arr` is a list of integers provided by user input, `p` is the final product of the elements from `arr` based on the sequence of 'L' and 'R' in `s` modulo `m`, `ans` is a list containing the values of `p` after each iteration of the loop, `k` is the next character in `s` (the second character if the previous was the first, and so on). If `k` is 'L', `l` is increased by 1. If `k` is 'R', `r` is decreased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
