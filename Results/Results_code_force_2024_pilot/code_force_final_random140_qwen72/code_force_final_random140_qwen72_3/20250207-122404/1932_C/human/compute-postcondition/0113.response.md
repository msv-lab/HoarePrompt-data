The value of `l` is incremented by 1. The initial state specifies that `s` is a non-empty string, and `k` is set to the third character of `s`. If `k` is 'L', `l` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `r` is decreased by 1. Since the code snippet only increments `l` by 1, it implies that `k` is 'L'. The value of `r` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `k` is 'L', `l` is incremented by 1, `r` is unchanged.**
