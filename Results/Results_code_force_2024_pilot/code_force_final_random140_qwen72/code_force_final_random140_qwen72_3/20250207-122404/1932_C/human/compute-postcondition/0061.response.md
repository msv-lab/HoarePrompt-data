Output State: **`_` is `t - 1`, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers provided by user input, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, `s` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'L' and 'R' and must have at least 1 character, `arr` is a list of integers provided by user input, `p` is the final product of the elements from `arr` based on the sequence of 'L' and 'R' in `s` modulo `m`, `ans` is a list containing the values of `p` after each iteration of the loop, `k` is the next character in `s`, if the next `k` is 'L', then `l` is 2 and `r` is `n - 1`, if the next `k` is 'R', then `l` is 1 and `r` is `n - 2`.** 

Explanation: The value of `l` is incremented by 1. If the next character `k` in `s` is 'L', then `l` was initially 1 and is now 2. If the next character `k` in `s` is 'R', then `l` was initially 0 and is now 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
