Output State: **`ans` contains the updated value of `p`, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers provided by user input, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, `s` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'L' and 'R' provided by user input, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5, `t` must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers provided by user input, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `s`, `r` is `n - 1 -` the number of 'R' characters in `s` + 1, `p` is now `p * arr[r] % m`, `strr` is the next character in the reversed string `s`.**
