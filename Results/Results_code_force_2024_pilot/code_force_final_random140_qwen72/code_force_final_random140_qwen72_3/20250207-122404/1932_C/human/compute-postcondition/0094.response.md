Output State: **_ is `t - 1`, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers provided by user input, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, `s` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'L' and 'R' and must have at least 1 character, `arr` is a list of integers provided by user input, `p` is the final value of `p` after all iterations, which is the product of the elements in `arr` indexed by the positions determined by the 'L' and 'R' characters in `s`, modulo `m`, `ans` is a list of length `n` containing the intermediate values of `p` after each iteration, `l` is -1, `r` is `n - 1`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the string `s` in reverse order, updating the value of `p` based on whether the current character is 'L' or 'R'.
- For each 'R' encountered, `r` is incremented, and `p` is updated to `p * arr[r] % m`.
- For each 'L' encountered, `l` is decremented, and `p` is updated to `p * arr[l] % m`.
- After each update, the current value of `p` is appended to the list `ans`.
- After all iterations, `l` will be -1 because it starts at the number of 'L' characters and is decremented for each 'L' encountered.
- `r` will be `n - 1` because it starts at `n - 1 -` the number of 'R' characters and is incremented for each 'R' encountered.
- The final value of `p` is the product of the elements in `arr` indexed by the positions determined by the 'L' and 'R' characters in `s`, modulo `m`.
- The list `ans` contains the intermediate values of `p` after each iteration, and its length is equal to the length of `s`.
