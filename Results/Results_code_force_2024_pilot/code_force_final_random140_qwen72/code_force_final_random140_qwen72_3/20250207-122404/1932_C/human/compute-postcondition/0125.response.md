Output State: **`s` must be a non-empty string, `strr` is the last character of `s`, `ans` is an empty list, `l` is decreased by 1, `r`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `arr`, and `p` remain unchanged, `strr` is not equal to 'R', `p` is updated to `p * arr[l] % m`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `p` is updated to `p * arr[l] % m`.
- All other variables (`s`, `strr`, `ans`, `l`, `r`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `arr`) remain unchanged.
- The condition that `strr` is not equal to 'R' remains valid.
