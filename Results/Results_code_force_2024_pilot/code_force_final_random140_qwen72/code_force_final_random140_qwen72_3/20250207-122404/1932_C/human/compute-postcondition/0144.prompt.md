Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and m are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4; a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4; s is a string of length n consisting of characters 'L' and 'R'. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for k in s:
        if k == 'L':
            l += 1
        else:
            r -= 1
    p = 1
    ans = []
    for strr in s[::-1]:
        if strr == 'R':
            r += 1
            p = p * arr[r] % m
        else:
            l -= 1
            p = p * arr[l] % m
        ans.append(p)
    print(*ans[::-1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After the loop executes all iterations, `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers provided by user input, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, `s` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'L' and 'R' provided by user input, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5, `t` must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers provided by user input, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `p` is the final product of the elements from `arr` based on the sequence of 'L' and 'R' in `s` modulo `m`, and `ans` is a list containing the values of `p` after each iteration of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: _ is `t - 1`, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers provided by user input, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, `s` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'L' and 'R' and must have at least 1 character, `arr` is a list of integers provided by user input, `p` is the final value of `p` after all iterations, which is the product of the elements in `arr` indexed by the positions determined by the 'L' and 'R' characters in `s`, modulo `m`, `ans` is a list of length `n` containing the intermediate values of `p` after each iteration, `l` is -1, `r` is `n - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After all iterations, `l` will be equal to the number of 'L' characters in `s`, and `r` will be equal to `n - 1` minus the number of 'R' characters in `s`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `s`, `arr`, and `p` remain unchanged. `ans` is now a list containing the final values of `p` after each iteration, with the last element being the final value of `p` after processing all characters in `s` in reverse order.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
