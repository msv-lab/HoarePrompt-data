Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is the same as the initial value, `a` remains a list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq a_i < 2^{30}\), `x` is a list with `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to that point, and `inds` is a defaultdict where each key is an element from `x` and the value is a list of indices where that element appears in `x`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(q):
    l, r = func_1(int)
    if x[l - 1] == x[r]:
        print('Yes')
        continue
    lower = func_2(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or -1
    upper = func_2(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)
    lower = inds[x[r]][lower + 1]
    upper = inds[x[l - 1]][upper]
    if upper > lower and l <= upper <= r and l <= lower <= r:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is the same as the initial value, `a` remains a list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq a_i < 2^{30}\), `x` is a list with `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to that point, `inds` is a defaultdict where each key is an element from `x` and the value is a list of indices where that element appears in `x`, `i` is 0, `q` must be greater than 0, `l` and `r` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`. If `x[l - 1]` is equal to `x[r]`, then the element at index `l - 1` in `x` is equal to the element at index `r` in `x`. `lower` is now the second largest index in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l`, or -1 if no such index exists. `upper` is the largest index in `inds[x[l - 1]]` that is less than or equal to `r`. If `upper` is greater than `lower`, `l` is less than or equal to `upper`, `upper` is less than or equal to `r`, and `l` is less than or equal to `lower`, which is less than or equal to `r`, then these conditions hold true. Otherwise, at least one of these conditions does not hold: `upper` is not greater than `lower`, `l` is not less than or equal to `upper`, `upper` is not less than or equal to `r`, or `l` is not less than or equal to `lower`, or `lower` is not less than or equal to `r`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is the same as the initial value, `a` remains a list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq a_i < 2^{30}\), `x` is a list with `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to that point, `inds` is a defaultdict where each key is an element from `x` and the value is a list of indices where that element appears in `x`, `i` is 1, `q` is greater than 1, `l` and `r` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `lower` is the second index in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l`, or `-1` if no such index exists, `upper` is the value at the position `upper` in the list `inds[x[l - 1]]`. If `upper > lower` and `l <= upper <= r` and `(l <= lower <= r)`, the conditions are met. Otherwise, the conditions are not met.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is the same as the initial value, `a` remains a list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq a_i < 2^{30}\), `x` is a list with `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to that point, `inds` is a defaultdict where each key is an element from `x` and the value is a list of indices where that element appears in `x`, `i` is 2, `q` is greater than 2, `l` and `r` are the new values returned by `func_1(int)`, `lower` is the third index in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l`, or `-1` if no such index exists, `upper` is the largest index in `inds[x[l - 1]]` that is less than or equal to `r`, and `upper` is now set to the value of the element at the `upper` index in the list `inds[x[l - 1]]`. If `x[l - 1] == x[r]`, the current iteration of the loop is skipped, and the next iteration begins. If `upper > lower` and `l <= upper <= r` and `(l <= lower <= r)`, the conditions are met, and the loop continues normally. Otherwise, the conditions are not met, and the loop continues normally.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
