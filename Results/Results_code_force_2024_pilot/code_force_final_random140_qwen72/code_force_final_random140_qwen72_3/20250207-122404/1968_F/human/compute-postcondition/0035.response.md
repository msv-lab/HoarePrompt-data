The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since there is no loop context provided in the initial state, the `continue` statement would typically be used within a loop to skip the remaining part of the loop body and proceed to the next iteration.

However, since the initial state does not specify a loop, the `continue` statement here would not have any effect on the variables or the flow of the program outside of a loop. Therefore, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the same as the initial value, `a` remains a list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq a_i < 2^{30}\), `x` is a list with `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to that point, `inds` is a defaultdict where each key is an element from `x` and the value is a list of indices where that element appears in `x`, `i` is 1, `q` must be greater than 1, `l` and `r` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`.**
