The code snippet `a = list(func_1(int))` updates the variable `a` to be a list of integers returned by the function `func_1(int)`. Since `n` and `q` are already updated to the values returned by `func_1(int)` in the initial state, the list `a` will contain `n` integers. The values of `n`, `q`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `q` are updated to the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n.**
