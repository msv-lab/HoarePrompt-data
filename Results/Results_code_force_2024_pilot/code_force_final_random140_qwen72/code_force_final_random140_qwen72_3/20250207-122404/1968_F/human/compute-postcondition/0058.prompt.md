You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and q are positive integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5. a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30. l and r are integers such that 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n.
def func_3():
    n, q = func_1(int)
    a = list(func_1(int))
    x = [0]
    inds = defaultdict(list)
    inds[0].append(0)
    for i in a:
        x.append(x[-1] ^ i)
        
        inds[x[-1]].append(len(x) - 1)
        
    #State: `n` is the same as the initial value, `a` remains a list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq a_i < 2^{30}\), `x` is a list with `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to that point, and `inds` is a defaultdict where each key is an element from `x` and the value is a list of indices where that element appears in `x`.
    for i in range(q):
        l, r = func_1(int)
        
        if x[l - 1] == x[r]:
            print('Yes')
            continue
        
        lower = func_2(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or -1
        
        upper = func_2(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)
        
        lower = inds[x[r]][lower + 1]
        
        upper = inds[x[l - 1]][upper]
        
        if upper > lower and l <= upper <= r and l <= lower <= r:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: `n` is the same as the initial value, `a` remains a list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq a_i < 2^{30}\), `x` is a list with `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to that point, `inds` is a defaultdict where each key is an element from `x` and the value is a list of indices where that element appears in `x`, `i` is `q`, `q` is the same as the initial value, and the values of `l`, `r`, `lower`, and `upper` are undefined or reset after the loop completes.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts positive integers `n` and `q`, a list `a` of `n` integers, and two integers `l` and `r` such that 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n. It processes these inputs and returns a result based on the specified constraints.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
