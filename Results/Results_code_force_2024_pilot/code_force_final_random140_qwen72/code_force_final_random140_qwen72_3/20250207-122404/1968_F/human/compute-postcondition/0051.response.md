Output State: **`n` is the same as the initial value, `a` remains a list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq a_i < 2^{30}\), `x` is a list with `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to that point, `inds` is a defaultdict where each key is an element from `x` and the value is a list of indices where that element appears in `x`, `i` is 2, `q` is greater than 2, `l` and `r` are the new values returned by `func_1(int)`, `lower` is the third index in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l`, or `-1` if no such index exists, `upper` is the largest index in `inds[x[l - 1]]` that is less than or equal to `r`. If `x[l - 1] == x[r]`, the current iteration of the loop is skipped, and the next iteration begins. Otherwise, the conditions are not met, and the loop continues normally.**

Explanation:
- The code updates the value of `lower` by setting it to the next index in the list `inds[x[r]]` after the current `lower` value.
- Since `lower` was initially the second index in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l`, or `-1` if no such index exists, after the code executes, `lower` becomes the third index in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l`, or `-1` if no such index exists.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
