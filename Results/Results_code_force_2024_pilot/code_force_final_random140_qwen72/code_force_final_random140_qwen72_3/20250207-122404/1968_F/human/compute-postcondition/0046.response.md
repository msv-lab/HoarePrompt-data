To determine what will be printed by the `print('Yes')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

### Initial State:
- `n` is the same as the initial value.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq a_i < 2^{30}\).
- `x` is a list with `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to that point.
- `inds` is a defaultdict where each key is an element from `x` and the value is a list of indices where that element appears in `x`.
- `i` is 2.
- `q` is greater than 2.
- `l` and `r` are the new values returned by `func_1(int)`.
- `lower` is the second index in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l`, or `-1` if no such index exists.
- `upper` is the value at the position `upper` in the list `inds[x[l - 1]]`.

### Conditions:
- If `upper > lower` and `l <= upper <= r` and `(l <= lower <= r)`, the conditions are met.
- Otherwise, the conditions are not met.

### Analysis:
1. **`x` List Construction**:
   - `x` is constructed such that `x[0] = 0` and `x[i] = a[0] ^ a[1] ^ ... ^ a[i-1]` for `i > 0`.
   - This means `x` contains the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a`.

2. **`inds` Dictionary**:
   - `inds` maps each unique value in `x` to a list of indices where that value appears in `x`.

3. **`l` and `r` Values**:
   - `l` and `r` are determined by the function `func_1(int)`, but the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided. We assume `l` and `r` are valid indices within the range of `x`.

4. **`lower` Value**:
   - `lower` is the second index in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l`. If no such index exists, `lower` is set to `-1`.

5. **`upper` Value**:
   - `upper` is the value at the position `upper` in the list `inds[x[l - 1]]`.

6. **Conditions Check**:
   - The conditions check if `upper > lower` and `l <= upper <= r` and `(l <= lower <= r)`.
   - If all these conditions are met, the print statement will execute.

### Conclusion:
Given the conditions and the structure of the problem, the `print('Yes')` statement will only execute if the conditions are met. Since the exact values of `l`, `r`, `lower`, and `upper` are not explicitly provided, we cannot definitively determine if the conditions are met without more information. However, based on the structure of the problem, if the conditions are met, the output will be:

Output: **Yes**
