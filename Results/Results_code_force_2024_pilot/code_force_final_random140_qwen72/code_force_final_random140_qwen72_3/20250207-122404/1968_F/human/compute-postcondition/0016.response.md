Output State: **`n` is the same as the initial value, `a` remains a list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq a_i < 2^{30}\), `x` is a list with `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to that point, and `inds` is a defaultdict where each key is an element from `x` and the value is a list of indices where that element appears in `x`.**

### Explanation:
- **`n`**: The value of `n` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.
- **`a`**: The list `a` also remains unchanged as it is only iterated over and not modified.
- **`x`**: Initially, `x` starts with a single element `[0]`. For each element `i` in `a`, the loop appends the result of `x[-1] ^ i` to `x`. After `n` iterations, `x` will have `n + 1` elements, where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to that point.
- **`inds`**: The `inds` dictionary is updated in each iteration. For each new element added to `x`, the corresponding index (which is `len(x) - 1`) is appended to the list associated with the key `x[-1]` in `inds`. Therefore, `inds` will contain keys that are the elements of `x`, and the values will be lists of indices where those elements appear in `x`.
