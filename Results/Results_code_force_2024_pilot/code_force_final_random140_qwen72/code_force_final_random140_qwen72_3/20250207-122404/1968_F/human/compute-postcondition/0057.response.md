The function `func_3` accepts several parameters: `n`, `q`, `a`, `l`, and `r`. Here, `n` and `q` are positive integers with constraints 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5. The parameter `a` is a list of `n` integers, each of which is within the range 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30. The parameters `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n.

The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the given parameters. However, the specific output conditions are not provided in the problem statement, so I will describe the general functionality based on the parameters:

Functionality: **The function accepts positive integers `n` and `q`, a list `a` of `n` integers, and two integers `l` and `r` such that 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n. It processes these inputs and returns a result based on the specified constraints.**
