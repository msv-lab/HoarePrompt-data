The code appends the index `len(x) - 1` to the list `inds[x[-1]]`. This means that the list `inds[x[-1]]` now includes the index `len(x) - 1`.

Let's break down the changes:

- `inds[x[-1]]` is updated to include the new index `len(x) - 1`.
- All other variables (`n`, `a`, `i`, `x`, `inds[x[-2] ^ i]`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is at least 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq a_i < 2^{30}\), `i` is the second element of `a`, `x` has one additional element which is the result of `x[-1] ^ i`, `inds[x[-1]]` now includes the index `len(x) - 1`, `inds[x[-2] ^ i]` now includes the index `len(x) - 1`.**
