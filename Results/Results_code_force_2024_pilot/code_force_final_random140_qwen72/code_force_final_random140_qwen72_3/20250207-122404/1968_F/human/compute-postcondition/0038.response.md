Output State: **`n` is the same as the initial value, `a` remains a list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq a_i < 2^{30}\), `x` is a list with `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to that point, `inds` is a defaultdict where each key is an element from `x` and the value is a list of indices where that element appears in `x`, `i` is 1, `q` is greater than 1, `l` and `r` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `lower` is the first index in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l`, or `-1` if no such index exists, `upper` is the last index in `inds[x[l - 1]]` that is less than or equal to `r`, or `-1` if no such index exists.** 

Explanation:
- The code assigns the value of `func_2(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)` to the variable `upper`.
- `func_2` is expected to find the last index in the list `inds[x[l - 1]]` that satisfies the condition `arg <= r`. If no such index exists, `upper` will be `-1`.
- All other variables (`n`, `a`, `x`, `inds`, `i`, `q`, `l`, `r`, `lower`) remain unchanged.
