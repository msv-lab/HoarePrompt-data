Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq a_i < 2^{30}\), `i` is the third element of `a`, `x` has one additional element which is the result of `x[-2] ^ i`, `inds[x[-1]]` now includes the index `len(x) - 1`, `inds[x[-2] ^ i]` now includes the index `len(x) - 1`, and `inds[x[-1]]` has been appended with the index `len(x) - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The code `inds[x[-1]].append(len(x) - 1)` appends the index `len(x) - 1` to the list `inds[x[-1]]`.
- All other conditions from the initial state remain unchanged:
  - `n` is at least 2.
  - `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element \(0 \leq a_i < 2^{30}\).
  - `i` is the third element of `a`.
  - `x` has one additional element which is the result of `x[-2] ^ i`.
  - `inds[x[-1]]` now includes the index `len(x) - 1`.
  - `inds[x[-2] ^ i]` now includes the index `len(x) - 1`.
  - `inds[x[-1]]` has been appended with the index `len(x) - 1`.

Thus, the output state reflects these conditions accurately.
