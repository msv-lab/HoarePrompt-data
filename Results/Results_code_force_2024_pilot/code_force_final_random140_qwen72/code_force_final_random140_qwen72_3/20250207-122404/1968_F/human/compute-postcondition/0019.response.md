Postcondition: **`n` is the same as the initial value, `a` remains a list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq a_i < 2^{30}\), `x` is a list with `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to that point, `inds` is a defaultdict where each key is an element from `x` and the value is a list of indices where that element appears in `x`, `i` is 0, `q` must be greater than 0, `l` and `r` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`, and the element at index `l - 1` in `x` is equal to the element at index `r` in `x`.**
