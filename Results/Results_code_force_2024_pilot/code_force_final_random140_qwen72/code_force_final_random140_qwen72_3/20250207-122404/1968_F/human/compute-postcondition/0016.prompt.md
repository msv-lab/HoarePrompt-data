Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` and `q` are updated to the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n, `x` is a list containing a single element 0, `inds` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, `inds[0]` now contains the list `[0]`.
Code of the loop:
for i in a:
    x.append(x[-1] ^ i)
    inds[x[-1]].append(len(x) - 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is at least 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30, `i` is the first element of `a`, `x` has one additional element which is the result of `x[-1] ^ i`, `inds[x[-1]]` now includes the index `len(x) - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The code appends the current length of `x` minus 1 to the list `inds[x[-1]]`. This means that the list `inds[x[-1]]` now includes the index `len(x) - 1`.

Let's break down the changes:

- `inds[x[-1]]` is updated to include the new index `len(x) - 1`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is at least 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq a_i < 2^{30}\), `i` is the second element of `a`, `x` has one additional element which is the result of `x[-1] ^ i`, `inds[x[-1]]` now includes the index `len(x) - 1`, `inds[x[-2] ^ i]` now includes the index `len(x) - 1`, and `inds[x[-1]]` has been appended with the index `len(x) - 1`.**

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is at least 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq a_i < 2^{30}\), `i` is the third element of `a`, `x` has one additional element which is the result of `x[-2] ^ i`, `inds[x[-1]]` now includes the index `len(x) - 1`, `inds[x[-2] ^ i]` now includes the index `len(x) - 1`, and `inds[x[-1]]` has been appended with the index `len(x) - 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
