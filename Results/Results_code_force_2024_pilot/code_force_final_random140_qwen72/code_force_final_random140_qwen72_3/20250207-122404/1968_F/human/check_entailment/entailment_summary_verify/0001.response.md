### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires determining if a subarray \(a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r\) can be divided into \(k > 1\) parts such that the bitwise XOR of each part is the same.
   - This involves checking if there exists a way to partition the subarray such that the XOR of elements in each part is equal.

2. **Prefix XOR Array:**
   - The program constructs a prefix XOR array `x` where `x[i]` is the XOR of the first `i` elements of the array `a`.
   - This allows us to quickly compute the XOR of any subarray \(a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r\) using `x[r] ^ x[l-1]`.

3. **Binary Search for Indices:**
   - The program uses binary search to find indices in the prefix XOR array that match the required conditions.
   - Specifically, it checks if there are indices `lower` and `upper` such that `x[lower] == x[r]` and `x[upper] == x[l-1]` within the range `[l, r]`.

4. **Conditions for "Interesting" Subarray:**
   - If `x[l-1] == x[r]`, the subarray is trivially interesting because the entire subarray has a XOR of zero, which can be split into multiple parts with XOR zero.
   - Otherwise, the program checks if there are indices `lower` and `upper` such that `upper > lower` and both indices are within the range `[l, r]`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases correctly by ensuring that the indices are within the valid range and that the conditions for "interesting" subarrays are met.

6. **Function Summaries:**
   - **func_1**: Reads input and casts it to the specified type.
   - **func_2**: Performs binary search on a list to find the first element that satisfies a predicate.
   - **func_3**: Processes the main logic of the program, including constructing the prefix XOR array and handling queries.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **func_1**: This function reads input and maps it to the specified type. It is used to read the number of test cases, the size of the array, and the array itself. This function works correctly and efficiently.

- **func_2**: This function performs binary search to find the first element in a list that satisfies a given predicate. It is used to find the indices in the prefix XOR array that match the required conditions. The binary search implementation is correct and efficient.

- **func_3**: This function processes the main logic of the program:
  - It reads the number of elements `n` and the number of queries `q`.
  - It reads the array `a` and constructs the prefix XOR array `x`.
  - It uses a dictionary `inds` to store the indices of each unique XOR value in `x`.
  - For each query, it checks if the subarray from `l-1` to `r` is interesting by:
    - Checking if `x[l-1] == x[r]`.
    - Using binary search to find indices `lower` and `upper` such that `x[lower] == x[r]` and `x[upper] == x[l-1]` within the range `[l, r]`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is interesting based on the given problem description. It uses efficient data structures and algorithms to handle the constraints and edge cases. The original assessment is accurate.
