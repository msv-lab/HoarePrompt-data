Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is 32, `y` is `arr[2]`, `k` is `y.bit_length() - 1`, `ans` is `23 + 2 * (pre[y.bit_length() - 1][0] * suf[y.bit_length() - 1][0] + pre[y.bit_length() - 1][1] * suf[y.bit_length() - 1][1])`, `c` is `prefix[3]`, `j` is 31. For each bit position `j` from 0 to 31 in `c`, if the bit at position `j` is 1, then `pre[j][1]` is increased by 1 and `suf[j][1]` is decreased by 1. If the bit at position `j` is 0, then `pre[j][0]` is incremented by 1 and `suf[j][0]` is decremented by 1.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates 32 times, from `j = 0` to `j = 31`.
- For each iteration, the loop checks the bit at position `j` in `c` using the expression `c >> j & 1`.
- If the bit is 1, `pre[j][1]` is incremented by 1 and `suf[j][1]` is decremented by 1.
- If the bit is 0, `pre[j][0]` is incremented by 1 and `suf[j][0]` is decremented by 1.
- After all iterations, `j` will be back to its initial value of 31, as it is reset by the loop structure.
- The other variables (`i`, `n`, `y`, `k`, `ans`, `c`) remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop.
