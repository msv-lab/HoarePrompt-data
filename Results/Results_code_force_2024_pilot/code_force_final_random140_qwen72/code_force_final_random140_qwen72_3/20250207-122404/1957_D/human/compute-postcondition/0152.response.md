The function `func_1` is described with certain parameter constraints but lacks explicit input parameters in the function definition. However, based on the provided constraints, it seems the function should accept two parameters: `t` (the number of test cases) and a list of lists `a` (where each sublist represents a test case with `n` integers). Given the constraints:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

The function's output is not explicitly defined, but typically in such scenarios, the function would process each test case and return a result for each one. Since the specific output is not provided, I'll assume the function processes the data and returns a list of results corresponding to each test case.

Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t`, an integer representing the number of test cases, and `a`, a list of lists where each sublist contains `n` integers. It processes each test case and returns a list of results corresponding to each test case.**
