Output State: **`arr` remains unchanged, `prefix` contains `len(arr) + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` up to that point.**

### Explanation:
- **`arr`**: The original list `arr` remains unchanged because the loop does not modify `arr`.
- **`prefix`**: Initially, `prefix` starts with a single element `[0]`. For each element `v` in `arr`, the loop appends the result of `v ^ prefix[-1]` to `prefix`. After the loop completes, `prefix` will have `len(arr) + 1` elements. Each element in `prefix` represents the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` up to that point. Specifically:
  - `prefix[0]` is `0`.
  - `prefix[1]` is `arr[0] ^ 0`.
  - `prefix[2]` is `arr[1] ^ prefix[1]`.
  - And so on, until the last element `prefix[len(arr)]` which is `arr[-1] ^ prefix[-2]`.

Thus, the final state of `prefix` is a list where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` up to that index.
