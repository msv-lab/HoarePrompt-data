Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is 32, `y` is `arr[0]`, `k` is `arr[0].bit_length() - 1`, `ans` is 23, `c` is `prefix[1]`, `j` is 1, `pre[j][1]` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet `pre[j][1] += 1` increments the value of `pre[j][1]` by 1. Since `j` is 1, `pre[1][1]` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
