Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is 32, `y` is `arr[1]`, `k` is `y.bit_length() - 1`, `ans` is `23 + (pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1])`, `c` is `prefix[2]`, `j` is 2. If `c >> j & 1` is true, `pre[j][1]` is incremented by 1 and `suf[j][1]` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `pre[j][0]` is incremented by 1 and `suf[j][0]` is decremented by 1.***
