Postcondition: **`arr` remains unchanged, `prefix` contains `len(arr) + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` up to that point, `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, where each sublist is `[32, 0]`, `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing `[0, 0]` except for each sublist at index `j` (where `j` ranges from 0 to 31), which is `[0, x]` if the bit at position `j` in `cur` is 1, or `[x, 0]` if the bit at position `j` in `cur` is 0, where `x` is the count of how many times the corresponding bit was 1 or 0 during the loop's execution, `i` is 30, `n` must be greater than 0, `cur` is now the value of `prefix[30]`, and `j` is 0, and the bit at position `j` in `cur` is 0**
