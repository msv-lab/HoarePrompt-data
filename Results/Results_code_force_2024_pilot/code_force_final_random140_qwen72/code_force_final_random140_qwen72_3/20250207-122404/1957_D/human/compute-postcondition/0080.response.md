Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is 32, `y` is `arr[0]`, `k` is `arr[0].bit_length() - 1`, `ans` is 23, `c` is `prefix[1]`, `j` is 0, the bit at position `j` in `c` is 1, `pre[0][1]` is increased by 1, `suf[j][1]` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation:
- The code `suf[j][1] -= 1` decreases the value of `suf[j][1]` by 1.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
