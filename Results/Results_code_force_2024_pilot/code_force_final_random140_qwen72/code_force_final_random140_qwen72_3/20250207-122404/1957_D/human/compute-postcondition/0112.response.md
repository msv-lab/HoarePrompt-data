Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is 32, `y` is `arr[1]`, `k` is `y.bit_length() - 1`, `ans` is `23 + (pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1])`, `c` is `prefix[2]`, `j` is 1, `pre[j][1]` is `pre[j][1] + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `pre[j][1]` is incremented by 1.
- All other variables (`i`, `n`, `y`, `k`, `ans`, `c`, `j`) remain unchanged from their initial values.
