The code snippet `suf[j][1] -= 1` decrements the value of `suf[j][1]` by 1. Given the initial state, `suf[j][1]` is already decremented by 1, so the new value of `suf[j][1]` is one less than its previous value.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is 32, `y` is `arr[1]`, `k` is `y.bit_length() - 1`, `ans` is `23 + (pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1])`, `c` is `prefix[2]`, `j` is 2, `pre[j][1]` is incremented by 1, `suf[j][1]` is decremented by 2.**
