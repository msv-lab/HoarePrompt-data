The code snippet `prefix.append(v ^ prefix[-1])` appends the result of the bitwise XOR operation between `v` and the last element of `prefix` to the list `prefix`.

- `prefix` is a list that must have at least one element.
- `v` is a variable whose value is not specified in the initial state, but it is assumed to be defined before this line of code is executed.

After executing the code, the new element is added to `prefix`, and the length of `prefix` increases by 1. The new last element of `prefix` is the result of `v ^ prefix[-1]`.

Output State: **`arr` must have at least one element, `prefix` now has an additional element which is the result of `v ^ prefix[-1]`.**
