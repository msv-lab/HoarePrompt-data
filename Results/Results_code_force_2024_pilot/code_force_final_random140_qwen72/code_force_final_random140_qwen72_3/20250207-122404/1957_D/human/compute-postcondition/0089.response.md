Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is 32, `y` is `arr[0]`, `k` is `arr[0].bit_length() - 1`, `ans` is 23, `c` is `prefix[1]`, `j` is 1, `pre[j][0]` is increased by 1, `suf[j][0]` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `suf[j][0]` is decreased by 1.
- All other variables (`i`, `n`, `y`, `k`, `ans`, `c`, `j`, `pre[j][0]`) remain unchanged from their initial values.
