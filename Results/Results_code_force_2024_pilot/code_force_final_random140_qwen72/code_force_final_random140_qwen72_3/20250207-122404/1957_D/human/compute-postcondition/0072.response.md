To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given the loop statement:
```python
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

- The loop will iterate from `i = 1` to `i = n`.
- For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 1.

The initial state provided includes:
- `i` is 0
- `n` is 32

Since `n` is already 32, which is greater than 1, the loop will execute. However, the loop variable `i` should start at 1, not 0, as specified in the loop head.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` is 32**
