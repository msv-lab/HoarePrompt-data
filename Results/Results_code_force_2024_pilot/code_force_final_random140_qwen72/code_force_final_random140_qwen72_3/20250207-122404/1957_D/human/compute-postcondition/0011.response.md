Output State: **`arr` remains unchanged, `prefix` contains `len(arr) + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` up to that point, `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing `[0, 0]`, `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing `[0, 0]`.**

Explanation: The code initializes a new list `suf` with 32 sublists, each containing `[0, 0]`. This does not affect the values of `arr`, `prefix`, or `pre`, which remain as they were in the initial state. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions plus the new state of `suf`.
