Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is 32, `y` is `arr[0]`, `k` is `arr[0].bit_length() - 1`, `ans` is 23, `c` is `prefix[1]`, `j` is 1. If the bit at position `j` of `c` is 1, then `pre[j][1]` is increased by 1 and `suf[j][1]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `pre[j][0]` is increased by 1 and `suf[j][0]` is decreased by 1.***
