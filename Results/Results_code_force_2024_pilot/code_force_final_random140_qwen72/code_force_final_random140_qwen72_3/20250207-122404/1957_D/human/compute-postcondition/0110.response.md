Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is 32, `y` is `arr[1]`, `k` is `y.bit_length() - 1`, `ans` is `23 + (pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1])`, `c` is `prefix[2]`, `j` is 0. If the bit at position `j` of `c` is 1, `pre[j][1]` is increased by 1 and `suf[j][1]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, if the bit at position `j` of `c` is 0, `pre[j][0]` is increased by 1 and `suf[j][0]` is decreased by 1.***
