Output State: **`arr` remains unchanged, `prefix` contains `len(arr) + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` up to that point, `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, where each sublist is `[32, 0]`, `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing `[0, 0]` except for each sublist at index `j` (where `j` ranges from 0 to 31), which is `[0, x+1]` if the bit at position `j` in `cur` is 1, or `[1, 0]` if the bit at position `j` in `cur` is 0, where `x` is the count of how many times the corresponding bit was 1 or 0 during the loop's execution, `i` is 30, `n` must be greater than 0, `cur` is now the value of `prefix[30]`, and `j` is 31. After all iterations, `suf[j]` will be `[0, 1]` if the bit at position `j` in `cur` is 1, or `[1, 0]` if the bit at position `j` in `cur` is 0, for each `j` from 0 to 31.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each bit position from 0 to 31.
- For each bit position `j`, the loop checks if the bit at position `j` in `cur` is 1 or 0.
- If the bit is 1, it increments `suf[j][1]` by 1.
- If the bit is 0, it increments `suf[j][0]` by 1.
- After all 32 iterations, `suf[j]` will contain the counts of how many times the bit at position `j` in `cur` was 1 or 0.
- Since the loop runs exactly 32 times, `j` will end up being 31 after the last iteration.
