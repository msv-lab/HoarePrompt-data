Postcondition: **`arr` remains unchanged, `prefix` contains `len(arr) + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` up to that point, `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, where each sublist is `[32, 0]`, `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing `[0, 0]` except for each sublist at index `j` (where `j` ranges from 0 to 31), which is `[0, x+1]` if the bit at position `j` in `cur` is 1, or `[1, 0]` if the bit at position `j` in `cur` is 0, `i` is 29, `n` must be greater than 29, `cur` is now the value of `prefix[29]`, `j` is 0, and the bit at position `j` (0) in `cur` is 1.**
