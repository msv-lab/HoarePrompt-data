The code appends the result of `v ^ prefix[-1]` to the list `prefix`. Since `prefix` initially has an additional element which is the result of `v ^ prefix[-1]`, appending this same value again means that `prefix` now has one more element than before, and this new element is the same as the previously added additional element.

Output State: **`arr` must have at least three elements, `prefix` has an additional element which is the result of `v ^ prefix[-1]`, and this element is appended again to `prefix`.**
