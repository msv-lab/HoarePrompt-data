The only object in the loop head is the variable `j`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` relative to the range specified in the loop, which is from 0 to 31 (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`i` is 3, `n` is 32, `y` is `arr[2]`, `k` is `y.bit_length() - 1`, `ans` is `23 + 2 * (pre[y.bit_length() - 1][0] * suf[y.bit_length() - 1][0] + pre[y.bit_length() - 1][1] * suf[y.bit_length() - 1][1])`, `c` is `prefix[3]`, `j` is 2. If the least significant bit of `c` (i.e., `c >> j & 1`) is 1, then `pre[1][1]` is increased by 1 and `suf[1][1]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, if the bit at position `j` in `c` is 0, then `pre[1][0]` is incremented by 1 and `suf[1][0]` is decremented by 1.**
