The only variable in the loop head is `j`, and the loop is defined to iterate over the range from 0 to 31 (inclusive). For the loop to execute, `j` must start at 0. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `y`, `k`, `ans`, `c`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`i` is 3, `n` is 32, `y` is `arr[2]`, `k` is `y.bit_length() - 1`, `ans` is `23 + 2 * (pre[y.bit_length() - 1][0] * suf[y.bit_length() - 1][0] + pre[y.bit_length() - 1][1] * suf[y.bit_length() - 1][1])`, `c` is `prefix[3]`, `j` is 0**
