Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is 32, `y` is `arr[2]`, `k` is `y.bit_length() - 1`, `ans` is `23 + 2 * (pre[y.bit_length() - 1][0] * suf[y.bit_length() - 1][0] + pre[y.bit_length() - 1][1] * suf[y.bit_length() - 1][1])`, `c` is `prefix[3]`, `j` is 2, `pre[2][1]` is increased by 1, `suf[2][1]` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `suf[j][1]` is decremented by 1, where `j` is 2. So, `suf[2][1]` is now `suf[2][1] - 1`.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
