Postcondition: ***`arr` remains unchanged, `prefix` contains `len(arr) + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` up to that point, `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, where each sublist is `[32, 0]`, `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing `[0, 0]` except for the sublist at index `j` which is `[0, 1]` if the least significant bit of `cur` (i.e., `cur >> j & 1`) is 1, or `[1, 0]` if the bit at position `j` in `cur` is 0, `i` is 31, `n` must be greater than 0, `cur` is the cumulative XOR of the first 31 elements in `arr`, and `j` is 0.***
