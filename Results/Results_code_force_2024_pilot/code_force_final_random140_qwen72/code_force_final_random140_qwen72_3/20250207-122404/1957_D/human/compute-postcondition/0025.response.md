Output State: **`arr` remains unchanged, `prefix` contains `len(arr) + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` up to that point, `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, where each sublist is `[32, 0]`, `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing `[1, 0]` at index `j` and `[0, 0]` otherwise, `i` is 31, `n` must be greater than 0, `cur` is the cumulative XOR of the first 31 elements in `arr`, `j` is 0, and the bit at position `j` in `cur` is 0.**
