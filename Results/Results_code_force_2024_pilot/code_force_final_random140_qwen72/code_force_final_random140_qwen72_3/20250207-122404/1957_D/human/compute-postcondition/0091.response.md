The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` relative to the upper limit of the range, which is 32. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2, and it must still be less than 32.

State: **`i` is 1, `n` is 32, `y` is `arr[0]`, `k` is `arr[0].bit_length() - 1`, `ans` is 23, `c` is `prefix[1]`, `j` is 2**
