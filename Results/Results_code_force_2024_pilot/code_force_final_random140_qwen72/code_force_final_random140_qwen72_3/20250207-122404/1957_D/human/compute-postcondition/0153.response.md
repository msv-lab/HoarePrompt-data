Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `arr` from the input. It calculates a value `ans` based on the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` and the bit counts of these cumulative XOR values. The function then prints the value of `ans`. The function does not return any value; instead, it directly prints the result. The input list `arr` remains unchanged throughout the function execution. **
