The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and the range limit `32`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` being less than `32`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 to 2, and `32` remains unchanged as it is the upper limit of the loop.

State: **`i` is 2, `n` is 32, `y` is `arr[1]`, `k` is `y.bit_length() - 1`, `ans` is `23 + (pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1])`, `c` is `prefix[2]`, `j` is 2. If `c >> j & 1` is true, `pre[j][1]` is incremented by 1 and `suf[j][1]` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `pre[j][0]` is incremented by 1 and `suf[j][0]` is decremented by 1.**
