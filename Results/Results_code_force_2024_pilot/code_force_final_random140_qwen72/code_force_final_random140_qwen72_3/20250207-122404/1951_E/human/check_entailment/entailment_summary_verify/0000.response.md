### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided functions to see if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to partition a string into substrings such that none of the substrings are palindromes.
- For each test case, we need to output "YES" if such a partition exists, followed by the number of parts and the parts themselves. If no such partition exists, we output "NO".

#### Function Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Purpose**: Check if a string is a palindrome.
   - **Implementation**: The function checks if the first half of the string is equal to the reversed second half.
   - **Issue**: This implementation is incorrect. A correct palindrome check should compare the entire string with its reverse. For example, `func_1("abcba")` should return `True`, but the current implementation will return `False`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Purpose**: Determine the number of parts to partition the string.
   - **Implementation**: The function returns different integers based on the length of the string and the result of `func_1` on the first half of the string.
   - **Issue**: This function does not perform the actual partitioning and does not handle the case where the string cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings. It also does not output the required "YES" or "NO" responses.

#### Missing Logic:
- The program does not handle multiple test cases.
- It does not output the required "YES" or "NO" responses.
- It does not perform the actual partitioning of the string into non-palindromic substrings.

#### Specific Case Analysis:
- **Input**: `"lllllllll"`
- **Expected Output**:
  ```
  NO
  ```
- **Actual Output**: The program does not produce the correct output because it lacks the necessary logic to handle this case.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not correctly solve the problem as described. They lack the necessary logic to handle multiple test cases, perform the required partitioning, and output the correct results.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
