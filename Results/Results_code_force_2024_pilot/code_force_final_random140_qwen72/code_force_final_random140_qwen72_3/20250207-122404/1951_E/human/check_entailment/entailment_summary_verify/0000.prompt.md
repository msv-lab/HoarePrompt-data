You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(ch):
    if len(ch) % 2 == 0:
        x = len(ch) // 2
    else:
        x = len(ch) // 2 + 1
    if ch[:len(ch) // 2] == ch[x:][::-1]:
        return True
    else:
        return False

#Function 2:
def func_2(ch):
    b = len(ch) // 2
    if len(ch) % 2 == 0:
        if func_1(ch[:b]):
            a = 3
        else:
            a = 4
    elif func_1(ch[:b]):
        a = 1
    else:
        a = 2
    return a



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` takes a string `ch` consisting of lowercase Latin characters and returns an integer based on the length of `ch` and the result of calling `func_1` on the first half of `ch`. If the length of `ch` is even and `func_1(ch[:b])` returns `True`, it returns 3; if `func_1(ch[:b])` returns `False`, it returns 4. If the length of `ch` is odd and `func_1(ch[:b])` returns `True`, it returns 1; if `func_1(ch[:b])` returns `False`, it returns 2. The function does not modify the input string `ch`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not fully address the problem description. Specifically, they do not handle the partitioning of the string into non-palindromic substrings as required. Here are a few issues:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function checks if a string is a palindrome, but it only checks the first half against the reversed second half, which is incorrect. A correct palindrome check should compare the entire string with its reverse.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function attempts to determine the number of parts to partition the string, but it does not actually perform the partitioning. It also does not handle the case where the string cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.

3. **Missing Logic**: The program does not include any logic to handle multiple test cases or to output the required "YES" or "NO" responses along with the partition details.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:
- **Input**: `"lllllllll"`
- **Expected Output**: 
  ```
  NO
  ```
- **Actual Output**: The program does not produce the correct output because it lacks the necessary logic to handle this case.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
