### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function correctly checks if a given string `ch` is a palindrome.
   - It splits the string into two halves and compares the first half with the reversed second half.
   - If the string is a palindrome, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function attempts to determine the minimum number of parts needed to partition a string `ch` such that no part is a palindrome.
   - It calculates the midpoint of the string and checks if the first half is a palindrome.
   - However, the logic for determining the number of parts is flawed. It does not correctly handle all cases, especially when the string is a palindrome and needs to be split into non-palindromic parts.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic in the provided code attempts to handle multiple test cases and uses `func_1` and `func_2` to determine if a valid partition exists.
   - The logic includes several checks to determine if the string is a palindrome or if it can be split into non-palindromic parts.
   - However, the logic is overly complex and contains several issues:
     - The check `if s == s[0] * len(s)` is used to determine if the string consists of the same character repeated. This is a valid check, but it is not sufficient to handle all cases.
     - The check `elif len(s) > 2 and s == s[:2] * (len(s) // 2) + s[0]` is intended to handle specific patterns, but it is not clear why this specific pattern is being checked.
     - The use of `func_2` to determine the number of parts is flawed, as explained earlier.
     - The logic for splitting the string into non-palindromic parts is not robust and may fail for certain inputs.

### Issues:
- **Overly Complex Logic**: The main logic is overly complex and contains unnecessary checks.
- **Flawed Partitioning Logic**: The logic for determining the number of parts and splitting the string is flawed and may not produce the correct results for all inputs.
- **Missing Edge Cases**: The code does not handle all edge cases, such as strings of length 1 or 2, which are inherently non-palindromic.

### Correct Approach:
- For each test case, check if the entire string is a palindrome.
- If the string is not a palindrome, the entire string can be a single part.
- If the string is a palindrome, try to split it into the smallest possible non-palindromic parts. For example, if the string is "aaa", it can be split into "aa" and "a".

### Conclusion:
The provided code is incorrect due to the flawed partitioning logic and overly complex main logic. The program does not handle all cases correctly and may produce incorrect results for certain inputs.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
