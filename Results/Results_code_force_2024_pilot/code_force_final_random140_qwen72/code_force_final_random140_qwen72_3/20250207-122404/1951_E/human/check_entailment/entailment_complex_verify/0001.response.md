### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function correctly checks if a given string `ch` is a palindrome.
   - It splits the string into two halves and compares the first half with the reversed second half.
   - If the string is a palindrome, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function attempts to determine the minimum number of parts needed to partition a string `ch` such that no part is a palindrome.
   - However, the logic in `func_2` is flawed. It does not correctly handle the partitioning of the string to ensure no part is a palindrome. Instead, it returns a fixed number of parts based on the length and the result of `func_1` on the first half of the string.
   - For example, if the string length is even and the first half is a palindrome, it returns 3, which is not necessarily the correct number of parts needed to ensure no part is a palindrome.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic in the provided code attempts to process multiple test cases and use `func_1` and `func_2` to determine if a valid partition exists.
   - However, the logic is overly complex and contains several issues:
     - It incorrectly handles special cases like strings with all identical characters or strings that are repeated patterns.
     - The partitioning logic is not robust and does not always produce valid partitions.
     - The use of `T1` and `T2` flags and the variable `a` is confusing and does not clearly convey the intended logic.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Partitioning Logic**: The logic in `func_2` and the main loop does not correctly handle the partitioning of the string to ensure no part is a palindrome.
- **Overly Complex and Confusing Code**: The main logic is overly complex and difficult to follow, leading to potential bugs and incorrect results.
- **Special Cases Not Handled Properly**: Special cases like strings with all identical characters or repeated patterns are not handled correctly.

### Correct Approach:
- For each test case, check if the entire string is a palindrome.
- If the string is not a palindrome, the entire string can be a single part.
- If the string is a palindrome, try to split it into the smallest possible non-palindromic parts. For example, if the string is "aaa", it can be split into "a", "a", "a". If the string is "abba", it can be split into "a", "bb", "a".

### Conclusion:
The provided code is incorrect due to the flawed partitioning logic and the overly complex and confusing main logic. The program does not correctly handle all cases and does not always produce valid partitions.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
