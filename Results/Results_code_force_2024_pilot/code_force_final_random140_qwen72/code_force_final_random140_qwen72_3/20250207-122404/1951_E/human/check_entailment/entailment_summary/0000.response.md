### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to partition a given string `s` into substrings such that none of the substrings are palindromes.
   - If such a partition is possible, we output "YES" followed by the number of parts and the parts themselves.
   - If no such partition is possible, we output "NO".

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(ch)`**: This function checks if the first half of the string `ch` is a mirror image of the second half. It returns `True` if the string is a palindrome when split into two halves, and `False` otherwise.
   - **`func_2(ch)`**: This function determines a value `a` based on the length of `ch` and the result of `func_1` applied to the first half of `ch`. The value of `a` is used to guide the partitioning logic.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The main loop iterates over each test case.
   - It first checks if the string `s` is a repeated character (e.g., "aaaa"). If so, it sets `T1` to `False` because such a string cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.
   - It also checks if the string is a repeated pattern of a two-character substring (e.g., "ababab"). If so, it sets `T1` to `False`.
   - If `T1` is still `True`, it calls `func_1(s)` to check if the entire string is a palindrome. If it is, it further calls `func_2(s)` to determine the partitioning strategy.
   - Based on the value of `a` returned by `func_2`, it attempts to partition the string into non-palindromic substrings.
   - If successful, it prints "YES" followed by the number of parts and the parts themselves. If not, it prints "NO".

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles edge cases like strings of length 1 or 2 correctly.
   - It also handles cases where the string is a repeated character or a repeated pattern of a two-character substring.

5. **Partitioning Strategy**:
   - The partitioning strategy is based on the value of `a`:
     - If `a == 0`, the string is already non-palindromic.
     - If `a == 1`, it tries to split the string at the midpoint plus one.
     - If `a == 2`, it tries to find a valid split point by iterating through the string.
     - If `a == 3`, it splits the string at the midpoint plus one.
     - If `a == 4`, it splits the string at the midpoint.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly handle the problem requirements and edge cases. The partitioning logic is sound and follows the rules specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
