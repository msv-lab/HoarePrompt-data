### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function checks if a given string `ch` is a palindrome.
   - It splits the string into two halves and compares the first half with the reversed second half.
   - If the string is a palindrome, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function determines the minimum number of parts needed to partition a string `ch` such that no part is a palindrome.
   - It first calculates the midpoint of the string.
   - If the string length is even:
     - It checks if the first half of the string is a palindrome using `func_1`.
     - If it is a palindrome, it sets `a` to 3 (indicating that at least 3 parts are needed).
     - If it is not a palindrome, it sets `a` to 4 (indicating that at least 4 parts are needed).
   - If the string length is odd:
     - It checks if the first half of the string is a palindrome using `func_1`.
     - If it is a palindrome, it sets `a` to 1 (indicating that at least 1 part is needed).
     - If it is not a palindrome, it sets `a` to 2 (indicating that at least 2 parts are needed).

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic is missing from the provided code. We need to implement the main function that processes multiple test cases and uses `func_1` and `func_2` to determine if a valid partition exists and to output the partition.

### Issues:
- **Incomplete Main Logic**: The provided code only includes helper functions (`func_1` and `func_2`). The main logic for processing test cases and generating the required output is missing.
- **Incorrect Partitioning Logic**: The logic in `func_2` is not correct for determining the minimum number of parts needed to ensure no part is a palindrome. The function should focus on finding a valid partition rather than just returning a fixed number of parts.

### Correct Approach:
- For each test case, check if the entire string is a palindrome.
- If the string is not a palindrome, the entire string can be a single part.
- If the string is a palindrome, try to split it into the smallest possible non-palindromic parts.

### Conclusion:
The provided code is incomplete and contains logical errors in the partitioning logic. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
