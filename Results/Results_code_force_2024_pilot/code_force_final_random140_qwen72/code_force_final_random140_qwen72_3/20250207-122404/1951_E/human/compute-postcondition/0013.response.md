Postcondition: ***`ch` is a string of lowercase Latin characters, and `b` is the integer division of the length of `ch` by 2. If the length of `ch` is even, and `func_1(ch[:b])` returns `True`, then `a` is 3. Otherwise, if the length of `ch` is even, `a` is 4. If the length of `ch` is odd, and `func_1(ch[:b])` returns `True`, then `a` is 1. Otherwise, if the length of `ch` is odd, `a` is 2.***
