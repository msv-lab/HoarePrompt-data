The function `func_1` takes a single parameter `ch`, which is a string of lowercase Latin characters. It checks whether the first half of the string is a mirror image of the second half (or vice versa, considering the middle character if the length is odd). If the string is a palindrome when split into two halves, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. After the function concludes, the input string `ch` remains unchanged, and the function has no side effects.
