Output State: **`x` is the integer division of the original `x` by 4 and must be greater than 0, `y` is the same input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `l1` is [original `x` % 2, (original `x` // 2) % 2], `l2` is an empty list.**

Explanation:
- `x` was originally divided by 2 and is now further divided by 2 using `x //= 2`. So, `x` is now the integer division of the original `x` by 4.
- The condition that `x` must be greater than 0 remains valid.
- `y`, `t`, `_`, and `l2` remain unchanged.
- `l1` contains the original `x` modulo 2 and the new value of `x` (after the first division by 2) modulo 2.
