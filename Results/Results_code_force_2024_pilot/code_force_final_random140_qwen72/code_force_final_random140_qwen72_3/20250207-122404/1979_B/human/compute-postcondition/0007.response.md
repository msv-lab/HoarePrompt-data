The only variable in the loop head is `x`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. If `x` is non-zero, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is the integer division of the original `x` by 2, and `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must still be non-zero after the integer division.

Since `x` is the result of the integer division of the original `x` by 2, it means that the original `x` must have been at least 2 (since 1 divided by 2 would result in 0, which would terminate the loop). Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the new value of `x` must be at least 1.

State: **`x` is the integer division of the original `x` by 2 and must be greater than 0, `y` is the same input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `l1` is [original `x` % 2], `l2` is an empty list**
