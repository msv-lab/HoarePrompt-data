The value of `y` is updated by performing an integer division by 2 (`y //= 2`). This operation changes the value of `y` to half of its current value, rounded down to the nearest whole number. Since `y` was originally a non-zero integer and has already been halved once, it is now halved again. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is 0, `y` is the original value of `y` divided by 4, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the original `x` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing the least significant bit of the original `y` followed by the new least significant bit of `y` (which is `y % 2`), `n` is the length of the binary representation of the original `x`, `cnt` is the number of leading matching bits in the updated `l1` and `l2` up to the point where they differ or until the end of the lists, `i` is 0 if all bits matched, or the index of the first differing bit.**
