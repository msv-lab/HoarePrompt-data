Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `l1` is an empty list, `l2` is an empty list, `n` is the length of the original `l1`, `cnt` is the number of leading matching bits in the original `l1` and `l2` up to the point where they differ or until the end of the lists, `i` is `n - 1` if all bits matched, or the index of the first differing bit.
Code of the loop:
while x:
    l1.append(x % 2)
    x //= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `x` is the original `x` divided by 2 (integer division), `y` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `l1` is a list containing the last bit of the original `x` (i.e., `x % 2` before the division), `l2` is an empty list, `n` is 1, `cnt` is the number of leading matching bits in the updated `l1` and `l2` up to the point where they differ or until the end of the lists, `i` is 0 if all bits matched, or the index of the first differing bit.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `x` is the original `x` divided by 4 (integer division), `y` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `l1` is a list containing the last two bits of the original `x` (i.e., the last bit before the division and the new bit from `x % 2`), `l2` is an empty list, `n` is 1, `cnt` is the number of leading matching bits in the updated `l1` and `l2` up to the point where they differ or until the end of the lists, `i` is 0 if all bits matched, or the index of the first differing bit.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `x` is the original `x` divided by 8 (integer division) and `x` must be greater than 0, `y` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `l1` is a list containing the last two bits of the original `x` and the new bit from `x % 2`, `l2` is an empty list, `n` is 1, `cnt` is the number of leading matching bits in the updated `l1` and `l2` up to the point where they differ or until the end of the lists, `i` is 0 if all bits matched, or the index of the first differing bit.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
