Output State: **`x` is 0, `y` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the original `x` in reverse order, `l2` is an empty list, `n` is the length of `l1`, `cnt` is the number of matching bits from the start of both lists up to the first differing bit, or `n` if all bits match, `i` is the index of the first differing bit or `n` if all bits matched.**

### Explanation:
- **`x`**: The loop continues as long as `x` is non-zero. After each iteration, `x` is divided by 2 (integer division). Eventually, `x` will become 0, which is when the loop terminates.
- **`l1`**: Each iteration appends the remainder of `x` divided by 2 (which is either 0 or 1) to the list `l1`. This effectively builds the binary representation of the original `x` in reverse order.
- **Other Variables**: The variables `y`, `t`, `_`, `l2`, `n`, `cnt`, and `i` are not modified within the loop, so their values remain unchanged from their initial states.
