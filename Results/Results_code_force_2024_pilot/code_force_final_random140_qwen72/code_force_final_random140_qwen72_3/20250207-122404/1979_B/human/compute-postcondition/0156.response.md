Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `x` is 0.
- `y` is 0.
- `t` is greater than 2.
- `_` is 2.
- `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the original `x` in reverse order.
- `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the original `y` in reverse order.
- If `len(l2) < len(l1)`, `l2` has an additional 0 appended to it, making `len(l2)` equal to `len(l1)`.
- `n` is equal to `len(l1)`.
- `i` is the index of the first differing bit or `n` if all bits matched.
- `cnt` is the number of matching bits from the start of the lists up to the first differing bit or `n` if all bits matched.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Binary Representation of `x` and `y`:**
   - Since `x` is 0, its binary representation is `0`.
   - Since `y` is 0, its binary representation is also `0`.

2. **Lists `l1` and `l2`:**
   - `l1` is the binary representation of `x` in reverse order: `[0]`.
   - `l2` is the binary representation of `y` in reverse order: `[0]`.

3. **Lengths of `l1` and `l2`:**
   - `len(l1)` is 1.
   - `len(l2)` is 1.
   - Since `len(l2)` is not less than `len(l1)`, no additional 0 is appended to `l2`.

4. **Value of `n`:**
   - `n` is equal to `len(l1)`, which is 1.

5. **Index of the First Differing Bit (`i`):**
   - Both `l1` and `l2` contain the same bit `[0]`, so there is no differing bit.
   - Therefore, `i` is `n`, which is 1.

6. **Number of Matching Bits (`cnt`):**
   - Since all bits match up to the first differing bit (which doesn't exist), `cnt` is `n`, which is 1.

7. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(2 ** cnt)`.
   - Since `cnt` is 1, `2 ** cnt` is `2 ** 1`, which is 2.

### Final Output:
Output: **2**
