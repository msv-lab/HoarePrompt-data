Output State: **`x` is 0, `y` is 0, `t` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the original `x` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the original `y` in reverse order with an additional 0 appended to it, `len(l2)` is equal to `len(l1)`, `n` is equal to `len(l1)`, `cnt` is the number of matching bits from the start of both lists up to the first differing bit, or `n` if all bits match, and `i` is the index of the first differing bit or `n` if all bits matched.**
