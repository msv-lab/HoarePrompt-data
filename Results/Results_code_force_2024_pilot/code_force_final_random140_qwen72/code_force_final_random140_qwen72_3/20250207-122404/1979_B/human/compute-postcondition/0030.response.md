Postcondition: ***`x` is 0, `y` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `l1` is a list containing the binary digits of the original `x` in reverse order, and `l2` is a list containing the binary digits of the original `y` in reverse order. If the length of `l2` is less than the length of `l1`, an additional 0 is appended to `l2`, making its length less than or equal to the length of `l1`. Otherwise, if the length of `l1` is less than the length of `l2`, an additional 0 is appended to `l1`, ensuring that the length of `l2` remains greater than or equal to the length of `l1`.***
