Output State: **`x` is 0, `y` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the original `x` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the original `y` in reverse order. If `len(l2) < len(l1)`, `l2` has an additional 0 appended to it, making the length of `l2` one less than the length of `l1`. If `len(l1) <= len(l2)`, `l1` remains unchanged. `n` is the length of the longer list (`l1` or `l2`), `cnt` is 0, `i` is 0 if all bits matched, or the index of the first differing bit.**
