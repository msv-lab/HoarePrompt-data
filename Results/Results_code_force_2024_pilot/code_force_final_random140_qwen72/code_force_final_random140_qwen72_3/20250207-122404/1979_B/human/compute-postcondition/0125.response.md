The code `l2.append(y % 2)` appends the result of `y % 2` to the list `l2`. 

- `y % 2` gives the remainder when `y` is divided by 2, which is either 0 or 1.
- Since `y` is greater than 0 and `y // 2` is also greater than 0, `y` must be an even number (since dividing an odd number by 2 would result in a non-integer value, and `y` is an integer). Therefore, `y % 2` will be 0.
- The list `l2` initially contains `[y % 2, y % 2]`, which means it contains `[0, 0]`.
- After appending `y % 2` (which is 0) to `l2`, the list `l2` will become `[0, 0, 0]`.

The other variables (`x`, `t`, `_`, `l1`, `n`, `cnt`, `i`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`x` is 0, `y` is `y // 2` (still greater than 0), `t` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the original `x` in reverse order, `l2` is `[0, 0, 0]`, `n` is the length of `l1`, `cnt` is the number of matching bits from the start of both lists up to the first differing bit, or `n` if all bits match, `i` is the index of the first differing bit or `n` if all bits matched.**
