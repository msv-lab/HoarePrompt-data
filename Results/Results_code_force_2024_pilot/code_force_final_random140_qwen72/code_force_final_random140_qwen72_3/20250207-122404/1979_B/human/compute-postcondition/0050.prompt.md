Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `l1` is a list containing the binary digits of the original `x` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing the binary digits of the original `y` in reverse order, `n` is the length of `l1`, `cnt` is 0. If the length of `l2` is less than the length of `l1`, an additional 0 is appended to `l2`, making its length equal to the length of `l1`. Otherwise, the lengths of `l1` and `l2` remain unchanged, and `l1` and `l2` retain their original properties.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if l1[i] == l2[i]:
        cnt += 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`x` is 0, `y` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `l1` is a list containing the binary digits of the original `x` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing the binary digits of the original `y` in reverse order, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0. If the `i`-th elements of `l1` and `l2` are equal, `cnt` is 1. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0, and the elements at index `i` of `l1` and `l2` are not equal, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`x` is 0, `y` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `l1` is a list containing the binary digits of the original `x` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing the binary digits of the original `y` in reverse order, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `cnt` is 1 if the elements at index 0 of `l1` and `l2` were not equal, or 2 if they were equal. If the elements at index `i` of `l1` and `l2` are equal, `cnt` is incremented to 2. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0 or 1 (depending on the equality of the elements at index 0), and the most internal loop or if statement is broken.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`x` is 0, `y` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `l1` is a list containing the binary digits of the original `x` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing the binary digits of the original `y` in reverse order, `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `cnt` is 2 if the elements at index 0 of `l1` and `l2` were not equal, or 3 if they were equal when `l1[i]` equals `l2[i]`. If `l1[i]` does not equal `l2[i]`, `cnt` is 1 if the elements at index 0 of `l1` and `l2` were not equal, or 2 if they were equal, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
