To determine what will be printed by the `print(2 ** cnt)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `x` is 0.
   - `y` is 0.
   - `t` is greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the print statement).
   - `_` is 0 (though `_` is not used in the print statement).
   - `l1` is a list containing the binary digits of the original `x` in reverse order.
   - `l2` is a list containing the binary digits of the original `y` in reverse order.
   - `n` is the length of `l1`.
   - `cnt` is the number of leading matching bits in `l1` and `l2` up to the point where they differ or until the end of the lists.
   - The value of `i` is `n - 1` if all bits matched, or the index of the first differing bit.

2. **Binary Representation:**
   - Since `x` is 0, the binary representation of `x` is `0`.
   - Since `y` is 0, the binary representation of `y` is `0`.

3. **Lists `l1` and `l2`:**
   - `l1` is a list containing the binary digits of `x` in reverse order, which is `[0]`.
   - `l2` is a list containing the binary digits of `y` in reverse order, which is `[0]`.

4. **Length `n`:**
   - `n` is the length of `l1`, which is 1.

5. **Counting Matching Bits (`cnt`):**
   - Since both `l1` and `l2` contain only one bit and it is the same (both are 0), all bits match.
   - Therefore, `cnt` is 1.

6. **Value of `i`:**
   - Since all bits matched, `i` is `n - 1`, which is `1 - 1 = 0`.

7. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement `print(2 ** cnt)` will compute `2 ** cnt`.
   - Given that `cnt` is 1, `2 ** 1` is 2.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:
Output: **2**
