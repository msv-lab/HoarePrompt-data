Output State: **`x` is the integer division of the original `x` by 4 and must be greater than or equal to 4, `y` is the same input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `l1` is [original `x` % 2, (original `x` // 2) % 2, `x` % 2], `l2` is an empty list.**

Explanation:
- The code `l1.append(x % 2)` appends the value of `x % 2` to the list `l1`.
- The initial state specifies that `l1` is `[original `x` % 2, (original `x` // 2) % 2]`.
- After appending `x % 2` to `l1`, the new state of `l1` is `[original `x` % 2, (original `x` // 2) % 2, `x` % 2]`.
- All other variables (`x`, `y`, `t`, `_`, and `l2`) remain unchanged.
