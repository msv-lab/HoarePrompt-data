To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `x` is 0
- `y` is 0
- `t` is greater than 0
- `_` is 0
- `l1` is a list containing the binary digits of the original `x` in reverse order
- `l2` is a list containing the binary digits of the original `y` in reverse order
- `n` is the length of `l1`
- `cnt` is 0

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0.
2. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and the loop condition depends on `n`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`n`**: For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0.
- **`i`**: The loop variable `i` should start from 0.

### Final State:
- `x` is 0 (unchanged)
- `y` is 0 (unchanged)
- `t` is greater than 0 (unchanged)
- `_` is 0 (unchanged)
- `l1` is a list containing the binary digits of the original `x` in reverse order (unchanged)
- `l2` is a list containing the binary digits of the original `y` in reverse order (unchanged)
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `cnt` is 0 (unchanged)
- `i` is 0

### Final State Format:
State: **`x` is 0, `y` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `l1` is a list containing the binary digits of the original `x` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing the binary digits of the original `y` in reverse order, `n` must be greater than 0, `cnt` is 0, `i` is 0**
