The only variable in the loop head is `_` and the value `t`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The values of `x` and `y` do not affect the loop's execution directly, but they must remain within the specified bounds.

State: **`x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
