Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `l1` is an empty list, `l2` is an empty list, `n` is the length of the longer list (`l1` or `l2`), `cnt` is the number of matching bits from the start of both lists up to the first differing bit, or `n` if all bits match, `i` is the index of the first differing bit or `n` if all bits matched.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `l1, l2 = [], []` reassigns both `l1` and `l2` to empty lists.
- All other variables (`x`, `y`, `t`, `_`, `n`, `cnt`, `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
