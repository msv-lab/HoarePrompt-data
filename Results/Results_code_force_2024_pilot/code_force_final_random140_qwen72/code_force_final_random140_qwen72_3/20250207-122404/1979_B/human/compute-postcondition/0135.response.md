Output State: **`x` is 0, `y` is 0, `t` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the original `x` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the original `y` in reverse order. If `len(l2) < len(l1)`, `l2` has an additional 0 appended, and the lengths of `l1` and `l2` are adjusted accordingly. If `len(l1) < len(l2)`, `l1` has an additional 0 appended, and `n` is incremented by 1. In both cases, `cnt` is the number of matching bits from the start of both lists up to the first differing bit, or `n` if all bits match, and `i` is the index of the first differing bit or `n` if all bits matched. `n` is now equal to the length of `l1`.**
