Output State: **`x` is the integer division of the original `x` by 2 and must be greater than 0, `y` is the same input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `l1` is [original `x` % 2, `x` % 2], `l2` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code appends the result of `x % 2` to the list `l1`. Since `l1` initially contains `[original `x` % 2]`, after appending `x % 2`, `l1` now contains `[original `x` % 2, `x` % 2]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
