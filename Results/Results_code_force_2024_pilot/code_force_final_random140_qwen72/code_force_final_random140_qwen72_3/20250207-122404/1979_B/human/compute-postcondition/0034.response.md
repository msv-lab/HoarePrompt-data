Postcondition: ***`x` is 0, `y` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `l1` is a list containing the binary digits of the original `x` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing the binary digits of the original `y` in reverse order, and `n` is the length of `l1`. If the length of `l2` is less than the length of `l1`, an additional 0 is appended to `l2`, making its length equal to the length of `l1`. Otherwise, the lengths of `l1` and `l2` remain unchanged, and `l1` and `l2` retain their original properties.***
