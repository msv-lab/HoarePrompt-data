Postcondition: ***`x` is 0, `y` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `l1` is a list containing the binary digits of the original `x` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing the binary digits of the original `y` in reverse order, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `cnt` is 1 if the elements at index 0 of `l1` and `l2` were not equal, or 2 if they were equal. If the elements at index `i` of `l1` and `l2` are equal, `cnt` is incremented to 2. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0 or 1 (depending on the equality of the elements at index 0), and the most internal loop or if statement is broken.***
