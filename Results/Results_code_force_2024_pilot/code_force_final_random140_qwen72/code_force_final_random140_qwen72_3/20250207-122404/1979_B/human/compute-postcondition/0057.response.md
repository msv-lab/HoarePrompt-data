Output State: **`x` is the original `x` divided by 2 (integer division), `y` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `l1` is a list containing the last bit of the original `x` (i.e., `x % 2` before the division), `l2` is an empty list, `n` is 1, `cnt` is the number of leading matching bits in the updated `l1` and `l2` up to the point where they differ or until the end of the lists, `i` is 0 if all bits matched, or the index of the first differing bit.**
