Output State: **`x` is 0, `y` is the original input integer divided by 2 (and rounded down to the nearest integer) and must be non-zero, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `l1` is a list containing the binary digits of the original `x` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing the values `y % 2` (which is either 0 or 1) repeated twice.**

Explanation:
- The code `l2.append(y % 2)` appends the value of `y % 2` to the list `l2`.
- Initially, `l2` contains one value, which is `y % 2` (either 0 or 1).
- After executing the code, `l2` now contains two values, both of which are `y % 2`.
- All other variables (`x`, `y`, `t`, `_`, `l1`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
