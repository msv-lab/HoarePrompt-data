Output State: **`x` and `y` are the input integers, `x` must be non-zero, `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `l1` is [x % 2], `l2` is an empty list.**

Explanation:
- The value of `x % 2` (which is the remainder when `x` is divided by 2) is appended to the list `l1`.
- All other variables (`y`, `t`, `_`, and `l2`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
