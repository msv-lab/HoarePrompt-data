The code snippet `x, y = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`. This changes the values of `x` and `y` from their initial state of 0 to the values provided by the user.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the original `x` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the original `y` in reverse order, `n` is the length of the longer list (`l1` or `l2`), `cnt` is the number of matching bits from the start of both lists up to the first differing bit, or `n` if all bits match, `i` is the index of the first differing bit or `n` if all bits matched.**
