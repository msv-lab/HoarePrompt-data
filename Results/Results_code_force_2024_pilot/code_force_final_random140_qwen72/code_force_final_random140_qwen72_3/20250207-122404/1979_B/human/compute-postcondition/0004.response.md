The only variable in the loop head is `x`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. If `x` is truthy (non-zero), the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `x` and `y` are the input integers. For the loop to execute the first time, `x` must be non-zero.

State: **`x` and `y` are the input integers, `x` must be non-zero, `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `l1` is an empty list, `l2` is an empty list**
