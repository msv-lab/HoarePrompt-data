Output State: **`x` is an input integer and must be non-zero, `y` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `l1` is a list containing the last bit of `x` (i.e., `x % 2`), `l2` is an empty list, `n` is the length of the updated `l1` (which is now 1), `cnt` is the number of leading matching bits in the updated `l1` and `l2` up to the point where they differ or until the end of the lists, `i` is `n - 1` if all bits matched, or the index of the first differing bit.**
