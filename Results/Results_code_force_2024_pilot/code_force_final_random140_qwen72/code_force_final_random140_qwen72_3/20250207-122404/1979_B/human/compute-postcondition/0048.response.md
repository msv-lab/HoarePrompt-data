Output State: **`x` is 0, `y` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `l1` is a list containing the binary digits of the original `x` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing the binary digits of the original `y` in reverse order, `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `cnt` is 1 if the elements at index 0 of `l1` and `l2` were not equal, or 2 if they were equal, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
