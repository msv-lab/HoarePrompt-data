Output State: **`x` is the original `x` divided by 4 (integer division) and `x` must be greater than 0, `y` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `l1` is a list containing the last two bits of the original `x` and the new bit from `x % 2`, `l2` is an empty list, `n` is 1, `cnt` is the number of leading matching bits in the updated `l1` and `l2` up to the point where they differ or until the end of the lists, `i` is 0 if all bits matched, or the index of the first differing bit.**

Explanation:
- The code `l1.append(x % 2)` appends the remainder of `x` when divided by 2 to the list `l1`.
- The value of `x % 2` is the new bit added to `l1`.
- The initial state specifies that `l1` contains the last two bits of the original `x` (before the division by 4). After appending `x % 2`, `l1` now contains these two bits plus the new bit.
- All other variables (`x`, `y`, `t`, `_`, `l2`, `n`, `cnt`, `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
