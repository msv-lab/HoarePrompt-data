Output State: **`x` is 0, `y` is 0, `t` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the original `x` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the original `y` in reverse order, if `len(l2) < len(l1)`, `l2` has an additional 0 appended to it, making `len(l2)` equal to `len(l1)`, `n` is equal to `len(l1)`, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `cnt` is 2.**

Explanation: The code `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. Initially, `cnt` was 1 (as per the condition that `l1[i]` is equal to `l2[i]`), so after executing the code, `cnt` becomes 2. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
