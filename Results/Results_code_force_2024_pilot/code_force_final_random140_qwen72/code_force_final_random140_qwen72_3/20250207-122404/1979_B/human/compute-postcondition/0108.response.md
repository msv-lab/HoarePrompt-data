Output State: **`x` is now `x // 2`, `y` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `l1` is a list containing `[x % 2]` (where `x` is the new value of `x`), `l2` is an empty list, `n` is the length of the longer list (`l1` or `l2`), `cnt` is the number of matching bits from the start of both lists up to the first differing bit, or `n` if all bits match, `i` is the index of the first differing bit or `n` if all bits matched.**

Explanation:
- `x` is updated to `x // 2`, which means `x` is now half of its original value, rounded down to the nearest integer.
- All other variables (`y`, `t`, `_`, `l1`, `l2`, `n`, `cnt`, `i`) remain unchanged.
- The list `l1` contains the new value of `x % 2`, which is the remainder when the new `x` is divided by 2.
