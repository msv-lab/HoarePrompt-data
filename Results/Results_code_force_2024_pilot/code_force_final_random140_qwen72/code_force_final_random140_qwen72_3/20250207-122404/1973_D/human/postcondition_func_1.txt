The function `func_2` accepts an integer `m` and prints it prefixed by "! ". It then reads an integer from the standard input and returns this integer. The function does not modify the value of `m` or any other external state. The returned value is expected to be `m` if it meets certain conditions (as described in the comments), or -1 otherwise, but the function itself does not enforce these conditions; it simply returns whatever integer is provided through the input.
