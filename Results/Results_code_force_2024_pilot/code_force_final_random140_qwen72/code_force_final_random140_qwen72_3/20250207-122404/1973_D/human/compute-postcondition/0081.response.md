Postcondition: **`n` and `k` remain the same, with `k` being greater than or equal to 1, `max_val` remains the same, `i` is `i - 1`, `m` is `(i - 1) * max_val`, `j` is the minimum of `k` and the value of `j` when `p` becomes greater than or equal to `n`, `p` is the result of `func_1(p + 1, m)` after the loop completes, which could be less than `n` if the loop completes without breaking, or it could be greater than or equal to `n` if the loop breaks early, and `p` is not equal to `n`.**
