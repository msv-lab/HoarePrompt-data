The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `k`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `k`. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `k` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 (so `j` is 2), and `k` must still be greater than or equal to 2.

State: **`n` and `k` remain the same, with `k` being greater than or equal to 2, `max_val` remains the same, `i` is `i - 1`, `m` is `(i - 1) * max_val`, `j` is 2, `p` is the result of `func_1(p + 1, m)`. If `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
