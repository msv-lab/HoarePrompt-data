Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` remain the same, with `k` being greater than or equal to 2, `max_val` remains the same, `i` is `i - 1`, `m` is `(i - 1) * max_val`, `j` is 3, `p` is the result of `func_1(p + 1, m)`. If `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
