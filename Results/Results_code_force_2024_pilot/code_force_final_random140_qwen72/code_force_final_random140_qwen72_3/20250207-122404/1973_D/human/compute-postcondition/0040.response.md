To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\).
- `max_val` is the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value `r` where `r` is less than or equal to `n` and `r` equals `n`. If no such `i` exists, `max_val` remains 0.
- `i` is `n // k` and `n // k` must be greater than 0.
- `m` is `i * max_val`.
- `p` is the final result of `func_1(p + 1, m)` after the loop has completed all iterations.
- `j` is `k`, and `k` must be greater than 0.
- `p` is not equal to `n`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n // k, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over `i` starting from `n // k` down to 1 (inclusive) in steps of -1.
- The loop condition is that `i` must be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

### Adjusting the State:
- The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `i`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n // k`.
- For the next iteration, `i` will be decremented by 1.

### New State:
- `i` is now `n // k - 1`.
- All other variables (`n`, `k`, `max_val`, `m`, `p`, `j`) remain unchanged.

### Final State:
State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\), `max_val` is the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value `r` where `r` is less than or equal to `n` and `r` equals `n`. If no such `i` exists, `max_val` remains 0, `i` is `n // k - 1`, `m` is `i * max_val`, `p` is the final result of `func_1(p + 1, m)` after the loop has completed all iterations, `j` is `k`, and `k` must be greater than 0. Additionally, `p` is not equal to `n`.**
