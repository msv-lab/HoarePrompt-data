Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `n` and `k` remain the same, with `k` being greater than or equal to 1. `max_val` remains the same. `i` is 0, as the loop decrements `i` from `n // k` down to 1 and then stops. `m` is 0, because `m` is calculated as `i * max_val` and `i` is 0. `p` is the final value obtained from the repeated application of `func_1` starting from `p = 1` and incrementing by 1 each time, until `p` becomes greater than or equal to `n` or the loop completes all `k` iterations. `j` is the final value of the loop counter, which will be `k` if the loop completes without breaking due to `p` reaching or exceeding `n`. The loop will terminate without calling `func_2(m)` if `p` never equals `n` for any iteration.**

This means that after all iterations, the loop has exhausted all possible values of `i` from `n // k` down to 1, and `i` is now 0. The variable `m` is also 0 because `i` is 0. The variable `p` holds the final result of the inner loop's operations, and `j` is the final value of the inner loop counter, which will be `k` unless the loop breaks early due to `p` reaching or exceeding `n`. The loop does not call `func_2(m)` if `p` never equals `n` during any of the iterations.
