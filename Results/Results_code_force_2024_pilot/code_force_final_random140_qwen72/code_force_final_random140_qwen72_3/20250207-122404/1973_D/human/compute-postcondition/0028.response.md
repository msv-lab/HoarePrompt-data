Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\), `max_val` is the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value `r` where `r` is less than or equal to `n` and `r` equals `n`. If no such `i` exists, `max_val` remains 0, `i` is `n // k` and `n // k` must be greater than 0, `m` is `i * max_val`, `p` is the result of `func_1(p + 1, m)`, `j` is 2, and `k` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `p` is the result of `func_1(1, m)`.
- The code snippet updates `p` to the result of `func_1(p + 1, m)`.
- The values of `n`, `k`, `max_val`, `i`, `m`, and `j` remain unchanged.
- The new value of `p` is the result of calling `func_1` with arguments `p + 1` and `m`.

Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `p` while keeping all other variables and conditions the same as in the initial state.
