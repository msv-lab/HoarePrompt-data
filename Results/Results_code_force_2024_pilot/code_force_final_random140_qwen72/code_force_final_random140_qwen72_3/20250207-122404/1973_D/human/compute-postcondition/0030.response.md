Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\), `max_val` is the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value `r` where `r` is less than or equal to `n` and `r` equals `n`. If no such `i` exists, `max_val` remains 0, `i` is `n // k` and `n // k` must be greater than 0, `m` is `i * max_val`, `p` is the result of `func_1(p + 1, m)`, `j` is 2, and `k` must be greater than 0. If `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
