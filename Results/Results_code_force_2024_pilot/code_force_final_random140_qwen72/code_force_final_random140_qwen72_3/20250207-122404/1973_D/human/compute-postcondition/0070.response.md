Output State: **`n` and `k` remain the same, with `k` being greater than or equal to 2, `max_val` remains the same, `i` is `i - 1`, `m` is `(i - 1) * max_val`, `j` is 2, `p` is the result of `func_1(p + 1, m)`. If `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- `n` and `k` remain unchanged.
- `max_val` remains unchanged.
- `i` is updated to `i - 1`.
- `m` is updated to `(i - 1) * max_val`.
- `j` remains 2.
- `p` is updated to the result of `func_1(p + 1, m)`.
- If the new value of `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
