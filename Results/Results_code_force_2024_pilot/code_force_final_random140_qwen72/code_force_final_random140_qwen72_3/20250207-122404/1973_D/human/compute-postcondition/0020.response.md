Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\), `max_val` is the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value `r` where `r` is less than or equal to `n` and `r` equals `n`. If no such `i` exists, `max_val` remains 0, `i` is `n // k` and `n // k` must be greater than 0, `m` is `i * max_val`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `m` is calculated as `i * max_val`.
- `i` is given as `n // k`.
- `max_val` is defined based on the condition involving `func_1(1, i * n)`.
- Since `i` is `n // k`, `m` becomes `(n // k) * max_val`.
- All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
