The function `func_2(m)` is called with the argument `m`. The initial state specifies that `m` is `(i - 1) * max_val`, and `i` is `i - 1`. However, the function `func_2` itself does not modify any of the global variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `n`, `k`, `max_val`, `i`, `m`, `j`, and `p` remain unchanged after the function call.

Output State: **`n` and `k` remain the same, with `k` being greater than or equal to 1, `max_val` remains the same, `i` is `i - 1`, `m` is `(i - 1) * max_val`, `j` is the minimum of `k` and the value of `j` when `p` becomes greater than or equal to `n`, `p` is the result of `func_1(p + 1, m)` after the loop completes, and `p` is equal to `n`.**
