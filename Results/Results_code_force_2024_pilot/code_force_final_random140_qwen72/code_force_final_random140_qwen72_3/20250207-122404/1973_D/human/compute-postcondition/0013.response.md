The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` being greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented by 1, making it `n - 2`.

Given that `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\), and `i` is `n - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` should be `n - 2` for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\). `max_val` is 0, `i` is `n - 2`, and `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, (n - 1) * n)`. If `r` is less than or equal to `n`, `max_val` is updated to `n - 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
