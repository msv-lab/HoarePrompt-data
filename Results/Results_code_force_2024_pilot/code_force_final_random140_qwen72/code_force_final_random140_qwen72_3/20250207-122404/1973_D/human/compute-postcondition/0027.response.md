To determine the state adjustments necessary for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop head:

### Given State:
- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\).
- `max_val` is the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value `r` where `r` is less than or equal to `n` and `r` equals `n`. If no such `i` exists, `max_val` remains 0.
- `i` is `n // k` and `n // k` must be greater than 0.
- `m` is `i * max_val`.
- `p` is the result of `func_1(1, m)`.
- If `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues as specified.
- `j` is 1, and `k` must be greater than 0.

### Loop Head:
```python
for j in range(1, k + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop head involves the variable `j` and the constant `k`.
- The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `k + 1`.

### State Adjustments:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1.
- The condition for the loop to continue is that `j` must be less than `k + 1`.

### Updated State:
- `j` is incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 2.
- The condition `j < k + 1` must still hold true for the loop to execute again.

### Final State:
State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\), `max_val` is the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value `r` where `r` is less than or equal to `n` and `r` equals `n`. If no such `i` exists, `max_val` remains 0, `i` is `n // k` and `n // k` must be greater than 0, `m` is `i * max_val`, `p` is the result of `func_1(1, m)`, `j` is 2, and `k` must be greater than 0.**
