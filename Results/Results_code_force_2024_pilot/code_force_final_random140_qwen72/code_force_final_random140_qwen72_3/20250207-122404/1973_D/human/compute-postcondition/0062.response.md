Output State: **`n` and `k` remain the same, with `k` remaining greater than 0, `max_val` remains the same, `i` is `i - 1`, `m` is `(i - 1) * max_val`, `p` remains the same, `j` remains the same, `p` is not equal to `n`.**

Explanation:
- `m` is updated to the value of `i * max_val`.
- Since `i` is already `i - 1`, the new value of `m` is `(i - 1) * max_val`.
- All other variables (`n`, `k`, `max_val`, `p`, `j`) remain unchanged.
- The condition `p` is not equal to `n` still holds true.
