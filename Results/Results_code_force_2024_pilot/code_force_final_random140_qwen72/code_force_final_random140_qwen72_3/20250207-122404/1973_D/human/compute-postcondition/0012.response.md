Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\). `max_val` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, and `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, (n - 1) * n)`. If `r` is less than or equal to `n`, `max_val` is updated to `n - 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
