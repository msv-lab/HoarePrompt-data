Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\), `max_val` is the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value `r` where `r` is less than or equal to `n` and `r` equals `n`. If no such `i` exists, `max_val` remains 0, `i` is `n // k - 1`, `m` is `(n // k - 1) * max_val`, `p` is 0, `j` is `k`, and `k` must be greater than 0. Additionally, `p` is not equal to `n`.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, k + 1):
    p = func_1(p + 1, m)
    if p >= n:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` and `k` remain the same, with `k` remaining greater than 0. `max_val` remains the same. `i` remains the same. `m` remains the same. `p` is now the result of `func_1(1, m)`. `j` remains the same. If `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing the next statement following the if block.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` and `k` remain the same, with `k` remaining greater than 0. `max_val` remains the same. `i` remains the same. `m` remains the same. `p` is now the result of `func_1(func_1(1, m) + 1, m)`. `j` is incremented by 1, and `k` must be greater than the new value of `j`. If `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` and `k` remain the same, `max_val` remains the same, `i` remains the same, `p` is updated to the result of `func_1(func_1(1, m) + 1, m)`, `j` is incremented by 1, and `k` must be greater than the new value of `j`. If `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
