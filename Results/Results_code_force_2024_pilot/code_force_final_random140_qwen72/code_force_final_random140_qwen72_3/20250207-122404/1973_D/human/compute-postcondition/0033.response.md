Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\), `max_val` is the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value `r` where `r` is less than or equal to `n` and `r` equals `n`. If no such `i` exists, `max_val` remains 0, `i` is `n // k` and `n // k` must be greater than 0, `m` is `i * max_val`, `p` is the result of `func_1(p + 1, m)`, `j` is 3, `k` must be greater than or equal to 3, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.** 

Explanation: The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is currently in. The values of `n`, `k`, `max_val`, `i`, `m`, `p`, and `j` remain unchanged. The condition that `p` is greater than or equal to `n` leading to the break is part of the initial state and is not altered by the `break` statement itself.
