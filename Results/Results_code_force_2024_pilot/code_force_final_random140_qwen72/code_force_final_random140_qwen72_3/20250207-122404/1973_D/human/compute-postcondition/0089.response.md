Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\), `i` is `n // k`, `max_val` is the largest value of `i` for which `func_1(1, i * n)` is equal to `n`, or 0 if no such `i` exists, `n // k` is greater than 0, `m` is `i * max_val`, `j` is `k`, `k` is at least 1, `p` is the result of `func_1(p + 1, m)` after the last iteration, and `func_2(m)` has been called.**

Explanation:
- The call to `func_2(m)` does not modify any of the variables in the initial state.
- All the initial conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
- The only new information is that `func_2(m)` has been called.
