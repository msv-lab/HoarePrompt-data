Output State: **After all iterations, `n` and `k` remain the same, with `k` remaining greater than 0. `max_val` remains the same. `i` remains the same. `m` remains the same. `p` is the final value obtained from the repeated application of `func_1` starting from `p = 1` and incrementing by 1 each time, until `p` becomes greater than or equal to `n` or the loop completes all `k` iterations. `j` is the final value of the loop counter, which will be `k` if the loop completes without breaking due to `p` reaching or exceeding `n`.**

In simpler terms:
- `n` and `k` do not change.
- `max_val`, `i`, and `m` remain unchanged.
- `p` is updated to the final value after applying `func_1` multiple times, either until it reaches or exceeds `n` or until the loop has run `k` times.
- `j` will be `k` if the loop completes all iterations, or it will be the last value before `p` reached or exceeded `n`.
