Output State: **The program does not return any value explicitly. However, based on the initial state and the provided code, the final value of `p` after the loop completes all iterations would be the result of `func_1(p + 1, m)`, where `p` initially equals `n`, and `m` is calculated as `i * max_val` with `i` being `n // k`. The exact value of `p` depends on the implementation of `func_1` and the value of `max_val`.**

To break it down further:
- `n` and `k` are positive integers with \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is calculated as `n // k`, which is a positive integer.
- `max_val` is determined by the condition that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value `r` where `r` is less than or equal to `n` and `r` equals `n`. If no such `i` exists, `max_val` remains 0.
- `m` is then calculated as `i * max_val`.
- `p` starts as `n` and is updated to the result of `func_1(p + 1, m)` after the loop completes.
- `j` is set to `k`.

Since the return statement is empty, the program does not explicitly return a value. However, the final state of `p` is influenced by the loop and the function `func_1`.
