Output State: **`n` and `k` remain the same, with `k` remaining greater than 0, `max_val` remains the same, `i` is `i - 1`, `m` is `(i - 1) * max_val`, `p` is 0, `j` remains the same, `p` is not equal to `n`.** 

Explanation: The value of `p` is set to 0. All other variables (`n`, `k`, `max_val`, `i`, `m`, `j`) retain their previous values or relationships as described in the initial state.
