Output State: **`n` and `k` remain the same, with `k` being greater than or equal to 1, `max_val` remains the same, `i` is `i - 1`, `m` is `(i - 1) * max_val`, `j` is the minimum of `k` and the value of `j` when `p` becomes greater than or equal to `n`, `p` is the result of `func_1(p + 1, m)` after the loop completes, which could be less than `n` if the loop completes without breaking, or it could be greater than or equal to `n` if the loop breaks early.**

Explanation:
- `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- `max_val` also remains unchanged.
- `i` and `m` are set before the loop starts and remain unchanged within the loop.
- `j` increments with each iteration of the loop, but the loop will stop either when `j` reaches `k` or when `p` becomes greater than or equal to `n`.
- `p` is updated in each iteration by calling `func_1(p + 1, m)`. The final value of `p` will depend on whether the loop completes all `k` iterations or breaks early due to `p` reaching or exceeding `n`.
