Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\), `max_val` is the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value `r` where `r` is less than or equal to `n` and `r` equals `n`. If no such `i` exists, `max_val` remains 0, `i` is `n // k` and `n // k` must be greater than 0, `m` is `i * max_val`, `p` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `n` and `k` are positive integers within the range \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\).
- `max_val` is defined based on the function `func_1` and its return value.
- `i` is set to `n // k`, which is a positive integer since `n // k` must be greater than 0.
- `m` is calculated as `i * max_val`.
- The code snippet `p = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `p`.
- No other variables are affected by this assignment, so their values remain as specified in the initial state.
