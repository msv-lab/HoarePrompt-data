The code snippet `m = i * max_val` updates the value of `m` based on the current values of `i` and `max_val`.

- `i` is given as `n // k - 1`.
- `max_val` is defined as the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value `r` where `r` is less than or equal to `n` and `r` equals `n`. If no such `i` exists, `max_val` remains 0.

Given these definitions, the new value of `m` is calculated as `i * max_val`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\), `max_val` is the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value `r` where `r` is less than or equal to `n` and `r` equals `n`. If no such `i` exists, `max_val` remains 0, `i` is `n // k - 1`, `m` is `(n // k - 1) * max_val`, `p` is the final result of `func_1(p + 1, m)` after the loop has completed all iterations, `j` is `k`, and `k` must be greater than 0. Additionally, `p` is not equal to `n`.**
