Output State: **After all iterations, `n` and `k` remain the same, with `k` remaining greater than 0. `max_val` remains the same. `i` remains the same. `m` remains the same. `p` is equal to `n`. `j` is the final value of the loop counter, which will be `k` if the loop completes without breaking due to `p` reaching or exceeding `n`. The function `func_2(m)` has been called, and its return value (if any) is not specified.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `n`, `k`, `max_val`, `i`, and `m` remain unchanged.
- `p` is equal to `n` after the loop.
- `j` is the final value of the loop counter, which will be `k` if the loop completes without breaking.
- The function `func_2(m)` is called, but since no return value or side effects are specified, we assume it does not affect the state of the variables.
