Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` remain the same, with `k` remaining greater than 0. `max_val` remains the same. `i` remains the same. `m` remains the same. `p` is now the result of `func_1(1, m)`. `j` remains the same. If `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing the next statement following the if block.***
