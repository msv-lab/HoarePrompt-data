Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\), `max_val` is the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value `r` where `r` is less than or equal to `n` and `r` equals `n`. If no such `i` exists, `max_val` remains 0, `i` is `n // k` and `n // k` must be greater than 0, `m` is `i * max_val`, `p` is the final result of `func_1(p + 1, m)` after the loop has completed all iterations, `j` is `k`, and `k` must be greater than 0. If `p` is greater than or equal to `n` at any point during the loop, the loop breaks early.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `j = 1` to `j = k`.
- In each iteration, `p` is updated to the result of `func_1(p + 1, m)`.
- If at any point `p` becomes greater than or equal to `n`, the loop breaks.
- After the loop completes, `j` will be `k` unless the loop breaks early due to `p` reaching or exceeding `n`.
- The values of `n`, `k`, `max_val`, `i`, and `m` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
