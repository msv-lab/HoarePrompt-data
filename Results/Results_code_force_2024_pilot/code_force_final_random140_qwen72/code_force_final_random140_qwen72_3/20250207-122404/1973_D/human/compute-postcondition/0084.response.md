The function `func_3` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the context provided, it implicitly uses `n` and `k`, which are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4. The function does not return any value explicitly. Instead, it modifies a variable `p` through a series of operations involving `func_1` and `max_val`. The final value of `p` after the loop completes all iterations is determined by the result of `func_1(p + 1, m)`, where `p` initially equals `n`, and `m` is calculated as `i * max_val` with `i` being `n // k`.

Functionality: **The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters explicitly but operates on implicit parameters `n` and `k` (positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4). It does not return any value explicitly. Instead, it modifies a variable `p` using a loop and the function `func_1`, with the final value of `p` depending on the implementation of `func_1` and the value of `max_val`.**
