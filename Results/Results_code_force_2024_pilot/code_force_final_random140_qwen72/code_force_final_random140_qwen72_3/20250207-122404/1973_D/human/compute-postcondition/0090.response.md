Output State: **The program does not return any value.** 

Explanation: The provided code snippet ends with a `return` statement without specifying any value to return. Therefore, the program does not return any value. All the variables mentioned in the initial state (`n`, `k`, `i`, `max_val`, `m`, `j`, `p`) remain as they are, but since there is no value being returned, the output state reflects that no value is returned by the program.
