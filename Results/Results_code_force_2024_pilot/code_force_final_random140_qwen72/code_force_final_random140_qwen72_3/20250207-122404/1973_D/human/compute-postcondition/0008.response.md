The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters. The output of the function is not specified in the provided information, so it's unclear what the function returns. However, based on the context that `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, it might imply that the function is intended to handle or generate results for `t` test cases, but without further details on what these test cases are or what the function should return, the exact functionality cannot be fully described.

Given the lack of specific output details, the best description of the function's functionality is:

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its return value is unspecified. It may be designed to handle or generate results for a number of test cases represented by a positive integer `t`, but the exact nature of these test cases and the function's output are not provided.**
