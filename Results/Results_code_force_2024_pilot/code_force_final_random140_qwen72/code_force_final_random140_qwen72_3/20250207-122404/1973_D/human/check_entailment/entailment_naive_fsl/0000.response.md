Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle all potential cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the logic in `func_3` for finding the largest value `m` such that the array can be split into `k` subarrays with the required property is flawed.

### Issue 1: Incorrect Calculation of `max_val`
The program attempts to find the maximum value `max_val` by iterating from `n` down to `1` and checking if `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value less than or equal to `n`. However, this approach is incorrect because it assumes that the maximum value of the subarray is always `n`, which is not necessarily true. The correct approach should involve querying the actual maximum value of the subarray.

### Issue 2: Incorrect Splitting Logic
The program tries to split the array into `k` subarrays by iterating from `n // k` down to `1` and checking if `func_1(p + 1, m)` returns `n`. This logic is flawed because it does not correctly handle the case where the subarray cannot be split as required. The program should ensure that each subarray has the same value of `f(l, r)` and that the entire array is covered.

### Example Case:
Consider the following test case:
- `n = 6`, `k = 3`, and the hidden array is `[1, 3, 6, 1, 2, 1]`.

The program will incorrectly calculate `max_val` and fail to correctly split the array into subarrays with the required properties. Specifically, the program will not correctly identify that the largest value `m` such that the array can be split into `k` subarrays is `6`.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle all potential cases and fails to meet the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
