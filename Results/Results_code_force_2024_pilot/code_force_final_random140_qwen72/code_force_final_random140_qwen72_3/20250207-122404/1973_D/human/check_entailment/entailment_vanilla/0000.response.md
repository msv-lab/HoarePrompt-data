### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the largest value `m` such that the array can be split into `k` subarrays where each subarray's `f(l, r)` equals `m`.
   - We can make up to `2n` queries to determine the smallest `r` for a given `l` and `x`.

2. **Function Analysis:**
   - **func_1:** This function makes a query to find the smallest `r` such that `f(l, r) = x`. It prints the query and reads the response.
   - **func_2:** This function prints the answer `m` and reads the response to check if it is correct.
   - **func_3:** This function handles the logic for a single test case.
     - It first tries to find the maximum possible value `max_val` by querying the entire array.
     - It then iterates over possible values of `i` to find the largest `m` that can split the array into `k` subarrays.
     - If a valid `m` is found, it prints the answer using `func_2`.
   - **func_4:** This function handles multiple test cases by calling `func_3` for each test case.

3. **Detailed Analysis of func_3:**
   - **Finding `max_val`:**
     - The loop `for i in range(n, 0, -1):` tries to find the largest `i` such that `f(1, i * n) = i * n` and `r <= n`.
     - If such an `i` is found, `max_val` is set to `i` and the loop breaks.
   - **Finding the largest `m`:**
     - The loop `for i in range(n // k, 0, -1):` tries to find the largest `i` such that `m = i * max_val` can split the array into `k` subarrays.
     - For each `i`, it checks if `p` (the end of the current subarray) reaches `n` after `k` queries.
     - If `p == n`, it means the array can be split into `k` subarrays with `f(l, r) = m`, and it prints the answer using `func_2`.
     - If no valid `m` is found, it prints `-1`.

4. **Potential Issues:**
   - The logic for finding `max_val` seems to be incorrect. It assumes that `r` should always be `n` when `f(1, i * n) = i * n`, which is not necessarily true.
   - The loop `for i in range(n // k, 0, -1):` might not cover all possible values of `i` that could lead to a valid `m`.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program does not correctly handle the logic for finding `max_val` and the largest `m`.
   - The assumptions and logic used in the program are flawed, leading to potential incorrect results.

### Correctness: **False**
