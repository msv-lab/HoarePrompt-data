To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

### Initial State:
- `arr` is a list of integers.
- `counter` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `arr` and the value is the count of how many times that element appears in `arr`.
- `i` is initialized to `n-1`, where `n` is the length of `arr`.
- `ans` is determined by the following conditions:
  - It is the first index `i` such that `counter.get(i, 0)` is 0 or the first index `i` such that `counter.get(i, 0)` is 1 and `once` is False.
  - If no such index exists, it is the last index `i` such that `counter.get(i, 0)` is 1.
- `once` is a boolean flag that becomes True if there was exactly one unique element found before breaking out of the loop, otherwise it remains False.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initialize Variables:**
   - `arr` is a list of integers.
   - `counter` is a dictionary with counts of elements in `arr`.
   - `i` starts at `n-1` (the last index of `arr`).
   - `ans` is initially undefined.
   - `once` is initially False.

2. **Determine `ans`:**
   - Loop through the indices of `arr` from `n-1` to 0.
   - For each index `i`:
     - Check if `counter.get(arr[i], 0)` is 0 or 1.
     - If `counter.get(arr[i], 0)` is 0, set `ans` to `i` and break the loop.
     - If `counter.get(arr[i], 0)` is 1 and `once` is False, set `ans` to `i`, set `once` to True, and break the loop.
     - If no such index is found, continue to the next index.
   - If the loop completes without finding an index where `counter.get(arr[i], 0)` is 0 or 1 and `once` is False, set `ans` to the last index `i` where `counter.get(arr[i], 0)` is 1.

3. **Print `ans`:**
   - The value of `ans` will be the index determined by the conditions above.

### Example Scenarios:
- If `arr = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]`, then `counter = {1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3}`.
  - `i` starts at 5.
  - `counter.get(arr[5], 0) = 3` (not 0 or 1).
  - `i` decrements to 4.
  - `counter.get(arr[4], 0) = 3` (not 0 or 1).
  - `i` decrements to 3.
  - `counter.get(arr[3], 0) = 3` (not 0 or 1).
  - `i` decrements to 2.
  - `counter.get(arr[2], 0) = 2` (not 0 or 1).
  - `i` decrements to 1.
  - `counter.get(arr[1], 0) = 2` (not 0 or 1).
  - `i` decrements to 0.
  - `counter.get(arr[0], 0) = 1` (1 and `once` is False), so `ans = 0` and `once = True`.

- If `arr = [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3]`, then `counter = {1: 2, 2: 2, 3: 2}`.
  - No index `i` where `counter.get(arr[i], 0)` is 0 or 1.
  - The last index `i` where `counter.get(arr[i], 0)` is 1 does not exist.
  - `ans` will be the last index `i` where `counter.get(arr[i], 0)` is 1, which is 5.

### Final Output:
Based on the initial state and the logic described, the value of `ans` will be the index determined by the conditions. Since the exact `arr` is not provided, we can only describe the output in general terms.

Output: **ans (where ans is the index determined by the conditions described in the initial state)**
