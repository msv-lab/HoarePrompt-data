The value of `n` is updated to the new input integer. The other variables (`t`, `arr`, `counter`, `i`, `ans`, `once`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 but one less than before, `n` is the new input integer, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `counter` contains each unique element from `arr` as keys with their corresponding counts as values, `i` is the last element of `arr`, `ans` is the smallest non-negative integer that either does not appear in `arr` or appears exactly once (if `once` is True), and `once` is True if there was at least one unique element in `arr`.**
