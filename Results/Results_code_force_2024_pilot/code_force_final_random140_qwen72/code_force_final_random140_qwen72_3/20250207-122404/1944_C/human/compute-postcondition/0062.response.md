Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers from the new input, `counter` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `arr` and the value is the count of how many times that element appears in `arr`, `i` is the last element of `arr`, `ans` is 0.** 

The variable `ans` is initialized to 0, while the other variables (`arr`, `counter`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
