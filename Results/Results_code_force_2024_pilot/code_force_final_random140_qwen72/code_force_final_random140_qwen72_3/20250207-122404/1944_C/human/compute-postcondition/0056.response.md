The code updates the count of the first element of `arr` in the dictionary `counter`. It increments the count of `i` (which is the first element of `arr`) by 1. If `i` was not already in `counter`, it initializes the count to 1.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers from the new input that must have at least 1 element, `i` is the first element of `arr`, `counter[i]` is now `counter.get(i, 0) + 1`.**
