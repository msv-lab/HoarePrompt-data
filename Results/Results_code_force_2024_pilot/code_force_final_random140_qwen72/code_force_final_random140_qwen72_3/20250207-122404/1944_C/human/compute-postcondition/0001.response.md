The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be explicitly set.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer input by the user, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4.

To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1. The placeholder `_` is automatically managed by the loop and does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
