Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have completed, `t` is 0, `n` is the last input integer for the final test case, `arr` is the last list of integers from the final test case, `counter` contains the frequency count of each element in the last `arr`, `i` is the last element of the last `arr`, `ans` is the smallest non-negative integer that either does not appear in the last `arr` or appears exactly once (if `once` is True), and `once` is True if there was at least one unique element in the last `arr`.**

Explanation:
- `t` is 0 because the loop has run `t` times, and `t` was the number of test cases.
- `n` holds the value of the last input integer for the final test case.
- `arr` holds the list of integers from the last test case.
- `counter` is a dictionary containing the frequency count of each element in the last `arr`.
- `i` is the last element of the last `arr`.
- `ans` is the smallest non-negative integer that either does not appear in the last `arr` or appears exactly once, depending on the conditions specified in the loop.
- `once` is True if there was at least one unique element in the last `arr` before the loop broke out.
