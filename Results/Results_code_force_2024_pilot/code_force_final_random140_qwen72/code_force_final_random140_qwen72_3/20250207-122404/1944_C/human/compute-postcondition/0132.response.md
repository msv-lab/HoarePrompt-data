Output State: **`arr` has been fully iterated over, `counter` contains the frequency count of each element in `arr`, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `ans` remains 0, `once` is now True, and `counter.get(i, 0)` is not equal to 0.** 

The variable `once` has been updated to `True`. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged from the initial state.
