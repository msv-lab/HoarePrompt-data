Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 2, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `counter` contains each unique element from `arr` as keys with their corresponding counts as values, `i` is 2, `ans` and `once` remain unchanged. If `counter.get(i, 0) == 1`, then `ans` is set to 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
