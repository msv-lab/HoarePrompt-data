Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers from the new input, `counter` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `arr` and the value is the count of how many times that element appears in `arr`, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is the first index `i` such that `counter.get(i, 0)` is 0 or the first index `i` such that `counter.get(i, 0)` is 1 and `once` is False, or the last index `i` such that `counter.get(i, 0)` is 1 if no such index exists, `once` is True if there was exactly one unique element found before breaking out of the loop, otherwise it remains False.**

### Explanation:
- **`arr` and `counter`**: These remain unchanged throughout the loop as they are not modified within the loop.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be the last index of the loop, which is `n-1`.
- **`ans`**: The value of `ans` is determined based on the conditions checked in the loop:
  - If `counter.get(i, 0)` is 0 for any `i`, the loop breaks and `ans` is set to that `i`.
  - If `counter.get(i, 0)` is 1 and `once` is False, `ans` is set to `i + 1` and `once` is set to True.
  - If `counter.get(i, 0)` is 1 and `once` is already True, `ans` is set to `i` and the loop breaks.
- **`once`**: This flag is set to True if there is exactly one unique element (i.e., an element that appears exactly once) found before the loop breaks. If no such element is found, `once` remains False.
