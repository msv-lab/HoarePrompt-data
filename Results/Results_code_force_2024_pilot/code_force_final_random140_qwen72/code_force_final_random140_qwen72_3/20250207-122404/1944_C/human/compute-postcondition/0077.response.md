Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers from the new input, `counter` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `arr` and the value is the count of how many times that element appears in `arr`, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, and the count of `i` in `counter` is greater than 0. If `counter.get(i, 0)` is 1 and `once` is False, then `ans` is 1, `once` is True, and the current value of `counter[i]` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0, `once` remains False, and if `counter.get(i, 0)` is 1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `counter.get(i, 0)` is not 1, the program continues executing as normal.***
