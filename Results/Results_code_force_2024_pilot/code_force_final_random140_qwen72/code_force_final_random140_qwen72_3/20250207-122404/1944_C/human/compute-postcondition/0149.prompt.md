Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `arr` has been fully iterated over, `counter` contains the frequency count of each element in `arr`, `i` is the last element of `arr`, `counter[i]` is the final frequency count of the last element in `arr`, `ans` is 0, `once` is False.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if counter.get(i, 0) == 0:
        ans = i
        break
    elif counter.get(i, 0) == 1 and not once:
        once = True
        ans = i + 1
    elif counter.get(i, 0) == 1:
        ans = i
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`arr` has been fully iterated over, `counter` contains the frequency count of each element in `arr`, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0. If `counter.get(i, 0)` is 0, the frequency count of the first element in `arr` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `counter.get(i, 0)` is 1 and `once` is False, then `ans` is set to 1, `once` is set to True, and `counter.get(i, 0)` is 1, indicating that the first element in `arr` appears exactly once. If `counter.get(i, 0)` is not 0 and not 1, or if `once` is already True, then `ans` remains 0, `once` remains False, and `counter.get(i, 0)` is not equal to 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`arr` has been fully iterated over, `counter` contains the frequency count of each element in `arr`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, and `counter.get(i, 0)` is not equal to 0. If `counter.get(i, 0)` is equal to 0, `ans` is set to 1, `once` remains False, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `counter.get(i, 0)` is equal to 1 and `once` is False, `ans` is set to 2 and `once` becomes True. If `counter.get(i, 0)` is equal to 1 but `once` is already True, `ans` is set to 1 and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0 and `once` remains False.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2. If `counter.get(i, 0)` equals 0, `ans` is set to 2, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. If `counter.get(i, 0)` equals 1 and `once` is False, `once` becomes True and `ans` is set to 3. If `counter.get(i, 0)` equals 1 and `once` is already True, `ans` is set to 2, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
