Output State: **`arr` has been fully iterated over, `counter` contains the frequency count of each element in `arr`, `i` is 0, `counter[i]` is the frequency count of the first element in `arr` (if `arr` is non-empty), `ans` is equal to `i`, `once` is False, `n` must be greater than 0, `counter.get(i, 0)` is not equal to 0, and `counter.get(i, 0)` is equal to 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
