Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `counter` contains each unique element from `arr` as keys with their corresponding counts as values, `i` is 0, `ans` is 0, `once` is False, and the count of `i` in `counter` is greater than 0. If `counter.get(i, 0)` is equal to 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the same state.***
