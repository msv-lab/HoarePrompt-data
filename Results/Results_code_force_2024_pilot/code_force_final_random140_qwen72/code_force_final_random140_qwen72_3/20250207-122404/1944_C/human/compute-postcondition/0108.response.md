The code updates the value of `counter[i]` by incrementing it by 1. Since `i` is the second element of `arr`, and `counter[i]` was initially `counter.get(i, 0) + 1`, after executing the code, `counter[i]` will be `counter.get(i, 0) + 2`.

Output State: **`arr` must have at least two elements, `i` is the second element of `arr`, `counter[i]` is now `counter.get(i, 0) + 2`.**
