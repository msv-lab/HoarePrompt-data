Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `counter` contains each unique element from `arr` as keys with their corresponding counts as values, `i` is the last element of `arr`, `ans` is the smallest non-negative integer that either does not appear in `arr` or appears exactly once (if `once` is True), and `once` is True if there was at least one unique element in `arr`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the range from 0 to `n-1`.
- For each iteration, it checks the count of the current index `i` in the `counter` dictionary.
- If the count of `i` is 0, it sets `ans` to `i` and breaks out of the loop.
- If the count of `i` is 1 and `once` is False, it sets `ans` to `i + 1`, sets `once` to True, and continues.
- If the count of `i` is 1 and `once` is already True, it sets `ans` to `i` and breaks out of the loop.
- If the count of `i` is greater than 1, it continues to the next iteration.
- After all iterations, `ans` will be the smallest non-negative integer that either does not appear in `arr` or appears exactly once (if `once` is True).
- `once` will be True if there was at least one unique element in `arr`.
