Output State: **`arr` must have at least one element, `i` is the first element of `arr`, `counter[i]` is now `counter.get(i, 0) + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `arr` must have at least one element and `i` is the first element of `arr`.
- The code updates the dictionary `counter` by incrementing the count of the value `i` (which is the first element of `arr`) by 1. If `i` was not already a key in `counter`, it initializes `counter[i]` to 1.
- The values of `arr` and `i` remain unchanged.
- The updated state reflects the new value of `counter[i]` which is now `counter.get(i, 0) + 1`.
