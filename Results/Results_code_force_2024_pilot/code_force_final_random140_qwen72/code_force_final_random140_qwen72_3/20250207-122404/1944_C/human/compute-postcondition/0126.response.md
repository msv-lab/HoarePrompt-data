Postcondition: ***`arr` has been fully iterated over, `counter` contains the frequency count of each element in `arr`, `i` is 0, `counter[i]` is the frequency count of the first element in `arr` (if `arr` is non-empty), `ans` is 0, `once` is False, `n` must be greater than 0, and `counter.get(i, 0)` is not equal to 0. If `counter.get(i, 0)` is equal to 1, then `ans` is set to `i` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0 and `once` remains False.***
