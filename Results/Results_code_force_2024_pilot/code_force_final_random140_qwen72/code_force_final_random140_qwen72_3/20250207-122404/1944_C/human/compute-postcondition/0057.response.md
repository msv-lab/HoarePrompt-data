The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `arr`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `arr`. If `arr` has more elements, the loop will continue to the next element.

At the end of the last iteration, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `i` is the first element of `arr`, and `counter[i]` is now `counter.get(i, 0) + 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `arr` must have at least 2 elements. The value of `i` will be updated to the second element of `arr` at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers from the new input that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element of `arr`, `counter[i]` is now `counter.get(i, 0) + 1`**
