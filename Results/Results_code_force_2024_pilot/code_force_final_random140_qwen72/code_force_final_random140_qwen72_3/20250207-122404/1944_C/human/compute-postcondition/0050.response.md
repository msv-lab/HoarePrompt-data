To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic leading to the value of `ans`.

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `arr` is a list of integers from the input.
- `counter` contains each unique element from `arr` as keys with their corresponding counts as values.
- `i` is the last element of `arr`.
- `ans` is the smallest non-negative integer that either does not appear in `arr` or appears exactly once (if `once` is True).
- `once` is True if there was at least one unique element in `arr`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Counter Creation**: The `counter` dictionary is created by counting the occurrences of each element in `arr`.
2. **Determine `once`**: The variable `once` is set to True if there is at least one unique element in `arr` (i.e., an element that appears exactly once in `arr`).
3. **Find `ans`**:
   - If `once` is True, `ans` is the smallest non-negative integer that either does not appear in `arr` or appears exactly once.
   - If `once` is False, `ans` is the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear in `arr`.

### Example Scenarios:
- **Scenario 1**: If `arr = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3]`, then `counter` would be `{1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 2}`. Here, `once` is True because 1 appears exactly once. The smallest non-negative integer that either does not appear in `arr` or appears exactly once is 0 (since 0 does not appear in `arr`).
- **Scenario 2**: If `arr = [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3]`, then `counter` would be `{1: 2, 2: 2, 3: 2}`. Here, `once` is False because no element appears exactly once. The smallest non-negative integer that does not appear in `arr` is 0.

### General Case:
- If `once` is True, `ans` will be the smallest non-negative integer that either does not appear in `arr` or appears exactly once.
- If `once` is False, `ans` will be the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear in `arr`.

### Final Output:
The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans` based on the conditions described above. Since the exact value of `ans` depends on the specific contents of `arr`, we can describe it as follows:

Output: **ans (where ans is the smallest non-negative integer that either does not appear in arr or appears exactly once if once is True, otherwise it is the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear in arr)**
