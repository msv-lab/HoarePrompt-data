Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 2, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `counter` contains each unique element from `arr` as keys with their corresponding counts as values, `i` is 2. If `counter.get(i, 0) == 0`, `ans` is 2, `once` remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `counter.get(i, 0) == 1` and `once` is False, then `ans` is 3 and `once` is True. If `counter.get(i, 0) == 1` and `once` is already True, then `ans` is set to 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `counter.get(i, 0) > 1`, `ans` and `once` remain unchanged.***
