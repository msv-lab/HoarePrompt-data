To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects present in the loop head, which are `i` and `arr`.

- The variable `i` will take on the values of elements in `arr` during each iteration of the loop.
- The loop will execute if `arr` contains at least one element.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 0 but one less than before (this is not relevant to the loop execution).
- `n` is the new input integer (this is not directly relevant to the loop execution).
- `arr` is a list of integers from the new input (this is relevant to the loop execution).
- `counter` is an empty dictionary (this is not relevant to the loop execution).
- `i` is the last element of the old `arr` (this will be overwritten by the loop).
- `ans` is the smallest non-negative integer that either does not appear in the old `arr` or appears exactly once (if `once` is True) (this is not relevant to the loop execution).
- `once` is True if there was at least one unique element in the old `arr` (this is not relevant to the loop execution).

For the loop to execute, `arr` must contain at least one element. The variable `i` will be set to the first element of `arr` when the loop starts.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`arr` is a list of integers from the new input that must have at least 1 element, `i` is the first element of `arr`**
