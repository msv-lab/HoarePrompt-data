Postcondition: ***`arr` has been fully iterated over, `counter` contains the frequency count of each element in `arr`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, and `counter.get(i, 0)` is not equal to 0. If `counter.get(i, 0)` is equal to 1 and `once` is False, `ans` is set to 2 and `once` becomes True. If `counter.get(i, 0)` is equal to 1 but `once` is already True, `ans` is set to 1 and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0 and `once` remains False.***
