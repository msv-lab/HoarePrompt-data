Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer input by the user, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 0 ≤ a_i < n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    counter = {}
    for i in arr:
        counter[i] = counter.get(i, 0) + 1
    ans = 0
    once = False
    for i in range(n):
        if counter.get(i, 0) == 0:
            ans = i
            break
        elif counter.get(i, 0) == 1 and not once:
            once = True
            ans = i + 1
        elif counter.get(i, 0) == 1:
            ans = i
            break
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `counter` contains each unique element from `arr` as keys with their corresponding counts as values, `i` is the last element of `arr`, `ans` is the smallest non-negative integer that either does not appear in `arr` or appears exactly once (if `once` is True), and `once` is True if there was at least one unique element in `arr`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `arr` is a list of integers from the new input, `counter` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `arr` and the value is the count of how many times that element appears in `arr`, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is the first index `i` such that `counter.get(i, 0)` is 0 or the first index `i` such that `counter.get(i, 0)` is 1 and `once` is False, or the last index `i` such that `counter.get(i, 0)` is 1 if no such index exists, `once` is True if there was exactly one unique element found before breaking out of the loop, otherwise it remains False.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `arr` has been fully iterated over, `counter` contains the frequency count of each element in `arr`, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is the length of the range, `ans` is the index of the first unique element found or the first index where the frequency is 0, `once` is True if a unique element was found before breaking out of the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
