Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers from the new input, `counter` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `arr` and the value is the count of how many times that element appears in `arr`, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `ans` is 2, `once` is True**

The code snippet `once = True` does not change the value of `once` since it was already `True` in the initial state. Therefore, all other variables remain unchanged.
