Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem by simulating the optimal moves of Alice and Bob to determine the MEX of the array `c` after all elements from `a` have been processed according to the rules of the game. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the logic and its correctness:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself `arr`.

2. **Frequency Counting**: It uses a dictionary `counter` to count the occurrences of each element in `arr`. This step is crucial for determining the MEX later.

3. **Determining the MEX**:
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to 0, which will hold the final MEX value.
   - A boolean variable `once` is used to track whether a number has appeared exactly once in the array.
   - The program iterates through the numbers from 0 to `n-1`:
     - If a number `i` does not appear in `counter`, it means `i` is the smallest non-negative integer not in the array, so `ans` is set to `i` and the loop breaks.
     - If a number `i` appears exactly once and `once` is `False`, it sets `once` to `True` and updates `ans` to `i + 1`.
     - If a number `i` appears exactly once and `once` is already `True`, it sets `ans` to `i` and breaks the loop.

4. **Output**: The program prints the final value of `ans` for each test case.

### Analysis of the Logic:
- **Optimal Play**: The logic correctly simulates the optimal play of Alice and Bob. Alice wants to maximize the MEX, and Bob wants to minimize it. By ensuring that the first missing number or the first unique number is chosen, the program effectively captures the optimal strategy.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases well, such as when all numbers are the same or when the array is very small.
- **Efficiency**: The use of a dictionary for counting frequencies ensures that the program runs efficiently, even for large inputs.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the MEX of the array `c` after the game is played optimally by Alice and Bob. The reasoning and implementation align with the problem requirements and constraints.

Correctness: **True**
