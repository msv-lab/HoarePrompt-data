Correctness: **True**

The provided solution appears to correctly solve the problem by considering the optimal moves for both players. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why it works:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the elements of the array `arr`.

2. **Counting Elements**: It uses a dictionary `counter` to count the occurrences of each element in the array `arr`.

3. **Finding the MEX**: The program iterates through the numbers from 0 to `n-1` to determine the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends. It checks:
   - If a number `i` is missing from the array (`counter.get(i, 0) == 0`), it sets `ans` to `i` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If a number `i` appears exactly once and `once` is `False`, it sets `once` to `True` and continues. This ensures that Alice can pick this number to maximize the MEX.
   - If a number `i` appears exactly once and `once` is already `True`, it sets `ans` to `i` and breaks out of the loop.

4. **Output**: Finally, it prints the value of `ans` for each test case.

This approach ensures that the program correctly finds the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally. Therefore, the program is correct.
