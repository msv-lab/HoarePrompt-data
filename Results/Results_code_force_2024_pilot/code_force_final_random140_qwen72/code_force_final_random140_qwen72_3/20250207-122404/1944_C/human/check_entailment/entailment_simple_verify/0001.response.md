### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns picking elements from an array `a` until it is empty.
   - Alice aims to maximize the MEX of the array `c`, while Bob aims to minimize it.
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr`.
   - It then counts the frequency of each element in the array using a dictionary `counter`.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - The program iterates through the range `[0, n-1]` and checks the following conditions:
     - If the current number `i` is not present in the array (`counter.get(i, 0) == 0`), it sets `ans` to `i` and breaks the loop.
     - If the current number `i` is present exactly once and `once` is `False`, it sets `once` to `True` and updates `ans` to `i + 1`.
     - If the current number `i` is present exactly once and `once` is already `True`, it sets `ans` to `i` and breaks the loop.

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The program correctly identifies the smallest missing number (MEX) by iterating through the range `[0, n-1]`.
   - It handles the case where a number appears exactly once by ensuring that Alice can pick it to maximize the MEX.
   - The logic ensures that the final score is the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as arrays with all elements being the same or arrays with unique elements.
   - It correctly processes multiple test cases as specified in the problem statement.

6. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The annotations confirm that the program maintains the correct state throughout its execution.
   - The use of the `counter` dictionary to count frequencies and the `once` flag to track the presence of unique elements aligns with the optimal strategy described in the problem.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally. The original assessment accurately evaluates the program's correctness.

Final: **True**
