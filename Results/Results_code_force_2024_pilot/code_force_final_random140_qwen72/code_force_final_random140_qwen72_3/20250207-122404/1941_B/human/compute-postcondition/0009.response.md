The only objects in the loop head are `elementIndex`, `range(1, length - 1)`, and implicitly `length`. For the loop to execute, the range must contain at least one value. This means that the upper bound of the range, `length - 1`, must be greater than the lower bound, which is 1. Therefore, `length` must be greater than 2.

Given the initial state:
- `inputarray` is a list of non-negative integers, and its length is at least 3.
- `func_2(inputarray)` returns `False`.
- `loop_counter` is 1.
- `length` is equal to the length of `inputarray`.
- `highestNumber` is -1.
- `highestIndex` is -1.

We need to ensure that `length` is greater than 2 for the loop to execute. Since `length` is already stated to be at least 3, this condition is satisfied. The variable `elementIndex` should start at 1 for the first iteration.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`inputarray` is a list of non-negative integers, and its length is at least 3, `func_2(inputarray)` returns `False`, `loop_counter` is 1, `length` is equal to the length of `inputarray` (which is at least 3), `highestNumber` is -1, `highestIndex` is -1, `elementIndex` is 1**
