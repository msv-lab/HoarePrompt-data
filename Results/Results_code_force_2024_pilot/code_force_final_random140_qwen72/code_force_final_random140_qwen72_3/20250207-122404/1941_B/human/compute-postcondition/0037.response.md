To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the conditions involving the variables in the loop head, which are `elementIndex` and `length`.

Given the loop statement:
```python
for elementIndex in range(1, length - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

For the loop to execute:
- `elementIndex` should start at 1.
- The upper bound of the range, `length - 1`, must be greater than or equal to 1. This means `length` must be at least 3.

Given the initial state:
- `inputarray` is a list of non-negative integers, and its length is at least 3.
- `length` is equal to the length of `inputarray` (which is at least 3).

Since `length` is already at least 3, the loop can execute as long as `elementIndex` starts at 1.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `elementIndex` is 1 and `length` is at least 3.

State: **`inputarray` is a list of non-negative integers, `length` is at least 3, `elementIndex` is 1, `func_2(inputarray)` returns `False`, `loop_counter` is 2, `highestNumber` is -1, `highestIndex` is -1, `newArray` is the result of `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`, `func_2(newArray)` returns `False`**
