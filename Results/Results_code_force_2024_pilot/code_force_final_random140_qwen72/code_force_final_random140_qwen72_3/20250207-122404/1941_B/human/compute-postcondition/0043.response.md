To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given state and the loop head:

### Given State:
- `inputarray` is a list of non-negative integers.
- `length` is at least 3.
- `elementIndex` is 1.
- `func_2(inputarray)` returns `False`.
- `loop_counter` is 2.
- `highestNumber` is either -1 or `inputarray[1]` (depending on whether `inputarray[1]` is greater than or equal to the initial `highestNumber`).
- `highestIndex` is either -1 or 1 (depending on whether `inputarray[1]` is greater than or equal to the initial `highestNumber`).
- `newArray` is the result of `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`.
- `func_2(newArray)` returns `False`.
- If `inputarray[1]` is greater than or equal to the initial `highestNumber`, then `highestNumber` is set to `inputarray[1]` and `highestIndex` is set to 1.

### Loop Head:
```python
for elementIndex in range(1, length - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over `elementIndex` from 1 to `length - 2` (inclusive).
- At the end of the previous iteration, `elementIndex` is 1.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `elementIndex` must be incremented by 1, making it 2.
- The condition for the loop to continue is that `elementIndex` must be less than `length - 1`.

### Adjusted State:
- `elementIndex` is incremented to 2.
- `length` remains at least 3, ensuring that `elementIndex` (which is now 2) is still less than `length - 1`.

### Final State:
State: **`inputarray` is a list of non-negative integers, `length` is at least 3, `elementIndex` is 2, `func_2(inputarray)` returns `False`, `loop_counter` is 2, `highestNumber` is either -1 or `inputarray[1]` (depending on whether `inputarray[1]` is greater than or equal to the initial `highestNumber`), `highestIndex` is either -1 or 1 (depending on whether `inputarray[1]` is greater than or equal to the initial `highestNumber`), `newArray` is the result of `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`, and `func_2(newArray)` returns `False`. Additionally, if `inputarray[1]` is greater than or equal to the initial `highestNumber`, then `highestNumber` is set to `inputarray[1]` and `highestIndex` is set to 1.**
