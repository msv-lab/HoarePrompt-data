Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `inputarray` is a list of non-negative integers, and its length is at least 3. `func_2(inputarray)` returns `False`. `loop_counter` is 2. `length` is equal to the length of `inputarray` (which is at least 3). `highestNumber` is -1. `highestIndex` is -1. `newArray` is the result of `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`. `func_2(newArray)` returns `False`.
Code of the loop:
for elementIndex in range(1, length - 1):
    if inputarray[elementIndex] >= highestNumber:
        highestIndex = elementIndex
        highestNumber = inputarray[elementIndex]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`inputarray` is a list of non-negative integers, `length` is at least 3, `elementIndex` is 1, `func_2(inputarray)` returns `False`, `loop_counter` is 2, `highestNumber` is either -1 or `inputarray[1]` (depending on whether `inputarray[1]` is greater than or equal to the initial `highestNumber`), `highestIndex` is either -1 or 1 (depending on whether `inputarray[1]` is greater than or equal to the initial `highestNumber`), `newArray` is the result of `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`, and `func_2(newArray)` returns `False`. Additionally, if `inputarray[1]` is greater than or equal to the initial `highestNumber`, then `highestNumber` is set to `inputarray[1]` and `highestIndex` is set to 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`inputarray` is a list of non-negative integers, `length` is at least 3, `elementIndex` is 2, `func_2(inputarray)` returns `False`, `loop_counter` is 2, and `newArray` is the result of `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`, and `func_2(newArray)` returns `False`. If `inputarray[2]` is greater than or equal to the initial `highestNumber`, then `highestNumber` is set to `inputarray[2]` and `highestIndex` is set to 2. Otherwise, `highestNumber` remains as the maximum of `inputarray[1]` and the initial `highestNumber`, and `highestIndex` remains as 1 or -1 depending on whether `inputarray[1]` was greater than or equal to the initial `highestNumber`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`inputarray` is a list of non-negative integers, `length` is at least 3, `elementIndex` is 3, `func_2(inputarray)` returns `False`, `loop_counter` is 2, `newArray` is the result of `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`, `func_2(newArray)` returns `False`. If `inputarray[3]` is greater than or equal to the initial `highestNumber`, then `highestNumber` is set to `inputarray[3]` and `highestIndex` is set to 3. Otherwise, `highestNumber` remains as the maximum of `inputarray[1]` and the initial `highestNumber`, and `highestIndex` remains as 1 or -1 depending on whether `inputarray[1]` was greater than or equal to the initial `highestNumber`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
