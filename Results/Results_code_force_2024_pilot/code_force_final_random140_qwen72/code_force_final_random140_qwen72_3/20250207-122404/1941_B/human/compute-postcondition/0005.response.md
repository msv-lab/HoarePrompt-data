The only variable in the loop head is `loop_counter`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `loop_counter`. If `loop_counter` is not equal to 100, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `loop_counter` is 1, which means the loop condition (`loop_counter != 100`) is already satisfied.

Since the loop condition is already met with the current state, no adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **inputarray is a list of non-negative integers, and its length is at least 3, `func_2(inputarray)` returns `False`, `loop_counter` is 1**
