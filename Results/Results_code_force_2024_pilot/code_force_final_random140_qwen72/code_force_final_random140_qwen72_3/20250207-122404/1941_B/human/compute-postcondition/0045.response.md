Output State: **`inputarray` is a list of non-negative integers, `length` is at least 3, `elementIndex` is 2, `func_2(inputarray)` returns `False`, `loop_counter` is 2, `highestNumber` is `inputarray[2]`, `highestIndex` is 2, `newArray` is the result of `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`, and `func_2(newArray)` returns `False`. Additionally, if `inputarray[1]` is greater than or equal to the initial `highestNumber`, then `highestNumber` was initially set to `inputarray[1]` and `highestIndex` was set to 2.**
