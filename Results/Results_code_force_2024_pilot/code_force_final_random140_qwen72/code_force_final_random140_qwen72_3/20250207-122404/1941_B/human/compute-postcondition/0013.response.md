Postcondition: ***`inputarray` is a list of non-negative integers, and its length is at least 3. `func_2(inputarray)` returns `False`. `loop_counter` is 1. `length` is equal to the length of `inputarray` (which is at least 3). If `inputarray[1]` is greater than or equal to `highestNumber`, then `highestNumber` is updated to `inputarray[1]` and `highestIndex` is set to 1. `elementIndex` remains 1.***
