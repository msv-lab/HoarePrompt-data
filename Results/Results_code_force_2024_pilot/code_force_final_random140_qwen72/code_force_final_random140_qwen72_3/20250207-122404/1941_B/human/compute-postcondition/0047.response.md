The only objects in the loop head are variables `elementIndex` and `length`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `elementIndex` being less than `length - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `elementIndex` is 2, and `length` is at least 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `elementIndex` needs to be incremented by 1 (to 3), and `length` must still be greater than 3.

State: **`inputarray` is a list of non-negative integers, `length` is at least 3, `elementIndex` is 3, `func_2(inputarray)` returns `False`, `loop_counter` is 2, and `newArray` is the result of `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`, and `func_2(newArray)` returns `False`. If `inputarray[2]` is greater than or equal to the initial `highestNumber`, then `highestNumber` is set to `inputarray[2]` and `highestIndex` is set to 2. Otherwise, `highestNumber` remains as the maximum of `inputarray[1]` and the initial `highestNumber`, and `highestIndex` remains as 1 or -1 depending on whether `inputarray[1]` was greater than or equal to the initial `highestNumber`.**
