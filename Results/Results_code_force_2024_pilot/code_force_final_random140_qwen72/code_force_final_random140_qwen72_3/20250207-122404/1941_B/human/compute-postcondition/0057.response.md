Postcondition: **`inputarray` is a list of non-negative integers, `length` is at least 3, `elementIndex` is `length - 1`, `func_2(inputarray)` returns `False`, `loop_counter` is 2, `highestNumber` is the maximum value in `inputarray` from index 1 to `length - 2`, `highestIndex` is the index of the maximum value in `inputarray` from index 1 to `length - 2`, `newArray` is the result of `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`, and `func_2(newArray)` returns `True`. Additionally, `highestNumber` is greater than or equal to 0.**
