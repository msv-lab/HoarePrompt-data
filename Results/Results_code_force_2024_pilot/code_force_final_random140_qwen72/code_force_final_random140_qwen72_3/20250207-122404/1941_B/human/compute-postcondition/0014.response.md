The only objects in the loop head are `elementIndex` and `length`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `elementIndex` being less than `length - 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `elementIndex` is 1 and `length` is at least 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `elementIndex` needs to be incremented by 1 to 2, and `length` must still be greater than 2 (since `elementIndex` must be less than `length - 1`).

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`inputarray` is a list of non-negative integers, and its length is at least 3. `func_2(inputarray)` returns `False`. `loop_counter` is 1. `length` is equal to the length of `inputarray` (which is at least 3). `elementIndex` is 2.**
