Postcondition: **`inputarray` is a list of non-negative integers, and its length is at least 3. `func_2(inputarray)` returns `False`. `loop_counter` is 1. `length` is equal to the length of `inputarray` (which is at least 3). `highestNumber` is the highest value in `inputarray` from index 1 to `length - 2`. `highestIndex` is the index of the highest value in `inputarray` from index 1 to `length - 2`. `highestNumber` is greater than or equal to 0. `newArray` is the result of `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`. `func_2(newArray)` returns `True`.**
