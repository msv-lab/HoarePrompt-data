Output State: **`inputarray` is a list of non-negative integers, and its length is at least 3, `func_2(inputarray)` returns `False`, `loop_counter` is 1, `length` is equal to the length of `inputarray`.** 

The code snippet assigns the length of `inputarray` to the variable `length`. Since `inputarray` is a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 3, `length` will be at least 3. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
