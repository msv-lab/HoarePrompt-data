Postcondition: ***`inputarray` is a list of non-negative integers, and its length is at least 3. `func_2(inputarray)` returns `False`. `loop_counter` is 1. `length` is equal to the length of `inputarray` (which is at least 3). `elementIndex` is 3. If `inputarray[3]` is greater than or equal to `highestNumber`, then `highestIndex` is 3 and `highestNumber` is equal to `inputarray[3]`. Otherwise, `highestIndex` and `highestNumber` remain unchanged.***
