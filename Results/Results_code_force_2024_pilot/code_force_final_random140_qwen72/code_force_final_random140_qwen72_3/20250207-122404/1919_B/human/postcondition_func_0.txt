The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it reads an integer `s` and a string `e` consisting of '+' and '-' characters. It then calculates the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in `e` and prints this difference. The function does not return any value. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the state includes the number of processed test cases (`i`), the last input integer (`s`), the last input string (`e`), the count of '+' characters (`P`), and the count of '-' characters (`M`).
