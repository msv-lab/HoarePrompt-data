Reasoning:  
The provided function `func` is intended to solve the problem of calculating the minimum possible penalty for splitting a string `s` of '+' and '-' characters into non-empty subarrays. However, the function does not actually implement the optimal splitting logic described in the problem statement. Instead, it simply counts the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string and prints the absolute difference between these counts.

This approach is incorrect because the problem requires minimizing the penalty by optimally splitting the array, which involves considering the sums of subarrays and their lengths, not just the overall balance of '+' and '-' characters. The correct solution should involve a more complex algorithm that considers different ways to split the array to minimize the penalty.

For example, in the third test case with the input string `"+-+-+"`, the optimal way to split the array to achieve a penalty of 0 is `([1,-1,1,-1],[1,-1])`, but the provided function would incorrectly output 0 based on the overall balance of '+' and '-' characters without performing the actual splitting.

Therefore, the function does not correctly solve the problem as specified.

Correctness: **False**
