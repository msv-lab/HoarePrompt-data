Correctness: **False**

The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as specified. The solution calculates the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters in the string `e`, which does not account for the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty. According to the problem statement, the goal is to find a way to split the array such that the total penalty is minimized, which involves considering the sum of the elements in each segment and multiplying it by the length of the segment, not just the overall count of positive and negative values.

To solve this problem correctly, one would need to consider how to partition the array to minimize the penalty, which might involve dynamic programming or a greedy approach to ensure that the segments are chosen in a way that minimizes the total penalty. The current solution does not address this aspect and thus is incorrect.
