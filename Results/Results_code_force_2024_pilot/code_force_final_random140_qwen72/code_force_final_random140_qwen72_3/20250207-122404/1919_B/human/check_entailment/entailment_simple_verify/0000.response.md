Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The program simply calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters and outputs the absolute value of this difference. This approach does not account for the requirement to split the array into subarrays to minimize the penalty.

The counterexample provided in the original assessment is valid:
- For the input `--++++`, the expected output is `4`, but the program outputs `2`.

This demonstrates that the program does not attempt to split the array into subarrays to minimize the penalty, which is a crucial part of the problem statement. The program's logic is flawed and does not meet the requirements of the problem.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is indeed incorrect for all potential cases.

Final: **False**
