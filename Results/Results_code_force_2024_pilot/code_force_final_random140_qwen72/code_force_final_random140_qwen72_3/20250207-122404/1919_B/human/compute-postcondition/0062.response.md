To determine what will be printed by the `print(abs(P - M))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant variables:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000.
- `s` is the integer value provided by the user input.
- `i` is 2.
- `e` is a non-empty input string.
- `P` is the number of '+' characters in `e`.
- `M` is the number of '-' characters in `e`.

The `print(abs(P - M))` statement will print the absolute difference between the number of '+' characters (`P`) and the number of '-' characters (`M`) in the string `e`.

Since the exact content of the string `e` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `abs(P - M)`. However, we can describe it based on the given information.

Output: **abs(P - M) (where P is the number of '+' characters in the string e, and M is the number of '-' characters in the string e)**
