The value of `M` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `M` is either 0 or 2, depending on whether `q` is '+' or not. If `q` is '+', `M` was initially 0, so now `M` is 1. If `q` is not '+', `M` was initially 2, so now `M` is 3. The values of `t`, `n`, `s`, `i`, `e`, and `P` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, `s` is the integer value provided by the user input, `i` is 1, `e` is a non-empty input string with at least two characters remaining, `q` is the third character of `e`, `P` is 0 if `q` is not '+', otherwise `P` is 2, `M` is 1 if `q` is '+', otherwise `M` is 3.**
