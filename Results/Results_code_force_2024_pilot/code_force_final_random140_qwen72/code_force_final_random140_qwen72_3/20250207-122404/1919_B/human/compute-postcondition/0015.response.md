The only objects in the loop head are the variable `q` and the string `e`. The loop iterates over each character in the string `e`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `q` is the first character of `e`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the next character in the string `e` must be considered. Since `i` is not part of the loop head, it does not need to be adjusted. However, `q` should now be the second character of `e`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000
- `s` is an integer greater than 0
- `i` is 0
- `e` is a non-empty input string
- `q` is the first character of `e`

After the first iteration, `q` should be the second character of `e` (if it exists). For the loop to execute again, `e` must have at least two characters.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, `s` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `e` is a non-empty input string with at least 2 characters, `q` is the second character of `e`. If `q` is '+', then `P` is 2 and `M` is 0. Otherwise, `P` is 0 and `M` is 2.**
