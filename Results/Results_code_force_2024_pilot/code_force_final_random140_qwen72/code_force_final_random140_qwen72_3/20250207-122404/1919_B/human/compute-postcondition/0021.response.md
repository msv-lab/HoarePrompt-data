The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and the loop condition is based on the value provided by `int(input())`. Since the loop iterates over a range defined by user input, the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than this input value.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 1. The input value must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, `s` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `e` is a non-empty input string, `P` is the number of '+' characters in `e`, and `M` is the number of '-' characters in `e`.**
