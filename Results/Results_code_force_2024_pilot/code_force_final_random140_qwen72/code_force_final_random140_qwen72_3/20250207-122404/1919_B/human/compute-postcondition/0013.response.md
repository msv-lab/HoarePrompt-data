The value of `M` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `M` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `q` is '+' or not. If `q` is '+', then `M` was initially 0 and becomes 1. If `q` is not '+', then `M` was initially 1 and becomes 2. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, `s` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `e` is a non-empty input string, `q` is the first character of `e`, `P` is 0 or 1, `M` is 1 if `q` is '+', otherwise `M` is 2.**
