The only objects in the loop head are the variable `q` and the string `e`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `e`. If there are more characters left in `e`, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `e` is a non-empty input string. For the loop to execute one more time, the next character in `e` needs to be processed, and `q` will take the value of the next character in `e`.

Since `i` is not part of the loop head, it does not need to be adjusted. The state of `e` remains the same, but `q` will now be the next character in the string.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, `s` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `e` is a non-empty input string, `q` is the first character of `e`. If `q` is '+', then `P` is 1 and `M` is 0. Otherwise, `P` is 0 and `M` is 1.**
