The code snippet `s = int(input())` changes the value of `s` from a string of length `n` consisting only of '+' and '-' characters to an integer input by the user. The new value of `s` is an integer greater than 0, as specified by the condition `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, `s` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0.**
