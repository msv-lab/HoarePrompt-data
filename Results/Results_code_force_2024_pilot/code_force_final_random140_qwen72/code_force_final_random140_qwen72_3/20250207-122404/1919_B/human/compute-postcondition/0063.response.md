Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, `s` is the integer value provided by the user input, `i` is `t-1`, `e` is a non-empty input string, `P` is the number of '+' characters in `e`, and `M` is the number of '-' characters in `e`.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will have reached the value `t-1` because the loop runs from `0` to `t-1` (inclusive). The variables `P` and `M` will hold the counts of '+' and '-' characters, respectively, for the last input string `e` processed in the loop. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop. The variable `s` holds the integer value provided by the user input for the last iteration.
