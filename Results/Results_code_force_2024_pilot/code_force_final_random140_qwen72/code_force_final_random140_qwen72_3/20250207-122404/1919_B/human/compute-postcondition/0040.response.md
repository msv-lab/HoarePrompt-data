Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, `s` is the integer value provided by the user input, `i` is 1, `e` is a non-empty input string, `P` is the number of '+' characters in `e`, and `M` is the number of '-' characters in `e`.**

### Explanation:
- The variables `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- The variable `i` also remains unchanged as it is not used or modified within the loop.
- The variable `e` is the input string that the loop iterates over.
- The variable `P` counts the number of '+' characters in the string `e`.
- The variable `M` counts the number of '-' characters in the string `e`.

After the loop has executed all its iterations, `P` will hold the total count of '+' characters, and `M` will hold the total count of '-' characters in the input string `e`.
