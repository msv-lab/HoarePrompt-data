Precondition: **t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 250. k and q are positive integers where 1 ≤ k, q ≤ 100, representing the length of the sequence a and the number of values n_i, respectively. p is a list of k unique integers in ascending order, where 1 ≤ p[i] ≤ 100. qs is a list of q integers, where 1 ≤ qs[i] ≤ 100.**
