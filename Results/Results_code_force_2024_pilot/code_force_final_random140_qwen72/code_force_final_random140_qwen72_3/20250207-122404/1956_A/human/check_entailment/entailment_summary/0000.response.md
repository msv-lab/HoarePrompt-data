### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to simulate a game where players are removed based on a sequence `a` until no more players can be removed.
   - The goal is to determine how many players remain after the game ends for different initial numbers of players `n`.

2. **Function Analysis:**
   - **`func_1(p)`**:
     - This function precomputes the number of remaining players for all possible initial player counts from 1 to 100.
     - It iterates over each possible number of players `n` and simulates the removal process using the sequence `p`.
     - The key operation is to repeatedly subtract the count of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to the current number of players `cur_n` until `cur_n` is less than the smallest element in `p`.
     - The result is stored in the `remaining_players` list, where `remaining_players[n]` gives the number of remaining players for an initial count of `n`.

   - **`func_2()`**:
     - This function handles multiple test cases.
     - For each test case, it reads the input values `k`, `q`, `p`, and `qs`.
     - It calls `func_1(p)` to get the precomputed results for the sequence `p`.
     - It then constructs the result for each query in `qs` by looking up the precomputed results in `remaining_players`.
     - Finally, it formats the results as required and appends them to the `results` list.

3. **Verification:**
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly simulates the removal process for each possible initial number of players.
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and uses the precomputed results from `func_1` to generate the final output.
   - The output format matches the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the game simulation and produces the expected results for the given problem description.

Correctness: **True**
