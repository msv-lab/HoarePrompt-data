Output State: **`p` is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, where 1 <= p[i] <= 100; `max_n` is 100; `remaining_players` is a list of 101 integers where each element `remaining_players[n]` (for 1 <= n <= 100) is the result of the loop's computation for that `n`, specifically the largest value less than the minimum value in `p` after subtracting the count of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `n`; `n` is 100; `cur_n` is the largest value less than the minimum value in `p`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `n = 1` to `n = 100`.
- For each `n`, `cur_n` starts as `n` and is repeatedly reduced by the count of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `cur_n` until `cur_n` is less than the minimum value in `p`.
- The final value of `cur_n` for each `n` is stored in `remaining_players[n]`.
- After the loop completes, `remaining_players` contains the computed values for each `n` from 1 to 100.
- The variable `n` will be 100, and `cur_n` will be the largest value less than the minimum value in `p`.
