Output State: **`p` is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, where 1 <= p[i] <= 100; `max_n` is 100; `remaining_players` is a list of 101 zeros with `remaining_players[1]` set to 0 and `remaining_players[2]` set to 0; `n` is 3; `cur_n` is 3.** 

The value of `cur_n` is updated to 3, which matches the value of `n`. All other variables remain unchanged.
