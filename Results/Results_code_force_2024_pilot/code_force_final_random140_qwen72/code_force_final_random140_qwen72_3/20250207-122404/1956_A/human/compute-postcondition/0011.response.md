The code snippet `p = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `p`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 250
- `k` and `q` are input integers where 1 ≤ k, q ≤ 100
- `p` is a list of integers read from the input
- `qs` is a list of q integers where 1 ≤ qs[i] ≤ 100
- `results` is a list containing one string element which is the space-separated string representation of the elements in `res`
- `remaining_players` is the result of `func_1(p)`
- `res` is a list containing the elements of `remaining_players` at the indices specified by `qs`
- `k` and `q` are updated to the values provided by the user input

After executing the code snippet:
- `p` is now a list of integers read from the new input.

The other variables (`t`, `k`, `q`, `qs`, `results`, `remaining_players`, `res`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 250, `k` and `q` are input integers where 1 ≤ k, q ≤ 100, `p` is a list of integers read from the new input, `qs` is a list of q integers where 1 ≤ qs[i] ≤ 100, `results` is a list containing one string element which is the space-separated string representation of the elements in `res`, `remaining_players` is the result of `func_1(p)`, `res` is a list containing the elements of `remaining_players` at the indices specified by `qs`.**
