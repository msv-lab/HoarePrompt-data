Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 250, `k` and `q` are input integers where 1 ≤ k, q ≤ 100, `p` is a list of integers read from the new input, `qs` is a list of integers read from the new input, `results` is a list containing one string element which is the space-separated string representation of the elements in `res`, `remaining_players` is the result of `func_1(p)`, `res` is a list containing the elements of `remaining_players` at the indices specified by the new `qs`.**

Explanation:
- The line `remaining_players = func_1(p)` updates the value of `remaining_players` to the result of calling `func_1` with the list `p`.
- The initial state mentions that `remaining_players` is already the result of `func_1(p)`, so this line does not change the value of `remaining_players`.
- All other variables (`t`, `k`, `q`, `p`, `qs`, `results`, and `res`) remain unchanged.
- The output state reflects that `remaining_players` is still the result of `func_1(p)`, and all other variables retain their initial values.
