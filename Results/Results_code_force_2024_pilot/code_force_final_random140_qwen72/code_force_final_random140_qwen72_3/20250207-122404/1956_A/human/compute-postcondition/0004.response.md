The code snippet `p = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into parts based on spaces, converts each part to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `p`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 250
- `k` and `q` are input integers where 1 ≤ k, q ≤ 100
- `p` is a list of k unique integers in ascending order, where 1 ≤ p[i] ≤ 100
- `qs` is a list of q integers, where 1 ≤ qs[i] ≤ 100
- `results` is an empty list

After executing the code snippet:
- `p` is now a list of integers read from the input, which may or may not match the initial description of `p` (i.e., it may not be unique or in ascending order, and the length may not be `k`).

The other variables (`t`, `k`, `q`, `qs`, and `results`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 250, `k` and `q` are input integers where 1 ≤ k, q ≤ 100, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, `qs` is a list of q integers where 1 ≤ qs[i] ≤ 100, `results` is an empty list.**
