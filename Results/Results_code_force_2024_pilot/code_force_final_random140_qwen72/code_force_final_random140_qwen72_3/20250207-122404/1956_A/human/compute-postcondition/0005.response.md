Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 250, `k` and `q` are input integers where 1 ≤ k, q ≤ 100, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, `qs` is a list of q integers where 1 ≤ qs[i] ≤ 100, `results` is an empty list, `qs` is updated to a list of integers read from the input.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `t`, `k`, and `q` are input integers with specific ranges, `p` is a list of integers, `qs` is a list of integers, and `results` is an empty list.
- The code snippet `qs = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `qs`.
- After executing this code, `qs` is updated to a new list of integers read from the input, while the other variables (`t`, `k`, `q`, `p`, and `results`) remain unchanged.
