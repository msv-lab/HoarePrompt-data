Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 249, `k` and `q` are input integers where 1 ≤ k, q ≤ 100, `p` is a list of integers read from the new input, `qs` is a list of integers read from the new input, `results` is a list containing two string elements: the first element is the space-separated string representation of the elements in `res`, and the second element is the same as the first element, `remaining_players` is the result of `func_1(p)`, `res` is a list containing the elements of `remaining_players` at the indices specified by `qs`.**

Explanation:
- The code `res = [remaining_players[n] for n in qs]` updates the list `res` to contain the elements of `remaining_players` at the indices specified by `qs`.
- All other variables (`t`, `k`, `q`, `p`, `qs`, `results`, `remaining_players`) remain unchanged.
- The list `res` is now specifically defined as the elements of `remaining_players` at the indices given by `qs`.
