Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 250, `k` and `q` are input integers where 1 ≤ k, q ≤ 100, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, `qs` is a list of q integers where 1 ≤ qs[i] ≤ 100, `results` is a list containing one string element which is the space-separated string representation of the elements in `res`, `remaining_players` is the result of `func_1(p)`, `res` is a list containing the elements of `remaining_players` at the indices specified by `qs`. `k` and `q` are updated to the values provided by the user input.**
