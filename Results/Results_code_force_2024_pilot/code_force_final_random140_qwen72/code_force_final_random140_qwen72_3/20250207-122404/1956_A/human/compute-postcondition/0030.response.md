To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop condition:

### Given State:
- `p` is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, where \(1 \leq p[i] \leq 100\).
- `max_n` is 100.
- `remaining_players` is a list of 101 zeros with `remaining_players[1]` set to 0 and `remaining_players[2]` set to 0.
- `n` is 3.
- `cur_n` is 3.

### Loop Condition:
```python
while cur_n >= min(p):
```

### Analysis:
- The loop will execute if `cur_n` is greater than or equal to the minimum value in the list `p`.
- The minimum value in `p` is `p[0]` because `p` is sorted in ascending order.
- For the loop to execute at least once, `cur_n` must be greater than or equal to `p[0]`.

### Current State:
- `cur_n` is 3.
- `p` is a list of distinct positive integers starting from at least 1 (since \(1 \leq p[i] \leq 100\)).

### Conclusion:
- Since `p` is sorted in ascending order and contains distinct positive integers, the smallest possible value for `p[0]` is 1.
- Therefore, `cur_n` being 3 is already greater than or equal to the minimum value in `p` (which is at least 1).

Since the current state already satisfies the loop condition, no adjustments are necessary.

### Final State:
State: **`p` is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, where 1 <= p[i] <= 100; `max_n` is 100; `remaining_players` is a list of 101 zeros with `remaining_players[1]` set to 0 and `remaining_players[2]` set to 0; `n` is 3; `cur_n` is 3**
