Output State: **t is an input integer between 1 and 250, k and q are positive integers where 1 ≤ k, q ≤ 100, p is a list of k unique integers in ascending order, where 1 ≤ p[i] ≤ 100, qs is a list of q integers, where 1 ≤ qs[i] ≤ 100, results is an empty list.** 

The code initializes an empty list called `results`. All other variables (`t`, `k`, `q`, `p`, `qs`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
