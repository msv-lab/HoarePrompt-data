Output State: **`p` is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, where 1 <= p[i] <= 100; `max_n` is 100; `remaining_players` is a list of 101 zeros with `remaining_players[1]` set to 0 and `remaining_players[2]` set to 0; `n` is 3; `cur_n` is 3 - `count`; `count` is the index of the first element in `p` that is greater than 3.** 

Explanation: The value of `cur_n` is decremented by the value of `count`. All other variables remain unchanged. The new value of `cur_n` is 3 minus the index of the first element in `p` that is greater than 3.
