You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 250. k and q are positive integers where 1 ≤ k, q ≤ 100, representing the length of the sequence a and the number of values n_i, respectively. p is a list of k unique integers in ascending order, where 1 ≤ p[i] ≤ 100. qs is a list of q integers, where 1 ≤ qs[i] ≤ 100.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        k, q = map(int, input().split())
        
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        qs = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        remaining_players = func_1(p)
        
        res = [remaining_players[n] for n in qs]
        
        results.append(' '.join(map(str, res)))
        
    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` is an input integer between 1 and 250, `k` and `q` are input integers where 1 ≤ k, q ≤ 100, `p` is a list of integers read from the input, `qs` is a list of integers read from the input, `results` is a list containing `t` string elements, each of which is the space-separated string representation of the elements in `res` for each iteration, `remaining_players` is the result of `func_1(p)` for the last iteration, `res` is a list containing the elements of `remaining_players` at the indices specified by `qs` for the last iteration.
    return results
    #The program returns a list `results` containing `t` string elements, where each element is a space-separated string representation of the elements in `res` for each iteration. Here, `t` is an input integer between 1 and 250, and `res` is a list containing the elements of `remaining_players` at the indices specified by `qs` for the last iteration. `remaining_players` is the result of `func_1(p)` for the last iteration, where `p` is a list of integers read from the input.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_2` does not explicitly accept any parameters but reads input values for `t`, `k`, `q`, `p`, and `qs`. It processes `t` test cases, where for each test case, it uses the lists `p` and `qs` to generate a list `res` of elements from `remaining_players` at the indices specified by `qs`. The final output is a list `results` containing `t` string elements, each a space-separated string representation of the elements in `res` for the corresponding test case.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list `results` containing `t` string elements, where each element is a space-separated string representation of the elements in `res` for each iteration. Here, `t` is an input integer between 1 and 250, and `res` is a list containing the elements of `remaining_players` at the indices specified by `qs` for the last iteration. `remaining_players` is the result of `func_1(p)` for the last iteration, where `p` is a list of integers read from the input.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
