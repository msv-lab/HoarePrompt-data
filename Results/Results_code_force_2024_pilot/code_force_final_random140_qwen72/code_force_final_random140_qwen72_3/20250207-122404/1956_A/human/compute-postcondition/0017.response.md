Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 249, `k` and `q` are input integers where 1 ≤ k, q ≤ 100, `p` is a list of integers read from the new input, `qs` is a list of integers read from the new input, `results` is a list containing two string elements: the first element is the space-separated string representation of the elements in `res`, and the second element is the same as the first element, `remaining_players` is the result of `func_1(p)`, `res` is a list containing the elements of `remaining_players` at the indices specified by `qs`. `k` and `q` are now updated to the values read from the input.**
