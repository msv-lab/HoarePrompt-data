Output State: **`p` is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, where 1 <= p[i] <= 100; `max_n` is 100; `remaining_players` is a list of 101 zeros with `remaining_players[1]` set to 0 and `remaining_players[2]` set to 0; `n` is 3; `cur_n` is 3 - 2*count; `count` is the index of the first element in `p` that is greater than `cur_n`; `count` is updated to the index of the first element in `p` that is greater than `3 - 2*count`.**

Explanation:
- The `bisect.bisect_right(p, cur_n)` function finds the index of the first element in `p` that is greater than `cur_n`.
- `cur_n` is initially calculated as `3 - 2*count`.
- `count` is updated to the index of the first element in `p` that is greater than `3 - 2*count`.
- All other variables (`p`, `max_n`, `remaining_players`, and `n`) remain unchanged.
