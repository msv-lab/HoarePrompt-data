Output State: **The program returns a list `remaining_players` of 101 integers, where each element `remaining_players[n]` (for 1 <= n <= 100) represents the largest value less than the minimum value in `p` after subtracting the count of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `n`. The first element of the list is not used (index 0), and the rest of the elements are computed based on the described logic.**
