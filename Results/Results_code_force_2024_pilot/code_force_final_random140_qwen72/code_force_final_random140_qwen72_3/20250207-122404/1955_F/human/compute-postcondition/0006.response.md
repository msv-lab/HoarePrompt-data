The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and the loop's execution depends on the value of `i` relative to the integer input provided by the user. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and the integer input provided by the user must be greater than 1.

State: **`i` is 2, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers provided by the user and each is greater than 0, the integer input provided by the user must be greater than 1**
