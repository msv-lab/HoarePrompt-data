The function `func` does not explicitly define any parameters in its signature. However, based on the given parameter constraints, it seems the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each involving four integers (`p_i`), where each `p_i` is within the range of 0 to 200, and the total number of test cases (`t`) is between 1 and 10,000.

Given the context, the function likely processes these test cases internally, but since the parameters are not directly passed to the function, they might be read from an external source (e.g., user input, file, etc.) within the function body.

The output of the function is not specified, so we cannot definitively state what it returns. However, based on typical programming patterns, the function might return a result or a list of results corresponding to each test case.
