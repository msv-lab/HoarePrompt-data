To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- Each of the four integers `p_i` in each test case is an integer where \(0 \leq p_i \leq 200\).

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The only variable in the loop head is `i`.
2. **Input Dependency**: The loop will execute based on the value provided by `int(input())`.
3. **Execution Condition**: For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be greater than 0.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
- The loop will iterate `int(input())` times.
- For the loop to execute at least once, `int(input())` must be greater than 0.
- The initial state of `i` is 0 (as it is the starting point of the `range` function).

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is 0.
- `int(input())` must be greater than 0.

### Final State:
State: **`i` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
