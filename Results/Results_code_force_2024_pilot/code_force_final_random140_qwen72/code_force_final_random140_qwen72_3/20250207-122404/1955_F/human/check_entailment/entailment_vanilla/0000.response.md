### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win the game.
   - Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all remaining numbers is zero.
   - Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all remaining numbers is non-zero.
   - Eve can remove numbers optimally to maximize Bob's wins.

2. **Bitwise XOR Properties:**
   - The XOR of a set of numbers is zero if and only if the number of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the set can be paired off such that each pair sums to zero in terms of their binary representation.
   - Specifically, the XOR of 1, 2, 3, and 4 are:
     - 1 (01 in binary)
     - 2 (10 in binary)
     - 3 (11 in binary)
     - 4 (100 in binary)

3. **Optimal Removal Strategy:**
   - To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should try to balance the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s such that the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero.
   - Removing pairs of numbers that sum to zero in terms of their binary representation helps achieve this.

4. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.
   - It calculates the number of pairs of each type that can be removed (`a // 2`, `b // 2`, `c // 2`, `d // 2`).
   - It adds an additional term to account for the case where the remaining counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s sum to 3, which ensures the XOR is zero.

5. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly calculates the maximum number of pairs that can be removed.
   - The additional term `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 3 == 3)` ensures that if the remaining counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s sum to 3, Bob wins one more time.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win the game. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
