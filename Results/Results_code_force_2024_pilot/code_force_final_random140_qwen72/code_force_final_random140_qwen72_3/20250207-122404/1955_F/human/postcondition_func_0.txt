The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, where `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`. For each test case, it reads four integers `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` (where `0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200`). It then calculates and prints the sum of the integer division of each of these numbers by 2, plus 1 if the sum of their remainders when divided by 2 and 3 respectively equals 3. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value.
