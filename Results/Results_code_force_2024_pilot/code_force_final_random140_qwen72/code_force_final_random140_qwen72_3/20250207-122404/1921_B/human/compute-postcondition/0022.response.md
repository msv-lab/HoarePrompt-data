The value of `a` is incremented by 1 if the character at index `i` (which is 0) in the string `s` is greater than the character at index `i` (which is 0) in the string `t`. Otherwise, `a` remains unchanged. The values of `n`, `i`, `s`, `t`, and `b` remain the same.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `s` is a new input string, `t` is a new input string, `a` is 0 or 1, `b` is 0**.
