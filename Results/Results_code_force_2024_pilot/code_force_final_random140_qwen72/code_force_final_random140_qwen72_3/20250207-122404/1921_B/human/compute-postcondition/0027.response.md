The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1 to become 2, and `n` must still be greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `s` is a new input string, `t` is a new input string, `a` is 0 or 1 if `s[1] <= t[1]` or `a` is 1 or 2 if `s[1] > t[1]`, `b` is 0, 1, or 2 depending on the comparison of the first and second characters of `s` and `t`.**
