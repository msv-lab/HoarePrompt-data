The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a placeholder for the loop variable, and the result of `int(input())`. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`.

For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must return a positive integer. This value represents the number of iterations the loop will perform, which corresponds to the number of test cases `t`.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, the input must be a positive integer, and since `t` is already defined as an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, the input should match this condition.

State: **`_` is a placeholder, `int(input())` must be a positive integer (1 ≤ int(input()) ≤ 10^4)**
