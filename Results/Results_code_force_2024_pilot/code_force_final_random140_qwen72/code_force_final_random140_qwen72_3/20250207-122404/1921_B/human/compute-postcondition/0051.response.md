Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the new input integer that must be greater than 2, `s1` is the new input string, `s2` is the new input string from the user, `i` is 2, `hd` is 2 if the first characters of `s1` and `s2` are the same and `s1[i]` equals `s2[i]`, otherwise `hd` is 3, and `res` is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in `s1` and `s2`.***
