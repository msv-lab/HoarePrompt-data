Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), the second line contains a string s of length n consisting of '0's and '1's, and the third line contains a string f of length n consisting of '0's and '1's. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s1 = input()
    s2 = input()
    hd = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if s1[i] != s2[i]:
            hd += 1
    res = abs(s1.count('1') - s2.count('1'))
    print(res + abs(hd - res) // 2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s1` and `s2` are input strings, `i` is `n-1`, `hd` is the number of positions where the characters in `s1` and `s2` differ, `res` is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in `s1` and `s2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is the new input integer, `s1` and `s2` are the new input strings, `i` is `n-1`, `hd` is the number of positions where the characters in `s1` and `s2` differ, and `res` is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in `s1` and `s2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is the new input integer, `s1` is the new input string, `s2` is the new input string from the user, `i` is `n-1`, `hd` is the number of positions where `s1` and `s2` differ, `res` is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in `s1` and `s2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
