Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `t` is an input string, `a` is the number of positions where `s[i] > t[i]` for 0 ≤ i < n, `b` is the number of positions where `s[i] < t[i]` for 0 ≤ i < n, `i` is n-1**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` is updated to the integer value provided by the user input.
- The values of `s`, `t`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state.
