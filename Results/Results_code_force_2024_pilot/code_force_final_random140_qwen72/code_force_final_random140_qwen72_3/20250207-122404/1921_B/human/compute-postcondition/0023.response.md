The value of `b` is incremented by 1 if the character at index `i` (which is 0) in string `s` is less than the character at index `i` (which is 0) in string `t`. Since `i` is 0, the comparison is between the first characters of `s` and `t`.

- If the first character of `s` is less than the first character of `t`, `b` becomes 1.
- If the first character of `s` is not less than the first character of `t`, `b` remains 0.

The values of `n`, `i`, `s`, `t`, and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `s` is a new input string, `t` is a new input string, `a` is 0 or 1, `b` is 1 if the first character of `s` is less than the first character of `t`, otherwise `b` is 0.**
