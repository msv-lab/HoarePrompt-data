Functionality: ** The function reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it reads the number of boxes `n`, the initial state of the boxes `s`, and the final state of the boxes `t`. It then calculates and prints the maximum number of positions where the characters in `s` are greater than those in `t` or less than those in `t`. The function does not return any value; instead, it directly prints the result for each test case. **
