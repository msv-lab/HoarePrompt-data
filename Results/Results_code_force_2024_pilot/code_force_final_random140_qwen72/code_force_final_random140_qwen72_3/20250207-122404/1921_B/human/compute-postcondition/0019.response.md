The code snippet `t = input()` updates the value of `t` to a new input string. The other variables (`n`, `s`, `a`, `b`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string, `t` is a new input string, `a` is the number of positions where `s[i] > t[i]` for 0 ≤ i < n, `b` is the number of positions where `s[i] < t[i]` for 0 ≤ i < n, `i` is n-1**.
