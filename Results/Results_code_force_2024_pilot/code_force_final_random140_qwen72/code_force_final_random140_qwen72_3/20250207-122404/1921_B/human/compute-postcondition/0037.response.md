To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the conditions within the loop head, which involves the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop `for i in range(n):` will execute if `n` is greater than 0. The initial state of `i` is set to `n-1`, but this is not relevant to the loop's ability to execute since `i` is redefined by the loop itself starting from 0.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments to ensure the loop executes are:
- `n` must be greater than 0.

The other variables (`s`, `t`, `a`, `b`) and the initial value of `i` (which is `n-1`) do not affect the loop's execution directly and thus do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
