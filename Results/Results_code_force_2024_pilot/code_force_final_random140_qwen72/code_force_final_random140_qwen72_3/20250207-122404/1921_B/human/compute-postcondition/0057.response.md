Functionality: ** The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a positive integer `n` and two strings `s1` and `s2` of length `n` containing only '0's and '1's. For each test case, it calculates and prints the sum of the absolute difference between the number of '1's in `s1` and `s2`, and half the difference between the Hamming distance (`hd`) and this absolute difference. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value. The final state of the program is that `t` is 0, `n` is the last input integer, `s1` and `s2` are the last input strings, `i` is `n-1`, and `hd` is the number of positions where the characters in `s1` and `s2` differ. **
