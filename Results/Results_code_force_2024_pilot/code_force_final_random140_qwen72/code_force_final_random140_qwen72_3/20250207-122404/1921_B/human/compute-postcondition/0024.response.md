The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1, and `n` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `s` is a new input string, `t` is a new input string, `a` is 0 or 1, `b` is 1 if the first character of `s` is less than the first character of `t`, otherwise `b` is 0**
