Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4).
- `s` is an input string of length `n`.
- `t` is another input string of length `n`.
- `a` is the number of positions where `s[i] > t[i]` for 0 ≤ i < n.
- `b` is the number of positions where `s[i] < t[i]` for 0 ≤ i < n.
- `i` is `n-1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(max(a, b))
```

### Explanation:
- The variable `a` counts the number of positions where the character in `s` is greater than the corresponding character in `t`.
- The variable `b` counts the number of positions where the character in `s` is less than the corresponding character in `t`.
- The `max(a, b)` function returns the larger of the two values, `a` and `b`.

### Output:
The `print(max(a, b))` statement will print the maximum of the two values `a` and `b`, where:
- `a` is the number of positions where `s[i] > t[i]` for 0 ≤ i < n.
- `b` is the number of positions where `s[i] < t[i]` for 0 ≤ i < n.

Since the exact values of `a` and `b` depend on the specific strings `s` and `t`, we cannot determine the exact numerical value without knowing the strings. However, the output will be the larger of the two counts.

Output: **max(a, b) (where a is the number of positions where s[i] > t[i] and b is the number of positions where s[i] < t[i] for 0 ≤ i < n)**
