The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` relative to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4), `s` is an input string, `t` is an input string, `a` is 1 if `s[0] > t[0]` else `a` is 0, `b` is 1 if `s[0] < t[0]` else `b` is 0, `i` is 1**
