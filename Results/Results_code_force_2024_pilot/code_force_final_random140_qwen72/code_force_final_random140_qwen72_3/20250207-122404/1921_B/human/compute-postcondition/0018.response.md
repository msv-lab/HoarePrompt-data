Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string, `t` is an input string, `a` is the number of positions where `s[i] > t[i]` for 0 ≤ i < n, `b` is the number of positions where `s[i] < t[i]` for 0 ≤ i < n, `i` is n-1**

Explanation: The value of `s` is updated to a new input string provided by the user. The values of `n`, `t`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged. The conditions for `a` and `b` are still valid based on the new value of `s` and the existing value of `t`.
