Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `n` remains unchanged after the loop.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `a` is the count of indices where `s[i]` is greater than `t[i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, n-1]`.
- `b` is the count of indices where `s[i]` is less than `t[i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, n-1]`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(max(a, b))
```

### Explanation:
- `a` and `b` are counts of specific conditions over the range `[0, n-1]`.
- `max(a, b)` will return the larger of the two counts.

### Output:
The `print(max(a, b))` statement will print the maximum value between `a` and `b`, where:
- `a` is the count of indices where `s[i]` is greater than `t[i]`.
- `b` is the count of indices where `s[i]` is less than `t[i]`.

Since the exact values of `a` and `b` depend on the specific strings `s` and `t`, we cannot determine the exact numerical value without knowing `s` and `t`. However, the print statement will output the maximum of these two counts.

Output: **max(a, b) (where a is the count of indices where s[i] > t[i] and b is the count of indices where s[i] < t[i])**
