### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to transform the initial state `s` to the final state `t` using the minimum number of operations.
   - The operations allowed are:
     - Adding a cat to an empty box.
     - Removing a cat from a box.
     - Moving a cat from one box to another.
   - The goal is to find the minimum number of operations required to achieve the final state `t`.

2. **Analyzing the Solution:**
   - The solution uses two counters `a` and `b`:
     - `a` counts the number of positions where `s[i] > t[i]`, which means there is a cat in `s` but not in `t`.
     - `b` counts the number of positions where `s[i] < t[i]`, which means there is no cat in `s` but there should be a cat in `t`.
   - The minimum number of operations required is the maximum of these two counts because:
     - To remove a cat (when `s[i] > t[i]`), we need one operation per such position.
     - To add a cat (when `s[i] < t[i]`), we need one operation per such position.
     - If the number of cats to be added is greater than the number of cats to be removed, we need to perform the maximum of these two operations.

3. **Verification:**
   - The logic correctly identifies the number of operations needed to transform `s` to `t`.
   - The use of `max(a, b)` ensures that we account for the maximum number of operations required, whether it is adding or removing cats.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The solution handles edge cases where `s` and `t` are identical (no operations needed).
   - It also handles cases where all operations are either additions or removals.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly solves the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:
