The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `num`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `num`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `num` must be greater than 0 for the loop to have executed at least once.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 (so `i` becomes 1), and `num` must still be greater than `i` (so `num` must be greater than 1).

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` is a positive integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for each test case, `num` must be greater than 1, `L1` is a list containing one integer input, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 1**
