Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` is a positive integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for each test case, `num` is a positive integer greater than 0, `L1` is a list containing `num` integers where `L1[0]` is at least 2, `i` is 0. If `L1[0]` is divisible by any integer `j` in the range [2, `L1[0]`], then `res` is a list containing one element which is `L1[0] // j * (j - 1)` where `j` is the smallest divisor of `L1[0]` greater than 1. Otherwise, `res` remains an empty list.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the range from 2 to `L1[0] + 1`.
- For each value of `j` in this range, it checks if `L1[0]` is divisible by `j`.
- If `L1[0]` is divisible by `j`, it appends the result of `L1[0] // j * (j - 1)` to the list `res` and breaks out of the loop.
- This means that `res` will contain at most one element, which is the result of the first successful division.
- If no such `j` exists (i.e., `L1[0]` is a prime number), `res` will remain an empty list.
- The variable `i` remains 0 because the loop only processes the first element of the list `L1`.
- The other variables (`t`, `x`, `num`, `L1`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
