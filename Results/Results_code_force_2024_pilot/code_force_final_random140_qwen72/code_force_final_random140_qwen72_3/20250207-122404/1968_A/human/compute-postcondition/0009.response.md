Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` is a positive integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for each test case, `num` is a positive integer, `L1` is a list containing `num` integers, `res` is an empty list, `i` is `num - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains a positive integer between 1 and 1000.
- The variable `x` remains a positive integer between 2 and 1000.
- The variable `num` is a positive integer, indicating the number of iterations the loop will execute.
- The list `L1` contains `num` integers, as each iteration appends one integer to `L1`.
- The list `res` remains empty, as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `i` is `num - 1`, which is the final value of `i` after the last iteration of the loop.
