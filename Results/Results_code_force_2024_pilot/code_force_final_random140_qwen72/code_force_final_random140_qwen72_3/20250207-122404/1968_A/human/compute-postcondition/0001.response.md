Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` is a positive integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for each test case, `num` is an input integer representing the number of entries, `L1` is an empty list.** 

The code initializes an empty list `L1`, while the values of `t`, `x`, and `num` remain unchanged from their initial states.
