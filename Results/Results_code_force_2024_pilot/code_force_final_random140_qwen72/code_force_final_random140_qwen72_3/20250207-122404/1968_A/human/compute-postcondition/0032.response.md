The code appends the result of the expression `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` to the list `res`. Given the initial conditions:

- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `x` is a positive integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for each test case.
- `num` is a positive integer greater than 0.
- `L1` is a list containing `num` integers where `L1[0]` is at least 2 and `L1[1]` is at least 3.
- `i` is 1.
- `res` is a list.
- If `L1[i]` (where `i` is 1) is divisible by `j` (the smallest divisor of `L1[0]` greater than 1), then `res` contains two elements: the first element is `L1[0] // j * (j - 1)` and the second element is `L1[1] // j * (j - 1)`.
- If `L1[i]` is not divisible by `j`, then `res` contains only the first element, which is `L1[0] // j * (j - 1)`.
- `j` is 3.

Given `i` is 1, the code will append `L1[1] // 3 * (3 - 1)` to `res`. Since `L1[1]` is at least 3, `L1[1] // 3` will be at least 1, and multiplying by 2 gives a non-zero value.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` is a positive integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for each test case, `num` is a positive integer greater than 0, `L1` is a list containing `num` integers where `L1[0]` is at least 2 and `L1[1]` is at least 3, `i` is 1, `res` is a list containing the value `L1[1] // 3 * 2`, `j` is 3.**
