Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` is a positive integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for each test case, `num` must be greater than 0, `L1` is a list containing one integer input, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 0.** 

The code appends an integer input to the list `L1`. The input is prompted with a message indicating the entry number, which is `1` since `i` is `0`. The other variables remain unchanged.
