Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` is a positive integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for each test case, `num` is a positive integer greater than 0, `L1` is a list containing `num` integers where `L1[0]` is at least 2 and `L1[1]` is at least 3, `i` is 1, `res` is a list containing the value `L1[1] // 3 * 2`, `j` is 3, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
