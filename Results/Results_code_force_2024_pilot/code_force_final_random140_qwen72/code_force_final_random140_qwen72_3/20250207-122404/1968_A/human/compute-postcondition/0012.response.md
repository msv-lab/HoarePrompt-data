Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` is a positive integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for each test case, `num` is a positive integer greater than 0, `L1` is a list containing `num` integers where `L1[0]` is at least 2, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 0, and the current value of `L1[i]` is divisible by `j`.**
