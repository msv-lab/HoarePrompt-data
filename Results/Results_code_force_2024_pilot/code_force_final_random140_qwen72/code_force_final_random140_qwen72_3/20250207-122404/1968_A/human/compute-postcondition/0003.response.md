The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `num`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `num`. If `num` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `i` is initialized by the loop itself, starting from 0.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `num` must be greater than 0. The initial state of `t`, `x`, `L1`, and `res` does not affect the loop's ability to execute, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` is a positive integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for each test case, `num` must be greater than 0, `L1` is an empty list, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
