The code appends a new integer input to the list `L1`. The user is prompted to enter an entry number which is `i + 1`. Since `i` is initially 1, the prompt asks for "Enter entry no.2- ". After the user inputs a value, this value (converted to an integer) is appended to `L1`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` is a positive integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for each test case, `num` must be greater than 1, `L1` is a list containing two integers, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 1**.
