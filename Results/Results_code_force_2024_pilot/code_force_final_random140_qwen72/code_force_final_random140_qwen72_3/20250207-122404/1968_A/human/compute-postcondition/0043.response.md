The code snippet `res.append(L1[i] // j * (j - 1))` appends a new element to the list `res`. This element is calculated as the integer division of `L1[i]` by `j`, multiplied by `(j - 1)`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000
- `x` is a positive integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for each test case
- `num` is a positive integer greater than 2
- `L1` is a list containing `num` integers where `L1[0]` is at least 2, `L1[1]` is at least 2, and `L1[2]` is at least 2
- `i` is 2
- `res` is a list
- The current value of `L1[i]` is divisible by `j`

Let's break down the impact of the code:

1. `L1[i]` is the third element of the list `L1` (since `i` is 2).
2. `L1[i] // j` performs integer division of `L1[i]` by `j`.
3. `(j - 1)` is the value of `j` minus 1.
4. The result of `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` is appended to the list `res`.

Since `L1[i]` is divisible by `j`, `L1[i] // j` will be an integer, and the result of the multiplication `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` will also be an integer.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000
- `x` is a positive integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for each test case
- `num` is a positive integer greater than 2
- `L1` is a list containing `num` integers where `L1[0]` is at least 2, `L1[1]` is at least 2, and `L1[2]` is at least 2
- `i` is 2
- `res` is a list with one additional element, which is the result of `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`
- The current value of `L1[i]` is divisible by `j`

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` is a positive integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for each test case, `num` is a positive integer greater than 2, `L1` is a list containing `num` integers where `L1[0]` is at least 2, `L1[1]` is at least 2, and `L1[2]` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `res` is a list with one additional element equal to `L1[2] // j * (j - 1)`, and the current value of `L1[2]` is divisible by `j`.**
