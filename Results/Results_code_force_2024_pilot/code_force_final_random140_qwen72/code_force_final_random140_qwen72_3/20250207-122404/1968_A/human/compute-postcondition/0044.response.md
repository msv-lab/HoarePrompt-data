Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` is a positive integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for each test case, `num` is a positive integer greater than 2, `L1` is a list containing `num` integers where `L1[0]` is at least 2, `L1[1]` is at least 2, and `L1[2]` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `res` is a list with one additional element equal to `L1[2] // j * (j - 1)`, and the current value of `L1[2]` is divisible by `j`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
