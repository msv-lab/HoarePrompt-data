Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` is a positive integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for each test case, `num` is a positive integer greater than 0, `L1` is a list containing `num` integers where `L1[0]` is at least 2 and `L1[1]` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `res` is a list. If `L1[i]` (where `i` is 1) is divisible by `j` (the smallest divisor of `L1[0]` greater than 1), then `res` contains two elements: the first element is `L1[0] // j * (j - 1)` and the second element is `L1[1] // j * (j - 1)`. If `L1[i]` is not divisible by `j`, then `res` contains only the first element, which is `L1[0] // j * (j - 1)`.***
