Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` is a positive integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for each test case, `num` is a positive integer greater than 2, `L1` is a list containing `num` integers where `L1[0]` is at least 2, `L1[1]` is at least 2, and `L1[2]` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `j` is `k + 2` where `k` is the last value of `j`, and `res` is a list. If `L1[2]` is divisible by `j`, `res` has one additional element equal to `L1[2] // j * (j - 1)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.***
