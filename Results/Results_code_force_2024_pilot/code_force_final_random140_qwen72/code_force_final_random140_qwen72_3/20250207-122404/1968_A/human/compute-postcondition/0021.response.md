The given code snippet appends the result of `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` to the list `res`.

Let's break down the impact of this code:

- `res` initially contains one element if `L1[i]` is divisible by `j`, otherwise, it is an empty list.
- The operation `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` is performed and the result is appended to `res`.
- Since `L1[i]` is at least `j + 1`, and `j` is `j + 1`, `L1[i]` is always greater than or equal to `j`, ensuring that `L1[i] // j` is at least 1.
- The expression `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` calculates the integer division of `L1[i]` by `j`, then multiplies the result by `(j - 1)`.
- This new value is appended to `res`.

Given the initial conditions:
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `x` is a positive integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for each test case.
- `num` is a positive integer greater than 0.
- `L1` is a list containing `num` integers where `L1[0]` is at least 2.
- `i` is 0.
- `j` is `j + 1`.
- `L1[i]` is at least `j + 1`.
- If `L1[i]` is divisible by `j`, then `res` is a list containing one element which is `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`. Otherwise, `res` remains an empty list.

After executing the code snippet:
- `res` now contains one additional element, which is the result of `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`.
- All other variables (`t`, `x`, `num`, `L1`, `i`, `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` is a positive integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for each test case, `num` is a positive integer greater than 0, `L1` is a list containing `num` integers where `L1[0]` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `j` is `j + 1`, `L1[i]` is at least `j + 1`, `res` is a list containing one additional element which is `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`**.
