To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for j in range(2, L1[i] + 1):
```

The loop head involves the following variables:
- `j`: This is the loop variable that will iterate from 2 to `L1[i] + 1`.
- `L1[i]`: This is the upper bound for the loop, which depends on the value of `L1` at index `i`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `x` is a positive integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for each test case.
- `num` is a positive integer greater than 2.
- `L1` is a list containing `num` integers where `L1[0]` is at least 2 and `L1[1]` is at least 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `res` is a list.

For the loop to execute, the following conditions must be met:
- `L1[i]` must be at least 2, because the loop iterates from 2 to `L1[i] + 1`. If `L1[i]` is less than 2, the loop will not execute.

Since `i` is 2, we need to ensure that `L1[2]` is at least 2. The other variables (`t`, `x`, `num`, and `res`) are not directly involved in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `L1[2]` to ensure it is at least 2.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` is a positive integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for each test case, `num` is a positive integer greater than 2, `L1` is a list containing `num` integers where `L1[0]` is at least 2, `L1[1]` is at least 2, and `L1[2]` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `res` is a list.**
