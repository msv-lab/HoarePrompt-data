Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` is a positive integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for each test case, `num` must be greater than 2, `L1` is a list containing three integers, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 2.**

Explanation: The code appends a new integer to the list `L1`, which was initially a list containing two integers. The new integer is obtained from user input and is appended to `L1`. The other variables (`t`, `x`, `num`, `res`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
