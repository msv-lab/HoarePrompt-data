To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for j in range(2, L1[i] + 1):
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - `j`: This is the loop variable that will iterate over the range.
   - `L1[i]`: This is the upper bound of the range, which depends on the value of `L1` at index `i`.

2. **Conditions for the Loop to Execute:**
   - The loop will execute if the range `range(2, L1[i] + 1)` is non-empty.
   - For the range to be non-empty, `L1[i] + 1` must be greater than 2, which means `L1[i]` must be at least 2.

3. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
   - `x` is a positive integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for each test case.
   - `num` is a positive integer greater than 0.
   - `L1` is a list containing `num` integers.
   - `res` is an empty list.
   - `i` is 0.

4. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - To ensure the loop executes, `L1[i]` must be at least 2.
   - Since `i` is 0, we need to ensure that `L1[0]` is at least 2.
   - The other variables (`t`, `x`, `num`, `res`) are not directly involved in the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` is a positive integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for each test case, `num` is a positive integer greater than 0, `L1` is a list containing `num` integers where `L1[0]` is at least 2, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
