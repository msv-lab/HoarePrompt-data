The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `num`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `num`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `num` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 (so `i` becomes 2), and `num` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` is a positive integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for each test case, `num` must be greater than 2, `L1` is a list containing two integers, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 2**
