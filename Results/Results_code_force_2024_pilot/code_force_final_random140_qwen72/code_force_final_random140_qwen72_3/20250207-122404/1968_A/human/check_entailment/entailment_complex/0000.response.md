Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles the input by reading the number of test cases (`num`) and then reading each test case (`L1[i]`).

2. **Logic for Finding y**:
   - The program iterates over each test case and tries to find the smallest divisor `j` of `L1[i]` greater than 1.
   - Once it finds such a divisor, it calculates `y` as `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` and appends it to the result list `res`.
   - This logic is based on the observation that for a given `x`, the value of `y` that maximizes `\gcd(x, y) + y` is often related to the smallest divisor of `x` greater than 1.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `L1[i]` is a prime number, the smallest divisor greater than 1 is `L1[i]` itself. In this case, the program will append `L1[i] // L1[i] * (L1[i] - 1)`, which simplifies to `L1[i] - 1`. This is a valid and optimal solution because for a prime `x`, the greatest possible value of `\gcd(x, y) + y` is achieved when `y = x - 1`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program correctly prints each value in the result list `res` on a new line, which matches the expected output format.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
