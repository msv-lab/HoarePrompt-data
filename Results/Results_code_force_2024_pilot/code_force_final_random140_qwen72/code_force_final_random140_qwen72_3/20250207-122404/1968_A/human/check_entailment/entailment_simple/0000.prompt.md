Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) â€” the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

Example

Input

    7
    
    10
    
    7
    
    21
    
    100
    
    2
    
    1000
    
    6

Output

    5
    6
    18
    98
    1
    750

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and x is a positive integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for each test case.
def func():
    num = int(input('Enter number of entries- '))
    L1 = []
    res = []
    for i in range(num):
        L1.append(int(input('Enter entry no.' + str(i + 1) + '- ')))
        
    #State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` is a positive integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for each test case, `num` is a positive integer, `L1` is a list containing `num` integers, `res` is an empty list, `i` is `num - 1`.
    for i in range(num):
        for j in range(2, L1[i] + 1):
            if L1[i] % j == 0:
                res.append(L1[i] // j * (j - 1))
                break
        
    #State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` is a positive integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000 for each test case, `num` is a positive integer, `L1` is a list containing `num` integers, `i` is `num - 1`, `res` is a list. For each integer `L1[i]` (where `i` ranges from 0 to `num - 1`), if `L1[i]` is divisible by any integer `j` in the range [2, `L1[i]`], then `res` contains the value `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` for the smallest such `j`. If `L1[i]` is a prime number, `res` remains unchanged from its previous state.
    print(*res, sep='\n')
    #This is printed: 5
    #10
    #14
