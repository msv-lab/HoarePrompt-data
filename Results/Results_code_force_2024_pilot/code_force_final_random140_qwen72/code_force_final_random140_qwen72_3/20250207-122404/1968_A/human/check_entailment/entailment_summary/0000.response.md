Reasoning:

The provided program aims to solve the problem of finding an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \le y < x \)) such that \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized. The program follows these steps:

1. **Input Handling**: It reads the number of test cases and then reads each test case.
2. **Finding the Smallest Divisor**: For each test case, it finds the smallest divisor of \( x \) greater than 1.
3. **Calculating the Result**: It calculates \( y \) using the formula \( y = \frac{x}{d} \times (d - 1) \), where \( d \) is the smallest divisor of \( x \).
4. **Output**: It prints the calculated \( y \) for each test case.

### Analysis:
- **Smallest Divisor Calculation**: The program correctly identifies the smallest divisor \( d \) of \( x \) greater than 1. This is done by iterating from 2 to \( x \) and checking divisibility.
- **Formula for \( y \)**: The formula \( y = \frac{x}{d} \times (d - 1) \) is used to maximize \( \gcd(x, y) + y \). This formula works because:
  - \( \gcd(x, y) \) will be \( d \) when \( y = \frac{x}{d} \times (d - 1) \).
  - \( y \) itself is maximized by choosing the largest possible \( y \) that is a multiple of \( d - 1 \).

### Verification:
- **Example Test Cases**:
  - For \( x = 10 \), the smallest divisor \( d \) is 2. So, \( y = \frac{10}{2} \times (2 - 1) = 5 \). \( \gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10 \).
  - For \( x = 7 \), the smallest divisor \( d \) is 7. So, \( y = \frac{7}{7} \times (7 - 1) = 6 \). \( \gcd(7, 6) + 6 = 1 + 6 = 7 \).
  - For \( x = 21 \), the smallest divisor \( d \) is 3. So, \( y = \frac{21}{3} \times (3 - 1) = 14 \). \( \gcd(21, 14) + 14 = 7 + 14 = 21 \).

The program correctly handles the input and output as specified in the problem description. It also produces the correct results for the given examples.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
