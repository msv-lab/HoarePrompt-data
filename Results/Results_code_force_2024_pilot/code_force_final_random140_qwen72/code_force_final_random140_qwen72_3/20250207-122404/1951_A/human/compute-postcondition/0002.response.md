The only variable in the loop head is `_` and the input integer `t`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be initialized to a specific value before the loop starts.

State: **start and end are integers where start <= end, t must be greater than 0, results is an empty list**
