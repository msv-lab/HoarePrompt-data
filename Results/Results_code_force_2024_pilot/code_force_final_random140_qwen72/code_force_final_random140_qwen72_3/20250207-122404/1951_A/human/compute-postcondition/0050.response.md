To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the conditions involving the objects in the loop head, which are `r` and `results`.

1. **`results`**: For the loop to execute, `results` must be a non-empty list. This is because the loop iterates over the elements of `results`, and if `results` is empty, the loop will not execute.

2. **`r`**: `r` is the variable that will hold each element of `results` during each iteration of the loop. It does not need to be explicitly initialized before the loop, as it will be set by the loop itself.

Given the initial state:
- `start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`.
- `t` is an integer representing the total number of iterations.
- `results` is a list containing `t` elements, each determined based on the input `arr`.

To ensure the loop executes, `results` must contain at least one element. The other variables (`start`, `end`, `t`, and `arr`) do not directly affect the loop's ability to execute, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted to ensure `results` is non-empty:

State: **`results` is a list containing at least one element, `r` is the first element in `results`**.
