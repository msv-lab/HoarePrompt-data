Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: start and end are integers where start <= end, and they represent the range of folder names to be processed. The current directory contains subfolders, some of which may contain .html files. t is an input integer. results is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = input()
    count_ones = arr.count('1')
    if count_ones == 0:
        results.append('yes')
    elif count_ones % 2 != 0:
        results.append('no')
    elif count_ones == 2:
        if '11' in arr:
            results.append('no')
        else:
            results.append('yes')
    else:
        results.append('yes')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0, `results` is a list, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is an input string, and `count_ones` is the number of '1's in `arr`. If `count_ones` is 0, `results` contains `['yes']`. If `count_ones` is greater than 0, and if `count_ones` is odd, `results` contains `['no']`. If `count_ones` is even and equal to 2, `results` contains `['no']` if the substring '11' is present in `arr`, otherwise `results` contains `['yes']`. If `count_ones` is even and not 2, `results` contains `['yes']`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a new input string, `count_ones` is the number of '1's in `arr`. If `count_ones` is 0, `results` contains `['yes', 'yes']` if the if condition is true, otherwise `results` contains `['yes', 'no']`. If `count_ones` is greater than 0 and odd, `results` contains `['no', 'yes']` if the if condition is true, otherwise `results` contains `['no', 'no']`. If `count_ones` is even and equal to 2, `results` contains `['no', 'yes']` if the substring '11' is present in the new `arr` and the if condition is true, otherwise `results` contains `['no', 'no']` if the substring '11' is present and the if condition is false, or `['yes', 'yes']` if the substring '11' is not present and the if condition is true, or `['yes', 'no']` if the substring '11' is not present and the if condition is false. If `count_ones` is even and not 2, `results` contains `['yes', 'yes']` if the if condition is true, otherwise `results` contains `['yes', 'no']`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a new input string, `count_ones` is the number of '1's in the new `arr`, and `results` remains unchanged initially. If `count_ones` is 0, `results` now contains one additional element 'yes'. If `count_ones` is odd, the additional element is 'no'. If `count_ones` is even and equals 2, the additional element is 'no' if '11' is in `arr`, otherwise it is 'yes'. If `count_ones` is even and not 2, the additional element is 'yes'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
