Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`, `t` is an integer representing the total number of iterations, `results` is a list containing `t` elements. Each element in `results` is determined based on the input `arr` for each iteration: if `arr` contains no '1's, the element is 'yes'; if `arr` contains an odd number of '1's, the element is 'no'; if `arr` contains exactly two '1's and the substring '11' is present, the element is 'no'; otherwise, if `arr` contains exactly two '1's but the substring '11' is not present, the element is 'yes'; if `arr` contains an even number of '1's greater than 2, the element is 'yes'.
Code of the loop:
for r in results:
    print(r)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `results` is a list containing at least one element, `r` is the first element in `results`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `results` is a list containing at least two elements, `r` is the second element in `results`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `results` is a list containing at least three elements, `r` is the third element in `results`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
