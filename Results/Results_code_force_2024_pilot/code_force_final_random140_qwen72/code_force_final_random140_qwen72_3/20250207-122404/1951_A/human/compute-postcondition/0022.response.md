Postcondition: ***`start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0, `results` is a list, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is an input string, and `count_ones` is the number of '1's in `arr`. If `count_ones` is 0, `results` contains `['yes']`. If `count_ones` is greater than 0, and if `count_ones` is odd, `results` contains `['no']`. If `count_ones` is even and equal to 2, `results` contains `['no']` if the substring '11' is present in `arr`, otherwise `results` contains `['yes']`. If `count_ones` is even and not 2, `results` contains `['yes']`.***
