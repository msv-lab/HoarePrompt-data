Initial State: `results` is a list containing at least two elements, `r` is the second element in `results`.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. The `results` list is given to contain at least two elements.
2. The variable `r` is assigned the value of the second element in the `results` list.
3. The `print(r)` statement will print the value of `r`, which is the second element in the `results` list.

Since the exact values of the elements in the `results` list are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the second element of the list.

Output: **r (where r is the second element in the results list)**
