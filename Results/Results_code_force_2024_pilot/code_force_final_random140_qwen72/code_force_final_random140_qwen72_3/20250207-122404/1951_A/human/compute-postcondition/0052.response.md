The only objects in the loop head are the variable `r` and the list `results`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `results`. If `results` has at least two elements, the loop can execute again for the second element. At the end of the last iteration, `results` contains at least one element, and `r` is the first element in `results`. For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must have at least two elements, and `r` will be the second element in `results`.

State: **`results` is a list containing at least two elements, `r` is the second element in `results`**
