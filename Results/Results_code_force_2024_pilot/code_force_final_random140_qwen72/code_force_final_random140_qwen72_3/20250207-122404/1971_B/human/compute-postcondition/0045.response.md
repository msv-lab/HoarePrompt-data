Let's analyze the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
2. `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
3. `cnt_test_cases` must be greater than the length of `string`.
4. `i` is the length of the new `string`.
5. `string` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.
6. `m` is the first character of the new `string`.
7. `k` is the number of occurrences of `m` in the new `string`.
8. The length of the new `string` is 1, and all characters in the new `string` are the same as the first character `m`, or the length of the new `string` is greater than 1, and `k` is not equal to the length of the new `string`.
9. Additionally, `k` is not equal to the length of the new `string`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Yes')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement simply prints the string `'Yes'`.
- The initial state provides conditions and variables, but none of these conditions affect the execution of the `print` statement directly.
- The `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print the string `'Yes'` regardless of the values of the variables or the conditions described in the initial state.

Output: **Yes**
