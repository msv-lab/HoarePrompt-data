Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
- `cnt_test_cases` must be greater than the length of `string`.
- `i` is the length of the new `string`.
- `string` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.
- `m` is the first character of the new `string`.
- `k` is the number of occurrences of `m` in the new `string`.
- The length of the new `string` is 1, and all characters in the new `string` are the same as the first character `m`, or the length of the new `string` is greater than 1, and `k` is not equal to the length of the new `string`.
- Additionally, `k` is not equal to the length of the new `string`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(''.join(sorted(string)))
```

### Analysis:
1. **String Stripping**: The `string` is the input string `s` stripped of leading and trailing whitespace. This means `string` contains only the non-whitespace characters from `s`.

2. **Character Count**: `m` is the first character of the new `string`, and `k` is the number of occurrences of `m` in the new `string`.

3. **String Length Conditions**:
   - If the length of the new `string` is 1, then all characters in the new `string` are the same as `m`.
   - If the length of the new `string` is greater than 1, then `k` is not equal to the length of the new `string`.

4. **Sorting and Joining**: The `print` statement sorts the characters in the new `string` and joins them into a single string.

### Possible Scenarios:
- **Length 1**: If the length of the new `string` is 1, then `string` consists of a single character `m`. Sorting a single character does not change it.
- **Length > 1**: If the length of the new `string` is greater than 1, then `k` is not equal to the length of the new `string`. This means there are other characters in the string besides `m`.

### Conclusion:
- If the length of the new `string` is 1, the output will be the single character `m`.
- If the length of the new `string` is greater than 1, the output will be the sorted version of the new `string`.

Given the conditions, the new `string` is either a single character repeated or a string with multiple characters where the first character `m` appears fewer times than the length of the string.

### Final Output:
Output: **sorted(string) (where string is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace and sorted alphabetically)**

For example:
- If `string` is "a", the output will be "a".
- If `string` is "bca", the output will be "abc".
