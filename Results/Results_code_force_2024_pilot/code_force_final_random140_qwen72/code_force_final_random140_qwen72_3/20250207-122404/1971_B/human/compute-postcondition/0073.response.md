Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where `1 <= t <= 1000`. For each test case, it reads a string `s` of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters. It then checks if the string contains only one unique character. If so, it prints 'No'. If the string contains more than one unique character, it prints 'Yes' followed by the sorted version of the string. After processing all test cases, the function has no return value, but it has printed the results for each test case. The final state of the program includes the processed number of test cases and the printed results for each test case. **
