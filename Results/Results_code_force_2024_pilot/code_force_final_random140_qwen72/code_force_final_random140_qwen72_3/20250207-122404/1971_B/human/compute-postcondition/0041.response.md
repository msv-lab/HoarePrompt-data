Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `cnt_test_cases` must be greater than the length of `string`, `i` is the length of the new `string`, `string` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `m` is the first character of the new `string`, `k` is the number of occurrences of `m` in the new `string`. If the length of the new `string` is 1, then all characters in the new `string` are the same as the first character `m`. Otherwise, if the length of the new `string` is greater than 1, `k` is not equal to the length of the new `string`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `i` will be equal to the length of the new `string` after the loop completes, as the loop iterates over each character in the string.
- The variable `k` will count the number of times the first character `m` appears in the string.
- The other variables (`t`, `s`, `cnt_test_cases`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
