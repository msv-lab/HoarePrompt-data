Based on the initial state and the provided Python code snippet, let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
   - `cnt_test_cases` must be greater than the length of the new `string` + 1.
   - `i` is `len(string) + 1`.
   - `string` is the input string `s` stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.
   - `m` is the first character of the new `string`.
   - `k` is the number of occurrences of `m` in the new `string`.
   - If the length of the new `string` is 1, all characters in the new `string` are the same as the first character `m`.
   - Otherwise, if the length of the new `string` is greater than 1, `k` is not equal to the length of the new `string`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print('No')
   ```

3. **Analysis**:
   - The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'No'`.
   - The conditions and variables described in the initial state do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the `print` statement does not reference any of these variables or conditions.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The `print` statement will always output the string `'No'` regardless of the values of the variables or the conditions described in the initial state.

Output: **No**
