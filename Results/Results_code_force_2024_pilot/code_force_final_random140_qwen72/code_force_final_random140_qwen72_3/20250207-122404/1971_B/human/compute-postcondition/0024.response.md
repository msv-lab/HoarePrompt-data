Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `cnt_test_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is the length of `string` - 1, `string` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `m` is the first character of `string`, and `k` is the number of times the first character `m` appears in `string`. If `k` is equal to the length of `string`, all characters in `string` are the same as the first character `m`. Otherwise, `k` is not equal to the length of `string`.***
