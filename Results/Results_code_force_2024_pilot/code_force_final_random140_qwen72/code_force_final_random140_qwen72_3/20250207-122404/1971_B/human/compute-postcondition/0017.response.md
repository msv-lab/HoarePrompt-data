Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `cnt_test_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `string` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace and must have at least 3 characters, `m` is the first character of `string`. If `string[i]` is equal to `m`, then `k` is 3. Otherwise, `k` is 1.***
