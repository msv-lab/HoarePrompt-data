Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
- `cnt_test_cases` must be greater than the length of the new `string` + 1.
- `i` is `len(string)`.
- `string` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.
- `m` is the first character of the new `string`.
- `k` is the number of times the first character `m` appears in the new `string`.
- `k` is not equal to the length of the new `string`.

Given these conditions, the `print` statement is simply:

```python
print('Yes')
```

This statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state. It will always print the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
