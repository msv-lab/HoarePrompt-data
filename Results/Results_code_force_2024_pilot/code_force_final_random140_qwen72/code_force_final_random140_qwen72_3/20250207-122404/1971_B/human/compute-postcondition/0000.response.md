The code snippet `cnt_test_cases = int(input())` reads an integer from the user input and assigns it to the variable `cnt_test_cases`. This operation does not affect the initial state of `t` or the description of `s`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters. `cnt_test_cases` is an input integer.**
