Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `cnt_test_cases` is the total number of test cases processed, `i` is the final value of the loop counter which is equal to `cnt_test_cases`, `string` is the last input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `m` is the first character of the last `string`, and `k` is the number of times the first character `m` appears in the last `string`. If `k` equals the length of the last `string`, all characters in the last `string` are the same as the first character `m`. Otherwise, `k` is not equal to the length of the last `string`.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop have completed:
- The variable `t` remains within its specified range.
- Each `s` was a string of up to 10 lowercase English letters.
- The loop has run exactly `cnt_test_cases` times.
- The loop counter `i` is now equal to `cnt_test_cases`.
- The last `string` processed is the input string from the last iteration, stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace.
- `m` is the first character of this last `string`.
- `k` is the count of how many times `m` appears in the last `string`.
- If all characters in the last `string` are the same as `m`, then `k` is equal to the length of the last `string`. Otherwise, `k` is less than the length of the last `string`.
