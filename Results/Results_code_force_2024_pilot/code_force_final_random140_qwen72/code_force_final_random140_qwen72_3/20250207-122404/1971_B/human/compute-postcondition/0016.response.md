The value of `k` is incremented by 1. Initially, `k` is either 0 or 2 based on whether `string[i]` is equal to `m` or not. After the increment, `k` will be 1 if it was initially 0, or 3 if it was initially 2. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `cnt_test_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `string` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace and must have at least 3 characters, `m` is the first character of `string`, `k` is 1 if `string[i]` is not equal to `m`, otherwise `k` is 3.**
