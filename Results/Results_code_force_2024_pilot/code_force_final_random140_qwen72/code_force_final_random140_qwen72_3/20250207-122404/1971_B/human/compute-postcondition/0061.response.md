To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
- `cnt_test_cases` must be greater than the length of the new `string` + 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `string` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace and must have at least two characters.
- `m` is the first character of the new `string`.
- If the first character of `string` (at index `i`) is equal to `m`, then `k` is 1. Otherwise, `k` remains 0.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(len(string)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the indices of the `string`.
- The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than the length of `string`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The variables in the loop head are `i` and `string`.

2. **Determine the Next State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - The length of `string` must remain the same for the loop to continue.

3. **Adjust the States:**
   - Increment `i` by 1: `i` becomes 2.
   - The length of `string` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute again.

### Final State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
- `cnt_test_cases` must be greater than the length of the new `string` + 1.
- `i` is 2.
- `string` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace and must have at least two characters.
- `m` is the first character of the new `string`.
- If the first character of `string` (at index `i`) is equal to `m`, then `k` is 1. Otherwise, `k` remains 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `cnt_test_cases` must be greater than the length of the new `string` + 1, `i` is 2, `string` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace and must have at least two characters, `m` is the first character of the new `string`. If the first character of `string` (at index `i`) is equal to `m`, then `k` is 1. Otherwise, `k` remains 0.**
