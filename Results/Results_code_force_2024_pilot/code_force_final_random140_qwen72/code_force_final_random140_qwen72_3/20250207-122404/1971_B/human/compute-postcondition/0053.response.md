Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `cnt_test_cases` must be greater than the length of the new `string` + 1, `i` is `len(string) + 1`, `string` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `m` is the first character of the new `string`, `k` is 0. If the length of the new `string` is 1, all characters in the new `string` are the same as the first character `m`. If the length of the new `string` is greater than 1, `k` is not equal to the length of the new `string`.**
