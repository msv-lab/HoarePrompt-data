Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
- `cnt_test_cases` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is the length of `string` - 1.
- `string` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.
- `m` is the first character of `string`.
- `k` is the number of times the first character `m` appears in `string`.
- `k` is not equal to the length of `string`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(''.join(sorted(string)))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **String Stripping**: The variable `string` is the input string `s` after stripping leading and trailing whitespace. Since `s` is already described as a string of lowercase English letters, this operation does not change the content of `s` if it already has no leading or trailing whitespace.

2. **Sorting the String**: The `sorted(string)` function returns a list of characters from `string` in lexicographical (alphabetical) order. For example, if `string` is "cba", `sorted(string)` will return `['a', 'b', 'c']`.

3. **Joining the Sorted Characters**: The `''.join(sorted(string))` function joins the sorted list of characters back into a single string. Continuing the previous example, `''.join(['a', 'b', 'c'])` will result in the string "abc".

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the sorted version of the string `string`.

### Example:
- If `string` is "cba", the output will be "abc".
- If `string` is "dcba", the output will be "abcd".

### General Description:
The output will be the string `string` with its characters sorted in alphabetical order.

Output: **the sorted version of the string `string` (where `string` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace)**
