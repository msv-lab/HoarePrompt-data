Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, s is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
def func():
    cnt_test_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(cnt_test_cases):
        string = input().strip()
        
        if len(string) == 1:
            print('No')
        
        m = string[0]
        
        k = 0
        
        for i in range(len(string)):
            if string[i] == m:
                k += 1
        
        if k == len(string):
            print('No')
        else:
            print('Yes')
            print(''.join(sorted(string)))
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `cnt_test_cases` is the total number of test cases processed, `i` is the final value of the loop counter which is equal to `cnt_test_cases`, `string` is the last input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `m` is the first character of the last `string`, and `k` is the number of times the first character `m` appears in the last `string`. If `k` equals the length of the last `string`, all characters in the last `string` are the same as the first character `m`. Otherwise, `k` is not equal to the length of the last `string`.
