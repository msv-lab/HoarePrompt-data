Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The given program does not always produce a valid rearranged string `r` that is different from the original string `s`. The program checks if all characters in the string are the same and prints "No" if they are, which is correct. However, when it prints "Yes" and outputs a sorted version of the string, it may still produce a string that is equal to the original string `s`.

For example, consider the input string "ab":
- The program will sort this to "ab", which is the same as the original string, thus failing the requirement that the rearranged string must be different from the original.

To fix this, the program should ensure that the rearranged string is different from the original string. One way to do this is to swap the first two characters if they are different, or find a character that is different from the first character and place it at the beginning.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    cnt_test_cases = int(input())
    for _ in range(cnt_test_cases):
        string = input().strip()
        if len(string) == 1:
            print('No')
        elif len(set(string)) == 1:
            print('No')
        else:
            print('Yes')
            # Find a different character and swap it with the first character
            for i in range(1, len(string)):
                if string[i] != string[0]:
                    string = string[:i] + string[0] + string[i+1:] + string[1:i] + string[i+1:]
                    break
            print(string)
```

This version ensures that the rearranged string is different from the original string by swapping the first character with a different character found later in the string. If no such character exists, it correctly outputs "No".
