You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program:
def func():
    cnt_test_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(cnt_test_cases):
        string = input().strip()
        if len(string) == 1:
            print('No')
        m = string[0]
        k = 0
        for i in range(len(string)):
            if string[i] == m:
                k += 1
        if k == len(string):
            print('No')
        else:
            print('Yes')
            print(''.join(sorted(string)))



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where `1 <= t <= 1000`. For each test case, it reads a string `s` of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters. It then checks if the string contains only one unique character. If so, it prints 'No'. If the string contains more than one unique character, it prints 'Yes' followed by the sorted version of the string. After processing all test cases, the function has no return value, but it has printed the results for each test case. The final state of the program includes the processed number of test cases and the printed results for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `cnt_test_cases`.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `string`.

2. **Single Character String:**
   - If the length of the string is 1, the function prints 'No' because it's impossible to rearrange a single character to form a different string.
   - This is correct according to the problem statement.

3. **Checking for All Characters Being the Same:**
   - The function initializes `m` with the first character of the string and `k` with 0.
   - It then iterates through the string and counts how many times the first character appears (`k`).
   - If `k` equals the length of the string, it means all characters are the same, and the function prints 'No'.
   - This is also correct according to the problem statement.

4. **Generating a Different String:**
   - If the string has more than one distinct character, the function prints 'Yes'.
   - It then sorts the string and prints the sorted version.
   - Sorting the string ensures that the characters are rearranged, but it does not guarantee that the resulting string is different from the original string. For example, if the input string is "ab", sorting it will still result in "ab", which is the same as the original string.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function correctly handles edge cases where the string length is 1 or all characters are the same.
   - However, it fails to ensure that the generated string is different from the original string in all cases.

### Conclusion:
The function is incorrect because it does not always generate a string that is different from the original string. Specifically, sorting the string does not guarantee a different string when the original string is already sorted or has a specific order that remains unchanged after sorting.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
