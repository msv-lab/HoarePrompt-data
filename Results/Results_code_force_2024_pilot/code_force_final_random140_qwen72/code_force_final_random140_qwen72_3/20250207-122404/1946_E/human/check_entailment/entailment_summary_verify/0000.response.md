### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not directly address the problem of counting the number of permutations based on prefix and suffix maximums. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(a, b)`**: This function appears to implement the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which is used to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers and the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity. Specifically, it returns a tuple `(x, y)` such that `ax + by = gcd(a, b)`.
   - **`func_2(a, b)`**: This function uses the result of `func_1` to compute a modular inverse. It returns `(c * a) % 1000000007`, where `c` is the modular inverse of `b` modulo `1000000007`.

2. **Problem Requirements**:
   - The problem requires counting the number of permutations of length `n` that satisfy certain conditions regarding prefix and suffix maximums.
   - The provided functions do not contain any logic to handle the permutation counting based on the given indices of prefix and suffix maximums.

3. **Example Test Case**:
   - For the test case:
     ```
     4 2 3
     1 2
     2 3 4
     ```
     The expected output is `3`, corresponding to the permutations `[1, 4, 3, 2]`, `[2, 4, 3, 1]`, and `[3, 4, 2, 1]`.
   - The provided functions do not perform any operations that would lead to this result. They are focused on modular arithmetic and do not address the combinatorial aspect of the problem.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are not designed to solve the problem of counting permutations based on prefix and suffix maximums.
   - The original assessment is accurate in stating that the program is incorrect because it does not implement the necessary logic to solve the given problem.

### Final Evaluation:
