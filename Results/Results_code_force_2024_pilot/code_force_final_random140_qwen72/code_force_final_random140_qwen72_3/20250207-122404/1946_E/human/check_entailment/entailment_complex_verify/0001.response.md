### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires determining the number of possible permutations of length `n` given the indices of prefix and suffix maximums.
   - A prefix maximum is an element that is greater than all previous elements.
   - A suffix maximum is an element that is greater than all subsequent elements.
   - The result should be modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Analyzing the Provided Functions:**
   - **func_1(a, b):** This function implements the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which finds the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers and the coefficients (x, y) such that \(ax + by = \text{gcd}(a, b)\).
     - If \(b == 0\), it returns \((1, 0)\).
     - If \(a < b\), it swaps \(a\) and \(b\) and calls itself recursively.
     - If \(a \% b == 0\), it returns \((1, -(a // b - 1))\).
     - Otherwise, it continues the recursion with \(b\) and \(a \% b\).
   - **func_2(a, b):** This function uses the result of `func_1` to compute the modular inverse of `a` modulo \(10^9 + 7\). It returns \(c \times a \% 1000000007\).

3. **Evaluating the Main Logic:**
   - The main logic of the program involves:
     - Precomputing factorials modulo \(10^9 + 7\) up to \(200002\).
     - Reading the input for multiple test cases.
     - Checking if the last prefix maximum and the first suffix maximum are the same, and if the first prefix maximum is 1 and the last suffix maximum is `n`.
     - Calculating the number of valid permutations using combinatorial methods and modular arithmetic.
   - The program uses the precomputed factorials and the modular inverse function to calculate combinations and update the answer accordingly.

4. **Correctness of the Main Logic:**
   - The program correctly checks the conditions for valid permutations.
   - It uses the precomputed factorials and modular inverse to calculate the number of valid permutations.
   - The combinatorial calculations are performed correctly using the modular inverse to handle large numbers.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` are correct and essential for the main logic.
   - The main logic of the program is also correct and follows the required steps to solve the problem.

### Final Evaluation:
- The provided program is correct in solving the specific problem of counting valid permutations given the indices of prefix and suffix maximums.

Final: **True**
