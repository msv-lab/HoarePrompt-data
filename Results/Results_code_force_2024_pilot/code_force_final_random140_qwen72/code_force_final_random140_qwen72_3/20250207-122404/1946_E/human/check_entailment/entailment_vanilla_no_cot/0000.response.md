Correctness: **False**

The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not directly solve the problem as described. The problem requires calculating the number of permutations that match the given prefix and suffix maximums, but the provided functions seem to be related to the Extended Euclidean Algorithm and modular inverses, which are not directly applicable to solving the permutation counting problem described.

To correctly solve the problem, you would need to implement logic that considers the constraints of prefix and suffix maximums and calculates the number of valid permutations accordingly. The current functions do not address this logic.
