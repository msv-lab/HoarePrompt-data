Reasoning:

The original assessment states that the provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not directly address the problem of counting the number of permutations based on prefix and suffix maximums. However, upon closer inspection, the program does indeed implement the necessary logic to solve the problem correctly.

### Key Points of the Program:

1. **Factorial Precomputation**:
   - The program precomputes factorials up to `200002` and stores them in the `facts` list. This is used later for combinatorial calculations.

2. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads multiple test cases, each with the length of the permutation `n`, the number of prefix maximums `m1`, and the number of suffix maximums `m2`.
   - It then reads the indices of the prefix maximums and suffix maximums.

3. **Initial Validity Check**:
   - The program checks if the last prefix maximum is the same as the first suffix maximum, the first prefix maximum is 1, and the last suffix maximum is `n`. If any of these conditions fail, it prints `0` because no valid permutation exists.

4. **Combinatorial Calculation**:
   - The program uses the precomputed factorials and the `func_2` function to calculate the number of ways to arrange the remaining elements between the suffix maximums.
   - It then reverses the prefix maximums and calculates the number of ways to arrange the remaining elements between the prefix maximums.

5. **Modulo Operation**:
   - All intermediate results and the final answer are taken modulo `1000000007` to handle large numbers.

### Analysis of Functions:

- **`func_1`**:
  - This function implements the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the modular inverse. It is used to compute the multiplicative inverse of a number modulo `1000000007`.

- **`func_2`**:
  - This function uses the result of `func_1` to compute the modular inverse and then multiplies it by `a` to get the final result. This is used to perform division under modulo arithmetic.

### Correctness of the Program:

- The program correctly handles the combinatorial aspect of the problem by using precomputed factorials and modular inverses.
- The initial validity check ensures that the input is consistent with the properties of prefix and suffix maximums.
- The combinatorial calculations are performed correctly, and the results are taken modulo `1000000007`.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is incorrect. The program does handle the logic required to count permutations based on the given prefix and suffix maximums. The use of the Extended Euclidean Algorithm and combinatorial calculations is appropriate for solving the problem.

Final: **True**
