Reasoning:

1. **Factorial Calculation**: The program starts by calculating factorials up to \(200,000\) and storing them in the list `facts`. This is necessary for later combinatorial calculations.

2. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the length of the permutation \(n\), the number of prefix maximums \(m_1\), and the number of suffix maximums \(m_2\). It then reads the indices of the prefix maximums and suffix maximums.

3. **Initial Validation**: The program checks if the last prefix maximum index is the same as the first suffix maximum index, and if the first prefix maximum index is 1 and the last suffix maximum index is \(n\). If any of these conditions fail, it prints 0, indicating no valid permutations exist.

4. **Combinatorial Calculation**:
   - The program initializes `ans` to 1 and `kol` to \(n\).
   - It iterates over the suffix maximums and calculates the number of ways to place the remaining elements using the combination formula \(C(n-1, n-x)\). The result is multiplied to `ans` and taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - It then reverses the prefix maximums (excluding the first and last elements) and performs similar combinatorial calculations for the prefix maximums.

5. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is used to compute the modular inverse of a number. It uses the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity.
   - The function handles different cases based on the values of `a` and `b` and returns the appropriate values.

6. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function uses `func_1` to compute the modular inverse of `b` and then multiplies it by `a` modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

7. **Final Output**: The program prints the final result for each test case.

Given the problem requirements and the steps taken by the program, the program appears to correctly handle the input and perform the necessary combinatorial calculations to determine the number of valid permutations. The use of modular arithmetic ensures that the results are within the required constraints.

Correctness: **True**
