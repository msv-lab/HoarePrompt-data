### Reasoning:

1. **Precomputation of Factorials**:
   - The code precomputes factorials up to 200,001 and stores them in the list `facts`. This is necessary for efficiently computing combinations later in the program.

2. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m1`, and `m2`, followed by the lists of prefix maximums `p` and suffix maximums `s`.

3. **Validation of Input**:
   - The program checks if the last element of `p` is equal to the first element of `s` and if the first element of `p` is 1 and the last element of `s` is `n`. If any of these conditions fail, it prints 0, indicating no valid permutations exist.

4. **Combination Calculation**:
   - The function `func_2` is used to compute the modular inverse of a number using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm (`func_1`). This is necessary for calculating combinations in modular arithmetic.
   - The program calculates the number of valid permutations by iterating over the suffix maximums and prefix maximums, using the combination formula to count the ways to place the remaining elements.

5. **Combination Formula**:
   - The combination formula \( C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \) is used to count the ways to place elements. The modular inverse is used to avoid division in modular arithmetic.

6. **Modular Arithmetic**:
   - All calculations are performed modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) to handle large numbers and ensure the result fits within standard integer limits.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It handles the input validation, combination calculations, and modular arithmetic appropriately. Therefore, the program is correct.
