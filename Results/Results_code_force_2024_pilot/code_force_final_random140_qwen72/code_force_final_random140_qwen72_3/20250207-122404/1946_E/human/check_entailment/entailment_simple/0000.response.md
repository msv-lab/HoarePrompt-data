### Reasoning:

1. **Precomputation of Factorials:**
   - The program precomputes factorials up to \(200,000\) and stores them in the list `facts`. This is necessary for efficiently calculating combinations later in the program.
   - The computation is done using modular arithmetic to ensure that the values do not overflow and remain within the bounds of \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\) and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the permutation \(n\), the number of prefix maximums \(m_1\), and the number of suffix maximums \(m_2\).
   - It then reads the indices of the prefix maximums and suffix maximums.

3. **Initial Validity Check:**
   - The program checks if the last prefix maximum index is the same as the first suffix maximum index, and if the first prefix maximum index is 1 and the last suffix maximum index is \(n\). If any of these conditions fail, it prints 0, indicating that no valid permutation exists.

4. **Combination Calculation:**
   - The program uses the `func_2` function to calculate combinations. The `func_2` function, in turn, uses the `func_1` function to compute the modular multiplicative inverse.
   - The combination calculation is used to determine the number of ways to arrange the remaining elements between the prefix and suffix maximums.

5. **Prefix Maximums Processing:**
   - The program processes the prefix maximums in reverse order, calculating the number of ways to arrange the elements before each prefix maximum.
   - It updates the total number of arrangements (`ans`) by multiplying it with the combination values and taking the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

6. **Suffix Maximums Processing:**
   - The program processes the suffix maximums, calculating the number of ways to arrange the elements after each suffix maximum.
   - It updates the total number of arrangements (`ans`) similarly to the prefix maximums processing.

7. **Final Output:**
   - The program prints the final result for each test case, which is the number of valid permutations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Correctness:

- The program correctly handles the precomputation of factorials and modular arithmetic.
- The initial validity check ensures that the input constraints are met.
- The combination calculation and the processing of prefix and suffix maximums are logically sound and follow the problem's requirements.
- The use of modular multiplicative inverses and combinations is appropriate for the problem's constraints.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
