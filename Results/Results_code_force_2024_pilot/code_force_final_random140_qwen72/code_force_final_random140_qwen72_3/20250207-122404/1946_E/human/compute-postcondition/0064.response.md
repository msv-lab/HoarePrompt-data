Postcondition: ***`N`, `M1`, and `M2` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ M1, M2 ≤ N ≤ 2 * 10^5. `L` is a list of integers of length M1, where 1 ≤ L[i] ≤ N and L is strictly increasing. `R` is a list of integers provided by the user input, with the last element of L equal to the first element of R, L[0] is 1, and R[-1] is N. `ans` is the final result after all iterations, which is the product of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` and the multiplications performed in the loop, modulo `MOD`, if `M2 > 1`. If `M2 > 1`, `cur` is the index in `R` corresponding to the last matched value of `i`, which will be `M2` if all elements in `R` were matched, otherwise it will be the index of the last unmatched element. `nums_left` is 0, as it is decremented by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0. `i` is `N`, as the loop increments `i` until it equals `N`. If `M2 ≤ 1`, `ans` remains the result of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`, `cur` remains `M1 - 2`, `nums_left` remains `N - R[0] - 1`, and `i` remains `N - 1`.***
