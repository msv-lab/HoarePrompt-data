To determine the output state, we need to consider the function `func_1` and its behavior with the given parameters. However, since the definition of `func_1` is not provided, we can only infer the changes based on the assumption that `func_1` returns two values, `c` and `d`.

Given:
- `a` is an integer.
- `b` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(b) <= 2 * 10^5.
- The function call `c, d = func_1(b, 1000000007)` assigns the results of `func_1` to `c` and `d`.

Since the function `func_1` is not defined, we cannot know the exact values of `c` and `d`. However, we can state that `c` and `d` are now assigned the values returned by `func_1`.

Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(b) <= 2 * 10^5, `c` and `d` are the values returned by `func_1(b, 1000000007)`.**
