Output State: **`N`, `M1`, and `M2` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ M1, M2 ≤ N ≤ 2 * 10^5. `L` is a list of integers of length M1, where 1 ≤ L[i] ≤ N and L is strictly increasing. `R` is a list of integers provided by the user input, with the last element of L equal to the first element of R, L[0] is 1, and R[-1] is N. Either M1 ≤ 1, or M2 ≤ 1, or (L[-2] ≠ R[1]). `ans` is the result of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` multiplied by `nums_left` modulo `MOD`. `cur` is `M1 - 2`. `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 2`. `M1` is greater than 1. `i` is `L[-1] - 1` and `L[-1]` must be at least 3. Additionally, `i` is not equal to `L[cur]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated to `ans * nums_left % MOD`.
- All other variables (`N`, `M1`, `M2`, `L`, `R`, `cur`, `nums_left`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
- The condition `L[-1]` must be at least 3 ensures that `nums_left` is a valid positive integer.
- The condition `i` is not equal to `L[cur]` remains valid.
