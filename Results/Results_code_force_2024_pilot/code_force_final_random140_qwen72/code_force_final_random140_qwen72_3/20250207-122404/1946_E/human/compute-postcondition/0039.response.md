Output State: **`N`, `M1`, and `M2` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ M1, M2 ≤ N ≤ 2 * 10^5. `L` is a list of integers of length M1, where 1 ≤ L[i] ≤ N and L is strictly increasing. `R` is a list of integers provided by the user input, with the last element of L equal to the first element of R, L[0] is 1, and R[-1] is N. Either M1 ≤ 1, or M2 ≤ 1, or (L[-2] ≠ R[1]). `ans` is the result of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`. If `M1 > 1`, the loop has executed all iterations, and `cur` is `M1 - 2`. If `M1 ≤ 1`, the loop does not execute, and `cur` remains `M1 - 2`. `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 1`.** 

Explanation: The code snippet assigns the value `N - R[0] - 1` to the variable `nums_left`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged. The new value of `nums_left` is calculated based on the given `N` and the first element of the list `R`.
