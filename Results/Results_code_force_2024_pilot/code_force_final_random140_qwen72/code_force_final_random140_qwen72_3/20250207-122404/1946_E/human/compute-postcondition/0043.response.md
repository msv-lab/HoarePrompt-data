To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop condition:

### Given Conditions:
- `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ M1, M2 ≤ N ≤ 2 * 10^5.
- `L` is a list of integers of length M1, where 1 ≤ L[i] ≤ N and L is strictly increasing.
- `R` is a list of integers provided by the user input, with the last element of L equal to the first element of R, L[0] is 1, and R[-1] is N.
- Either M1 ≤ 1, or M2 ≤ 1, or (L[-2] ≠ R[1]).
- `ans` is the result of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`.
- If `M1 > 1`, the loop has executed all iterations, and `cur` is now 1.
- If `M1 ≤ 1`, the loop does not execute, and `cur` remains 1.
- `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 1`.
- `i` is `R[0] + 1`.
- `M2` is greater than 1.

### Loop Condition:
```
while i < N:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop condition is `i < N`.
- For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be less than `N`.

### Current State:
- `i` is `R[0] + 1`.
- `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 2 * 10^5.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Initial Value of `i`:**
   - `i` is set to `R[0] + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute, `R[0] + 1` must be less than `N`.

2. **Adjustment Needed:**
   - We need to ensure that `R[0] + 1 < N`.
   - This means `R[0]` must be less than `N - 1`.

### Conclusion:
- The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which is derived from `R[0]`.
- To ensure the loop executes at least once, `R[0]` must be less than `N - 1`.

### Final State:
State: **`N`, `M1`, and `M2` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ M1, M2 ≤ N ≤ 2 * 10^5. `L` is a list of integers of length M1, where 1 ≤ L[i] ≤ N and L is strictly increasing. `R` is a list of integers provided by the user input, with the last element of L equal to the first element of R, L[0] is 1, and R[-1] is N. Either M1 ≤ 1, or M2 ≤ 1, or (L[-2] ≠ R[1]). `ans` is the result of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`. If `M1 > 1`, the loop has executed all iterations, and `cur` is now 1. If `M1 ≤ 1`, the loop does not execute, and `cur` remains 1. `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 1`. `i` is `R[0] + 1` and `R[0]` must be less than `N - 1`. `M2` is greater than 1.**
