To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop head:

### Given Conditions:
- `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ M1, M2 ≤ N ≤ 2 * 10^5.
- `L` is a list of integers of length M1, where 1 ≤ L[i] ≤ N and L is strictly increasing.
- `R` is a list of integers provided by the user input, with the last element of L equal to the first element of R, L[0] is 1, and R[-1] is N.
- `ans` is the result of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`.
- If `M1 > 1`, the loop has executed all iterations, and `cur` is now 3 if `i == R[cur]`, otherwise `cur` is now 2.
- If `M1 ≤ 1`, the loop does not execute, and `cur` is now 3 if `i == R[cur]`, otherwise `cur` is now 2.
- `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 3`.
- `i` is `R[0] + 3` and `R[0]` must be less than `N - 1`.
- `M2` is greater than 1.
- If `i == R[cur]`, `ans` remains unchanged.
- If `i != R[cur]`, `ans` is updated to `ans * nums_left % MOD`.

### Loop Head:
```python
while i < N:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop condition is `i < N`.
- To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `i` must be less than `N`.

### Current State:
- `i` is `R[0] + 3`.
- `R[0]` must be less than `N - 1`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- Since `i` is `R[0] + 3`, and `R[0]` must be less than `N - 1`, we need to ensure that `i` is still less than `N`.
- This means `R[0] + 3` must be less than `N`.

### Conclusion:
- The current state already ensures that `i` is less than `N` because `R[0]` is less than `N - 1`.
- Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute one more time.

### Final State:
State: **`N`, `M1`, and `M2` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ M1, M2 ≤ N ≤ 2 * 10^5. `L` is a list of integers of length M1, where 1 ≤ L[i] ≤ N and L is strictly increasing. `R` is a list of integers provided by the user input, with the last element of L equal to the first element of R, L[0] is 1, and R[-1] is N. `ans` is the result of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`. If `M1 > 1`, the loop has executed all iterations, and `cur` is now 3 if `i == R[cur]`, otherwise `cur` is now 2. If `M1 ≤ 1`, the loop does not execute, and `cur` is now 3 if `i == R[cur]`, otherwise `cur` is now 2. `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 3`. `i` is `R[0] + 3` and `R[0]` must be less than `N - 1`. `M2` is greater than 1. If `i == R[cur]`, `ans` remains unchanged. If `i != R[cur]`, `ans` is updated to `ans * nums_left % MOD`.**
