Output State: **`N`, `M1`, and `M2` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ M1, M2 ≤ N ≤ 2 * 10^5. `L` is a list of integers of length M1, where 1 ≤ L[i] ≤ N and L is strictly increasing. `R` is a list of integers provided by the user input, with the last element of L equal to the first element of R, L[0] is 1, and R[-1] is N. `ans` is the result of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` multiplied by `nums_left` modulo `MOD`. If `M1 > 1`, the loop has executed all iterations, and `cur` is now 1. If `M1 ≤ 1`, the loop does not execute, and `cur` remains 1. `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 1`. `i` is `R[0] + 1` and `R[0]` must be less than `N - 1`. `M2` is greater than 1. Additionally, `i` is not equal to `R[cur]`.**

Explanation:
- The code updates the value of `ans` by multiplying it with `nums_left` and taking the result modulo `MOD`.
- All other variables (`N`, `M1`, `M2`, `L`, `R`, `cur`, `nums_left`, `i`) remain unchanged.
- The condition `i` is not equal to `R[cur]` is still valid.
- The conditions regarding the lengths and values of `L` and `R` remain unchanged.
- The conditions regarding `M1` and `M2` remain unchanged.
- The value of `ans` is now `ans * nums_left % MOD`.
