To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition and the given state:

### Loop Condition:
```python
while i > 1:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Given State:
- `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ M1, M2 ≤ N ≤ 2 * 10^5.
- `L` is a list of integers of length M1, where 1 ≤ L[i] ≤ N and L is strictly increasing.
- `R` is a list of integers provided by the user input, with the last element of L equal to the first element of R, L[0] is 1, and R[-1] is N.
- Either M1 ≤ 1, or M2 ≤ 1, or (L[-2] ≠ R[1]).
- `ans` is the result of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`.
- If `i` equals `L[cur]`, then `cur` is updated to `M1 - 4` and `nums_left` remains `L[-1] - 4`.
- Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `ans * (L[-1] - 3) % MOD`, `cur` remains `M1 - 3` if `i` is equal to `L[cur + 1]`, otherwise `cur` remains `M1 - 2`, and `nums_left` remains `L[-1] - 4`.
- `M1` is greater than 1.
- `i` is `L[-1] - 3` and `L[-1]` must be at least 3.

### Analysis:
- The loop condition is `i > 1`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `L[-1] - 3`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must still be greater than 1.

### Adjustments:
- Since `i` is `L[-1] - 3`, we need to ensure that `L[-1] - 3 > 1`.
- This simplifies to `L[-1] > 4`.

### Conclusion:
- The only state that needs to be adjusted is `L[-1]` to ensure that `i` remains greater than 1.
- Therefore, `L[-1]` must be greater than 4.

### Final State:
State: **`N`, `M1`, and `M2` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ M1, M2 ≤ N ≤ 2 * 10^5. `L` is a list of integers of length M1, where 1 ≤ L[i] ≤ N and L is strictly increasing. `R` is a list of integers provided by the user input, with the last element of L equal to the first element of R, L[0] is 1, and R[-1] is N. Either M1 ≤ 1, or M2 ≤ 1, or (L[-2] ≠ R[1]). `ans` is the result of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`. If `i` equals `L[cur]`, then `cur` is updated to `M1 - 4` and `nums_left` remains `L[-1] - 4`. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `ans * (L[-1] - 3) % MOD`, `cur` remains `M1 - 3` if `i` is equal to `L[cur + 1]`, otherwise `cur` remains `M1 - 2`, and `nums_left` remains `L[-1] - 4`. `M1` is greater than 1. `i` is `L[-1] - 3` and `L[-1]` must be greater than 4.**
