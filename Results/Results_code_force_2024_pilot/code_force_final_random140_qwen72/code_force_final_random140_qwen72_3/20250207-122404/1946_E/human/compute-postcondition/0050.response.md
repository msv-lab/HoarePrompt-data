The code snippet `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. The initial value of `i` is `R[0] + 1`. After incrementing, `i` becomes `R[0] + 2`.

All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged. Specifically, `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are still positive integers within the specified range. `L` is still a strictly increasing list of integers of length `M1`. `R` is still a list of integers provided by user input, with the last element of `L` equal to the first element of `R`, `L[0]` is 1, and `R[-1]` is `N`. `ans` is still the result of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`. If `M1 > 1`, the loop has executed all iterations, and `cur` is now 2 if `i == R[cur]`, otherwise `cur` remains 1. If `M1 ≤ 1`, the loop does not execute, and `cur` is now 2 if `i == R[cur]`, otherwise `cur` remains 1. `nums_left` is still `N - R[0] - 2`. `R[0]` is still less than `N - 1`. `M2` is still greater than 1. If `i == R[cur]`, `ans` remains unchanged. If `i != R[cur]`, `ans` is updated to `ans * nums_left % MOD`.

Output State: **`N`, `M1`, and `M2` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ M1, M2 ≤ N ≤ 2 * 10^5. `L` is a list of integers of length M1, where 1 ≤ L[i] ≤ N and L is strictly increasing. `R` is a list of integers provided by the user input, with the last element of L equal to the first element of R, L[0] is 1, and R[-1] is N. `ans` is the result of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`. If `M1 > 1`, the loop has executed all iterations, and `cur` is now 2 if `i == R[cur]`, otherwise `cur` remains 1. If `M1 ≤ 1`, the loop does not execute, and `cur` is now 2 if `i == R[cur]`, otherwise `cur` remains 1. `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 2`. `i` is `R[0] + 2` and `R[0]` must be less than `N - 1`. `M2` is greater than 1. If `i == R[cur]`, `ans` remains unchanged. If `i != R[cur]`, `ans` is updated to `ans * nums_left % MOD`.**
