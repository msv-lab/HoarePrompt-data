Output State: **`N`, `M1`, and `M2` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ M1, M2 ≤ N ≤ 2 * 10^5. `L` is a list of integers of length M1, where 1 ≤ L[i] ≤ N and L is strictly increasing. `R` is a list of integers provided by the user input, with the last element of L equal to the first element of R, L[0] is 1, and R[-1] is N. Either M1 ≤ 1, or M2 ≤ 1, or (L[-2] ≠ R[1]). `ans` is the result of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`. `i` is `L[-1] - 3` and `L[-1]` must be greater than 4. `cur` is `M1 - 2`. `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 4`. `ans` is updated to `ans * (L[-1] - 4) % MOD`.**

Explanation:
- The code updates the value of `ans` by multiplying it with `nums_left` and taking the result modulo `MOD`.
- `nums_left` is defined as `L[-1] - 4`.
- The new value of `ans` is `ans * (L[-1] - 4) % MOD`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
