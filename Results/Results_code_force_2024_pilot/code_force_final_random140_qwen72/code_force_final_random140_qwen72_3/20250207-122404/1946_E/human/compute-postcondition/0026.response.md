The code snippet `cur -= 1` decrements the value of `cur` by 1. Given the initial state, `cur` is initially `M1 - 3` if `i` is equal to `L[cur + 1]`, otherwise `cur` remains `M1 - 2`. Since `i` is `L[-1] - 2` and `L[-1]` must be at least 3, let's determine the new value of `cur`.

1. **Initial Value of `cur`:**
   - If `i` is equal to `L[cur + 1]`, then `cur` is `M1 - 3`.
   - Otherwise, `cur` is `M1 - 2`.

2. **Decrementing `cur`:**
   - If `cur` is `M1 - 3`, then after decrementing, `cur` becomes `M1 - 4`.
   - If `cur` is `M1 - 2`, then after decrementing, `cur` becomes `M1 - 3`.

Given that `M1` is greater than 1 and `i` is `L[-1] - 2`, we need to consider both cases:

- If `i` is equal to `L[cur + 1]`, then `cur` was `M1 - 3` and now becomes `M1 - 4`.
- If `i` is not equal to `L[cur + 1]`, then `cur` was `M1 - 2` and now becomes `M1 - 3`.

Since the problem does not specify which case applies, we consider both possibilities. However, the output state should reflect the most general case.

Output State: **`N`, `M1`, and `M2` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ M1, M2 ≤ N ≤ 2 * 10^5. `L` is a list of integers of length M1, where 1 ≤ L[i] ≤ N and L is strictly increasing. `R` is a list of integers provided by the user input, with the last element of L equal to the first element of R, L[0] is 1, and R[-1] is N. Either M1 ≤ 1, or M2 ≤ 1, or (L[-2] ≠ R[1]). `ans` is the result of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`. `cur` is `M1 - 4` if `i` is equal to `L[cur + 1]`, otherwise `cur` is `M1 - 3`. `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 3`. `M1` is greater than 1. `i` is `L[-1] - 2` and `L[-1]` must be at least 3.**
