The code snippet provided decrements the value of `nums_left` by 1. Let's analyze the impact of this operation on the program state:

- `nums_left` was initially set to `L[-1] - 4`.
- After executing `nums_left -= 1`, `nums_left` is now `L[-1] - 5`.

All other variables (`N`, `M1`, `M2`, `L`, `R`, `ans`, `i`, `cur`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N`, `M1`, and `M2` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ M1, M2 ≤ N ≤ 2 * 10^5. `L` is a list of integers of length M1, where 1 ≤ L[i] ≤ N and L is strictly increasing. `R` is a list of integers provided by the user input, with the last element of L equal to the first element of R, L[0] is 1, and R[-1] is N. Either M1 ≤ 1, or M2 ≤ 1, or (L[-2] ≠ R[1]). `ans` is the result of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`. `i` is `L[-1] - 3` and `L[-1]` must be greater than 4. If `i` equals `L[cur]`, then `cur` is updated to `M1 - 5` and `nums_left` is now `L[-1] - 5`. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `ans * (L[-1] - 4) % MOD`, `cur` remains `M1 - 2`, and `nums_left` is now `L[-1] - 5`.**
