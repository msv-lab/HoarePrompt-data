Output State: **`N`, `M1`, and `M2` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ M1, M2 ≤ N ≤ 2 * 10^5. `L` is a list of integers of length M1, where 1 ≤ L[i] ≤ N and L is strictly increasing. `R` is a list of integers provided by the user input, with the last element of L equal to the first element of R, L[0] is 1, and R[-1] is N. Either M1 ≤ 1, or M2 ≤ 1, or (L[-2] ≠ R[1]). `ans` is the result of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`. `i` is `L[-1] - 3` and `L[-1]` must be greater than 4. `cur` is `M1 - 5` and `nums_left` remains `L[-1] - 4`. `M1` is greater than 1.** 

Explanation: The value of `cur` is decremented by 1, changing from `M1 - 4` to `M1 - 5`. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
