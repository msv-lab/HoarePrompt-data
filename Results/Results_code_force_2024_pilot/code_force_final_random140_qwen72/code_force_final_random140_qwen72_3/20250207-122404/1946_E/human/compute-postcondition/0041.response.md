Output State: **`N`, `M1`, and `M2` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ M1, M2 ≤ N ≤ 2 * 10^5. `L` is a list of integers of length M1, where 1 ≤ L[i] ≤ N and L is strictly increasing. `R` is a list of integers provided by the user input, with the last element of L equal to the first element of R, L[0] is 1, and R[-1] is N. Either M1 ≤ 1, or M2 ≤ 1, or (L[-2] ≠ R[1]). `ans` is the result of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`. If `M1 > 1`, the loop has executed all iterations, and `cur` is now 1. If `M1 ≤ 1`, the loop does not execute, and `cur` remains 1. `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 1`. Additionally, `M2` is greater than 1.**
