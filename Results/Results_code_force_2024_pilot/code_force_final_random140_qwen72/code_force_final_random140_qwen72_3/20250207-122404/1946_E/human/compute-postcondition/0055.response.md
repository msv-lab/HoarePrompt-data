The code snippet `nums_left -= 1` decrements the value of `nums_left` by 1. Let's analyze the impact of this code on the program:

- `nums_left` was initially defined as `N - R[0] - 2`.
- After executing `nums_left -= 1`, the new value of `nums_left` becomes `N - R[0] - 3`.

All other variables (`N`, `M1`, `M2`, `L`, `R`, `ans`, `cur`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N`, `M1`, and `M2` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ M1, M2 ≤ N ≤ 2 * 10^5. `L` is a list of integers of length M1, where 1 ≤ L[i] ≤ N and L is strictly increasing. `R` is a list of integers provided by the user input, with the last element of L equal to the first element of R, L[0] is 1, and R[-1] is N. `ans` is the result of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`. If `M1 > 1`, the loop has executed all iterations, and `cur` is now 3 if `i == R[cur]`, otherwise `cur` is now 2. If `M1 ≤ 1`, the loop does not execute, and `cur` is now 3 if `i == R[cur]`, otherwise `cur` is now 2. `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 3`. `i` is `R[0] + 2` and `R[0]` must be less than `N - 1`. `M2` is greater than 1. If `i == R[cur]`, `ans` remains unchanged. If `i != R[cur]`, `ans` is updated to `ans * nums_left % MOD`.**
