To determine the output state, let's break down the given information and the code:

- Initial State: `a` and `b` are integers where `b > 0` and `a < b`. `c` and `d` are assigned the values returned by `func_1(b, a)`.
- Code: `return d, c`

Since the function `func_1(b, a)` is not defined in the provided context, we cannot know the exact values of `c` and `d` without additional information about `func_1`. However, we can still describe the output state based on the information given.

Output State: **The program returns two values, `d` and `c`, which are the results of calling `func_1(b, a)`. The values of `d` and `c` depend on the implementation of `func_1`, but they are derived from the integers `a` and `b` where `b > 0` and `a < b`.**
