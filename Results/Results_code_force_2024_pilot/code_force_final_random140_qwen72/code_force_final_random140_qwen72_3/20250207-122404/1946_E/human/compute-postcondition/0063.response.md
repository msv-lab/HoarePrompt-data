Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `N`, `M1`, and `M2` remain positive integers such that 1 ≤ M1, M2 ≤ N ≤ 2 * 10^5. `L` remains a list of integers of length M1, where 1 ≤ L[i] ≤ N and L is strictly increasing. `R` remains a list of integers provided by the user input, with the last element of L equal to the first element of R, L[0] is 1, and R[-1] is N. `ans` is the final result after all iterations, which is the product of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` and the multiplications performed in the loop, modulo `MOD`. `cur` is the index in `R` corresponding to the last matched value of `i`, which will be `M2` if all elements in `R` were matched, otherwise it will be the index of the last unmatched element. `nums_left` is 0, as it is decremented by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0. `i` is `N`, as the loop increments `i` until it equals `N`.**

Explanation:
- The loop continues to execute as long as `i < N`.
- In each iteration, if `i` matches an element in `R` at index `cur`, `cur` is incremented.
- If `i` does not match an element in `R`, `ans` is updated by multiplying it with `nums_left` and taking the result modulo `MOD`.
- `nums_left` is decremented by 1 in each iteration, starting from `N - R[0] - 1`.
- `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, starting from `R[0] + 1`.
- When the loop finishes, `i` will be equal to `N`, and `nums_left` will be 0.
- `cur` will be the index in `R` corresponding to the last matched value of `i`, or `M2` if all elements in `R` were matched.
