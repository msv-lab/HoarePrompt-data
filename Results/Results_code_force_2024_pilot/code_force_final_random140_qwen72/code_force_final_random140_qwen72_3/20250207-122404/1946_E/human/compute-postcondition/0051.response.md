To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions in the loop head:

```python
while i < N:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop condition is `i < N`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `N`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is `R[0] + 2`
- `R[0]` must be less than `N - 1`

Since `i` is `R[0] + 2`, and `R[0]` is less than `N - 1`, we can deduce that `i` is less than `N - 1 + 2`, which simplifies to `i < N + 1`. However, since `R[0]` is less than `N - 1`, `i` is actually less than `N`.

Therefore, the condition `i < N` is already satisfied, and no adjustments are needed to the state for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`N`, `M1`, and `M2` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ M1, M2 ≤ N ≤ 2 * 10^5. `L` is a list of integers of length M1, where 1 ≤ L[i] ≤ N and L is strictly increasing. `R` is a list of integers provided by the user input, with the last element of L equal to the first element of R, L[0] is 1, and R[-1] is N. `ans` is the result of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`. If `M1 > 1`, the loop has executed all iterations, and `cur` is now 2 if `i == R[cur]`, otherwise `cur` remains 1. If `M1 ≤ 1`, the loop does not execute, and `cur` is now 2 if `i == R[cur]`, otherwise `cur` remains 1. `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 2`. `i` is `R[0] + 2` and `R[0]` must be less than `N - 1`. `M2` is greater than 1. If `i == R[cur]`, `ans` remains unchanged. If `i != R[cur]`, `ans` is updated to `ans * nums_left % MOD`.**
