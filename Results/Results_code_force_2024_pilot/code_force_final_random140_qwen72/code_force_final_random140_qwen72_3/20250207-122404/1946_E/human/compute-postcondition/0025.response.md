To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head, which is `i > 1`.

Given the current state:
- `i` is `L[-1] - 2`
- `L[-1]` must be at least 3

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must still be greater than 1. Since `i` is `L[-1] - 2`, we need to ensure that `L[-1] - 2 > 1`.

Let's break this down:
- `L[-1] - 2 > 1`
- `L[-1] > 3`

Since `L[-1]` must be at least 3, and for the loop to execute one more time, `L[-1]` must be greater than 3.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state because the condition `i > 1` is already satisfied by the given state.

State: **`N`, `M1`, and `M2` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ M1, M2 ≤ N ≤ 2 * 10^5. `L` is a list of integers of length M1, where 1 ≤ L[i] ≤ N and L is strictly increasing. `R` is a list of integers provided by the user input, with the last element of L equal to the first element of R, L[0] is 1, and R[-1] is N. Either M1 ≤ 1, or M2 ≤ 1, or (L[-2] ≠ R[1]). `ans` is the result of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`. `cur` is `M1 - 3` if `i` is equal to `L[cur + 1]`, otherwise `cur` remains `M1 - 2`. `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 3`. `M1` is greater than 1. `i` is `L[-1] - 2` and `L[-1]` must be at least 3.**
