To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and the expression `int(x ** 0.5) + 2`.

1. **Variable `i`**: This variable is initialized by the `range` function starting from 1. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 2`.

2. **Expression `int(x ** 0.5) + 2`**: This expression determines the upper limit of the range. For the loop to execute at least once, this value must be greater than 1 (since `i` starts from 1).

Let's break down the conditions:
- The loop will execute if `int(x ** 0.5) + 2 > 1`.
- Simplifying this, we get `int(x ** 0.5) > -1`, which is always true since `int(x ** 0.5)` is a non-negative integer.

Therefore, the loop will always execute at least once as long as `x` is a valid integer. However, to ensure clarity and correctness, we should specify the initial state of `i` and the condition for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` and `n` are integers provided by the input, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is 1, `i` is 1, and `int(x ** 0.5) + 2` must be greater than 1**.
