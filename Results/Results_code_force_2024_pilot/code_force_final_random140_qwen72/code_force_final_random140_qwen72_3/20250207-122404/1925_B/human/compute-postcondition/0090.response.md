The code snippet provided is:

```
l = [ans]
```

Let's analyze the impact of this code on the program:

- `l` is initialized as a list containing the value of `ans`.
- `ans` was previously set to 1, so `l` will be `[1]`.

The other variables (`_`, `x`, `n`, `k`, `i`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`_` is not explicitly tracked, `x` is an input integer that must be at least 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is the integer division result of `x` by `n`, `ans` is 1, `i` is 3, and `i` must be less than `int(x)`, `l` is `[1]`.**
