The code snippet initializes a list `l` with the value of `ans`. Given the initial state, `ans` is 1. Therefore, the list `l` will contain the single element 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` and `n` are integers provided by the input, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is 1, `i` is 1, `x % i` is 0, `l` is [1]**.
