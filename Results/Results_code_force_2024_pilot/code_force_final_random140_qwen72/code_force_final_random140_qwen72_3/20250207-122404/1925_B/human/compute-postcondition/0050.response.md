Output State: **`x` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 2, `l` is a list containing the value of `ans` and the value `2`, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`. If `x % i == 0` and `x // i <= k`, `l` also contains the value of `x // i`. If `x % i == 0` and `x // i > k`, `l` remains unchanged and contains only the value of `ans` and `2`. If `x % i != 0`, `l` and `ans` remain unchanged and contain only the value of `ans` and `2`.**
