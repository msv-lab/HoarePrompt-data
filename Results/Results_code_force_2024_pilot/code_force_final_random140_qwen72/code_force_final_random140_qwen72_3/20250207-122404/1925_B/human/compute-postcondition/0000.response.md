To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\).
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq x\).

### Loop Statement:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop head contains the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`.
- The loop will execute if `int(input())` returns a positive integer (i.e., greater than 0).

### Adjustments Needed:
- The only state that can be adjusted to ensure the loop executes is the input value provided by `int(input())`.
- For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be greater than 0.

### Final State:
- The state before the loop starts should ensure that the input value is greater than 0.
- The other variables (`t`, `x`, and `n`) are not directly involved in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

### Final Answer:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\), `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq x\), and `int(input())` must be greater than 0**.
