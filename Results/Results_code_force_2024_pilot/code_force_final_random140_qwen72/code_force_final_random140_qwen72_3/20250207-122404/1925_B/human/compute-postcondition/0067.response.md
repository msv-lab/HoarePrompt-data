The code snippet `x, n = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, and assigns the integer values of these parts to `x` and `n` respectively.

Output State: **`_` is not explicitly tracked, the input value must be at least 1 for the loop to execute one more time, `x` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer.**
