Output State: **`_` is not explicitly tracked, `x` is an input integer that must be at least 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is the integer division result of `x` by `n`, `ans` is 1, `i` is 3, `i` must be less than `int(x)`, if `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` is `[1, 3, x // 3]`. Otherwise, `l` is `[1, x // 3]`.**

Explanation:
- The code appends the result of `x // i` to the list `l`.
- Since `i` is 3, the value `x // 3` is appended to `l`.
- If `i` (which is 3) is less than or equal to `k`, then `l` was initially `[1, 3]`, so after appending `x // 3`, `l` becomes `[1, 3, x // 3]`.
- If `i` (which is 3) is greater than `k`, then `l` was initially `[1]`, so after appending `x // 3`, `l` becomes `[1, x // 3]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
