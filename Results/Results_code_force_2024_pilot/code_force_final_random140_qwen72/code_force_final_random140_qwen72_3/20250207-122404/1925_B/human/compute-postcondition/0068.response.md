Output State: **`_` is not explicitly tracked, the input value must be at least 1 for the loop to execute one more time, `x` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `k` is the integer division result of `x` by `n`.** 

In natural language, the variable `k` is now assigned the value of the integer division of `x` by `n`. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
