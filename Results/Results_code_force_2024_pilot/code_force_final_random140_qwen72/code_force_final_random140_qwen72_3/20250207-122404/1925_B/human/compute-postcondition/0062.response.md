Output State: **`x` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 3, and `l` is a list. If `i <= k`, `l` contains the value of `ans` and 3. If `x % i == 0` and `x // i <= k`, `l` also contains the value of `x // i`, and `ans` is the maximum of `ans`, `2`, and `x // i`. If `x % i == 0` and `x // i > k`, `l` contains the value of `ans`, 3, and 2, and `ans` is the maximum of `ans` and `2`. If `x % i != 0`, `l` contains the value of `ans`, 3, and 2, and `ans` is the maximum of `ans` and `2`. If `i > k`, `l` contains the value of `ans` and 3, and `ans` is the same as before. `ans` is now the maximum value in `l`.**
