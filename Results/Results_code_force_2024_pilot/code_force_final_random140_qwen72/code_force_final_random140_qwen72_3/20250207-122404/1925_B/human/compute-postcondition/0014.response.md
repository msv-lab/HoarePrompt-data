Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` and `n` are integers provided by the input, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is 1, and `i` is 1. If `x % i` is 0, then `l` is [1, 1, `x // i`] if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`; otherwise, `l` remains [1, 1]. If `x % i` is not 0, `l` remains [1, 1].***
