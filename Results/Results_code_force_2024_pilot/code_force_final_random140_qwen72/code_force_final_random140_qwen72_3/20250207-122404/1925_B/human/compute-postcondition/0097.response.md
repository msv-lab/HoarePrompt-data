Output State: **The loop has completed all its iterations. The final state is as follows: `_` is not explicitly tracked, `x` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `k` is the integer division result of `x` by `n`, `ans` is the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`, and `i` is the last value it reached, which is `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.
- For each `i`, if `x % i == 0`, the loop checks if `i` and `x // i` are less than or equal to `k` (where `k = x // n`).
- The list `l` is constructed with `ans` and potentially `i` and `x // i` if they meet the conditions.
- `ans` is updated to the maximum value in `l`.
- After the loop completes, `ans` will hold the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`.
- The variable `i` will be `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` because the loop runs until `i` reaches this value.
