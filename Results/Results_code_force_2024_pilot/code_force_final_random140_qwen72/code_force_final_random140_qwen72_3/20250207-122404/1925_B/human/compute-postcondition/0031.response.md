Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` and `n` are integers provided by the input, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`, `i` is `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`, and `ans` is the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`x` and `n`**: Remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- **`k`**: Remains unchanged as it is calculated once before the loop starts.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` because the loop iterates from 1 to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.
- **`ans`**: The variable `ans` is updated within the loop to be the maximum value among the divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to `k`. This means that after the loop finishes, `ans` will hold the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`.

This final state reflects the outcome of the loop's operations on the variables involved in the loop's head and body.
