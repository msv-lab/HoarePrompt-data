Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` and `n` are integers provided by the input, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is 1, `i` is 1, and `x % i` is 0.** 

This means that all the initial conditions still hold, and additionally, the current value of `i` (which is 1) divides `x` without leaving a remainder.
