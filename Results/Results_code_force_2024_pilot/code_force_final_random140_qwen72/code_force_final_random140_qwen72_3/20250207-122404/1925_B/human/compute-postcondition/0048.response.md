To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop head:

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `x` is a non-negative integer.
- `i` is set to 1.
- If `x % i == 0`, then `l` is a list containing the values of `ans`.
- If `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` also contains the value of `x // i`.
- If `x // i` is greater than `k`, `l` remains unchanged and contains only the value of `ans`.
- `ans` is now the maximum value in the list `l`.
- If `x % i != 0`, `l` and `ans` remain unchanged.

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 2):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
- The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 2`.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
- The condition for the loop to execute again is that `i` must be less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 2`.

### Final State:
- `x` remains a non-negative integer.
- `i` is now 2.
- The conditions for `l` and `ans` remain the same as they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`x` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 2, if `x % i == 0`, then `l` is a list containing the values of `ans`. If `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` also contains the value of `x // i`. If `x // i` is greater than `k`, `l` remains unchanged and contains only the value of `ans`. `ans` is now the maximum value in the list `l`. If `x % i != 0`, `l` and `ans` remain unchanged.**
