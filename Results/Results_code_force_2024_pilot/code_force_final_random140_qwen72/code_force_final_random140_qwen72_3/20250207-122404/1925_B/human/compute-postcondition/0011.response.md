Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` and `n` are integers provided by the input, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is 1, `i` is 1, `x % i` is 0, `l` is [1, 1, `x // i`], and `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`.**

Explanation:
- The list `l` was initially `[1]`.
- Since `i` is 1 and `x % i` is 0, the condition `i <= k` is true.
- Therefore, `l` is updated to `[1, 1]` before the code snippet is executed.
- The code `l.append(x // i)` appends the value of `x // i` to the list `l`.
- The new value of `l` is `[1, 1, x // i]`.
- All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
