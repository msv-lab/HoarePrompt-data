Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` and `n` are integers provided by the input, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is 1, `i` is 2, and `l` is [1]. If `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, then `l` is updated to [1, x // 2]. Otherwise, `l` remains [1].***
