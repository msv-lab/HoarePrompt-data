Postcondition: ***`_` is not explicitly tracked, `x` is an input integer that must be at least 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is the integer division result of `x` by `n`, `ans` is 1, `i` is 3, and `i` must be less than `int(x)`. If `x % i == 0`, then `ans` is the maximum value in `l`. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` is `[1, 3, x // 3]`. Otherwise, `l` is `[1, x // 3]`.***
