The code snippet `l.append(x // i)` appends the integer division of `x` by `i` to the list `l`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2, and `x` is an integer provided by the input. The integer division `x // i` will be calculated and appended to `l`.

- `l` was initially `[1]`.
- After appending `x // i`, `l` becomes `[1, x // 2]`.

All other variables (`t`, `x`, `n`, `k`, `ans`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` and `n` are integers provided by the input, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is 1, `i` is 2, `l` is [1, x // 2].**
