Postcondition: ***`x` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 2, and `l` is a list. If `x % i == 0`, `l` contains the value of `ans` and possibly the value `2`. If `x % i == 0` and `x // i <= k`, `l` also contains the value of `x // i`, and `ans` is the maximum of `ans`, `2`, and `x // i`. If `x % i == 0` and `x // i > k`, `l` remains unchanged and contains only the value of `ans` and `2`, and `ans` is the maximum of `ans` and `2`. If `x % i != 0`, `l` and `ans` remain unchanged and contain only the value of `ans` and `2`, and `ans` is the maximum of `ans` and `2`. If `i > k`, `l` and `ans` remain unchanged and contain only the value of `ans`, and `ans` is the same as before.***
