Postcondition: ***`x` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 3, and `l` is a list. If `x % i == 0` and `i <= k`, `l` contains the value of `ans`, 3, and possibly `x // i` if `x // i <= k`. In this case, `ans` is the maximum of `ans`, 2, and `x // i` if `x // i <= k`; otherwise, `ans` is the maximum of `ans` and 2. If `x % i == 0` and `i > k`, `l` contains the value of `ans` and 3, and `ans` remains the same as before. If `x % i != 0`, `l` and `ans` remain unchanged and contain only the value of `ans` and 2, and `ans` is the maximum of `ans` and 2.***
