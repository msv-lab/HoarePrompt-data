Postcondition: **`_` is not explicitly tracked, `x` is an input integer that must be at least 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is the integer division result of `x` by `n`, `ans` is 1, `i` is 1, `x % i` is 0, `l` is a list containing `[1]`. The current value of `i` is 1, and the integer division of `x` by `i` is less than or equal to `k`. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` is updated to contain `[1, 1]`.**
