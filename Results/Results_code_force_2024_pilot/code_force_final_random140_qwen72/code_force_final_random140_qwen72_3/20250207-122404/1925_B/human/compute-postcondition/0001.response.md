The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `n` respectively. The initial values of `x` and `n` are overwritten by the new values provided by the input. The variable `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` and `n` are integers provided by the input, and `int(input())` must be greater than 0.**
