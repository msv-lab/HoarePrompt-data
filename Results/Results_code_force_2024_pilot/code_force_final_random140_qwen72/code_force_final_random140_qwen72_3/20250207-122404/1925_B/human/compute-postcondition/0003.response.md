Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` and `n` are integers provided by the input, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is 1.** 

The variable `ans` is initialized to 1, while the other variables (`t`, `x`, `n`, and `k`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
