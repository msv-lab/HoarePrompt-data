To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 2):
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The variable `i` is the loop counter.
   - The expression `int(x ** 0.5) + 2` determines the upper bound of the loop.

2. **Determine the Conditions for the Loop to Execute:**
   - The loop will execute if the range is non-empty.
   - The range `range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 2)` will be non-empty if `int(x ** 0.5) + 2` is greater than 1.

3. **Simplify the Condition:**
   - For the loop to execute, `int(x ** 0.5) + 2 > 1`.
   - Simplifying this, we get `int(x ** 0.5) > -1`, which is always true for any non-negative `x`.

4. **Initial State Adjustments:**
   - Since `int(x ** 0.5) + 2` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute, `x` must be at least 0 (since the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers).
   - The loop counter `i` starts at 1.

### Final Adjusted State:
- The loop will execute as long as `x` is at least 0.
- The loop counter `i` starts at 1.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`_` is not explicitly tracked, `x` is an input integer that must be at least 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is the integer division result of `x` by `n`, `ans` is 1, `i` is 1**
