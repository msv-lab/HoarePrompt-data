Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `n` is greater than `x`. According to the problem description, `n` can be equal to `x`, but the program does not correctly handle this scenario. For example, consider the input:

```
1
5 5
```

The expected output is `1`, because the only way to split 5 into 5 sub-problems is to have each sub-problem with a difficulty of 1, making the GCD 1. However, the program's logic does not correctly handle this case, leading to an incorrect result.
