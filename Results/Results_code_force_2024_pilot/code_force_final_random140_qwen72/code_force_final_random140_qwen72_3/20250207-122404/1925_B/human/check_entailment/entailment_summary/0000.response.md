Reasoning:  
The program aims to find the maximum GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of a set of `n` sub-problems whose total difficulty sums up to `x`. The key insight is that the maximum GCD of the sub-problems' difficulties must be a divisor of `x`, and it should also be feasible to distribute `x` into `n` parts such that each part's difficulty is at least 1 and the GCD of these parts is maximized.

The program works as follows:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads `x` and `n`.
3. It calculates `k` as the integer division of `x` by `n`, which represents the average difficulty per sub-problem.
4. It initializes `ans` to 1, which will store the maximum GCD found.
5. It iterates over potential divisors `i` of `x` up to the square root of `x` plus 2.
   - If `i` is a divisor of `x`, it checks if `i` or `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`.
   - It updates `ans` to the maximum of the current `ans` and the valid divisors.
6. Finally, it prints `ans` for each test case.

This approach is efficient because it only considers divisors up to the square root of `x`, reducing the number of iterations needed. The logic ensures that the chosen divisor is feasible for distribution among `n` sub-problems.

Given the problem constraints and the execution summary, the program correctly implements the required logic and produces the expected output for the given examples.
