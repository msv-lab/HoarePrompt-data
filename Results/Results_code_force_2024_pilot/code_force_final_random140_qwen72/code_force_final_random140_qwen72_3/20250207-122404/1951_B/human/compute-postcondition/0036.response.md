The function `func_1` is designed to handle multiple test cases, each involving a set of cows with unique Cowdeforces ratings. The function accepts the following parameters:

- `t`: An integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- For each test case:
  - `n`: An integer representing the number of cows, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.
  - `k`: An integer representing the index of your cow, where 1 ≤ k ≤ n.
  - `a`: A list of n integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and all a_i's are distinct.

The function processes each test case and returns the result for each test case. The exact return value is not specified in the given information, but typically, such a function would return some form of analysis or computation based on the ratings and the index of your cow.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each defined by the number of cows `n`, the index of your cow `k`, and a list of Cowdeforces ratings `a` for the cows. It processes each test case and returns a result for each test case.**
