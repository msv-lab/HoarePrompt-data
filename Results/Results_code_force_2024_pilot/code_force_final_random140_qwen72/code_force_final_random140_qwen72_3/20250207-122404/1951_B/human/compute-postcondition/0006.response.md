Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `wins` is 0, `i` is 0. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[k - 1]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues as it was before the if statement.***
