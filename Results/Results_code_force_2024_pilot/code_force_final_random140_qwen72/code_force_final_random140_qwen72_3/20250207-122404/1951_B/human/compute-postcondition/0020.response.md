Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `wins` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k-1]` before encountering an element greater than `a[k-1]`, `i` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than `a[k-1]` or `n` if no such element exists, `wins_with_swap` is `wins + 1`. If `wins` is greater than or equal to `k`, the condition holds true.**
