You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two integers n and k, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n, representing the number of cows and the index of your cow, respectively. The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. All a_i's are distinct. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func_1():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    wins = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] > a[k - 1]:
            break
        
        wins += 1
        
    #State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `wins` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k-1]` before encountering an element greater than `a[k-1]`, `i` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than `a[k-1]` or `n` if no such element exists.
    if (wins >= k) :
        print(wins - 1)
        #This is printed: wins - 1 (where wins is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k-1]` before encountering an element greater than `a[k-1]`)
    #State: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `wins` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k-1]` before encountering an element greater than `a[k-1]`, and `i` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than `a[k-1]` or `n` if no such element exists. If `wins` is greater than or equal to `k`, the condition holds true.
    wins_with_swap = wins + 1
    for i in range(wins_with_swap, k - 1):
        if a[i] > a[k - 1]:
            break
        
        wins_with_swap += 1
        
    #State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `wins` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k-1]` before encountering an element greater than `a[k-1]`, `i` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than `a[k-1]` or `n` if no such element exists, `wins_with_swap` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k-1]` starting from `wins_with_swap` until the first element greater than `a[k-1]` is encountered or the end of the list is reached.
    print(max(wins - 1, wins_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins > 0)))
    #This is printed: max(wins - 1, wins_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins > 0)) (where `wins` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k-1]` before encountering an element greater than `a[k-1]`, and `wins_with_swap` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k-1]` starting from `wins_with_swap` until the first element greater than `a[k-1]` is encountered or the end of the list is reached)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases, each defined by the number of cows `n`, the index of your cow `k`, and a list of Cowdeforces ratings `a` for the cows. It processes each test case and returns a result for each test case.

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
