Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `wins` is 0.** 

The variable `wins` is initialized to 0, while the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, and `a`) retain their initial values and conditions.
