To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head, which in this case is `nei` and `graph[node]`.

1. **`nei`**: This variable will take on the values of the neighbors of `node` as defined by `graph[node]`.
2. **`graph[node]`**: This must be a non-empty iterable (e.g., a list or set) for the loop to execute at least once.

Given the state before the loop starts, we need to ensure that `graph[node]` contains at least one element for the loop to execute. The other variables mentioned in the state description do not directly affect the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the adjusted state should ensure that `graph[node]` is non-empty:

State: **`node` is the element that was at the front of `que` before the operation, `que` contains all elements that were added during the iterations but not yet processed, excluding the element that was just removed, `graph[node]` must contain at least one element, `prev` dictionary has entries for all nodes that were neighbors of the processed nodes, mapping each neighbor to its corresponding `node`, `nei` is the first neighbor of `node` in `graph[node]`, all other variables (`n`, `m`, `edges`, `graph`, `i`, `dsu`, `_min_edge`, `start`, `end`) remain unchanged.**
