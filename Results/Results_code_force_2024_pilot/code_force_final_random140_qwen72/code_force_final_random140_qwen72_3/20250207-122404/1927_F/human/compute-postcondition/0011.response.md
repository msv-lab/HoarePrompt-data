Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5), `edges` contains the tuple `(w, u, v)`, `graph` is a defaultdict of lists with `graph[u]` containing `[v, v]` and `graph[v]` containing `[u, u]`, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than 1, `u`, `v`, and `w` are the values returned by `func_3()`**.

Explanation:
- The line `graph[v].append(u)` adds `u` to the list `graph[v]`.
- Initially, `graph[v]` contained `[u]`.
- After executing the code, `graph[v]` now contains `[u, u]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
