Output State: **`node` is the element that was at the front of `que` before the operation, `que` contains all elements that were added during the iterations but not yet processed, if `nei` is not in `prev`, `que` now includes `nei`, and `prev` dictionary includes an entry for `nei` mapping it to `node`, `graph[node]` must contain at least one element, `nei` is the second neighbor of `node` in `graph[node]`, `prev[nei]` is now set to `node`, and all other variables (`n`, `m`, `edges`, `graph`, `i`, `dsu`, `_min_edge`, `start`, `end`) remain unchanged. If `node` is equal to `start` and `nei` is equal to `end`, the current iteration of the loop ends and moves to the next iteration.**
