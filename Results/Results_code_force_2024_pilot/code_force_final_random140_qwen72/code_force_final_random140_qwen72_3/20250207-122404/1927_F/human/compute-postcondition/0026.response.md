Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5), `edges` is a list of `m` tuples sorted in descending order by the first element of each tuple (weight `w`), `graph` is a defaultdict of lists, `i` is `m - 1`, `dsu` is an instance of the `DSU` class initialized with `n + 1`, `_min_edge` is infinity, `start` is -1, `end` is -1, `(w, u, v)` is the first tuple in `edges`, `parent_u` is the parent of `u` as determined by the `dsu.find(u)` method, `parent_v` is the parent of `v` as determined by the `dsu.find(v)` method.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `parent_v = dsu.find(v)` assigns the parent of `v` (determined by the `dsU.find(v)` method) to the variable `parent_v`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
