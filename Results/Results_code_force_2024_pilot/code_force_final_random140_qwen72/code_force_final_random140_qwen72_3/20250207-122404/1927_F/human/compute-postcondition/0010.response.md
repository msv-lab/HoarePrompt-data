Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5), `edges` contains the tuple `(w, u, v)`, `graph` is a defaultdict of lists with `graph[u]` containing `[v]` and `graph[v]` containing `[u]`, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than 1, `u`, `v`, and `w` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `graph[u]` now contains `[v, v]`.**

Explanation: The code `graph[u].append(v)` adds `v` to the list `graph[u]`. Since `graph[u]` initially contained `[v]`, after appending `v` again, `graph[u]` now contains `[v, v]`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
