To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables and conditions specified in the loop head. The loop head in this case is:

```python
for nei in graph[node]:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - `nei`: This variable is assigned the value of each neighbor of `node` in the `graph`.
   - `graph[node]`: This is the list of neighbors of the current `node`.

2. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as there are more elements in `graph[node]` to assign to `nei`.

3. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `node` is the first element that was in `que` before the operation.
   - `que` now contains all elements except the first one that was previously in `que`.
   - `prev` dictionary has entries for all neighbors of `node`, mapping them to `start`.
   - If `nei` is not in `prev`, it is appended to `que` and `prev` is updated to map `nei` to `node`.
   - `graph[node]` must contain at least one element.
   - All other variables (`n`, `m`, `edges`, `graph`, `i`, `dsu`, `_min_edge`, `start`, `end`) remain unchanged.
   - `que` must contain at least one element.
   - If `node` is equal to `start` and `nei` is equal to `end`, the current iteration of the loop ends, and the next iteration begins immediately.

4. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - Since the loop iterates over `graph[node]`, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the list of neighbors `graph[node]`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `graph[node]` must still contain at least one element that has not been processed yet.

### Adjusted State:
- `node` remains the same.
- `que` remains the same.
- `prev` remains the same.
- `graph[node]` must still contain at least one element.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `edges`, `graph`, `i`, `dsu`, `_min_edge`, `start`, `end`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`node` will be the first element that was in `que` before the operation, and `que` will now contain all elements except the first one that was previously in `que`. The `prev` dictionary will have entries for all these neighbors, mapping them to `start`. If `nei` is not in `prev`, `nei` is appended to `que` and `prev` is updated to map `nei` to `node`. `graph[node]` must contain at least one element. All other variables (`n`, `m`, `edges`, `graph`, `i`, `dsu`, `_min_edge`, `start`, `end`) remain unchanged, and `que` must contain at least one element.**
