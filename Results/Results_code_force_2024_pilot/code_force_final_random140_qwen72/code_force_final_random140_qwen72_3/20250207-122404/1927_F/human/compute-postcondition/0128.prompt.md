Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *After all iterations, `node` will be the element that was at the front of `que` before the operation, and `que` will contain all elements that were added during the iterations but not yet processed, excluding the element that was just removed. The `prev` dictionary will have entries for all nodes that were neighbors of the processed nodes, mapping each neighbor to its corresponding `node`. If `node` is equal to `end`, the loop will terminate early, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. All other variables (`n`, `m`, `edges`, `graph`, `i`, `dsu`, `_min_edge`, `start`, `end`) remain unchanged. `que` must contain at least one element, unless it was exactly one element before the operation, in which case `que` will now be empty.
Code of the loop:
for nei in graph[node]:
    if node == start and nei == end:
        continue
    if nei not in prev:
        prev[nei] = node
        que.append(nei)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`node` is the element that was at the front of `que` before the operation, `que` contains all elements that were added during the iterations but not yet processed. If `nei` is not in `prev`, `que` now includes `nei`, and `prev` dictionary includes an entry for `nei` mapping it to `node`. `graph[node]` must contain at least one element, `nei` is the first neighbor of `node` in `graph[node]`, and all other variables (`n`, `m`, `edges`, `graph`, `i`, `dsu`, `_min_edge`, `start`, `end`) remain unchanged. If `node` is equal to `start` and `nei` is equal to `end`, the program continues to the next iteration or statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`node` is the element that was at the front of `que` before the operation, `que` contains all elements that were added during the iterations but not yet processed. If `nei` is not in `prev`, `que` now includes `nei`, and `prev` dictionary includes an entry for `nei` mapping it to `node`. `graph[node]` must contain at least one element, `nei` is the second neighbor of `node` in `graph[node]`, and `prev[nei]` is now set to `node`. All other variables (`n`, `m`, `edges`, `graph`, `i`, `dsu`, `_min_edge`, `start`, `end`) remain unchanged. If `node` is equal to `start` and `nei` is equal to `end`, the current iteration of the loop ends and moves to the next iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`node` is the element that was at the front of `que` before the operation, `que` now includes all elements that were added during the iterations but not yet processed. If `nei` is not in `prev`, `que` now includes `nei`, and `prev` dictionary includes an entry for `nei` mapping it to `node`. `graph[node]` must contain at least three elements, `nei` is the third neighbor of `node` in `graph[node]`, and `prev[nei]` is now set to `node`. All other variables (`n`, `m`, `edges`, `graph`, `i`, `dsu`, `_min_edge`, `start`, `end`) remain unchanged. If `node` is equal to `start` and `nei` is equal to `end`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
