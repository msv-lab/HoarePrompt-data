Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After all iterations, `node` will be the last processed node from `que` or `end` if it was reached, and `que` will be empty. The `prev` dictionary will have entries for all nodes that were reachable from `start` and not previously in `prev`, mapping each node to its predecessor in the path. If `end` was reached, the loop will have terminated early when `node` became `end`. All other variables (`n`, `m`, `edges`, `graph`, `i`, `dsu`, `_min_edge`, `start`, `end`) remain unchanged. `path` is an empty list. `curr` is set to `end`.
Code of the loop:
while curr != -1:
    path.append(curr)
    curr = prev[curr]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After all iterations, `node` will be the last processed node from `que` or `end` if it was reached, and `que` will be empty. The `prev` dictionary will have entries for all nodes that were reachable from `start` and not previously in `prev`, mapping each node to its predecessor in the path. If `end` was reached, the loop will have terminated early when `node` became `end`. All other variables (`n`, `m`, `edges`, `graph`, `i`, `dsu`, `_min_edge`, `start`, `end`) remain unchanged. `path` is now a list containing `[end]`. `curr` is set to the predecessor of `end` as found in the `prev` dictionary, and `end` must not be `-1`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: After all iterations, `node` will be the last processed node from `que` or `end` if it was reached, and `que` will be empty. The `prev` dictionary will have entries for all nodes that were reachable from `start` and not previously in `prev`, mapping each node to its predecessor in the path. If `end` was reached, the loop will have terminated early when `node` became `end`. All other variables (`n`, `m`, `edges`, `graph`, `i`, `dsu`, `_min_edge`, `start`, `end`) remain unchanged. `path` is now a list containing `[end, curr]`. `curr` is updated to the predecessor of the current `curr` as found in the `prev` dictionary, and `curr` must not be `-1`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: After all iterations, `node` will be the last processed node from `que` or `end` if it was reached, and `que` will be empty. The `prev` dictionary will have entries for all nodes that were reachable from `start` and not previously in `prev`, mapping each node to its predecessor in the path. If `end` was reached, the loop will have terminated early when `node` became `end`. All other variables (`n`, `m`, `edges`, `graph`, `i`, `dsu`, `_min_edge`, `start`, `end`) remain unchanged. `path` is now a list containing `[end, curr, prev[curr], prev[prev[curr]]]`. `curr` is updated to the predecessor of the current `curr` as found in the `prev` dictionary, and `curr` must not be `-1`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
