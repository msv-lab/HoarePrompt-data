Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5), `edges` contains the tuples `(w, u, v)` and the new tuple `(w, u, v)` returned by `func_3()`, `graph` is a defaultdict of lists with `graph[u]` containing `[v, v, v]` and `graph[v]` containing `[u, u]`, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than 2, `u`, `v`, and `w` are the values returned by `func_3()`**.

Explanation: The code `graph[u].append(v)` adds the value `v` to the list `graph[u]`. Initially, `graph[u]` contained `[v, v]`, and after appending `v`, it now contains `[v, v, v]`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
