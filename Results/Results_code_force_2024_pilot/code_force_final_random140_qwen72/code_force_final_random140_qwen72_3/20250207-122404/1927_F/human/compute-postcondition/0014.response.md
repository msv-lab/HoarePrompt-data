Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5), `edges` contains the tuples `(w, u, v)` and the new tuple `(w, u, v)` returned by `func_3()`, `graph` is a defaultdict of lists with `graph[u]` containing `[v, v]` and `graph[v]` containing `[u, u]`, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than 2, `u`, `v`, and `w` are the values returned by `func_3()`**

Explanation:
- The values of `n`, `m`, `edges`, `graph`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- The variables `u`, `v`, and `w` are now assigned the values returned by the function `func_3()`.
- The condition that `m` is greater than 2 remains valid.
- The structure of `edges` and `graph` remains as described in the initial state, with the addition of the new tuple `(w, u, v)` from `func_3()`.
