Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than or equal to 0 (it was originally greater than 0 and has been decremented by the number of iterations), `func_6()` has been called `test_cases` times.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `test_cases` will be greater than or equal to 0 (it started as a positive number and was decremented by 1 for each iteration). The function `func_6()` will have been called a total number of times equal to the original value of `test_cases`.
