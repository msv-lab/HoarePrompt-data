To ensure the `while` loop executes at least once, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head, which is `que`. The loop will execute if `que` is not empty.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `que` is initialized as a deque containing the value of `start`.

For the loop to execute, `que` must contain at least one element. This means `start` must not be -1, as this would result in `que` being an empty deque.

Therefore, we need to ensure that `start` is a valid vertex (not -1) for the loop to execute at least once.

State: **After all iterations of the loop, `n` and `m` remain positive integers such that 3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5). The `edges` list is still a list of `m` tuples sorted in descending order by the first element of each tuple (weight `w`). The `graph` remains a defaultdict of lists, and `i` is 0. The `dsu` instance is updated to reflect the final connected components formed by the union operations. If any two vertices `u` and `v` were found to be in the same component before being unioned, `_min_edge` will be the smallest weight `w` of such an edge, and `start` and `end` will be the corresponding vertices `u` and `v`. Otherwise, `_min_edge` remains infinity, `start` must be a valid vertex (not -1), and `end` remains -1. The `que` is initialized as a deque containing the value of `start`. The `prev` dictionary is initialized with the key `start` and the value `-1`.**
