The code snippet `edges.sort(reverse=True)` sorts the `edges` list in descending order based on the first element of each tuple (which is `w`). This means that after sorting, the edge with the highest weight will be at the beginning of the list, and the edge with the lowest weight will be at the end.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5).
- The `edges` list contains `m` tuples, each of the form `(w, u, v)`.
- The `graph` is a defaultdict of lists, where each key `u` has a list of length equal to the number of times `u` was used as a vertex in the edges added to the graph.
- The index `i` is `m - 1`, indicating that the loop has completed all `m` iterations.

After executing the code snippet, the `edges` list is sorted in descending order based on the weights `w`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5); `edges` is a list of `m` tuples sorted in descending order by the first element of each tuple (weight `w`); `graph` is a defaultdict of lists, where each key `u` has a list of length equal to the number of times `u` was used as a vertex in the edges added to the graph; `i` is `m - 1`.**
