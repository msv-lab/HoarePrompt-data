The code snippet `graph[v].append(u)` adds the value `u` to the list associated with the key `v` in the `graph` dictionary.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5)
- `edges` contains the tuples `(w, u, v)` and the new tuple `(w, u, v)` returned by `func_3()`
- `graph` is a defaultdict of lists with `graph[u]` containing `[v, v, v]` and `graph[v]` containing `[u, u]`
- `i` is 2
- `m` is greater than 2
- `u`, `v`, and `w` are the values returned by `func_3()`

After executing the code snippet:
- The list `graph[v]` now contains `[u, u, u]` because `u` is appended to the existing list `[u, u]`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5), `edges` contains the tuples `(w, u, v)` and the new tuple `(w, u, v)` returned by `func_3()`, `graph` is a defaultdict of lists with `graph[u]` containing `[v, v, v]` and `graph[v]` containing `[u, u, u]`, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than 2, `u`, `v`, and `w` are the values returned by `func_3()`**
