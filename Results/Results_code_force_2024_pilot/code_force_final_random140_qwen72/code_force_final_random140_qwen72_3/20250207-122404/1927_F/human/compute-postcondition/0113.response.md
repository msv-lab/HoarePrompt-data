Output State: **`node` is the element that was at the front of `que` before the operation, `que` contains all elements that were added during the iterations but not yet processed, excluding the element that was just removed, `graph[node]` must contain at least one element, `prev` dictionary now includes an entry for `nei` mapping it to `node`, `nei` is the first neighbor of `node` in `graph[node]`, and all other variables (`n`, `m`, `edges`, `graph`, `i`, `dsu`, `_min_edge`, `start`, `end`) remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `prev[nei] = node` adds an entry to the `prev` dictionary where the key is `nei` and the value is `node`. This means that `nei` is now mapped to `node` in the `prev` dictionary. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
