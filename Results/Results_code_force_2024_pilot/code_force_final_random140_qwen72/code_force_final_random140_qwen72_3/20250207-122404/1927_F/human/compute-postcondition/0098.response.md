Output State: **`node` will be the first element that was in `que` before the operation, and `que` will now contain all elements except the first one that was previously in `que`. The `prev` dictionary will have entries for all these neighbors, mapping them to `start`. If `nei` is not in `prev`, `nei` is appended to `que` and `prev` is updated to map `nei` to `node`. `graph[node]` must contain at least one element. All other variables (`n`, `m`, `edges`, `graph`, `i`, `dsu`, `_min_edge`, `start`, `end`) remain unchanged, and `que` must contain at least one element. The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop. This means that no changes are made to the variables during this iteration, and the state remains the same as described in the initial state.
