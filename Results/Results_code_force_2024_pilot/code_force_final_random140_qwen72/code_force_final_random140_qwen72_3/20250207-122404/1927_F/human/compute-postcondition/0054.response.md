Output State: **`node` is the value of `start`, `que` is a deque containing no elements, `n` and `m` remain positive integers such that 3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5), `edges` is a list of `m` tuples sorted in descending order by the first element of each tuple (weight `w`), `graph` is a defaultdict of lists, `i` is 0, `dsu` instance reflects the final connected components formed by the union operations, `_min_edge` is the smallest weight `w` of an edge connecting two vertices `u` and `v` in the same component or remains infinity, `start` is a valid vertex (not -1), `end` is -1 if no such edge was found, and `prev` is a dictionary with the key `start` and the value `-1`.**
