The function `func_6` accepts no parameters directly within its definition, but based on the context provided, it is expected to operate on a graph defined by the parameters `n`, `m`, and `edges`. Here, `n` and `m` are positive integers representing the number of vertices and edges in the graph, respectively, with the constraints 3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5). The `edges` parameter is a list of tuples (w, u, v), where `w` is a positive integer representing the weight of the edge, and `u`, `v` are integers representing the vertices connected by the edge, with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n and u ≠ v.

However, since the function definition does not explicitly include these parameters, it is assumed that they are passed or defined elsewhere in the code. The function's output is not specified, so it is unclear what the function returns without additional context.

Given the constraints and the typical operations involving graphs, the function might be performing some graph-related computation, such as finding a minimum spanning tree, shortest path, or other graph properties. However, without the specific output, the exact functionality cannot be determined.

Functionality: **The function is expected to operate on a graph defined by the number of vertices `n`, the number of edges `m`, and a list of edges `edges`. It is likely to perform a graph-related computation, but the specific output is not provided, making it unclear what the function returns.**
