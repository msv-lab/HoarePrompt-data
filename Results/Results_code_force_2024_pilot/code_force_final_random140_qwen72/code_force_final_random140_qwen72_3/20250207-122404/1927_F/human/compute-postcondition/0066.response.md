The only objects in the loop head are `nei` and `graph[node]`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on `graph[node]`. If `graph[node]` contains elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `graph[node]` contains at least one element. For the loop to execute one more time, `graph[node]` must still contain at least one element, and `nei` should be the next element in `graph[node]`.

State: **`node` is the value of `start`, `graph[node]` contains at least one element, `nei` is the next element in `graph[node]`**
