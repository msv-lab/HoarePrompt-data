The only variable in the loop head is `que`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `que`. If `que` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `que` will contain all neighbors of `start` that were not previously in `prev`. For the loop to execute one more time, `que` must still contain at least one element.

State: **After all iterations, `node` will be the last processed neighbor from `graph[start]` that was not equal to `end`, and `que` will contain all neighbors of `start` that were not previously in `prev`. The `prev` dictionary will have entries for all these neighbors, mapping them to `start`. All other variables (`n`, `m`, `edges`, `graph`, `i`, `dsu`, `_min_edge`, `start`, `end`) remain unchanged, and `que` must contain at least one element.**
