Output State: **After all iterations, `node` will be the last processed node from `que` or `end` if it was reached, and `que` will be empty. The `prev` dictionary will have entries for all nodes that were reachable from `start` and not previously in `prev`, mapping each node to its predecessor in the path. If `end` was reached, the loop will have terminated early when `node` became `end`. All other variables (`n`, `m`, `edges`, `graph`, `i`, `dsu`, `_min_edge`, `start`, `end`) remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- **`node`**: This will be the last node processed from `que` or `end` if `end` was reached.
- **`que`**: This will be empty because the loop continues until `que` is exhausted or `node` becomes `end`.
- **`prev`**: This dictionary will map each node that was reachable from `start` to its predecessor in the path. This helps in reconstructing the path from `start` to `end` if `end` was reached.
- **Other Variables**: All other variables (`n`, `m`, `edges`, `graph`, `i`, `dsu`, `_min_edge`, `start`, `end`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
