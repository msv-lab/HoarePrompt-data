Postcondition: ***After all iterations, `node` will be the first element that was in `que` before the operation, and `que` will now contain all elements except the first one that was previously in `que`. The `prev` dictionary will have entries for all these neighbors, mapping them to `start`. All other variables (`n`, `m`, `edges`, `graph`, `i`, `dsu`, `_min_edge`, `start`, `end`) remain unchanged, and `que` must contain at least one element. If `node` is equal to `end`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
