The only object in the loop head is `que`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the queue `que`. If `que` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `que` contains all elements that were added during the iterations but not yet processed. For the loop to execute one more time, `que` must still contain at least one element.

State: **After all iterations, `node` will be the last element that was processed from `que`, and `que` will contain all elements that were added during the iterations but not yet processed. The `prev` dictionary will have entries for all nodes that were neighbors of the processed nodes, mapping each neighbor to its corresponding `node`. If `node` is equal to `end`, the loop will terminate early. All other variables (`n`, `m`, `edges`, `graph`, `i`, `dsu`, `_min_edge`, `start`, `end`) remain unchanged. `que` must contain at least one element.**
