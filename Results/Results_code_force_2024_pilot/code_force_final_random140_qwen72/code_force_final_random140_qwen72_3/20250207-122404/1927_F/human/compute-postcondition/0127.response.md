Postcondition: ***`node` is the element that was at the front of `que` before the operation, `que` now includes all elements that were added during the iterations but not yet processed. If `nei` is not in `prev`, `que` now includes `nei`, and `prev` dictionary includes an entry for `nei` mapping it to `node`. `graph[node]` must contain at least three elements, `nei` is the third neighbor of `node` in `graph[node]`, and `prev[nei]` is now set to `node`. All other variables (`n`, `m`, `edges`, `graph`, `i`, `dsu`, `_min_edge`, `start`, `end`) remain unchanged. If `node` is equal to `start` and `nei` is equal to `end`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.***
