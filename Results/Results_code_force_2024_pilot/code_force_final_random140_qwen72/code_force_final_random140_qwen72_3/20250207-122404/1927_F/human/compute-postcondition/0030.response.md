Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5), `edges` is a list of `m` tuples sorted in descending order by the first element of each tuple (weight `w`), `graph` is a defaultdict of lists, `i` is `m - 1`, `dsu` is an instance of the `DSU` class initialized with `n + 1`, `_min_edge` is `w`, `start` is `u`, `end` is `v`, `(w, u, v)` is the first tuple in `edges`, `parent_u` is the parent of `u` as determined by the `dsu.find(u)` method, `parent_v` is the parent of `v` as determined by the `dsu.find(v)` method, and `parent_u` is equal to `parent_v`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `v` to the variable `end`. All other variables and their values remain unchanged. Therefore, the only change in the output state is that `end` now holds the value `v`.
