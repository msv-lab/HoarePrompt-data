The code snippet `prev[nei] = node` updates the dictionary `prev` by setting the key `nei` to the value of `node`. This means that `prev[nei]` now holds the value of `node`.

Given the initial state:
- `node` is the value of `start`.
- `graph[node]` contains at least one element.
- `nei` is the next element in `graph[node]`.
- If `node` is equal to `start` and `nei` is equal to `end`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program proceeds as usual.

After executing the code snippet:
- `prev[nei]` is set to `node`.
- All other conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`node` is the value of `start`, `graph[node]` contains at least one element, `nei` is the next element in `graph[node]`, `prev[nei]` is set to `node`. If `node` is equal to `start` and `nei` is equal to `end`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program proceeds as usual.**
