The code appends a new tuple `(w, u, v)` to the list `edges`. The values of `w`, `u`, and `v` are returned by the function `func_3()`. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `graph`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5), `edges` contains the tuples `(w, u, v)` and the new tuple `(w, u, v)` returned by `func_3()`, `graph` is a defaultdict of lists with `graph[u]` containing `[v, v]` and `graph[v]` containing `[u, u]`, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than 1, `u`, `v`, and `w` are the values returned by `func_3()`**.
