Functionality: ** The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters. It reads a number of test cases using `func_1`, and then iterates over this number, calling `func_6` for each test case. After the function completes, the number of times `func_6` has been called is equal to the number of test cases initially read by `func_1`. The function does not return any value. **
