To determine the state adjustments necessary for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop structure:

### Given Information:
- `node` is the first element that was in `que` before the operation.
- `que` now contains all elements except the first one that was previously in `que`.
- `prev` dictionary has entries for all these neighbors, mapping them to `start`.
- If `nei` is not in `prev`, `nei` is appended to `que` and `prev` is updated to map `nei` to `node`.
- `graph[node]` must contain at least one element.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `edges`, `graph`, `i`, `dsu`, `_min_edge`, `start`, `end`) remain unchanged.
- `que` must contain at least one element.
- If `node` is equal to `start` and `nei` is equal to `end`, the current iteration of the loop ends and the next iteration begins immediately.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for nei in graph[node]:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head involves `nei` and `graph[node]`.
2. **Conditions for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `graph[node]` contains elements.
   - The variable `nei` will take the value of each element in `graph[node]`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- Since the loop iterates over `graph[node]`, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the list of neighbors `graph[node]`.
- The loop will execute again if `graph[node]` still contains elements.

### State After Adjustment:
- `node` remains the same (the first element that was in `que` before the operation).
- `que` remains the same (contains all elements except the first one that was previously in `que`).
- `prev` remains the same (has entries for all these neighbors, mapping them to `start`).
- `graph[node]` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute again.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `edges`, `graph`, `i`, `dsu`, `_min_edge`, `start`, `end`) remain unchanged.
- `que` must contain at least one element.

### Final State:
State: **`node` will be the first element that was in `que` before the operation, and `que` will now contain all elements except the first one that was previously in `que`. The `prev` dictionary will have entries for all these neighbors, mapping them to `start`. If `nei` is not in `prev`, `nei` is appended to `que` and `prev` is updated to map `nei` to `node`. `graph[node]` must contain at least one element. All other variables (`n`, `m`, `edges`, `graph`, `i`, `dsu`, `_min_edge`, `start`, `end`) remain unchanged, and `que` must contain at least one element. If `node` is equal to `start` and `nei` is equal to `end`, the current iteration of the loop ends and the next iteration begins immediately.**
