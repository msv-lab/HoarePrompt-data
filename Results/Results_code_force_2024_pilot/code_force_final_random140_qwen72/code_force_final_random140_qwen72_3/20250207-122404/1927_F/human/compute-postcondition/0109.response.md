Postcondition: **`node` is the element that was at the front of `que` before the operation, `que` contains all elements that were added during the iterations but not yet processed, excluding the element that was just removed, `graph[node]` must contain at least one element, `prev` dictionary has entries for all nodes that were neighbors of the processed nodes, mapping each neighbor to its corresponding `node`, `nei` is the first neighbor of `node` in `graph[node]`, `node` is equal to `start`, `nei` is equal to `end`, and all other variables (`n`, `m`, `edges`, `graph`, `i`, `dsu`, `_min_edge`) remain unchanged.**
