To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects present in the loop head, which in this case is `nei` and `graph[node]`.

1. **`nei`**: This variable will be assigned values from the list `graph[node]` during each iteration of the loop.
2. **`graph[node]`**: For the loop to execute, `graph[node]` must contain at least one element. If `graph[node]` is empty, the loop will not execute.

Given the initial state:
- `node` is the value of `start`.
- `graph` is a defaultdict of lists.

For the loop to execute, `graph[node]` must contain at least one element. The other variables and objects mentioned in the state (like `que`, `n`, `m`, `edges`, `i`, `dsu`, `_min_edge`, `start`, `end`, and `prev`) are not directly involved in the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the adjusted state should ensure that `graph[node]` is not empty.

State: **`node` is the value of `start`, `graph[node]` must contain at least one element**
