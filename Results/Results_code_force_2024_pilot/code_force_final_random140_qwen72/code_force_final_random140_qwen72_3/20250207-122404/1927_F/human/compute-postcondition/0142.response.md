Based on the initial state provided:

- `_min_edge` remains unchanged from its original value.
- `path` is a list containing the full path from `end` back to `start` (or the first node in the path that has no predecessor).
- `len(path)` will give the number of nodes in the path from `end` back to `start`.

Given this information, the `print` statement will output the value of `_min_edge` and the length of the `path` list.

Output: **_min_edge, len(path) (where _min_edge is the value of _min_edge and len(path) is the number of nodes in the path from end back to start)**
