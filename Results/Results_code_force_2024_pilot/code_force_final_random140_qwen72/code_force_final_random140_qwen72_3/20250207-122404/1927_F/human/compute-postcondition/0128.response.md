Output State: **`node` is the last element that was processed from `que`, `que` contains all elements that were added during the iterations but not yet processed, excluding the elements that were just removed. The `prev` dictionary has entries for all nodes that were neighbors of the processed nodes, mapping each neighbor to its corresponding `node`. If `node` is equal to `end`, the loop terminated early. All other variables (`n`, `m`, `edges`, `graph`, `i`, `dsu`, `_min_edge`, `start`, `end`) remain unchanged. `que` may be empty if all elements were processed.**
