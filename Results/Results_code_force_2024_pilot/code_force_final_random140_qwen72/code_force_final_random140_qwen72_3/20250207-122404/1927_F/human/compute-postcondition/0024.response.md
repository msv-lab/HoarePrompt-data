To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head: `w`, `u`, and `v` from the `edges` list. The loop will execute if `edges` contains at least one tuple.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5)
- `edges` is a list of `m` tuples sorted in descending order by the first element of each tuple (weight `w`)
- `graph` is a defaultdict of lists
- `i` is `m - 1`
- `dsu` is an instance of the `DSU` class initialized with `n + 1`
- `_min_edge` is infinity
- `start` is -1
- `end` is -1

For the loop to execute, `edges` must contain at least one tuple. Since `m` is the number of tuples in `edges` and `m` is at least 3, `edges` will always have at least one tuple. Therefore, the loop will execute as long as `edges` is not empty.

However, to ensure the loop starts correctly, we need to set the initial values of `w`, `u`, and `v` to the first tuple in `edges`.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5), `edges` is a list of `m` tuples sorted in descending order by the first element of each tuple (weight `w`), `graph` is a defaultdict of lists, `i` is `m - 1`, `dsu` is an instance of the `DSU` class initialized with `n + 1`, `_min_edge` is infinity, `start` is -1, `end` is -1, `(w, u, v)` is the first tuple in `edges`**
