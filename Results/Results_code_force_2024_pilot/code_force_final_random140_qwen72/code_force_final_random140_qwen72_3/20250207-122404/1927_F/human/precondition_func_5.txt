n and m are positive integers representing the number of vertices and edges in the graph, respectively, such that 3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5). edges is a list of tuples (w, u, v) where w is a positive integer representing the weight of the edge, and u, v are integers representing the vertices connected by the edge, with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n and u ≠ v.
