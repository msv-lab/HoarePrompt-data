### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program uses functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, and `func_5` to handle different types of input. These functions read and parse input from `sys.stdin`.
   - `func_1` reads a single integer.
   - `func_3` reads and returns a tuple of integers.
   - `func_4` reads and returns a list of integers.
   - `func_5` reads and returns a list of strings.

2. **Graph Construction:**
   - The program constructs a graph using a `defaultdict` of lists. Each key in the dictionary represents a vertex, and the value is a list of adjacent vertices.
   - It also maintains a list of edges, where each edge is represented as a tuple `(weight, u, v)`.

3. **Edge Sorting:**
   - The edges are sorted in descending order of their weights. This is done to ensure that the heaviest edges are considered first when trying to find a cycle.

4. **Disjoint Set Union (DSU):**
   - A DSU (or Union-Find) data structure is used to keep track of connected components in the graph.
   - The program iterates over the sorted edges and uses the DSU to check if adding an edge would form a cycle. If a cycle is detected, the edge weight is stored as `_min_edge`, and the start and end vertices of the cycle are recorded.

5. **Cycle Detection:**
   - Once a cycle is detected, a BFS (Breadth-First Search) is performed starting from the start vertex to find the path back to the end vertex.
   - The BFS ensures that the path does not revisit any vertex, thus forming a simple cycle.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the minimum edge weight in the cycle and the length of the cycle.
   - It then prints the vertices of the cycle in traversal order.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the input and constructs the graph.
- The use of DSU to detect cycles is appropriate and efficient.
- The BFS ensures that the cycle is simple and does not revisit any vertex.
- The program correctly outputs the required information for each test case.

Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description.

**Correctness: True**
