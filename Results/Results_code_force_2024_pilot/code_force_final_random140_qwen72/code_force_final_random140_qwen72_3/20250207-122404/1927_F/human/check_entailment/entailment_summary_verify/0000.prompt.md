You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Given an undirected weighted graph with n vertices and m edges. There is at
most one edge between each pair of vertices in the graph, and the graph does
not contain loops (edges from a vertex to itself). The graph is not
necessarily connected.

A cycle in the graph is called simple if it doesn't pass through the same
vertex twice and doesn't contain the same edge twice.

Find any simple cycle in this graph in which the weight of the lightest edge
is minimal.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (3 \le n \le m
\le \min(\frac{n\cdot(n - 1)}{2}, 2 \cdot 10^5) ) — the size of the graph and
the number of edges.

The next m lines of the test case contain three integers u , v , and w (1 \le
u, v \le n , u \ne v , 1 \le w \le 10^6 ) — vertices u and v are connected by
an edge of weight w .

It is guaranteed that there is at most one edge between each pair of vertices.
Note that under the given constraints, there is always at least one simple
cycle in the graph.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of m for all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a pair of numbers b and k , where:

  * b — the minimum weight of the edge in the found cycle, 
  * k — the number of vertices in the found cycle. 

On the next line, output k numbers from 1 to n — the vertices of the cycle in
traversal order.

Note that the answer always exists, as under the given constraints, there is
always at least one simple cycle in the graph.

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 7 : The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters. It reads a number of test cases using `func_1`, and then iterates over this number, calling `func_6` for each test case. After the function completes, the number of times `func_6` has been called is equal to the number of test cases initially read by `func_1`. The function does not return any value.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program has a logical flaw in how it handles the discovery of cycles and the construction of the cycle path. Specifically, the issue lies in the way the program uses the Disjoint Set Union (DSU) structure to detect cycles and the subsequent BFS to reconstruct the cycle path.

### Issue Explanation:
1. **Cycle Detection and Edge Weight Handling:**
   - The program sorts the edges in descending order of their weights and uses a DSU to detect cycles. When it finds a cycle (i.e., both endpoints of an edge belong to the same set), it assumes that this is the cycle with the minimum edge weight.
   - However, this approach may not always find the correct cycle with the minimum edge weight. For example, consider a graph where the minimum weight edge is part of a larger cycle, but the program might detect a smaller cycle with a higher minimum edge weight first.

2. **Path Reconstruction:**
   - The program uses a BFS to reconstruct the cycle path from the start to the end vertex of the detected cycle. However, the BFS does not guarantee that the path it constructs is a simple cycle. It might include additional vertices that are not part of the original cycle, leading to an incorrect output.

### Example Case:
Consider the following graph:
- Vertices: 4
- Edges: (1, 2, 1), (2, 3, 2), (3, 4, 3), (4, 1, 4)

In this graph, the cycle with the minimum edge weight is (1, 2, 3, 4) with the minimum edge weight being 1. However, the program might detect the cycle (2, 3, 4) with the minimum edge weight being 2, which is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle all potential cases, particularly in detecting the cycle with the minimum edge weight and ensuring that the reconstructed path is a simple cycle. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
