### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, and `func_5` are responsible for reading different types of input from the standard input (stdin). These functions are correctly implemented and handle the input as expected.

2. **Graph Construction and Edge Sorting**:
   - In `func_6`, the graph is constructed using a `defaultdict` of lists, and the edges are stored in a list of tuples. The edges are then sorted in descending order by weight. This is a crucial step for finding the minimum weight cycle.

3. **Disjoint Set Union (DSU) for Cycle Detection**:
   - The DSU data structure is used to detect cycles. The idea is to iterate through the sorted edges and use the DSU to check if adding an edge forms a cycle. If a cycle is detected, the minimum weight edge in the cycle is recorded.

4. **Path Reconstruction**:
   - Once a cycle is detected, a breadth-first search (BFS) is performed to reconstruct the path of the cycle. The BFS starts from the start vertex and continues until it reaches the end vertex, recording the path in a dictionary `prev`.

5. **Output**:
   - The function prints the minimum weight of the cycle and the length of the cycle path, followed by the nodes in the cycle path in reverse order.

6. **Test Case Handling**:
   - The function `func_7` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_6` for each test case. This ensures that the program processes multiple test cases as required by the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find a simple cycle with the minimum weight of the lightest edge in an undirected weighted graph. Each function performs its intended task, and the overall structure of the program aligns with the problem requirements.

**Correctness: True**
