Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of finding a simple cycle in an undirected weighted graph where the weight of the lightest edge is minimal. Let's break down the components and their roles:

1. **Disjoint Set Union (DSU) Class**:
   - This class is used to manage the connected components of the graph. It supports efficient union and find operations, which are crucial for detecting cycles in the graph.

2. **Input Reading Functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`)**:
   - These functions handle reading different types of input from the standard input. They are used to parse the number of test cases, the number of vertices and edges, and the edges themselves.

3. **Main Function (`func_6`)**:
   - This function processes each test case. It reads the graph, sorts the edges by weight in descending order, and uses the DSU to detect cycles.
   - When a cycle is detected (i.e., when two vertices are already in the same component), it records the minimum weight edge in the cycle.
   - It then performs a breadth-first search (BFS) to find the path forming the cycle and prints the required output.

4. **Test Case Handler (`func_7`)**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases and calls `func_6` for each test case.

### Analysis of `func_6`:
- **Graph Construction**:
  - The graph is constructed using an adjacency list representation.
  - Edges are stored in a list and sorted in descending order by weight.

- **Cycle Detection**:
  - The DSU is used to keep track of connected components.
  - For each edge, if the two vertices are already in the same component, a cycle is detected.
  - The minimum weight edge in the cycle is recorded.

- **Path Reconstruction**:
  - A BFS is performed starting from one vertex of the cycle to find the path back to the other vertex.
  - The path is reconstructed and printed in reverse order.

### Potential Issues:
- **Edge Sorting**:
  - The edges are sorted in descending order by weight. This ensures that the first cycle detected will have the maximum possible weight, which is not what we want. We need to sort the edges in ascending order to find the cycle with the minimum weight edge.

### Conclusion:
The current implementation of `func_6` sorts the edges in descending order, which is incorrect for the problem statement. The edges should be sorted in ascending order to ensure that the first cycle detected has the minimum weight edge.

Therefore, the program is **incorrect** as it does not meet the problem requirements.

Correctness: **False**
