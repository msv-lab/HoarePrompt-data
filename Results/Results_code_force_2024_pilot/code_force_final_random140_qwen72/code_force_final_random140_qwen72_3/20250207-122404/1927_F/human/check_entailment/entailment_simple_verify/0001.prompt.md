You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given an undirected weighted graph with n vertices and m edges. There is at
most one edge between each pair of vertices in the graph, and the graph does
not contain loops (edges from a vertex to itself). The graph is not
necessarily connected.

A cycle in the graph is called simple if it doesn't pass through the same
vertex twice and doesn't contain the same edge twice.

Find any simple cycle in this graph in which the weight of the lightest edge
is minimal.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (3 \le n \le m
\le \min(\frac{n\cdot(n - 1)}{2}, 2 \cdot 10^5) ) — the size of the graph and
the number of edges.

The next m lines of the test case contain three integers u , v , and w (1 \le
u, v \le n , u \ne v , 1 \le w \le 10^6 ) — vertices u and v are connected by
an edge of weight w .

It is guaranteed that there is at most one edge between each pair of vertices.
Note that under the given constraints, there is always at least one simple
cycle in the graph.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of m for all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a pair of numbers b and k , where:

  * b — the minimum weight of the edge in the found cycle, 
  * k — the number of vertices in the found cycle. 

On the next line, output k numbers from 1 to n — the vertices of the cycle in
traversal order.

Note that the answer always exists, as under the given constraints, there is
always at least one simple cycle in the graph.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, and `func_5` are used to read input from standard input. These functions are correctly defined and handle different types of input (integers, lists, etc.).

2. **Graph Construction:**
   - The function `func_6` reads the number of vertices `n` and edges `m`, constructs the graph using adjacency lists, and stores the edges in a list with their weights.
   - The edges are sorted in descending order by weight, which is a key part of the algorithm to find the lightest edge in a cycle.

3. **Disjoint Set Union (DSU):**
   - A DSU (or Union-Find) data structure is used to keep track of connected components. This is crucial for detecting cycles.
   - The DSU is initialized with `n + 1` elements to handle 1-based indexing.

4. **Cycle Detection:**
   - The algorithm iterates over the sorted edges. For each edge, it checks if the two endpoints are already in the same component (using `dsu.find`). If they are, it means adding this edge would form a cycle.
   - The first such edge found is the lightest edge in a cycle, and its endpoints are stored as `start` and `end`.

5. **Path Reconstruction:**
   - A breadth-first search (BFS) is performed starting from `start` to find the path to `end`. The BFS uses a queue and a dictionary `prev` to keep track of the previous node in the path.
   - Once the path is found, it is printed in reverse order.

6. **Test Case Handling:**
   - The function `func_7` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_6` for each test case.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the input and constructs the graph.
- The use of DSU ensures that cycles are detected efficiently.
- The BFS correctly reconstructs the path of the cycle.
- The program outputs the required results for each test case.

Therefore, the given program is correct based on the problem description.

**Correctness: True**
