The code snippet `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `arr`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `_` is 1
- `n` is an input integer
- `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input
- `s` is now a list containing 0 followed by all unique elements of `arr` in an unspecified order
- `i` is `n-1`
- If `n` is 2, `ans` remains 1. Otherwise, if `ans` is 1, it indicates that the loop broke due to the condition `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1` being true at some point during the iterations. If `ans` is 0, it indicates that the loop did not break due to the condition `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1` being true at any point during the iterations.

After executing the code snippet:
- `arr` is updated to a new list of integers derived from the input.

The other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `s`, `i`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `s` is now a list containing 0 followed by all unique elements of the new `arr` in an unspecified order, `i` is `n-1`. If `n` is 2, `ans` remains 1. Otherwise, if `ans` is 1, it indicates that the loop broke due to the condition `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1` being true at some point during the iterations. If `ans` is 0, it indicates that the loop did not break due to the condition `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1` being true at any point during the iterations.**
