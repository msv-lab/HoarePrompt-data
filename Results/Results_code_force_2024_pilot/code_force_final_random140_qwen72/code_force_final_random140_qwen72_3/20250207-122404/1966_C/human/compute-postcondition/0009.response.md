The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input, `s` is a set containing the first two elements of `arr`, `i` is 2**
