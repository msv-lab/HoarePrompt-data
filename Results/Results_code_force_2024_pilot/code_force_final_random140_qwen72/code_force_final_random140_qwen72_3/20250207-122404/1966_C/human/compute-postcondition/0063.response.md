The value of `ans` is toggled between 0 and 1. Initially, `ans` is 1, so after executing `ans = 1 - ans`, `ans` becomes 0. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `arr` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `s` is a list containing all elements of `arr` with an additional 0 at the beginning, `i` is 1, `ans` is 0, and the difference between `s[i]` and `s[i - 1]` is less than or equal to 1.**
