Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers representing the number of stones in each pile. For each test case, it determines and prints whether "Alice" or "Bob" wins based on the unique values in the list of stones. If the list contains only one unique value, "Alice" wins. Otherwise, it iterates through the sorted unique values and toggles a win state based on the difference between consecutive values. If the difference is greater than 1 at any point, the loop breaks, and the current win state is used to determine the winner. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without modifying any global state. **
