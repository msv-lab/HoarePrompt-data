Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `arr` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `s` is a list containing all elements of `arr` with an additional 0 at the beginning, `i` is 1, `ans` is 1, and the difference between the second element of `s` and the first element of `s` (which is 0) is greater than 1.**
