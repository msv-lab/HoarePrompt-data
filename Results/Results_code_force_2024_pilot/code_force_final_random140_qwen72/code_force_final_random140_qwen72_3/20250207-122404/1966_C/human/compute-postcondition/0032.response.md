Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 3, `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input, `s` is now a list containing 0 followed by all unique elements of `arr` in an unspecified order, `i` is 3, `ans` is 0.**

Explanation: The value of `ans` was initially 1. After executing the line `ans = 1 - ans`, `ans` is updated to 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
