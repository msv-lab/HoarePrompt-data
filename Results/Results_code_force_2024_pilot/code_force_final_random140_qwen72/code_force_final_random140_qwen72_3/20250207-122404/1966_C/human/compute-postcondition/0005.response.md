The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` should start at 0, as this is the initial state for the loop counter in Python's `range()` function.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input, `s` is an empty set, `i` is 0**
