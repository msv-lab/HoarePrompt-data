Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input, `s` is an empty set.**

Explanation: The code initializes a new set `s` and assigns it an empty set. The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions plus the new state of `s`.
