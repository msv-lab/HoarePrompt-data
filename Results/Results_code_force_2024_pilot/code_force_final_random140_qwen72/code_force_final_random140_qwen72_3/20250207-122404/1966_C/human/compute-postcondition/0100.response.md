Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is `n-1`, `s` is a list with 0 prepended to all elements of `arr`, `ans` is 1, and the difference between the `i`-th element of `s` and the `(i-1)`-th element of `s` is greater than 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `n`, `i`, `s`, and `ans` remain unchanged, but the `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is currently executing within.
