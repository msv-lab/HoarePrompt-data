Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `arr` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `s` is a list containing all elements of `arr` with an additional 0 at the beginning, `i` is `n-2`. The difference between any two consecutive elements in `s` (from index 1 to `n-2`) is less than or equal to 1, and `ans` is 0.**
