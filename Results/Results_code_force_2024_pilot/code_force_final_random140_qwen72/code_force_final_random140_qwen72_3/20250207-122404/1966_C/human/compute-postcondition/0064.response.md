Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `arr` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `s` is a list containing all elements of `arr` with an additional 0 at the beginning, `i` is 1. If the difference between the second element of `s` and the first element of `s` (which is 0) is greater than 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `ans` remains 1. Otherwise, if the difference between `s[i]` and `s[i - 1]` is less than or equal to 1, `ans` is set to 0.***
