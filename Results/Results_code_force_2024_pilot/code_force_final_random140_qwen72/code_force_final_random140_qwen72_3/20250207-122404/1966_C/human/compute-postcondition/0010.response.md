Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input, `s` is a set containing the first three elements of `arr`, `i` is 2**

Explanation: The code `s.add(arr[i])` adds the third element of the list `arr` (since `i` is 2) to the set `s`. Initially, `s` contained the first two elements of `arr`. After executing the code, `s` now contains the first three elements of `arr`. All other variables remain unchanged.
