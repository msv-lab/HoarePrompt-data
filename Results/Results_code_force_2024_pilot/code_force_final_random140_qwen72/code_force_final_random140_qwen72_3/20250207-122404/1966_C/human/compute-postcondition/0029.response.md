Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input, `s` is now a list containing 0 followed by all unique elements of `arr` in an unspecified order, `i` is 2. If `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is 1.**
