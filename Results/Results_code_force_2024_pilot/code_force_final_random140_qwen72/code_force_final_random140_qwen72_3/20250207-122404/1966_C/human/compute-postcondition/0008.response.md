Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input, `s` is a set containing the first two elements of `arr`, `i` is 1**

Explanation: The code adds the second element of the list `arr` to the set `s`. Initially, `s` contained only the first element of `arr`. After executing the code, `s` now contains both the first and the second elements of `arr`. All other variables remain unchanged.
