The value of `ans` is updated to `1 - ans`. Given the initial state, `ans` is 0 if the difference between `s[1]` and `s[0]` is less than or equal to 1, otherwise `ans` is 1. After executing the code, `ans` will be 1 if it was 0, and 0 if it was 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `arr` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `s` is a list containing all elements of `arr` with an additional 0 at the beginning, `i` is 2, `ans` is 1 if the difference between `s[1]` and `s[0]` is less than or equal to 1, otherwise `ans` is 0.**
