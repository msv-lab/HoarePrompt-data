Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `i` is `n-2`, and `s` is a list with 0 prepended to all elements of `arr`. The value of `ans` depends on the differences between consecutive elements in `s`. If any difference is greater than 1, the loop breaks and `ans` retains its last value before the break. Otherwise, `ans` toggles between 0 and 1 for each iteration until the loop completes. After the if-else block, `ans` will either be 1 (if the condition was true) or 0 (if the condition was false).***
