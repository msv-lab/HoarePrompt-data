Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input, `s` is now a list containing 0 followed by all unique elements of `arr` in an unspecified order, `i` is 1, `ans` is 1, and the difference between the second element of `s` and the first element of `s` (which is 0) is greater than 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
