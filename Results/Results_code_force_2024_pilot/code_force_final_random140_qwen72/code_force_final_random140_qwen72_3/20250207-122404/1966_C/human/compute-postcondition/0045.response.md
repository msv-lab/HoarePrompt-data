To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `_` is 1.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `arr` is a list of integers derived from the new input.
- `s` is an empty set.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- If `n` is 2, `ans` remains 1.
- Otherwise, if `ans` is 1, it indicates that the loop broke due to the condition `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1` being true at some point during the iterations.
- If `ans` is 0, it indicates that the loop did not break due to the condition `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1` being true at any point during the iterations.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.
2. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. This is because `range(n)` generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to `n-1`, and if `n` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`n`**: For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0.
- **`i`**: The variable `i` is initialized by the loop itself, starting from 0. Therefore, we do not need to adjust `i` explicitly.

### Final State:
The state before the loop starts should ensure that `n` is greater than 0. The other variables (`t`, `_`, `arr`, `s`, `ans`) are not directly involved in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `s` is an empty set, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is 1 if `n` is 2 or if the loop broke due to the condition `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1` being true at some point, otherwise `ans` is 0**.
