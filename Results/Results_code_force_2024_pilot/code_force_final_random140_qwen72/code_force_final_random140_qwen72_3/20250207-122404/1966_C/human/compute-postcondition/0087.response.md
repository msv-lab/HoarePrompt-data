The code `s.add(arr[i])` adds the element at index `i` of the array `arr` to the set `s`. Given that `i` is 1, the element `arr[1]` is added to `s`. The initial state specifies that `s` already contains `arr[0]`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `s` contains `arr[0]` and `arr[1]`.**
