Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 3, `arr` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `s` is a list containing all elements of `arr` with an additional 0 at the beginning, `i` is 3, `ans` is 1 if the difference between `s[2]` and `s[1]` is greater than 1, otherwise `ans` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
