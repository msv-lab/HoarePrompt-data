The code snippet `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into multiple parts (based on spaces), converts each part to an integer, and stores these integers in a list called `arr`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `_` is 0
- `n` is an input integer

After executing the code:
- `arr` is now a list of integers derived from the input.

The values of `t`, `_`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input.**
