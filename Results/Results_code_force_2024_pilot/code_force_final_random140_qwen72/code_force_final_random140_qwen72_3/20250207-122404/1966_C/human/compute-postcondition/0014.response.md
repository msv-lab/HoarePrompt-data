Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input, `s` is now a list containing all unique elements of `arr` in an unspecified order, `i` is n-1, `ans` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The variable `ans` is assigned the value 1.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `arr`, `s`, `i`) retain their initial values or conditions as specified in the initial state.
