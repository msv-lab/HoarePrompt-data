Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input, `s` is a set containing all elements of `arr`, `i` is n-1.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 10,000.
- The variable `_` remains 0, as it is not modified by the loop.
- The variable `n` retains its original value, which is the length of the list `arr`.
- The list `arr` remains unchanged, as it is only read during the loop.
- The set `s` now contains all the elements from the list `arr`, as each element is added to the set during each iteration of the loop.
- The loop index `i` ends up being `n-1`, which is the last index of the list `arr`.
