The code `s = list(s)` converts `s` into a list. Since `s` initially contains all elements of `arr`, after executing this line, `s` will be a list containing all the elements of `arr`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` remains unchanged, `i` is `n-1`, `s` is a list containing all elements of `arr`.**
