Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `arr` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `s` is a list containing all elements of `arr` with an additional 0 at the beginning, `i` is `n-2`. If the difference between any two consecutive elements in `s` (from index 1 to `n-2`) is greater than 1, `ans` is 1 and the loop breaks. Otherwise, if all differences between consecutive elements in `s` (from index 1 to `n-2`) are less than or equal to 1, `ans` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n-2`.
- For each iteration, the loop checks if the difference between `s[i]` and `s[i-1]` is greater than 1.
- If the condition is met, the loop breaks and `ans` remains 1.
- If the condition is never met throughout the loop, `ans` is toggled between 0 and 1 for each iteration, but since the loop starts with `ans` as 1, it will end up being 0 if the loop completes without breaking.
