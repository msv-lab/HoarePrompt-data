Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `arr` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `s` is a list containing all elements of `arr` with an additional 0 at the beginning, `i` is 2, `ans` is 0 if the difference between `s[1]` and `s[0]` is less than or equal to 1, otherwise `ans` remains 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
