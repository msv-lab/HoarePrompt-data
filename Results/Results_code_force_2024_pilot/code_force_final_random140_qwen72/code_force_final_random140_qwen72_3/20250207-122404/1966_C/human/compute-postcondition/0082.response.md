Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers derived from the new input, `s` is a list containing all elements of `arr` with an additional 0 at the beginning, `i` is `n-2` if `n` > 2, otherwise `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is 1 if the difference between any two consecutive elements in `s` (from index 1 to `n-2`) is greater than 1, otherwise `ans` is 0.**
