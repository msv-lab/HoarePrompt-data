Let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. `_` is 0.
2. `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
3. `a` is a list of integers read from input.
4. `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` (where `i` is an element in `a`) is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `i` in `a`, and all other elements are 0.
5. The first element of `cntl` (`cntl[0]`) is not 0.
6. `c` is the minimum of 1 and `cntl[0] - 1`.
7. `j` is 1.
8. The current value of `cntl[j]` is greater than 0 and less than 2.
9. `c` is 0.

Given these conditions, let's analyze the value of `j`:

- `j` is explicitly set to 1.
- The condition states that `cntl[j]` is greater than 0 and less than 2. Since `j` is 1, this means `cntl[1]` is 1 (the only integer between 0 and 2).

Therefore, when the `print(j)` statement is executed, it will print the value of `j`, which is 1.

Output: **1**
