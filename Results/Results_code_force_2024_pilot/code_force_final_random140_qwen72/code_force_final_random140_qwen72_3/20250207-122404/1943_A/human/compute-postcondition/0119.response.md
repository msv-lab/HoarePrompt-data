Let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. `a` is a list of integers.
2. `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` in `cntl` represents the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in `a`.
3. `cntl[0]` is not 0.
4. `c` is the minimum of 1 and `cntl[0]`.
5. `j` is 1.
6. `n` must be at least 1.
7. The current value of `cntl[j]` is greater than 0 but less than 2.
8. `c` is 0.

From these conditions, we can deduce the following:

- Since `c` is the minimum of 1 and `cntl[0]`, and `c` is 0, it implies that `cntl[0]` must be 0. This seems contradictory to the condition that `cntl[0]` is not 0. However, since `c` is explicitly stated to be 0, we must accept this as true.
- `j` is 1.
- `cntl[j]` is greater than 0 but less than 2. Since `cntl[j]` is an integer, the only value that satisfies this condition is 1.

Given these deductions, the `print(j)` statement will print the value of `j`, which is 1.

Output: **1**
