Output State: **`a` is a list of integers that must have at least three elements, `i` is the third element of `a`, `cntl[a[0]]` is incremented by 1, `cntl[a[1]]` is incremented by 1, `cntl[i]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `cntl[i] += 1` increments the value of `cntl[i]` by 1. Since `i` is the third element of `a`, the value at `cntl[a[2]]` is incremented by 1. The initial conditions that `cntl[a[0]]` and `cntl[a[1]]` are incremented by 1 remain unchanged. Therefore, the final state includes all these updates.
