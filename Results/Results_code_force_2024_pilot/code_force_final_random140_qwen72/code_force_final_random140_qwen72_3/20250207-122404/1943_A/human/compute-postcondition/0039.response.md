Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` (where `i` is an element in `a`) is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `i` in `a`, and all other elements are 0, the first element of `cntl` (cntl[0]) is not 0, `j` is 3, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
