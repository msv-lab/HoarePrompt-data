Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` is an updated input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` (where `i` is an element in `a`) is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `i` in `a`, and all other elements are 0, if `cntl[0]` is 0, no further changes are made. Otherwise, `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]` minus the number of times the loop has decremented `c`, and `j` is `n`.**

Explanation:
- The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a list of integers from the input and assigns it to `a`.
- The initial state specifies that `a` is a list of integers read from input, which is now updated.
- The rest of the initial state remains unchanged as the provided code snippet only affects the value of `a`.
