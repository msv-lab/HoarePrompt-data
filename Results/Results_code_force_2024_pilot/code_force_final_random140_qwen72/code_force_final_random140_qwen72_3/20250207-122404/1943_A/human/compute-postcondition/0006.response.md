The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If there are more elements in `a`, the loop will execute again with the next element.

At the end of the last iteration, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, and `i` is the first element in `a`. For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must have at least 2 elements, and `i` will be the second element in `a`.

State: **`_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from input that must have at least 2 elements, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where the element at index `i` (the first element in `a`) is now 1 and all other elements are 0, `i` is the second element in `a`**
