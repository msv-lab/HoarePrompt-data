Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` is an updated input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from input that must have at least 3 elements, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` with the element at index `i` (which is the third element in `a`) incremented by 3, `i` is the third element in `a`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `cntl[i]` is incremented by 1.
- Initially, `cntl[i]` was incremented by 2, so now it is incremented by 3.
- All other variables (`_`, `n`, `a`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
