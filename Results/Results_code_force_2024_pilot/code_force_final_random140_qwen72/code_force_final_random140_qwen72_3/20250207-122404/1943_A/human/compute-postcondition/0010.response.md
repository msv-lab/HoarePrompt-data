Output State: **_ is 0, n is an input integer greater than 0, a is a list of integers read from input, cntl is a list of length n + 1 where each element at index i (where i is an element in a) is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of i in a, and all other elements are 0.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `_` remains 0.
- The variable `n` remains an input integer greater than 0.
- The list `a` remains unchanged as it was initially provided.
- The list `cntl` is updated such that for each integer `i` in the list `a`, the element at index `i` in `cntl` is incremented by 1. This means that if an integer `i` appears multiple times in `a`, the corresponding element in `cntl` will reflect the count of how many times `i` appeared in `a`. All other elements in `cntl` (those not indexed by any element in `a`) remain 0.
