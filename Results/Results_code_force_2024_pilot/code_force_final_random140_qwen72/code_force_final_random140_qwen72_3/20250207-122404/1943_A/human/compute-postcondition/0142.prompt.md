Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list of integers, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` in `cntl` represents the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in `a`. The value of `cntl[0]` is not 0, and the loop has completed all its iterations. `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]`.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    if cntl[j] < 2:
        if cntl[j] == 0:
            print(j)
            break
        else:
            c -= 1
            if not c:
                print(j)
                break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a` is a list of integers, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` in `cntl` represents the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in `a`, `cntl[0]` is not 0, `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]`, `j` is 1, and `n` must be at least 1. If `cntl[j]` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `cntl[j]` is greater than 0 but less than 2, `c` is updated to the minimum of 1 and `cntl[0]`, and if `c` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`a` remains a list of integers, `cntl` remains a list of length `n + 1` with the same properties, `cntl[0]` is not 0, `j` is 2, and `n` is at least 2. If `cntl[j]` (where `j` is 2) is less than 2, `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]` minus 1. If `c` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the loop continues.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`a` remains a list of integers, `cntl` remains a list of length `n + 1` with the same properties, `cntl[0]` is not 0, `j` is 3, and `n` is at least 3. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, either `c` is decreased by 1 (and if `c` becomes 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement), or we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `cntl[j]` is 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
