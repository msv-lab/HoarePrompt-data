Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It reads the number of test cases `t` (where `1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4`) and for each test case, it reads `n` (where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5`) and a list of `n` integers `a` (where `0 ≤ a_i < n`). The function then counts the occurrences of each integer in `a` and stores these counts in a list `cntl` of length `n + 1`. If the count of `0` in `a` is zero, the function prints `0`. Otherwise, it prints the smallest integer `j` between `1` and `n` such that the count of `j` in `a` is either `0` or less than `2`, and the count of `0` in `a` is at least `2`. If no such `j` exists, no value is printed for that test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes and the program state reflects the printed outputs for each test case. **
