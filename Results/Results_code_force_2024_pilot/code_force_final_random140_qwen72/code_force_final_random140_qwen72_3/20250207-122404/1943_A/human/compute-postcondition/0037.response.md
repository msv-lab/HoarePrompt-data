The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` being less than `n + 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, and `n` is an input integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `j` must be less than `n + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` (where `i` is an element in `a`) is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `i` in `a`, and all other elements are 0, the first element of `cntl` (cntl[0]) is not 0, `j` is 3**
