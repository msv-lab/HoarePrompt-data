Based on the initial state provided:

- `a` is a list of integers.
- `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where `cntl[0]` is not 0.
- `j` is 3.
- `n` is at least 3.
- `c` is decreased by 1 (though `c` is not used in the print statement).

The `print(j)` statement will print the value of `j`.

Since `j` is explicitly stated to be 3, the output will be:

Output: **3**
