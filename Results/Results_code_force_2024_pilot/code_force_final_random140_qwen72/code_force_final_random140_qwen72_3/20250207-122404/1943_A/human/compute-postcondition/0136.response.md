The code snippet `c -= 1` decrements the value of `c` by 1. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `c`, we can only say that `c` is decreased by 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` remains a list of integers, `cntl` remains a list of length `n + 1` with the same properties, `cntl[0]` is not 0, `j` is 3, `n` is at least 3, and `c` is decreased by 1.**
