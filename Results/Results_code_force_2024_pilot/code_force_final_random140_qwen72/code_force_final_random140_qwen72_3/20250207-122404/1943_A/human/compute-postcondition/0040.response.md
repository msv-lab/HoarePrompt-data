The code snippet `c -= 1` decrements the value of the variable `c` by 1. However, the initial state does not specify the value of `c`. Therefore, we can only state that `c` is decreased by 1 without knowing its exact new value.

Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` (where `i` is an element in `a`) is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `i` in `a`, and all other elements are 0, the first element of `cntl` (cntl[0]) is not 0, `j` is 3, `c` is decreased by 1.**
