The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `a`. If `a` has at least two elements, the loop can execute again for the second element.

At the end of the last iteration, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `i` is the first element of `a`, and `cntl[a[0]]` is incremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must have at least two elements, and `i` will be the second element of `a`.

State: **`a` is a list of integers that must have at least two elements, `i` is the second element of `a`, `cntl[a[0]]` is incremented by 1**
