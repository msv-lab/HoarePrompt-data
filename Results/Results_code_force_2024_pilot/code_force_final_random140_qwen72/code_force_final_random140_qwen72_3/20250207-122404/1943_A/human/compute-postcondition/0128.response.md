Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1`.
- `cntl[0]` is not 0.
- `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]` minus 1.
- `j` is 2.
- `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute one more time.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(j)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `j` is explicitly set to 2.
- The other variables (`a`, `cntl`, `c`, and `n`) do not affect the value of `j` in this context.
- The `print` statement will simply output the value of `j`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will print the value of `j`, which is 2.

Output: **2**
