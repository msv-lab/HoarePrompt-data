Output State: **`a` is a list of integers that must have at least two elements, `i` is the second element of `a`, `cntl[a[0]]` is incremented by 1, `cntl[i]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `a` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `i` is the second element of `a`, and `cntl[a[0]]` is incremented by 1.
- The code snippet `cntl[i] += 1` increments the value of `cntl[i]` by 1, where `i` is the second element of `a`.
- After executing the code, the value of `cntl[i]` is incremented by 1, while the other conditions from the initial state remain unchanged.
