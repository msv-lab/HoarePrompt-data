Postcondition: **`_` is 1, `n` is an updated input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` (where `i` is an element in `a`) is incremented by the number of times `i` appears in `a`, the first element of `cntl` (`cntl[0]`) is not 0, `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]`, `j` is 1. If `cntl[j]` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `cntl[j]` is greater than 0 and less than 2, and if `c` is 0, we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
