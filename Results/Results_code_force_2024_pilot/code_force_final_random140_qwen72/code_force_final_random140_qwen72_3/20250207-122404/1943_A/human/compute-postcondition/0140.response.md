Postcondition: ***`a` remains a list of integers, `cntl` remains a list of length `n + 1` with the same properties, `cntl[0]` is not 0, `j` is 3, and `n` is at least 3. If `cntl[j]` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `c` is decreased by 1, and if `c` becomes 0, we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
