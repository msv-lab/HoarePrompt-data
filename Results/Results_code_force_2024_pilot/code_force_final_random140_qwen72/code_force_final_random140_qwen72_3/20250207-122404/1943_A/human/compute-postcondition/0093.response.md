Postcondition: ***The value of `j` is 3, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 3. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, and `c` is 0, then `c` is decreased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `cntl[j]` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement regardless of the value of `c`. If `cntl[j]` is 1 or greater, no changes are made to `c` and the loop continues.***
