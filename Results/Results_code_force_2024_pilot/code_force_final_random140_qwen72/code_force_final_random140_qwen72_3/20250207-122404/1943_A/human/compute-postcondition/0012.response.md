The code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the integer `0`.

Given the initial state:
- `_` is 0 (though this variable is not used in the `print` statement).
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of integers read from input.
- `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` (where `i` is an element in `a`) is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `i` in `a`, and all other elements are 0. Additionally, the first element of `cntl` (i.e., `cntl[0]`) is 0.

The `print` statement simply prints the integer `0`.

Output: **0**
