The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into parts based on spaces, converts each part to an integer, and stores the resulting list in the variable `a`. The variable `_` remains unchanged, and `n` is still an input integer greater than 0.

Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from input.**
