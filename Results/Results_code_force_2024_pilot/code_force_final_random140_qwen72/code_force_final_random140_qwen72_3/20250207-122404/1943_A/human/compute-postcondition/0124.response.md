To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given state and the loop head:

### Given State:
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` in `cntl` represents the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in `a`.
- `cntl[0]` is not 0.
- `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]`.
- `j` is 1.
- `n` must be at least 1.

### Loop Head:
```python
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head involves the variable `j` and the constant `n`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `j` is within the range `1` to `n` (inclusive).

3. **Adjust the State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1.
   - For the next iteration, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 2.
   - The condition for the loop to execute again is that `j` must be less than or equal to `n`.

### Adjusted State:
- `a` remains a list of integers.
- `cntl` remains a list of length `n + 1` with the same properties.
- `cntl[0]` is not 0.
- `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]`.
- `j` is now 2.
- `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute one more time.

### Final State:
State: **`a` is a list of integers, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` in `cntl` represents the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in `a`, `cntl[0]` is not 0, `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]`, `j` is 2, and `n` must be at least 2.**
