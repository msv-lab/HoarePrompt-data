Postcondition: ***`a` remains a list of integers, `cntl` remains a list of length `n + 1` with the same properties, `cntl[0]` is not 0, `j` is 2, and `n` is at least 2. If `cntl[j]` (where `j` is 2) is less than 2, `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]` minus 1. If `c` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the loop continues.***
