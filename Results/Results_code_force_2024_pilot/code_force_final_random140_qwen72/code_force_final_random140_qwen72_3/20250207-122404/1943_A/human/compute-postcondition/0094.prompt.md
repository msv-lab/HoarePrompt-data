Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `_` is 1, `n` is an updated input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` (where `i` is an element in `a`) is incremented by the number of times `i` appears in `a`, and the first element of `cntl` (`cntl[0]`) is not 0, `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]`.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    if cntl[j] < 2:
        if cntl[j] == 0:
            print(j)
            break
        else:
            c -= 1
            if not c:
                print(j)
                break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `_` is 1, `n` is an updated input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` (where `i` is an element in `a`) is incremented by the number of times `i` appears in `a`, the first element of `cntl` (`cntl[0]`) is not 0, `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]`, `j` is 1. If `cntl[j]` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `cntl[j]` is greater than 0 and less than 2, and if `c` is 0, the program also breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`_` is 1, `n` is an updated input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` (where `i` is an element in `a`) is incremented by the number of times `i` appears in `a`, the first element of `cntl` (`cntl[0]`) is not 0, `j` is 2. If `cntl[j]` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `cntl[j]` is not 0, `c` is the minimum of 1 and `cntl[0]`. If `c` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *The value of `j` is 3, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 3. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, and `c` is 0, then `c` is decreased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `cntl[j]` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement regardless of the value of `c`. If `cntl[j]` is 1 or greater, no changes are made to `c` and the loop continues.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
