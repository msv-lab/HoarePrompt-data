The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `n + 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `n` is an updated input integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still be greater than 0 for the loop condition to hold true.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`_` is 1, `n` is an updated input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` (where `i` is an element in `a`) is incremented by the number of times `i` appears in `a`, the first element of `cntl` (`cntl[0]`) is not 0, `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]`, `j` is 2**
