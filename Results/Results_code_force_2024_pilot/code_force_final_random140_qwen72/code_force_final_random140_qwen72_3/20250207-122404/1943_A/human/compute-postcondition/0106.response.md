Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` in `cntl` represents the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in `a`. The value of `cntl[0]` remains 0, and the loop has completed all its iterations.**

### Explanation:
- **`a`**: This is the original list of integers provided as input.
- **`cntl`**: After the loop completes, `cntl` will have been updated such that `cntl[i]` contains the number of times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`.
- **`cntl[0]`**: Since `cntl[0]` is never modified within the loop, it remains 0.
- **Loop Completion**: The loop iterates over each element in `a`, incrementing the corresponding index in `cntl` by 1. Once all elements in `a` have been processed, the loop has completed all its iterations.
