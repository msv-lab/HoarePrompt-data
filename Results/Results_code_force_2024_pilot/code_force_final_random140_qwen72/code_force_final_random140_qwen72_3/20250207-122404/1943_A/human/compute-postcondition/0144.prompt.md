Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 0 ≤ a_i < n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cntl = [(0) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for i in a:
        cntl[i] += 1
    if cntl[0] == 0:
        print(0)
    else:
        c = min(2, cntl[0])
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            if cntl[j] < 2:
                if cntl[j] == 0:
                    print(j)
                    break
                else:
                    c -= 1
                    if not c:
                        print(j)
                        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *_ is 0, n is an input integer greater than 0, a is a list of integers read from input, cntl is a list of length n + 1 where each element at index i (where i is an element in a) is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of i in a, and all other elements are 0. If cntl[0] is 0, no further changes are made. Otherwise, c is the minimum of 2 and cntl[0] minus the number of times the loop has decremented c, and j is n. The loop will break if it encounters an index j where cntl[j] is 0 or if c reaches 0 before the loop completes.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: _ is 1, n is an updated input integer greater than 0, a is a list of integers read from input, cntl is a list of length n + 1 where each element at index i (where i is an element in a) is incremented by the number of times i appears in a. If cntl[0] == 0, the first element of cntl (cntl[0]) is 0. Otherwise, the value of `j` is `n + 1`, and the loop has completed all its iterations. The values of `_`, `n`, `a`, and `cntl` remain unchanged from their initial state, except for the possible decrement of `c` based on the conditions inside the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`a` is a list of integers, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` in `cntl` represents the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in `a`. The loop has completed all its iterations. If `cntl[0]` is 0, the condition holds as is. If `cntl[0]` is not 0, `j` is the smallest integer between 1 and `n` such that `cntl[j]` is 0 or `cntl[j]` is less than 2, and `c` is 0, and `n` is at least the value of `j`. If no such `j` exists, the loop completes without printing any value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
