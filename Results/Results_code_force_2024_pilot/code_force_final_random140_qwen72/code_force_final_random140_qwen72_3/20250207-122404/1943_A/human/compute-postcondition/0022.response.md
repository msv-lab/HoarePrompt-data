Postcondition: **`_` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` (where `i` is an element in `a`) is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `i` in `a`, and all other elements are 0, the first element of `cntl` (cntl[0]) is not 0, `c` is the minimum of 1 and `cntl[0] - 1`, `j` is 1, the current value of `cntl[j]` is greater than 0 and less than 2, and `c` is 0.**
