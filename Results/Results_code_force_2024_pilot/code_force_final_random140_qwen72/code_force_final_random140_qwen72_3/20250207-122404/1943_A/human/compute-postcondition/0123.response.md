Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` in `cntl` represents the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in `a`, `cntl[0]` is not 0, `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]`, `j` is 1, and `n` must be at least 1. If `cntl[j]` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `cntl[j]` is greater than 0 but less than 2, `c` is updated to the minimum of 1 and `cntl[0]`, and if `c` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
