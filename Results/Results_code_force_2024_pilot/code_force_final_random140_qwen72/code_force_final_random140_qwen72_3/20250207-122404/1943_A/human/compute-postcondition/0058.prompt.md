Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `_` is 1, `n` is an updated input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements set to 0, and no further changes are made to `c` or `j` yet.
Code of the loop:
for i in a:
    cntl[i] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `_` is 1, `n` is an updated input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from input that must have at least 1 element, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` with the element at index `i` (which is the first element in `a`) incremented by 1, `i` is the first element in `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `_` is 1, `n` is an updated input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from input that must have at least 2 elements, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` with the element at index `i` (which is the first element in `a`) incremented by 2, `i` is the second element in `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `_` is 1, `n` is an updated input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from input that must have at least 3 elements, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` with the element at index `i` (which is the third element in `a`) incremented by 3, `i` is the third element in `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
