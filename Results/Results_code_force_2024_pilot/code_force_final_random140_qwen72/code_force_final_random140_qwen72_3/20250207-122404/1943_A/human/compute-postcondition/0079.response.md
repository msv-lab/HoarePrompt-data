Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` is an updated input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` (where `i` is an element in `a`) is incremented by the number of times `i` appears in `a`, the first element of `cntl` (`cntl[0]`) is not 0, `c` is the minimum of 1 and `cntl[0]`, `j` is 2.**

Explanation:
- The value of `c` is decremented by 1, so if `c` was initially the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]`, it is now the minimum of 1 and `cntl[0]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
