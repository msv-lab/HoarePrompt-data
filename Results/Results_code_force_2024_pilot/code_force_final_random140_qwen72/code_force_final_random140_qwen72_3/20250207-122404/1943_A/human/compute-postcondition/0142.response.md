Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` in `cntl` represents the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in `a`, `cntl[0]` is not 0, `j` is the smallest integer between 1 and `n` such that `cntl[j]` is 0 or `cntl[j]` is less than 2 and `c` is 0, and `n` is at least the value of `j`. If no such `j` exists, the loop completes without printing any value.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over `j` from 1 to `n`.
- For each `j`, it checks if `cntl[j]` is less than 2.
- If `cntl[j]` is 0, it prints `j` and breaks out of the loop.
- If `cntl[j]` is 1, it decrements `c` by 1. If `c` becomes 0, it prints `j` and breaks out of the loop.
- The loop will stop as soon as it finds the smallest `j` where `cntl[j]` is 0 or `cntl[j]` is 1 and `c` becomes 0.
- If no such `j` is found, the loop completes without printing any value.
- The final state of `j` will be the smallest integer between 1 and `n` that meets the above conditions, and `c` will be 0 if the loop breaks due to `c` becoming 0.
