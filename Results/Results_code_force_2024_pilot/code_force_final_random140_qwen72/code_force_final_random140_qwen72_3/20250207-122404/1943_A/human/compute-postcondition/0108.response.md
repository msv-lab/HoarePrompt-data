Based on the initial state provided:

- `a` is a list of integers.
- `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` in `cntl` represents the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in `a`.
- The value of `cntl[0]` is 0.
- The loop has completed all its iterations.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print(0)
```

This statement simply prints the integer `0`.

Output: **0**
