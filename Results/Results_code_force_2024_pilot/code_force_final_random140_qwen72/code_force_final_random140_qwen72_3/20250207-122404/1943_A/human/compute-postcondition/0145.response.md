The function `func` does not explicitly define its parameters within the function signature. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it can be inferred that the function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. The function is expected to handle up to `t` test cases, where `1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4`. For each test case, `n` is an integer where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5`, and the list contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where `0 ≤ a_i < n`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `2 · 10^5`.

The function's output is not specified in the prompt, but typically, such functions would return or print results for each test case.
