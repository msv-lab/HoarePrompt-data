### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns removing elements from an array `a` until it is empty.
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of the array `c`, which is initially empty and is built by Alice's choices.
   - Bob wants to minimize the MEX of the array `c`.
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a`.
   - It initializes a count array `cntl` of size `n + 1` to keep track of the frequency of each element in `a`.

3. **Counting Elements:**
   - The program iterates through the array `a` and updates the count of each element in `cntl`.

4. **Determining the MEX:**
   - If `cntl[0]` is 0, it means 0 is not present in the array, so the MEX is 0, and the program prints 0.
   - Otherwise, the program initializes a variable `c` to the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]`. This is because Alice can pick at most 2 zeros to maximize the MEX.
   - The program then iterates through the elements from 1 to `n`:
     - If `cntl[j]` is 0, it means `j` is not present in the array, so the MEX is `j`, and the program prints `j` and breaks out of the loop.
     - If `cntl[j]` is 1, it means there is exactly one `j` in the array. Alice can pick this element, and Bob will not pick it. Therefore, `c` is decremented by 1. If `c` becomes 0, it means Alice has picked enough elements to ensure the MEX is `j`, and the program prints `j` and breaks out of the loop.

5. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice will always try to pick the smallest available element to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob will try to pick the smallest available element to minimize the MEX.
   - The program correctly handles the optimal strategy by ensuring Alice picks the smallest available elements and Bob picks the next smallest available elements.

6. **Edge Cases and Constraints:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where 0 is not present in the array.
   - It also correctly handles the case where the array contains multiple zeros and other elements.
   - The program ensures that the MEX is determined based on the optimal moves of both players.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the MEX of the array `c` based on the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. It handles all edge cases and constraints mentioned in the problem description.

Final: **True**
