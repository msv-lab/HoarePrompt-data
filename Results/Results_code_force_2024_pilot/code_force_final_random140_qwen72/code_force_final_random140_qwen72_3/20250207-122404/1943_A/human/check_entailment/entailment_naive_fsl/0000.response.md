Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided solution does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic for determining the MEX value after both players play optimally is flawed. Here is a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Initialization and Counting**:
   - The program initializes a list `cntl` to count occurrences of each number in the array `a`.
   - This part is correct and accurately counts the occurrences of each number.

2. **Handling the MEX Calculation**:
   - The program checks if `cntl[0]` is zero and immediately prints 0 if true. This is incorrect because the MEX calculation should consider the entire array, not just the presence of 0.
   - The program then sets `c` to `min(2, cntl[0])`, which is also incorrect. The variable `c` is used to track the number of elements that can be added to `c` without affecting the MEX, but this logic is flawed.

3. **Loop to Determine MEX**:
   - The program iterates through the range from 1 to `n + 1` and checks if `cntl[j]` is less than 2. If `cntl[j]` is 0, it prints `j` and breaks. If `cntl[j]` is 1, it decrements `c` and checks if `c` is zero before printing `j` and breaking.
   - This logic is incorrect because it does not correctly simulate the optimal moves of Alice and Bob. It fails to consider the optimal strategy for both players, leading to incorrect MEX values.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
1
5
0 1 2 2 3
```
- The correct MEX value should be 4 because the optimal strategy would result in the array `c` containing `[0, 1, 2, 3]`, making the MEX 4.
- However, the provided program will output 3, which is incorrect.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to simulate the optimal moves of Alice and Bob. The key is to ensure that Alice always adds the smallest available number to `c` that maximizes the MEX, while Bob tries to minimize it. A more robust approach would involve a different strategy for counting and determining the MEX value.

Given the issues identified, the program is incorrect.
