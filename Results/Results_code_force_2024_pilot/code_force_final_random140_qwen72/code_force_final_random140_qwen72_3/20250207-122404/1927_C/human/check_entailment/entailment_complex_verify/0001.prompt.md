You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given an array a of n integers, an array b of m integers, and an even number k
.

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to choose exactly \frac{k}{2}
elements from both arrays in such a way that among the chosen elements, every
integer from 1 to k is included.

For example:

  * If a=[2, 3, 8, 5, 6, 5] , b=[1, 3, 4, 10, 5] , k=6 , then it is possible to choose elements with values 2, 3, 6 from array a and elements with values 1, 4, 5 from array b . In this case, all numbers from 1 to k=6 will be included among the chosen elements.
  * If a=[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 5] , b=[1, 3, 8, 10, 3] , k=6 , then it is not possible to choose elements in the required way. 

Note that you are not required to find a way to choose the elements — your
program should only check whether it is possible to choose the elements in the
required way.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
n, m \le 2\cdot10^5 , 2 \le k \le 2 \cdot \min(n, m) , k is even) — the length
of array a , the length of array b , and the number of elements to be chosen,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_j \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n and m over all test cases in a test
does not exceed 4 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to choose \frac{k}{2} numbers from
each array in such a way that among the chosen elements, every integer from 1
to k is included. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Output

Note

In the first test case of the example, it is possible to choose elements equal
to 2 , 3 , and 6 from array a and elements equal to 1 , 4 , and 5 from array b
. Thus, all numbers from 1 to k=6 are included among the chosen elements.

In the second test case of the example, it can be shown that it is not
possible to choose exactly three elements from each array in the required way.

In the third test case of the example, it is possible to choose elements equal
to 1 and 3 from array a and elements equal to 2 and 4 from array b . Thus, all
numbers from 1 to k=4 are included among the chosen elements.

    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` has been decremented to 0, as it corresponds to the number of remaining test cases. The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` have been reassigned multiple times, once for each test case, but their final values correspond to the last test case processed. The frozensets `a` and `b` contain the integers from the last test case's input. The variable `newk` is set to `k // 2` for the last test case. The variables `leftOnes`, `aOnes`, and `bOnes` have been updated based on the last test case's input and the logic within the loop. Specifically, `leftOnes` is the count of integers from 1 to `k` that are present in both `a` and `b`, `aOnes` is the count of integers from 1 to `k` that are present in `a` but not in `b`, and `bOnes` is the count of integers from 1 to `k` that are present in `b` but not in `a`. The variable `i` is set to `leftOnes`. If `aOnes` is equal to `newk` and `bOnes` is equal to `newk`, the output 'yes' is printed; otherwise, 'no' is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases. Each test case involves two arrays `a` and `b` of integers and an even integer `k`. The function checks if it is possible to distribute the integers from 1 to `k` between `a` and `b` such that each array contains exactly `k/2` unique integers from this range. If this condition is met, the function prints 'yes' for that test case; otherwise, it prints 'no'. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the final state includes the number of test cases `t` being 0, and the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `newk`, `leftOnes`, `aOnes`, and `bOnes` reflecting the values from the last test case processed.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case. For each test case, it reads the lengths of the arrays `n` and `m`, and the value of `k`.

2. **Set Conversion**: The function converts the input arrays `a` and `b` into `frozenset` objects. This is efficient for membership testing, which is used later in the code.

3. **Initialization**: The variables `leftOnes`, `aOnes`, and `bOnes` are initialized to zero. These variables will keep track of how many numbers from 1 to `k` are found in both arrays, only in array `a`, and only in array `b`, respectively.

4. **Counting Elements**: The loop from `i = 1` to `i <= k` checks each number from 1 to `k`:
   - If the number is in both `a` and `b`, it increments `leftOnes`.
   - If the number is only in `a`, it increments `aOnes`.
   - If the number is only in `b`, it increments `bOnes`.
   - If the number is not found in either array, the loop breaks early, indicating that it's impossible to form the required set.

5. **Balancing Elements**: After counting the elements, the function attempts to balance the counts of `aOnes` and `bOnes` using the `leftOnes`. It does this by incrementing the smaller count until `leftOnes` is exhausted.

6. **Final Check**: The function checks if `aOnes` and `bOnes` are both equal to `newk` (which is `k // 2`). If they are, it prints 'yes'; otherwise, it prints 'no'.

### Issues:
- **Early Break**: The loop breaks early if a number from 1 to `k` is not found in either array. This is correct because if any number from 1 to `k` is missing, it's impossible to form the required set.
- **Balancing Logic**: The balancing logic is correct. It ensures that the counts of `aOnes` and `bOnes` are balanced using the `leftOnes`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to choose exactly `k/2` elements from both arrays such that every integer from 1 to `k` is included. The logic is sound and handles all edge cases appropriately.

### Correctness:
**True**
