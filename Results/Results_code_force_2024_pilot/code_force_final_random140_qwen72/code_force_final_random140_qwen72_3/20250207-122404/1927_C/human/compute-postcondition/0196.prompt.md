Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n`, `m`, and `k` remain the same as they were initially. `t` is the next value in the range (incremented by 1). `a` and `b` remain the same frozensets of integers read from the inputs. `newk` is still `k // 2`. `i` is now 0. `leftOnes` will be the total number of integers from 1 to `k` that are present in both `a` and `b`. `aOnes` will be the total number of integers from 1 to `k` that are present in `a` but not in `b`. `bOnes` will be the total number of integers from 1 to `k` that are present in `b` but not in `a`.
Code of the loop:
while i < leftOnes:
    if aOnes < bOnes:
        aOnes += 1
    else:
        bOnes += 1
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n`, `m`, and `k` remain the same as they were initially. `t` is the next value in the range (incremented by 1). `a` and `b` remain the same frozensets of integers read from the inputs. `newk` is still `k // 2`. `i` is now 1. `leftOnes` must be greater than 0. If `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, `aOnes` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `bOnes` is incremented by 1. In both cases, `aOnes` and `bOnes` represent the total number of integers from 1 to `k` that are present in `a` but not in `b`, and in `b` but not in `a`, respectively.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n`, `m`, and `k` remain the same as they were initially. `t` is the next value in the range (incremented by 1). `a` and `b` remain the same frozensets of integers read from the inputs. `newk` is still `k // 2`. `i` is now 2. `leftOnes` must be greater than 1. If `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, `aOnes` is incremented by 1 and `bOnes` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `aOnes` remains unchanged and `bOnes` is incremented by 1. In both cases, `aOnes` and `bOnes` represent the total number of integers from 1 to `k` that are present in `a` but not in `b`, and in `b` but not in `a`, respectively.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n`, `m`, and `k` remain the same as they were initially. `t` is the next value in the range (incremented by 1). `a` and `b` remain the same frozensets of integers read from the inputs. `newk` is still `k // 2`. `i` is now 3. `leftOnes` must be greater than 2. If `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, `aOnes` is incremented by 1 and `bOnes` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `aOnes` remains unchanged and `bOnes` is incremented by 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
