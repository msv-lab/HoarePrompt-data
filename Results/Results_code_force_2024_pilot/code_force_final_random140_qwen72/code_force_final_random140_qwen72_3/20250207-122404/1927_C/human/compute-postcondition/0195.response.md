Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` remain the same as they were initially. `t` is the next value in the range (incremented by 1). `a` and `b` remain the same frozensets of integers read from the inputs. `newk` is still `k // 2`. `i` is now 3. `leftOnes` must be greater than 2. If `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, `aOnes` is incremented by 1 and `bOnes` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `aOnes` remains unchanged and `bOnes` is incremented by 1.**
