Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is reassigned in the loop head, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from input, `m` is the second integer from input, `k` is the third integer from input, `a` is a frozenset of integers read from the input, `b` is a frozenset of integers read from the new input, `leftOnes` is 0, `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 0, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 1.
Code of the loop:
while i <= k:
    if i in a and i in b:
        leftOnes += 1
    elif i in a:
        aOnes += 1
    elif i in b:
        bOnes += 1
    else:
        break
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is reassigned in the loop head, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from input, `m` is the second integer from input, `k` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a frozenset of integers read from the input, `b` is a frozenset of integers read from the new input, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 2. If `i` is in both `a` and `b`, `leftOnes` is 1, `aOnes` is 0, and `bOnes` is 0. If `i` is in `a` but not in `b`, `leftOnes` is 0, `aOnes` is 1, and `bOnes` is 0. If `i` is in `b` but not in `a`, `leftOnes` is 0, `aOnes` is 0, and `bOnes` is 1. If `i` is not in either `a` or `b`, `leftOnes` is 0, `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 0, and the loop or if statement is exited.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is reassigned in the loop head, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from input, `m` is the second integer from input, `k` must be greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a frozenset of integers read from the input, `b` is a frozenset of integers read from the new input, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 4. If `i` is in both `a` and `b`, `leftOnes` is 2, `aOnes` is 0, and `bOnes` is 0. If `i` is in `a` but not in `b`, `leftOnes` is 0, `aOnes` is 1, and `bOnes` is 0. If `i` is in `b` but not in `a`, `leftOnes` is 0, `aOnes` is 0, and `bOnes` is 1. If `i` is not in either `a` or `b`, `leftOnes` is 0, `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 0, and the loop or if statement is exited.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is reassigned in the loop head, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from input, `m` is the second integer from input, `k` must be greater than or equal to 4, `a` is a frozenset of integers read from the input, `b` is a frozenset of integers read from the new input, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 5. If `i` is in both `a` and `b`, `leftOnes` is 2, `aOnes` is 1, and `bOnes` is 1. If `i` is in `a` but not in `b`, `leftOnes` is 0, `aOnes` is 1, and `bOnes` is 0. If `i` is in `b` but not in `a`, `leftOnes` is 0, `aOnes` is 0, and `bOnes` is 1. If `i` is not in either `a` or `b`, `leftOnes` is 0, `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 0, and the loop or if statement is exited.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
