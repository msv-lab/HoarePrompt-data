Postcondition: ***`t` is reassigned in the loop head, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from input, `m` is the second integer from input, `k` must be greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a frozenset of integers read from the input, `b` is a frozenset of integers read from the new input, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 3. If `i` is in both `a` and `b`, `leftOnes` is 2, `aOnes` is 0, and `bOnes` is 0. If `i` is in `a` but not in `b`, `leftOnes` is 0, `aOnes` is 1, and `bOnes` is 0. If `i` is in `b` but not in `a`, `leftOnes` is 0, `aOnes` is 0, and `bOnes` is 1. If `i` is not in either `a` or `b`, `leftOnes` is 0, `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 0, and the loop or if statement is exited.***
