Output State: **`t` is reassigned in the loop head, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from input, `m` is the second integer from input, `k` is the third integer from input, `a` is a frozenset of integers read from the input, `b` is a frozenset of integers read from the new input, `leftOnes` is 0, `aOnes` is 0.**

Explanation: The variable `aOnes` is initialized to 0. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `leftOnes`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
