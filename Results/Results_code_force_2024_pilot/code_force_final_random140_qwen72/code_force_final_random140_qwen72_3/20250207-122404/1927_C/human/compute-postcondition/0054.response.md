Postcondition: ***`t` is reassigned in the loop head, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from input, `m` is the second integer from input, `k` is the total number of iterations the loop will run, `a` is a frozenset of integers read from the input, `b` is a frozenset of integers read from the new input, `leftOnes` must be greater than 1, `newk` is `k // 2`, and `i` is 1. If `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `bOnes` is incremented by 1.***
