Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers greater than 0, `t` is the next value in the range, `a` and `b` are frozensets of integers read from new inputs, `leftOnes` is 0, `newk` is `k // 2`, and `i` is 1. If `i` is in `a`, then `aOnes` is 1 and `bOnes` is 0. If `i` is in `b`, then `aOnes` is 0 and `bOnes` is 1. If `i` is not in either `a` or `b`, then `aOnes` and `bOnes` remain 0, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Additionally, `i` is not in both `a` and `b`.***
