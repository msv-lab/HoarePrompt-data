Output State: **`t` is reassigned in the loop head, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from input, `m` is the second integer from input, `k` is the third integer from input, `a` is a frozenset of integers read from the input, `b` is a frozenset of integers read from the new input, `leftOnes` is 0, `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 0, `newk` is `k // 2`.** 

The value of `newk` is calculated as the integer division of `k` by 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
