To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute at least once, let's analyze the loop condition:

```python
while i <= k:
```

The loop will execute if `i` is less than or equal to `k`. Given the state right before the loop:

- `i` is 1
- `k` is the third integer from input

For the loop to execute at least once, `i` (which is 1) must be less than or equal to `k`. Therefore, `k` must be at least 1.

No other states need to be adjusted because the condition `i <= k` will be satisfied as long as `k` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is reassigned in the loop head, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from input, `m` is the second integer from input, `k` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a frozenset of integers read from the input, `b` is a frozenset of integers read from the new input, `leftOnes` is 0, `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 0, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 1**
