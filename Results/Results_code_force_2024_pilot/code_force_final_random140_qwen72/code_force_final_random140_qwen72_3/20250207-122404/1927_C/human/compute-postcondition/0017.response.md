Output State: **`t` is reassigned in the loop head, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from input, `m` is the second integer from input, `k` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a frozenset of integers read from the input, `b` is a frozenset of integers read from the new input, `leftOnes` is 0, `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 1, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 1, and `i` is not in both `a` and `b`. Additionally, `i` is not in `a`, and `i` is in `b`.**
