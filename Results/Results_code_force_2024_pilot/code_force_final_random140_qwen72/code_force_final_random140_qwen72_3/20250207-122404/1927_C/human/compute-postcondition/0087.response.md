Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers greater than 0, `t` is the next value in the range, `a` and `b` are frozensets of integers read from new inputs, `leftOnes` is 0, `aOnes` is 0, `newk` is `k // 2`, and `i` is 1. If `i` is in `b`, then `bOnes` is 1. Otherwise, `bOnes` remains 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Additionally, `i` is not in `a` and is not in both `a` and `b`.***
