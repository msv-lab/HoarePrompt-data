Postcondition: **`n`, `m`, and `k` remain integers greater than 0, `t` is the next value in the range, `a` and `b` are frozensets of integers read from new inputs, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 0, `leftOnes` must be greater than 0, `aOnes` and `bOnes` will depend on the elements present in the sets `a` and `b` for each iteration from 1 to `k`. Additionally, the current value of `aOnes` is less than the current value of `bOnes`.**
