Postcondition: ***`t` is reassigned in the loop head, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from input, `m` is the second integer from input, `k` is the total number of iterations the loop will run, `a` is a frozenset of integers read from the input, `b` is a frozenset of integers read from the new input, `leftOnes` is the count of integers from 1 to `k` that are present in both `a` and `b`, `aOnes` is the count of integers from 1 to `k` that are present in `a` but not in `b`, `bOnes` is the count of integers from 1 to `k` that are present in `b` but not in `a`, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is `leftOnes`. If `aOnes` is equal to `newk` and `bOnes` is equal to `newk`, then no changes are made to `aOnes` or `bOnes`. Otherwise, if `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, `aOnes` is incremented by `leftOnes`. If `aOnes` is greater than or equal to `bOnes`, `bOnes` is incremented by `leftOnes`.***
