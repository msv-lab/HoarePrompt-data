Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input, `t` is the next value in the range (incremented by 1), `a` is a frozenset of integers read from a new input, `b` is a frozenset of integers read from the latest input, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is `2`, `leftOnes` is `0` or `1` depending on whether `i` is in both `a` and `b`, `aOnes` is incremented by 1, `bOnes` remains unchanged, and `k` must be greater than or equal to `2`.**
