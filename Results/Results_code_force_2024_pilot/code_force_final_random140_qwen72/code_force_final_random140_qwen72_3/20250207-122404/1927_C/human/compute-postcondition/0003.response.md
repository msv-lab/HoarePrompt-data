Output State: **`t` is reassigned in the loop head, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from input, `m` is the second integer from input, `k` is the third integer from input, `a` is a frozenset of integers read from the input, `b` is a frozenset of integers read from the new input.**

Explanation:
- The initial state remains unchanged for `t`, `int(input())`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `a`.
- The line `b = frozenset(map(int, input().split()))` reads a new line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and then creates a frozenset from these integers. This new frozenset is assigned to `b`.
