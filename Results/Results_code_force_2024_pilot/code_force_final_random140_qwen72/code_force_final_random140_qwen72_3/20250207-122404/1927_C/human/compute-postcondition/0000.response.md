The only objects in the loop head are the variable `t` and the result of `int(input())`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value returned by `int(input())`. If this value is at least 1, the loop will execute. The initial state of `t` is irrelevant to the loop's execution since `t` is being reassigned in the loop head.

For the loop to execute, the input must be a positive integer, as this will determine the number of iterations. Therefore, the input must be at least 1.

State: **`t` is reassigned in the loop head, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
