Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n`, `m`, and `k` remain integers greater than 0, `t` is the next value in the range, `a` and `b` are frozensets of integers read from new inputs, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 0, `leftOnes`, `aOnes`, and `bOnes` will depend on the elements present in the sets `a` and `b` for each iteration from 1 to `k`.
Code of the loop:
while i < leftOnes:
    if aOnes < bOnes:
        aOnes += 1
    else:
        bOnes += 1
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n`, `m`, and `k` remain integers greater than 0, `t` is the next value in the range, `a` and `b` are frozensets of integers read from new inputs, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 1, `leftOnes` must be greater than 0. If `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is incremented by 1, and `bOnes` remains greater than the updated `aOnes`. Otherwise, `aOnes` is greater than or equal to `bOnes`, and `bOnes` is incremented by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n`, `m`, and `k` remain integers greater than 0, `t` is the next value in the range, `a` and `b` are frozensets of integers read from new inputs, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 2, `leftOnes` must be greater than 1. If `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is incremented by 1, and `bOnes` remains greater than the updated `aOnes`. Otherwise, if `aOnes` is greater than or equal to `bOnes`, then `bOnes` is incremented by 1, and `aOnes` remains less than or equal to `bOnes`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n`, `m`, and `k` remain integers greater than 0, `t` is the next value in the range, `a` and `b` are frozensets of integers read from new inputs, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 3, and `leftOnes` must be greater than 2. If `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is incremented by 1, and `bOnes` remains greater than the updated `aOnes`. Otherwise, if `aOnes` is greater than or equal to `bOnes`, then `bOnes` is incremented by 1, and `aOnes` remains less than or equal to `bOnes`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
