Postcondition: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers greater than 0, `t` is the next value in the range, `a` and `b` are frozensets of integers read from new inputs, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 3. If `i` is in `a` and `b`, then `leftOnes` is 1, and `aOnes` and `bOnes` are 0. If `i` is only in `a`, then `aOnes` is 2 and `bOnes` is 0. If `i` is only in `b`, then `aOnes` is 0 and `bOnes` is 2. If `i` is not in either `a` or `b`, then `aOnes` and `bOnes` remain 0, and the program may break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
