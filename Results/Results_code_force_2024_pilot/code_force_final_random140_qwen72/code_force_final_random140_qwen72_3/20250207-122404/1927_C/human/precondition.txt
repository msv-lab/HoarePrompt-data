t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and m are positive integers (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·10^5), representing the lengths of arrays a and b, respectively. k is an even integer (2 ≤ k ≤ 2·min(n, m)), representing the total number of elements to be chosen. Arrays a and b contain integers (1 ≤ a_i, b_j ≤ 10^6).
