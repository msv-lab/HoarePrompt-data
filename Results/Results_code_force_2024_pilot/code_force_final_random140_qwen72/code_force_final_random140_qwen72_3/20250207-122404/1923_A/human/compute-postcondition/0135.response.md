Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `length` is an input integer, `arrs` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 2 elements, `idx` is 1. If `arrs[0]` is 0 and `idx` is not 0, `cnt0` is 2 if both `arrs[0]` and `arrs[1]` are 0, otherwise `cnt0` is 1 if `arrs[idx]` is 0, and `cnt0` remains 0 if `arrs[idx]` is not 0. If `arrs[0]` is 1, `cnt0` is 1 if `arrs[1]` is not 0, otherwise `cnt0` is 2 if `arrs[1]` is 0. If `arrs[0]` is not 1, `cnt0` remains 0. `cnt1` retains its value based on the initial conditions, `ans` retains its value based on the conditions described, and `arrs[0]` is 1 if the first element of `arrs` is 1. If `arrs[0]` is not 1, `cnt0` remains 0 and the other conditions remain unchanged.***
