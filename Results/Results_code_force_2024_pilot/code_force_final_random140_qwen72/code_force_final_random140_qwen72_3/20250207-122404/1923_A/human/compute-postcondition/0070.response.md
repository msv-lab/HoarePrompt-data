Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `length` is an input integer, `arrs` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `idx` is 0, `cnt0` is 1, `cnt1` is the same as before, `ans` is the same as before, and `arrs[0]` is 0.**

Explanation: The value of `cnt0` is incremented by 1, changing from 0 to 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
