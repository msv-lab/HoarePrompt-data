The code `arrs = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into substrings based on spaces, converts each substring to an integer, and stores these integers in a list called `arrs`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` must be greater than 0
- `length` is an input integer

After executing the code, the state will be updated as follows:
- `arrs` is a list of integers derived from the input.
- The values of `t` and `length` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `length` is an input integer, `arrs` is a list of integers derived from the input.**
