Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `length` is an input integer, `arrs` is a list of integers with at least `length` elements, `idx` is `len(arrs) - 1`, `cnt0` is the count of zeros in `arrs` (excluding the first element if `arrs[0]` is 0), and `cnt1` is the count of ones in `arrs`.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains greater than 0 as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`length`**: Remains an input integer as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`arrs`**: Remains a list of integers with at least `length` elements, as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`idx`**: After the loop completes, `idx` will be `len(arrs) - 1` because the loop iterates over the entire length of `arrs`.
- **`cnt0`**: Remains the count of zeros in `arrs` (excluding the first element if `arrs[0]` is 0), as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`cnt1`**: After the loop completes, `cnt1` will be the count of ones in `arrs`, as the loop increments `cnt1` each time it encounters a 1 in `arrs`.
