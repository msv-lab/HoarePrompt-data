Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `length` is an input integer, `arrs` is a list of integers with at least `length` elements, `idx` is `len(arrs) - 1`, and `cnt0` and `cnt1` retain their values based on the initial conditions: if `arrs[0] == 0` and the last element of `arrs` is not 0, `cnt0` and `cnt1` remain unchanged; if `arrs[0] == 0` and the last element of `arrs` is 0, `cnt0` is the count of zeros in `arrs` starting from index 1 minus 1, and `cnt1` is the total number of 1s in `arrs`; if `arrs[0] == 1`, `cnt0` is the count of zeros in `arrs` starting from index 1, and `cnt1` is the total number of 1s in `arrs`. If `cnt1` is 0 or 1, `ans` remains 0. Otherwise, if `cnt1` is neither 0 nor 1, `ans` is set to `cnt0`.***
