Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `length` is an input integer, `arrs` is a list of integers with at least `length` elements, `idx` is `len(arrs) - 1`, `cnt0` is 0, `cnt1` is the same as before, `ans` is the same as before.
Code of the loop:
for idx in range(len(arrs)):
    if arrs[0] == 0 and idx != 0:
        if arrs[idx] == 0:
            cnt0 += 1
    elif arrs[0] == 1:
        if arrs[idx] == 0:
            cnt0 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `length` is an input integer, `arrs` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `idx` is 0 unless the first element of `arrs` is 0 and `idx` is not 0, in which case `idx` remains unchanged. `cnt0` is 1 if the element at index `idx` in `arrs` is 0, otherwise `cnt0` is 0. `cnt1` and `ans` remain the same as before. The first element of `arrs` is 0 if the condition `arrs[0] == 0 and idx != 0` is true, otherwise it is either 0 or 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `length` is an input integer, `arrs` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `idx` is 1 unless the first element of `arrs` is 0 and `idx` was not 0, in which case `idx` remains unchanged, `cnt0` is 2 if `arrs[0] == 0 and idx != 0` and `arrs[idx]` is 0, otherwise `cnt0` is 1 more than its previous value if `arrs[idx]` is 0, or remains the same if `arrs[idx]` is not 0, `cnt1` and `ans` remain the same as before, the first element of `arrs` is 0 if the condition `arrs[0] == 0 and idx != 0` is true, otherwise it is either 0 or 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `length` is an input integer, `arrs` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, and `idx` is 2. If `arrs[0] == 0 and idx != 0`, and `arrs[idx]` is 0, `cnt0` is incremented by 1, making it 3. If `arrs[0] == 0 and idx != 0` but `arrs[idx]` is not 0, `cnt0` remains 2. If `arrs[0] == 1` and `arrs[idx]` is 0, `cnt0` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. Otherwise, `cnt0` remains the same. `cnt1` and `ans` remain unchanged. The first element of `arrs` is 0 if the condition `arrs[0] == 0 and idx != 0` is true, otherwise it is either 0 or 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
