Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `length` is an input integer, `arrs` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least `length` elements, `idx` is `len(arrs) - 1`, `cnt0` is the count of zeros in `arrs` starting from index 1 because `arrs[0]` is 0, `cnt1` is the count of ones in `arrs`, `ans` retains its value based on the conditions described, and `arrs[0]` is 0.**
