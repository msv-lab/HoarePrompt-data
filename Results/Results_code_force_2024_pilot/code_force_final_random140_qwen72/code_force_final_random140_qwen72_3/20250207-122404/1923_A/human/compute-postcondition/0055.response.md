Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `length` is an input integer, `arrs` is a list of integers with at least `length` elements, `idx` is `len(arrs) - 1`, `cnt0` is the count of zeros in `arrs` (excluding the first element if `arrs[0]` is 0), `cnt1` is the count of ones in `arrs`, `ans` is equal to `cnt0`. If the first element of `arrs` is 0 and the last element of `arrs` is 0, then `cnt0` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, the counts of zeros and ones remain unchanged. `cnt1` is neither 0 nor 1.**
