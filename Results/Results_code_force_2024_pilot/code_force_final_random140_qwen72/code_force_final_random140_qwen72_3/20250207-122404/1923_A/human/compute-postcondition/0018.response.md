The only objects in the loop head are the variables `idx` and the list `arrs`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the list `arrs`. If `idx` is less than the length of `arrs`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `idx` is 0, and `arrs` is a list of integers with at least one element.

For the loop to execute one more time, `idx` must be incremented by 1 (so it becomes 1), and `arrs` must still have at least one element remaining to be processed, meaning it must have at least two elements in total for the loop to run again.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `length` is an input integer, `arrs` is a list of integers with at least two elements, and `idx` is 1. If `arrs[1]` is 0 and `idx` is not 0, `cnt0` is set to 1. Otherwise, `cnt0` remains 0.**
