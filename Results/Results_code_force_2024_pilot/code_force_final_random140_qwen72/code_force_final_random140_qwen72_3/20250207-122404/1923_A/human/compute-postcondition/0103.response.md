Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `length` is an input integer, `arrs` is a list of integers with at least `length` elements, `idx` is `len(arrs) - 1`, `arrs[0] == 0`, `cnt0` is the count of zeros in `arrs` starting from index 1 minus 1, `cnt1` is the total number of 1s in `arrs`, and `ans` remains the same as before. Additionally, the last element of `arrs` is 0.**
