The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the context given, it is clear that the function should accept parameters to handle the described scenario. The function is expected to process multiple test cases, each involving a list of cells that may contain chips. Hereâ€™s the detailed breakdown:

- **Parameters**: The function implicitly accepts three parameters:
  - `t`: An integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 1000.
  - `n`: An integer representing the number of cells in each test case, where 2 <= n <= 50.
  - `a`: A list of `n` integers, where each integer is either 0 or 1, indicating whether the cell is free (0) or contains a chip (1). Each test case has at least one cell containing a chip.

- **Return Value**: The function processes each test case and returns a result for each test case. The exact nature of the return value is not specified in the problem statement, but it is implied that the function should return some form of output for each test case, possibly related to the configuration of the cells and the presence of chips.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t` (an integer representing the number of test cases), `n` (an integer representing the number of cells in each test case), and `a` (a list of `n` integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, indicating whether the cell is free or contains a chip). The function processes each test case and returns a result for each test case.**
