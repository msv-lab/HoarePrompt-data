Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `length` is an input integer, `arrs` is a list of integers with at least three elements, and `idx` is 2. If `arrs[0]` is 0 and `idx` is not 0, `cnt0` is set to 2. If `arrs[0]` is 1 and `arrs[1]` is 0, `cnt0` is set to 1. If `arrs[0]` is 0 and `arrs[2]` is 0, `cnt0` is set to 1. If `arrs[0]` is 1 and `arrs[2]` is 0, `cnt0` is set to 1. Otherwise, `cnt0` remains 0.***
