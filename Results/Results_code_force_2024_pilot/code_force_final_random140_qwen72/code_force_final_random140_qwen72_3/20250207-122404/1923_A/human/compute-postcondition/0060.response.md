Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `length` is an input integer, `arrs` is a list of integers with at least `length` elements, `idx` is `len(arrs) - 1`, `cnt0` is the count of zeros in `arrs` (excluding the first element if `arrs[0]` is 0). If the first element of `arrs` is 0 and the last element of `arrs` is 0, then `cnt0` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, the counts of zeros and ones remain unchanged. If `cnt1` is 0 or 1, `ans` remains 0. If `cnt1` is neither 0 nor 1, `ans` is equal to `cnt0`. The new `arrs` is a list of integers input by the user.**
