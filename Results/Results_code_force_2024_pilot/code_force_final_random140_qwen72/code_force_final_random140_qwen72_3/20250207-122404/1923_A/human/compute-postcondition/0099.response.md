Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `length` is an input integer, `arrs` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `idx` is 2, `cnt0` is the count of zeros in `arrs` starting from index 1 if `arrs[0] == 0`, or the count of zeros in `arrs` if `arrs[0] == 1`, `cnt1` is 3 if `arrs[0] == 1` and `arrs[idx] == 1`, otherwise `cnt1` is 2, and `ans` remains the same as before.***
