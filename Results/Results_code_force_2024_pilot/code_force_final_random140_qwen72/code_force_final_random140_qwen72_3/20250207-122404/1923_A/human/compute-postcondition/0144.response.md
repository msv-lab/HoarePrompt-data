Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `length` is an input integer, `arrs` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least `length` elements, `idx` is `length - 1`, `cnt0` is the count of zeros in `arrs` starting from index 1 if `arrs[0]` is 0, or the count of zeros in `arrs` if `arrs[0]` is 1, `cnt1` is 0, `ans` retains its value based on the conditions described, and `arrs[0]` is 1 if the first element of `arrs` is 1. If `arrs[0]` is not 1, `cnt0` remains 0 and the other conditions remain unchanged.**
