Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `length` is an input integer, `arrs` is a list of integers with at least one element, `idx` is 0, `cnt0` is the count of zeros in `arrs` (excluding the first element if `arrs[0]` is 0). If `arrs[0]` is 1, then `cnt1` is 1 and the first element of `arrs` is 1. Otherwise, `cnt1` remains 0.***
