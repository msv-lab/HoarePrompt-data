The code snippet `arrs = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `arrs`. This operation changes the value of `arrs`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `length` is an input integer, `arrs` is a list of integers read from the input, `idx` is `len(arrs) - 1`, `cnt0` and `cnt1` retain their values based on the initial conditions, and `ans` retains its value based on the conditions described.**
