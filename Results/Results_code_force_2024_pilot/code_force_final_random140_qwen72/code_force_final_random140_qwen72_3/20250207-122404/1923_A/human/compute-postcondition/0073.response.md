Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `length` is an input integer, `arrs` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `idx` is 0 unless the first element of `arrs` is 0 and `idx` is not 0, in which case `idx` remains unchanged. `cnt0` is 1 if the element at index `idx` in `arrs` is 0, otherwise `cnt0` is 0. `cnt1` and `ans` remain the same as before. The first element of `arrs` is 0 if the condition `arrs[0] == 0 and idx != 0` is true, otherwise it is either 0 or 1.***
