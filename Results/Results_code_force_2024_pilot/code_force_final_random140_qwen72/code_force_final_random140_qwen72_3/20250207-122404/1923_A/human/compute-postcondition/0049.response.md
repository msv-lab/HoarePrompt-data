Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `length` is an input integer, `arrs` is a list of integers with at least `length` elements, `idx` is `len(arrs) - 1`, `cnt0` is the count of zeros in `arrs` (excluding the first element which is 0), and `cnt1` is the count of ones in `arrs`. The first element of `arrs` is 0. If the last element of `arrs` is 0, then `cnt0` is decreased by 1.***
