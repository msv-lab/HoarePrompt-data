Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, representing the number of cells. a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i is either 0 or 1, representing whether the i-th cell is free (0) or contains a chip (1). At least one cell contains a chip in each test case.

    #State: After all iterations, `t` is 0, `length` has been an input integer for each iteration, `arrs` has been a list of integers with at least `length` elements for each iteration, `idx` has been `len(arrs) - 1` for each iteration, `cnt0` and `cnt1` have been calculated for each iteration based on the initial conditions: if `arrs[0] == 0` and the last element of `arrs` is not 0, `cnt0` and `cnt1` remain unchanged; if `arrs[0] == 0` and the last element of `arrs` is 0, `cnt0` is the count of zeros in `arrs` starting from index 1 minus 1, and `cnt1` is the total number of 1s in `arrs`; if `arrs[0] == 1`, `cnt0` is the count of zeros in `arrs` starting from index 1, and `cnt1` is the total number of 1s in `arrs`. If `cnt1` is 0 or 1, `ans` remains 0. Otherwise, if `cnt1` is neither 0 nor 1, `ans` is set to `cnt0`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case involves a list of integers (0s and 1s) representing cells, with 1s indicating cells containing chips and 0s indicating free cells. The function calculates the minimum number of moves required to group all 1s together into a single contiguous block by moving 1s to the left. The result for each test case is printed to the console. The function does not return any value; it only outputs the results directly.
