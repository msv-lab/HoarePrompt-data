Correctness: **False**

The provided solution does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single contiguous block. The logic for counting the number of operations is flawed. Specifically, the approach of counting zeros (`cnt0`) and ones (`cnt1`) and then using these counts to determine the answer is not sufficient. The correct approach involves finding the optimal position to gather all the chips and calculating the minimum number of moves required to bring all chips to this position.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def min_operations_to_gather_chips(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = test_cases[_][0]
        arr = test_cases[_][1]
        
        # Count the number of chips (1s)
        num_chips = sum(arr)
        
        # Initialize the minimum operations to a large number
        min_ops = float('inf')
        
        # Calculate the prefix sum of chips
        prefix_sum = [0] * (n + 1)
        for i in range(n):
            prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + arr[i]
        
        # Iterate over all possible positions to gather chips
        for i in range(n - num_chips + 1):
            # Calculate the number of moves to bring chips to the current position
            left_moves = prefix_sum[i]
            right_moves = prefix_sum[i + num_chips] - prefix_sum[i]
            total_moves = left_moves + (num_chips - right_moves)
            min_ops = min(min_ops, total_moves)
        
        results.append(min_ops)
    
    return results

# Example usage:
t = 5
test_cases = [
    (8, [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0]),
    (6, [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]),
    (6, [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]),
    (5, [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]),
    (9, [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0])
]

results = min_operations_to_gather_chips(t, test_cases)
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This corrected function uses a more systematic approach to find the minimum number of operations required to gather all chips into a single contiguous block. It calculates the prefix sum of chips and iterates over all possible positions to gather the chips, ensuring the correct minimum number of operations is found.
