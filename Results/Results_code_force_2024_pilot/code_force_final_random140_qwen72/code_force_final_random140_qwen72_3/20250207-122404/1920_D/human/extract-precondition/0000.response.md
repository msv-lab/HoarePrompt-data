Precondition: **x is an integer representing the k-th element query index, where 1 ≤ x ≤ size of the array after all operations.** 

However, the provided function definition `def func_1(x):` does not match the complexity of the problem described. The function should likely accept more parameters to handle the operations and queries as described. A more appropriate function definition might look like:

```python
def process_operations_and_queries(t, cases):
```

Where `t` is the number of test cases, and `cases` is a list of dictionaries or tuples, each containing the necessary data for each test case (n, q, operations, and queries). This would better align with the problem's requirements.
