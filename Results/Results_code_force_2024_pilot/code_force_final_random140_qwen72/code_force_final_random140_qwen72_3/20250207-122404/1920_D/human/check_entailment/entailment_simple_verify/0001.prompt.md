You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jayden has an array a which is initially empty. There are n operations of two
types he must perform in the given order.

  1. Jayden appends an integer x (1 \leq x \leq n ) to the end of array a . 
  2. Jayden appends x copies of array a to the end of array a . In other words, array a becomes [a,\underbrace{a,\ldots,a}_{x}] . It is guaranteed that he has done at least one operation of the first type before this. 

Jayden has q queries. For each query, you must tell him the k -th element of
array a . The elements of the array are numbered from 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \leq n, q
\leq 10^5 ) — the number of operations and the number of queries.

The following n lines describe the operations. Each line contains two integers
b and x (b \in \\{1, 2\\} ), where b denotes the type of operation. If b=1 ,
then x (1 \leq x \leq n ) is the integer Jayden appends to the end of the
array. If b=2 , then x (1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ) is the number of copies Jayden
appends to the end of the array.

The next line of each test case contains q integers k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_q (1
\leq k_i \leq \min(10^{18}, c) ), which denote the queries, where c is the
size of the array after finishing all n operations.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and the sum of q over all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output q integers — answers to Jayden's queries.

Note

In the first test case:

  * After the first operation a = [1] ;
  * After the second operation a = [1, 2] ;
  * After the third operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2] ;
  * After the fourth operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3] ;
  * After the fifth operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3] .

In the fourth test case, after all operations a = [1, 2] .

    #State: `x` is updated to `(x - 1) % i + 1` for each element `i` in `a`, and `a` has been fully iterated over. If at any point during the iteration `x` becomes an element in `b`, the program returns the value of `b` at the index `x`. Otherwise, the loop completes without returning, and `b` remains unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually. This is a good start for handling multiple test cases.

2. **Operation Processing**:
   - The program initializes `a` with `[0]` and `b` as an empty dictionary. The list `a` is used to keep track of the size of the array at different stages, and `b` maps positions to values.
   - For each operation, it reads the type (`d`) and the value (`e`).
   - If the type is 1 (append an integer), it increments the last element of `a` and updates the dictionary `b` with the new position and value.
   - If the type is 2 (append x copies of the array), it appends a new element to `a` which is the current size of the array multiplied by `(e + 1)`.

3. **Handling Large Sizes**:
   - The program checks if the last element of `a` exceeds \(10^{19}\) and skips further processing if it does. This is a reasonable check to avoid overflow issues.

4. **Query Processing**:
   - The program reverses the list `a` and then processes the queries.
   - The function `func_1` is defined to handle the queries. It takes a query index `x`, converts it to an integer, and checks if the index is directly in the dictionary `b`.
   - If the index is not directly in `b`, it iterates through the reversed list `a` to find the corresponding value using modulo operations.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results of the queries in the required format.

However, there are a few issues in the code:
- The variable names `c` and `d` are reused, which can lead to confusion.
- The function `r` is not defined in the provided code, but it seems to be intended to be `func_1`.

Given these points, the program is mostly correct but has some minor issues that need to be addressed.
