Postcondition: ***`x` is updated to `(x - 1) % i + 1`, `a` has at least one element, `i` is the second element of `a`, and `b` remains unchanged. If `x` (after being updated) is in `b`, the program returns the element at index `x` in list `b`. Since `x` is not initially in `b`, the actual index used is the result of the calculation, which is guaranteed to be within the bounds of `b` due to the modulo operation.***
