Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: x is an integer representing the k-th element query index, where 1 ≤ x ≤ size of the array after all operations, and x is not in b
Code of the loop:
for i in a:
    x = (x - 1) % i + 1
    if x in b:
        return b[x]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`x` is updated to `(x - 1) % i + 1`, `a` has at least one element, `i` is the first element of `a`, `b` remains unchanged, and `x` is not in `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`x` is updated to `(x - 1) % i + 1`, `a` has at least one element, `i` is the second element of `a`, and `b` remains unchanged. If `x` (after being updated) is in `b`, the program returns the element at index `x` in list `b`. Since `x` is not initially in `b`, the actual index used is the result of the calculation, which is guaranteed to be within the bounds of `b` due to the modulo operation.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`x` is updated to `(x - 1) % i + 1`, where `i` is the third element of `a`, and `a` has at least three elements. If `x` is in `b`, the program returns the value of `b` at the index calculated as `(x - 1) % i + 1`. Otherwise, the program does not return anything, and `b` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
