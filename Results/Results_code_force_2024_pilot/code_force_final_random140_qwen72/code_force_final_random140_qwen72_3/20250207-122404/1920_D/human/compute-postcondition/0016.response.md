Postcondition: ***`x` is updated to `(x - 1) % i + 1`, where `i` is the third element of `a`, and `a` has at least three elements. If `x` is in `b`, the program returns the value of `b` at the index calculated as `(x - 1) % i + 1`. Otherwise, the program does not return anything, and `b` remains unchanged.***
