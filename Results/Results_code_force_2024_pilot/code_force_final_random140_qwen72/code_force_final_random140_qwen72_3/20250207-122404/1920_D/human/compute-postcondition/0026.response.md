Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes an integer `x` and returns a value from the array `b`. Depending on the conditions involving the array `a` and the variable `f`, it may return the value at index `x` in `b`, the value at the index corresponding to the element at position `2 * i + 1` in `a` (where `i` is `f - 1`), or the value at the final modified index `x` after the loop completes. The function modifies `x` during its execution based on the elements in `a` and the conditions specified. The arrays `a` and `b` and the variable `f` remain unchanged throughout the function's execution. **
