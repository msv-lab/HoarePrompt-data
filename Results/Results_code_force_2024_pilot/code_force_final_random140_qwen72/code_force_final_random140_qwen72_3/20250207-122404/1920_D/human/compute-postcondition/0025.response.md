The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `x`, which is an integer representing the k-th element to be queried from the array `b`. The function returns different values based on the following cases:

- **Case_1**: If the function reaches a point where it can directly return the value of the element at index `x` in the array `b`, it does so.
- **Case_2**: If the function determines that the element at position `2 * i + 1` in the array `a` (where `i` is `f - 1`) is less than the original `x`, it returns the value of `b` at the index which is the element at position `2 * i + 1` in the array `a`.
- **Case_3**: If the loop completes all its iterations without returning a value, and the final value of `i` is `-1`, the function returns the value of `b` at the final value of `x`, which may have been updated during the loop.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `x` and returns the value of the element at index `x` in the array `b`. If the element at position `2 * i + 1` in the array `a` (where `i` is `f - 1`) is less than the original `x`, it returns the value of `b` at the index which is the element at position `2 * i + 1` in the array `a`. If the loop completes all iterations without returning a value, it returns the value of `b` at the final value of `x`.**
