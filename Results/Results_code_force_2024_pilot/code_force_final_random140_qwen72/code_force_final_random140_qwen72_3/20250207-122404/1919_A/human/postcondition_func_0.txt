The function `func` reads an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^9). It then compares `n` and `k` and prints 'Bob' if `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, and 'Alice' if `n` is less than `k`. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value. The state of the program after the function concludes includes the completion of all test cases, with no modifications to the input variables `n` and `k` beyond their use in the comparison.
