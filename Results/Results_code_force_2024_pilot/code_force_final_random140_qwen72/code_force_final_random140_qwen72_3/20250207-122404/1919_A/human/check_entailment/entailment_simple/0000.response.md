Reasoning:  
The logic of the program is based on the comparison between the number of coins `n` (Alice's coins) and `k` (Bob's coins). However, the program does not correctly implement the rules of the game as described in the problem statement. According to the game rules, the players can choose to swap wallets or keep their current wallets, and then remove one coin from their current wallet. The player who cannot make a valid move loses. The program, however, simply compares the number of coins and decides the winner based on which player has more coins at the start, which does not account for the strategic aspect of the game (swapping wallets and removing coins).

For example, in the case where `n == k`, the program always outputs "Bob". This is incorrect because if both players have the same number of coins, the outcome depends on the parity of the number of coins and the optimal strategy, not just the equality of the numbers. Similarly, the program incorrectly assumes that the player with fewer coins will always win, which is not necessarily true due to the swapping and removal mechanics.

Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem as specified.

Correctness: **False**
