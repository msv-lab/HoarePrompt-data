Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program simply compares the initial number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets and decides the winner based on which player has fewer coins initially. This approach fails to account for the game's rules, particularly the alternating moves and the option to swap wallets.

A counterexample to demonstrate the incorrectness of the program:

- Input: `t = 1`, `a = 1`, `b = 4`
- Expected Output: `Alice`
- Program Output: `Bob`

According to the game rules, Alice can win by swapping wallets with Bob on her first move, reducing the number of coins in her wallet to 3 and leaving Bob with 1 coin. Bob will then be forced to remove a coin, leaving him with 0 coins, and thus unable to make a move. Therefore, Alice wins. However, the program incorrectly outputs `Bob` because it does not simulate the game correctly.
