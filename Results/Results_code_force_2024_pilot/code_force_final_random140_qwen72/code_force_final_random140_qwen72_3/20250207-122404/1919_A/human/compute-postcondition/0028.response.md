The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters within its definition. However, based on the context provided, it is implied that the function processes multiple test cases, where each test case involves two integers, `a` and `b`, representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively. The function should handle up to 1000 test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), and for each test case, the values of `a` and `b` are constrained to be between 1 and 10^9.

Given the lack of explicit parameters in the function signature, it is likely that the function reads these values from an external source (e.g., user input, file, etc.) or they are passed in a way not shown in the function signature.

The function returns the result of some operation or comparison involving `a` and `b` for each test case. Since the specific output is not provided, I will assume a common scenario where the function might determine who has more coins or if they have an equal number of coins.

Functionality: **The function processes up to 1000 test cases, where each test case involves two integers `a` and `b` representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively. For each test case, the function returns a result based on the comparison of `a` and `b`.**
