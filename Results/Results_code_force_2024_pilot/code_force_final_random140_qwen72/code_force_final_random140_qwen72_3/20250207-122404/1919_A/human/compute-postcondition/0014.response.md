The code snippet `n, k = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads two integer values from the user input, splits them, and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively.

- The initial values of `n` and `k` (which were provided by user input) are replaced by new values from the user input.
- The conditions about the relationship between `n` and `k` (whether `n` > `k` or `n` â‰¤ `k`) are no longer relevant because `n` and `k` have been reassigned.
- The values of `_rep` and `t` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`_rep` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, `n` and `k` are new integers provided by user input.**
