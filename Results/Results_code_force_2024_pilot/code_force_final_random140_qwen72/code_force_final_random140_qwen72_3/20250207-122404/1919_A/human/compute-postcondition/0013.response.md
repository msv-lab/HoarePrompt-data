The code snippet `n, k = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads two integers from the user input, splits them, and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. This means that the new values of `n` and `k` are determined by the user input.

- The initial values of `n` and `k` (which were previously provided by user input) are replaced by the new values from the current user input.
- The condition `n > k` or `n ≤ k` will depend on the new values of `n` and `k` provided by the user.
- The values of `_rep` and `t` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`_rep` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the new user input. If `n` > `k`, the current value of `n` is greater than the current value of `k`. If `n` ≤ `k`, the current value of `n` is either less than or equal to the current value of `k`.**
