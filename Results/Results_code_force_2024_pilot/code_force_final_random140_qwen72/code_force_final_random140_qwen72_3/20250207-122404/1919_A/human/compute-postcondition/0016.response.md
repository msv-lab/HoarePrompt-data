The code snippet provided does not depend on the values of `n`, `k`, `_rep`, or `t`. It simply prints the string `'Alice'`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `k` are reassigned to new integer values provided by user input.
- `_rep` is 1.
- `t` is greater than 1.

However, none of these variables or their values affect the `print` statement, which only outputs the string `'Alice'`.

Output: **Alice**
