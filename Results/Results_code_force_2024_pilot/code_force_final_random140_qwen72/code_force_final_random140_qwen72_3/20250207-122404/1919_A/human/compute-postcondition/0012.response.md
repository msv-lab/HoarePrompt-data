The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_rep` and the variable `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the relationship between `_rep` and `t`. If `_rep` is less than `t`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_rep` is 0 and `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `_rep` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1, and `t` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`_rep` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, `n` and `k` are integers provided by user input. If `n` > `k`, the current value of `n` is greater than the current value of `k`. If `n` â‰¤ `k`, the current value of `n` is either less than or equal to the current value of `k`.**
