The only variables in the loop head are `_rep` and `t`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `_rep` being less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `_rep` is 1 and `t` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `_rep` must be incremented by 1 (so it becomes 2), and `t` must still be greater than the new value of `_rep`.

State: **`_rep` is 2, `t` is greater than 2, and `n` and `k` are new integers provided by user input, regardless of the initial values of `n` and `k` or their relationship.**
