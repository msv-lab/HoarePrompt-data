The code snippet provided contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'Bob'`. The initial state describes the reassignment of `n` and `k` from user input and mentions that `_rep` is 1 and `t` is greater than 1. However, these variables and their values do not affect the `print` statement, as it simply prints a hardcoded string.

Output: **Bob**
