Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers greater than 0, `k` is an integer read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `f` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples in descending order where each tuple is (y - x, x, y) for consecutive elements x and y in the list `a`, `start` is the second element of the first tuple in `gap`, `end` is the third element of the first tuple in `gap`, `mid` is (start + end) // 2, `nd` is 0 if the length of `gap` is 1, otherwise `nd` is the first element of the second tuple in `gap`, `i` is `m`, `res` is the minimum value of `max(end - s, s - start, nd)` for all valid `s` values calculated during the loop, or remains `inf` if no valid `s` was found.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains an integer within the specified range.
- **`n`, `m`, `k`**: These are integers read from the input and remain unchanged.
- **`a`, `b`, `f`, `gap`**: These lists and tuples remain as they were initialized.
- **`start`, `end`, `mid`, `nd`**: These variables are derived from the initial state and remain unchanged.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be equal to `m`, indicating that the loop has executed `m` times.
- **`res`**: This variable is updated during the loop to the minimum value of `max(end - s, s - start, nd)` for all valid `s` values. If no valid `s` is found, `res` remains `inf`.
