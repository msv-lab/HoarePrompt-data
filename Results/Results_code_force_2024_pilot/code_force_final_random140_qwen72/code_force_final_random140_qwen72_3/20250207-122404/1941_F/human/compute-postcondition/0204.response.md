Postcondition: ***`i` is `m`, `res` is the minimum value found during the loop execution for the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd` for all valid `s` values, where `s` is calculated as `f[j] + b[i]` or `f[j - 1] + b[i]` depending on the conditions specified in the loop. If `res` was initially `inf`, it remains unchanged. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `gap`, `start`, `end`, `mid`, `nd`) remain unchanged.***
