Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `m` is greater than 1, `remain` is `mid - b[1]`, `j` is the index in `f` where `mid - b[1]` should be inserted to maintain sorted order. If `j >= 1`, `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[1]`, and `res` remains unchanged unless `start < s < end` is true, in which case `res` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`. If `j < 1`, `s` is `f[j] + b[1]`, and `res` remains unchanged unless `start < s < end` is true, in which case `res` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`.***
