Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `remain` is `mid - b[0]`, `j` is the index in `f` where `remain` should be inserted to maintain sorted order, `j` is not equal to `k`, `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[0]`, `start < s < end` condition remains unchanged, `res` remains unchanged, and the current value of `s` satisfies `start < s < end`.**
