To determine what will be printed by the `print(res)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the computation step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an integer greater than 0.
   - `m` is an integer greater than 0.
   - `k` is an integer read from the input.
   - `a` is a list of integers read from the input.
   - `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input.
   - `f` is a sorted list of integers read from the current input.
   - `gap` is a sorted list of tuples in descending order where each tuple is \((y - x, x, y)\) for consecutive elements \(x\) and \(y\) in the list `a`.
   - `start` is the second element of the first tuple in `gap`.
   - `end` is the third element of the first tuple in `gap`.
   - `mid` is \((start + end) // 2\).
   - `i` is `m`.
   - `nd` is 0 if the length of `gap` is 1, otherwise `nd` is the first element of the second tuple in `gap`.
   - `res` is the minimum value of the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd` for all valid `s` computed during the loop.
   - `res` is not equal to infinity.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `gap` is a list of tuples sorted in descending order by the first element of each tuple, which represents the gap between consecutive elements in `a`.
   - `start` and `end` are the second and third elements of the first tuple in `gap`, respectively.
   - `mid` is the midpoint between `start` and `end`.
   - `nd` is the first element of the second tuple in `gap` if `gap` has more than one tuple, otherwise it is 0.
   - `res` is the result of a minimization process involving the maximum of three values: `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`.

3. **Computation of `res`:**
   - The value of `res` is determined by finding the minimum value of the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd` for all valid `s` computed during the loop.
   - Since `res` is not equal to infinity, it means that a finite value has been found during the loop.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The `print(res)` statement will print the value of `res`, which is the minimum value of the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd` for all valid `s`.

Given the complexity and the specific conditions, the exact numerical value of `res` cannot be determined without the actual values of `a`, `b`, and `f`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `res`.

Output: **res (where res is the minimum value of the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd` for all valid `s` computed during the loop)**
