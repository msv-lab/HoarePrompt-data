Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `m` is greater than 2, `remain` is `mid - b[2]`, `j` is the index in `f` where `mid - b[2]` should be inserted to maintain sorted order. If `j >= 1`, `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[2]`. If `start < s < end`, `res` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`. Otherwise, the values of `i`, `m`, `remain`, `j`, and `s` remain unchanged.***
