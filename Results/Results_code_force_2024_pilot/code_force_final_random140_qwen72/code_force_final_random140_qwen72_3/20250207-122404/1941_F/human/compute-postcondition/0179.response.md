Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `m` is greater than 1, `remain` is `mid - b[1]`, `j` is the index in `f` where `mid - b[1]` should be inserted to maintain sorted order, `s` is `f[j] + b[1]`. If `start < s < end`, `res` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.***
