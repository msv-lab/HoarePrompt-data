The code snippet `j = bisect.bisect_left(f, remain)` uses the `bisect_left` function from the `bisect` module to find the index in the sorted list `f` where the value `remain` should be inserted to maintain the sorted order. This index is then assigned to the variable `j`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n`, `m` is an integer greater than 0
- `k` are integers read from the input
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input
- `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input
- `f` is a sorted list of integers read from the input
- `gap` is a sorted list of tuples in descending order where each tuple is (y - x, x, y) for consecutive elements x and y in the list `a`
- `start` is the second element of the first tuple in `gap`
- `end` is the third element of the first tuple in `gap`
- `mid` is (start + end) // 2
- `nd` is 0 if the length of `gap` is 1, otherwise `nd` is the first element of the second tuple in `gap`
- `res` is set to infinity (`inf`)
- `i` is 0
- `remain` is `mid - b[0]`

After executing the code snippet:
- `j` is assigned the index in the sorted list `f` where the value `remain` should be inserted to maintain the sorted order.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `k` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `f` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples in descending order where each tuple is (y - x, x, y) for consecutive elements x and y in the list `a`, `start` is the second element of the first tuple in `gap`, `end` is the third element of the first tuple in `gap`, `mid` is (start + end) // 2, `nd` is 0 if the length of `gap` is 1, otherwise `nd` is the first element of the second tuple in `gap`, `res` is set to infinity (`inf`), `i` is 0, `remain` is `mid - b[0]`, `j` is the index in the sorted list `f` where the value `remain` should be inserted to maintain the sorted order.**
