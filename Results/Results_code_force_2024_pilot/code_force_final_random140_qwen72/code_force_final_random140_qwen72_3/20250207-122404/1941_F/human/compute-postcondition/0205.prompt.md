Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each testcase, n, m, and k are integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ m, k ≤ 2 * 10^5; a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 2 * 10^9 and a_i < a_{i+1}; d is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ d_i ≤ 10^9; f is a list of k integers where 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m, k = [*map(int, input().split())]
    a = [*map(int, input().split())]
    b = [*map(int, input().split())]
    f = [*map(int, input().split())]
    gap = [(y - x, x, y) for y, x in zip(a[1:], a)]
    gap.sort(reverse=True)
    start = gap[0][1]
    end = gap[0][2]
    mid = (start + end) // 2
    nd = 0 if len(gap) == 1 else gap[1][0]
    b.sort()
    f.sort()
    res = inf
    for i in range(m):
        remain = mid - b[i]
        j = bisect.bisect_left(f, remain)
        if j == k:
            s = f[j - 1] + b[i]
            if start < s < end:
                res = min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))
        else:
            s = f[j] + b[i]
            if start < s < end:
                res = min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))
            if j >= 1:
                s = f[j - 1] + b[i]
                if start < s < end:
                    res = min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))
    if res == inf:
        print(gap[0][0])
    else:
        print(res)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers greater than 0, `k` is an integer read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `f` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples in descending order where each tuple is (y - x, x, y) for consecutive elements x and y in the list `a`, `start` is the second element of the first tuple in `gap`, `end` is the third element of the first tuple in `gap`, `mid` is (start + end) // 2, `nd` is 0 if the length of `gap` is 1, otherwise `nd` is the first element of the second tuple in `gap`, `i` is `m`, and `res` is either the minimum value of `max(end - s, s - start, nd)` for all valid `s` values calculated during the loop, or remains `inf` if no valid `s` was found. If `res` was initially `inf`, it remains `inf`. Otherwise, `res` is a finite value representing the minimum value of `max(end - s, s - start, nd)` for all valid `s` values calculated during the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `f` is a sorted list of integers read from the current input, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples in descending order where each tuple is (y - x, x, y) for consecutive elements x and y in the list `a`, `start` is the second element of the first tuple in `gap`, `end` is the third element of the first tuple in `gap`, `mid` is (start + end) // 2, `i` is `m`, `nd` is 0 if the length of `gap` is 1, otherwise `nd` is the first element of the second tuple in `gap`, and `res` is the minimum value of the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd` for all valid `s` computed during the loop. If `res` was initially equal to infinity (`inf`), it remains unchanged. Otherwise, `res` is not equal to infinity.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is `m`, `res` is the minimum value found during the loop execution for the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd` for all valid `s` values, where `s` is calculated as `f[j] + b[i]` or `f[j - 1] + b[i]` depending on the conditions specified in the loop. If `res` was initially `inf`, it remains unchanged. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `gap`, `start`, `end`, `mid`, `nd`) remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
