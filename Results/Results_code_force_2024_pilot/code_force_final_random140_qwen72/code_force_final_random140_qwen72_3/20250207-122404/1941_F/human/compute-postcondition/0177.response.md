Output State: **`i` is 1, `m` is greater than 1, `remain` is `mid - b[1]`, `j` is the index in `f` where `mid - b[1]` should be inserted to maintain sorted order, `s` is `f[j] + b[1]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `s` is calculated as `f[j] + b[i]`.
- Since `i` is 1, `b[i]` is `b[1]`.
- Therefore, `s` is `f[j] + b[1]`.
- The values of `i`, `m`, `remain`, and `j` remain unchanged.
