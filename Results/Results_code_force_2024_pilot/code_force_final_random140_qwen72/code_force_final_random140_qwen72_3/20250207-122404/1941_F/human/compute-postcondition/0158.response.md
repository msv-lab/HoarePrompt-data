Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `remain` is `mid - b[0]`, `j` is the index in `f` where `remain` should be inserted to maintain sorted order, and `j` is equal to `k`, `s` is `f[k - 1] + b[0]`. If `start < s < end`, `res` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`. Otherwise, the values of `i`, `m`, `remain`, `j`, `k`, and `s` remain unchanged.***
