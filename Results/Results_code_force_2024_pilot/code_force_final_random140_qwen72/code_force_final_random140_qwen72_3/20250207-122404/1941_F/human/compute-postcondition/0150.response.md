Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `k` is the third integer read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the new input, `f` is a sorted list of integers read from the current input, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples in descending order based on the first element of each tuple, `start` is the second element of the first tuple in `gap`, `end` is the third element of the first tuple in `gap`, `mid` is (start + end) // 2, `i` is `m`, `nd` is 0 if the length of `gap` is 1, otherwise `nd` is the first element of the second tuple in `gap`, `res` is now equal to infinity (`inf`).**

Explanation: The code snippet `res = inf` assigns the value infinity (`inf`) to the variable `res`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
