Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is a list of integers read from the input, `f` is a list of integers read from the input, `gap` is a list of tuples where each tuple is (y - x, x, y) for consecutive elements x and y in the list `a`.** 

Explanation: The code creates a new list `gap` by iterating over consecutive pairs of elements in the list `a` using the `zip` function. For each pair `(x, y)` where `x` is the current element and `y` is the next element in `a`, it calculates the difference `y - x` and stores it along with `x` and `y` in a tuple. This list of tuples is then assigned to the variable `gap`. All other variables remain unchanged.
