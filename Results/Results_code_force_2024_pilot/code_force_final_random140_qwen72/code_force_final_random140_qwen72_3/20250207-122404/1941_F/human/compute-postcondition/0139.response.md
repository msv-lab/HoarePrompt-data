Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `k` is the third integer read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `f` is a sorted list of integers read from the current input, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples in descending order where each tuple is (y - x, x, y) for consecutive elements x and y in the list `a`, `start` is the second element of the first tuple in `gap`, `end` is the third element of the first tuple in `gap`, `mid` is (start + end) // 2, `i` is `m`, `nd` is 0 if the length of `gap` is 1, otherwise `nd` is the first element of the second tuple in `gap`, and `res` is the minimum value of the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd` for all valid `s` computed during the loop. If `res` was initially equal to infinity (`inf`), it remains unchanged. Otherwise, `res` is not equal to infinity.**

Explanation:
- The code `a = [*map(int, input().split())]` reads a line of input and splits it into a list of integers, which is then assigned to the variable `a`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `b`, `f`, `gap`, `start`, `end`, `mid`, `i`, `nd`, and `res`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The new value of `a` is a list of integers read from the input, replacing its previous value.
