Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers greater than 0, `k` is an integer read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `f` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples in descending order where each tuple is (y - x, x, y) for consecutive elements x and y in the list `a`, `start` is the second element of the first tuple in `gap`, `end` is the third element of the first tuple in `gap`, `mid` is (start + end) // 2, `nd` is 0 if the length of `gap` is 1, otherwise `nd` is the first element of the second tuple in `gap`, `i` is `m`, `res` is a finite value representing the minimum value of `max(end - s, s - start, nd)` for all valid `s` values calculated during the loop.**
