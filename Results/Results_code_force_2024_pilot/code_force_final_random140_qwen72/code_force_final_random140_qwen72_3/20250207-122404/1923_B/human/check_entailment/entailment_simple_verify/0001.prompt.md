You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are playing a computer game. The current level of this game can be modeled
as a straight line. Your character is in point 0 of this line. There are n
monsters trying to kill your character; the i -th monster has health equal to
a_i and is initially in the point x_i .

Every second, the following happens:

  * first, you fire up to k bullets at monsters. Each bullet targets exactly one monster and decreases its health by 1 . For each bullet, you choose its target arbitrary (for example, you can fire all bullets at one monster, fire all bullets at different monsters, or choose any other combination). Any monster can be targeted by a bullet, regardless of its position and any other factors; 
  * then, all alive monsters with health 0 or less die; 
  * then, all alive monsters move 1 point closer to you (monsters to the left of you increase their coordinates by 1 , monsters to the right of you decrease their coordinates by 1 ). If any monster reaches your character (moves to the point 0 ), you lose. 

Can you survive and kill all n monsters without letting any of them reach your
character?

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 3 \cdot 10^4 )
— the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines:

  * the first line contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ; 1 \le k \le 2 \cdot 10^9 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains n integers x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n (-n \le x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < \dots < x_n \le n ; x_i \ne 0 ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if you can kill all n monsters before they reach
your character, or NO otherwise.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Note

In the first example, you can act as follows:

  * during the 1 -st second, fire 1 bullet at the 1 -st monster and 1 bullet at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 1 -st monster dies, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd monster move closer; 
  * during the 2 -nd second, fire 2 bullets at the 2 -nd monster. Then the 2 -nd monster dies, the 3 -rd monster moves closer; 
  * during the 3 -rd second, fire 2 bullets at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 3 -rd monster dies. 

In the second example, you can fire only 1 bullet, so you can kill only one of
the two monsters during the 1 -st second. Then, the remaining monster moves
closer and kills your character.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - `func_1` reads the number of monsters `n` and the number of bullets per second `k`.
   - It then reads the health values of the monsters into a list `a`.
   - The positions of the monsters are read one by one and used to update a list `b` where `b[i]` represents the total health of monsters that are `i` units away from the player.

2. **Logic for Survival:**
   - The function initializes a variable `r` to keep track of the total number of bullets available.
   - It iterates through the distances from 1 to `n` (since the maximum distance a monster can be is `n`).
   - For each distance `i`, it adds `k` bullets to `r` (since you can fire `k` bullets per second).
   - It then checks if the total health of monsters at distance `i` (`b[i]`) is greater than the available bullets `r`. If so, it prints "NO" and returns, indicating that the player cannot survive.
   - If the player has enough bullets to kill all monsters at distance `i`, it subtracts the required bullets from `r`.

3. **Multiple Test Cases:**
   - `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles invalid input formats by catching `ValueError` and printing an error message.

5. **Correctness:**
   - The logic correctly simulates the game's rules and checks if the player can survive by ensuring that the total number of bullets available is always sufficient to kill the monsters before they reach the player.
   - The function correctly handles multiple test cases and edge cases.

The given program is correct based on the provided problem description and the reasoning above.
