A `ValueError` can occur when the `int()` function tries to convert the input to an integer but fails because the input is not a valid integer. This happens at the line `t = int(input())`.

The `try` block attempts to read an integer from the user input and then iterates `t` times, calling `func_1()` in each iteration. If the input is a valid integer within the specified range, the loop executes normally. However, if the input is not a valid integer, a `ValueError` is raised, and the program moves to the `except` block.

In the `except` block, the program prints "Invalid input format" and does not execute the loop or call `func_1()`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **If the input is a valid integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4, `t` is set to this integer, and the function `func_1()` is called `t` times. If the input is not a valid integer, the program prints "Invalid input format" and does not execute the loop or call `func_1()`.**
