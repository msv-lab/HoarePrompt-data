Let's break down the initial state and the conditions to determine what will be printed:

1. **Variable `n`**: Remains unchanged after the loop.
2. **Variable `i`**: Is `n-1` after the loop.
3. **Variable `x`**: Is the last input integer.
4. **Array `b`**: Each element `b[j]` is incremented by the sum of `a[i]` for all `i` such that `abs(int(input())) == j` for each `j` in the range from 0 to `n`.
5. **Variable `r`**: Is calculated as `k * n - sum(b[1:n])`, and it is ensured that `r` is greater than or equal to each `b[i]` for `i` in the range from 1 to `n`. If at any point `r` is less than `b[i]`, the program prints 'NO' and returns without completing the loop.

Given these conditions, the key point is that if the program reaches the `print('YES')` statement, it means that the condition `r >= b[i]` for all `i` in the range from 1 to `n` has been satisfied throughout the loop. Therefore, the program will not have printed 'NO' and returned early.

Thus, the `print('YES')` statement will execute, and the output will be:

Output: **YES**
