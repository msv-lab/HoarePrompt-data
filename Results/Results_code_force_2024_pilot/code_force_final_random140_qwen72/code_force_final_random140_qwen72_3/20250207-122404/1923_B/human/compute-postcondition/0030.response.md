To determine what will be printed by the `print('NO')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` must be greater than 3.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `x` is the last input integer.
   - `b` is an array where each element `b[j]` is incremented by the sum of `a[i]` for all `i` such that `abs(int(input())) == j` for each `j` in the range from 0 to `n`.
   - `r` is calculated as `2k - b[1] - b[i] + k`.
   - `r` is greater than or equal to `b[1]`.
   - If `r` is less than `b[i]`, the program does not return any value.

2. **Conditions:**
   - The program will only print 'NO' if `r` is less than `b[i]`.

3. **Analysis:**
   - The value of `r` is calculated as `2k - b[1] - b[i] + k`, which simplifies to `3k - b[1] - b[i]`.
   - We know that `r` must be greater than or equal to `b[1]` (i.e., `3k - b[1] - b[i] >= b[1]`).
   - Simplifying this inequality: `3k - b[1] - b[i] >= b[1]` becomes `3k - b[i] >= 2b[1]` or `3k >= 2b[1] + b[i]`.

4. **Final Condition:**
   - If `r` is less than `b[i]`, the program does not return any value.
   - This means that if `3k - b[1] - b[i] < b[i]`, the program will not print anything.
   - Simplifying this inequality: `3k - b[1] - b[i] < b[i]` becomes `3k - b[1] < 2b[i]` or `3k < b[1] + 2b[i]`.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the conditions, if `3k < b[1] + 2b[i]`, the program will not print anything.
   - However, if `3k >= b[1] + 2b[i]`, the program will print 'NO'.

Since the problem states that the program will print 'NO' if `r` is less than `b[i]`, and we have determined that this condition is met when `3k < b[1] + 2b[i]`, the program will indeed print 'NO' under these conditions.

Output: **NO**
