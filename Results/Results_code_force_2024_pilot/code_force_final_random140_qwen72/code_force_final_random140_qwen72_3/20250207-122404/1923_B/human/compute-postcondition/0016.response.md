The value of `r` is incremented by `k`. The initial value of `r` is 0, so after the increment, `r` will be equal to `k`. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `x`, `b`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `x` is the last input integer, `b` is an array where each element `b[j]` is incremented by the sum of `a[i]` for all `i` such that `abs(int(input())) == j` for each `j` in the range from 0 to `n`, `r` is `k`.**
