A `ValueError` can occur when the `int()` function tries to convert the input into an integer, but the input is not a valid integer (e.g., a string or a floating-point number). If the input is invalid, the `ValueError` is raised, and the program prints "Invalid input format" and exits the `try` block without executing the loop.

If the input is valid, the program sets `t` to the input integer and then enters a loop that runs `t` times, calling `func_1()` each time. The variable `_` is used as a placeholder in the loop and does not retain any specific value after the loop completes.

Therefore, the output state is: **If the input is a valid integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4, the program calls `func_1()` `t` times. If the input is invalid, the program prints "Invalid input format" and returns without further action.**
