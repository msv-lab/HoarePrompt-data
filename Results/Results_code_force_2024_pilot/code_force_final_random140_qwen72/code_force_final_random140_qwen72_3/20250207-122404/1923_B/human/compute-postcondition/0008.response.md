Given the initial state is unknown, there are no specific variables or objects defined that influence the output of the print statement. The print statement simply outputs a static string.

Here's the analysis:

- The print statement contains a static string: `'Invalid input format'`.
- Since there are no variables or conditions affecting this string, it will be printed as is.

Therefore, the output is:

Output: **Invalid input format**
