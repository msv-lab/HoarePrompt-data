The function `func_2` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the context provided, it seems there might be an implicit or external dependency on a variable `t`, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4. Since no specific output is provided, it's not clear what the function returns. Assuming the function is supposed to return something related to `t`, the description would need more detail.

However, given the constraints and without additional context, the best we can do is state the known parameter constraint and assume the function might return something based on `t`.

Functionality: **The function `func_2` implicitly depends on a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4). The exact return value is not specified, but it likely involves some computation or decision based on `t`.**
