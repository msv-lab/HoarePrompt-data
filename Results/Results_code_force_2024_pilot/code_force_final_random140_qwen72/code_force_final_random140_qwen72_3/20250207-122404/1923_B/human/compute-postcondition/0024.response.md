Let's break down the initial state and the provided Python code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is 2.
- `x` is the last input integer.
- `b` is an array where each element `b[j]` is incremented by the sum of `a[i]` for all `i` such that `abs(int(input())) == j` for each `j` in the range from 0 to `n`.
- `r` is `2k - b[1]`, and `r` is greater than or equal to `b[1]`.

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `n`**: It is given that `n` must be greater than 1.
2. **Variable `i`**: It is set to 2.
3. **Variable `x`**: It is the last input integer, but its specific value is not provided.
4. **Array `b`**: Each element `b[j]` is incremented by the sum of `a[i]` for all `i` such that `abs(int(input())) == j`. This means that `b[j]` is influenced by user inputs and the corresponding values in the array `a`.
5. **Variable `r`**: It is defined as `2k - b[1]`, and it is given that `r` is greater than or equal to `b[1]`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('NO')
```

### Explanation:
- The code snippet simply contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`.
- The values of the variables and the conditions described in the initial state do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the statement does not reference any of these variables or conditions.

### Final Output:
Output: **NO**
