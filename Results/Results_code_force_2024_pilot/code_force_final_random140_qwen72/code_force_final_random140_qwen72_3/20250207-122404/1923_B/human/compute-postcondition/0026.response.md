Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `x` is the last input integer, `b` is an array where each element `b[j]` is incremented by the sum of `a[i]` for all `i` such that `abs(int(input())) == j` for each `j` in the range from 0 to `n`, `r` is `2k - b[1]`, and `r` is greater than or equal to `b[1]`. If `r` is less than `b[i]`, the program does not return any value.***
