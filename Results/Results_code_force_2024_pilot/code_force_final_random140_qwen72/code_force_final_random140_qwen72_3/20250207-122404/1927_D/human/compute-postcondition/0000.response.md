The provided code defines a lambda function `R` that maps the input split by spaces to integers. This function will read a line of input and convert each space-separated value into an integer, returning an iterator of these integers.

Given the initial state, the definition of `R` does not change any of the variables mentioned (t, n, a, q, l, r). It only introduces a new function `R` that can be used to read and process input in the format specified.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the addition of the function `R`.

Output State: **t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, representing the length of the array a. a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6. q is an integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 2·10^5, representing the number of queries. Each query is represented by two integers l and r where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n. The sum of n and q across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5. A function `R` is defined to map input split by spaces to integers.**
