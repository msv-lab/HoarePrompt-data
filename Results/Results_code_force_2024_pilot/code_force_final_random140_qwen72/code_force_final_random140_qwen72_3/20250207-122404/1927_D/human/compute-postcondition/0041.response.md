Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer between 0 and 10^4 - 2, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `a` is a list containing only the integer 0, `q` is 0, `p` is the last element from `R()`, `i` is the length of `R()`, `j` is 0 if the last two elements of `R()` are the same, otherwise `j` is 1, `l` is the first element from `R()`, `r` is the second element from `R()`**

Explanation:
- The code `a = [0]` initializes the list `a` to contain only the integer 0.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `q`, `p`, `i`, `j`, `l`, `r`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
