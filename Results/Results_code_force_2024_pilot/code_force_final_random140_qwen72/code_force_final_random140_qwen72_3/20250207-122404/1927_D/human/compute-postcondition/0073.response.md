The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is non-zero, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is a non-zero integer between 0 and 10^4 - 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must remain a non-zero integer.

State: **`t` is a non-zero integer between 0 and 10^4 - 2, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `a` is a list containing `[0, 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`, `q` is now 0, `i` is `n`, `j` is `n-1`, `l` is the first element from `R()`, `r` is the second element from `R()`, `p` is the last element from `R()`**
