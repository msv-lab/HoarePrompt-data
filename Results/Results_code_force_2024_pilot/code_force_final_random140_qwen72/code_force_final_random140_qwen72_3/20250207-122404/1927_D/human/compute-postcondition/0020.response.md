The value of `p` is updated to be the same as the value of `x`. The value of `x` is the next element from `R()` after the second one, which means `x` is now the third element from `R()`. Since `p` is now equal to `x`, the condition for `j` (which depends on whether `x` is not equal to `p`) will no longer be met, so `j` will remain 2.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `a` is [0, 0, 0, j], `q` is an integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 2·10^5, each query is represented by two integers `l` and `r` where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n, the sum of `n` and `q` across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5, `p` is the third element from `R()`, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `R()` returns an iterable with at least two elements, `x` is the third element from `R()` after the second one.**
