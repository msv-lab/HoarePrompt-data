Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer between 0 and 10^4 - 2, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `a` is `[0, 0, j]`, `q` is 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 1 if `x` is not equal to `p`, otherwise `j` is 0, `l` is the first element from `R()`, `r` is the second element from `R()`, `p` is equal to `x`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `p` is updated to be equal to the current value of `x`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `q`, `i`, `j`, `l`, `r`) remain unchanged.
- The condition for `j` (whether `x` is not equal to `p`) is now evaluated based on the new value of `p`, which is `x`. If `x` was not equal to the previous value of `p`, `j` remains 1; otherwise, `j` remains 0.
