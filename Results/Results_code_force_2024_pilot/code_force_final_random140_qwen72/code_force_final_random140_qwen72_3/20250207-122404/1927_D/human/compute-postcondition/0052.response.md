Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer between 0 and 10^4 - 2, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `a` is `[0, 0, j]`, `q` is 0, `i` is 2, `j` is 1 if `x` is not equal to `p`, otherwise `j` is 0, `l` is the first element from `R()`, `r` is the second element from `R()`, `p` is equal to `x`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `q`, `j`, `l`, `r`, `p`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
