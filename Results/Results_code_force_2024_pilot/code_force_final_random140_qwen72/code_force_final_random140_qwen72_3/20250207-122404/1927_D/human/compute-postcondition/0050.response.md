The code snippet `a += j,` appends the value of `j` to the list `a`. Let's analyze the impact:

- `a` initially contains `[0, 0]`.
- `j` is 1 if `x` is not equal to `p`, otherwise `j` is 0.

After executing the code:

- If `j` is 1, `a` becomes `[0, 0, 1]`.
- If `j` is 0, `a` becomes `[0, 0, 0]`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `q`, `i`, `l`, `r`, `p`, and `x`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer between 0 and 10^4 - 2, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `a` is `[0, 0, j]`, `q` is 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 1 if `x` is not equal to `p`, otherwise `j` is 0, `l` is the first element from `R()`, `r` is the second element from `R()`, `p` is equal to the next element from `R()`**.
