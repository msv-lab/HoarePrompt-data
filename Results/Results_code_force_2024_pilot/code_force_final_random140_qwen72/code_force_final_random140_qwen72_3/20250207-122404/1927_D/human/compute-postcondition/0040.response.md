The function `R()` is called, which presumably modifies some internal state or performs some operations, but does not explicitly modify the variables listed in the initial state. Since the function `R()` does not return any value or change the variables mentioned, the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer between 0 and 10^4 - 2, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `a` is a list containing integers starting with 0 followed by the sequence of `j` values determined by the loop, `q` is 0 (indicating the loop has completed its iterations), `p` is the last element from `R()`, `i` is the length of `R()`, `j` is 0 if the last two elements of `R()` are the same, otherwise `j` is 1, `l` is the first element from `R()`, `r` is the second element from `R()`**.
