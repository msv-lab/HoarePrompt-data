To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1.
- `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5.
- `a` is a list containing integers starting with 0 followed by the sequence of `j` values determined by the loop.
- `q` is the first element from `R()` minus 2 and must be non-zero.
- `p` is the last element from `R()`.
- `i` is the length of `R()`.
- `j` is 0 if the last two elements of `R()` are the same, otherwise `j` is 1.
- `l` is the first element from `R()`.
- `r` is the second element from `R()`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the values of `l` and `r`:**
   - `l` is the first element from `R()`.
   - `r` is the second element from `R()`.

2. **Determine the value of `a[r]`:**
   - `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the sequence of `j` values.
   - `r` is the second element from `R()`, so `a[r]` is the value at index `r` in the list `a`.

3. **Evaluate the condition `a[r] < l`:**
   - If `a[r]` is less than `l`, the expression `((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l]` will evaluate to `[-1, -1]`.
   - If `a[r]` is greater than or equal to `l`, the expression will evaluate to `(a[r], r)`.

4. **Unpack the result and print:**
   - If `a[r] < l`, the `print` statement will unpack `[-1, -1]` and print `-1 -1`.
   - If `a[r] >= l`, the `print` statement will unpack `(a[r], r)` and print `a[r] r`.

### Final Output:
Based on the initial state and the code snippet, the output will depend on the values of `a[r]` and `l`. Since the exact values of `a` and `R()` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **-1 -1 (if a[r] < l) or a[r] r (if a[r] >= l)**

This means:
- If `a[r]` is less than `l`, the output will be `-1 -1`.
- If `a[r]` is greater than or equal to `l`, the output will be `a[r] r`, where `a[r]` is the value at index `r` in the list `a` and `r` is the second element from `R()`.
