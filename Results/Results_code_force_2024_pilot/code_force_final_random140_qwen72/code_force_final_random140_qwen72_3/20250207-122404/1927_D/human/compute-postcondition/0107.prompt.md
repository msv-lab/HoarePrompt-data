Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a non-zero integer between -1 and 10^4 - 3, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `a` is a list of length `n` starting with `[0]` followed by the sequence of indices where `x` was different from `p`, `q` is the first element from `R()`, `i` is `n`, `j` is 0, `l` is the first element from `R()`, `r` is the second element from `R()`, `p` is the last element of the iterable returned by `R()`.
Code of the loop:
while q:
    q -= 1
    l, r = R()
    print(*((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a non-zero integer between -1 and 10^4 - 3, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `a` is a list of length `n` starting with `[0]` followed by the sequence of indices where `x` was different from `p`, `i` is `n`, `j` is 0, `l` is the third element from `R()`, `r` is the fourth element from `R()`, `p` is the last element of the iterable returned by `R()`, `q` is a non-zero value decreased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is a non-zero integer between -1 and 10^4 - 3, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `a` is a list of length `n` starting with `[0]` followed by the sequence of indices where `x` was different from `p`, `i` is `n`, `j` is 0, `l` is the first element from `R()`, `r` is the second element from `R()`, `p` is the last element of the iterable returned by `R()`, `q` is a non-zero value decreased by 1 and must still be non-zero.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is a non-zero integer between -1 and 10^4 - 3, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `a` is a list of length `n` starting with `[0]` followed by the sequence of indices where `x` was different from `p`, `i` is `n`, `j` is 0, `l` is the first element from `R()`, `r` is the second element from `R()`, `p` is the last element of the iterable returned by `R()`, `q` is a non-zero value decreased by 2 and must still be non-zero.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
