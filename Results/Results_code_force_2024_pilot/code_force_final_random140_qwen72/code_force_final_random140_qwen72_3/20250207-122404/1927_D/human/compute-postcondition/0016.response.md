Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `a` is [0, 0, 0], `q` is an integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 2·10^5, each query is represented by two integers `l` and `r` where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n, the sum of `n` and `q` across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5, `p` is the next element from `R()`, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `R()` returns an iterable with at least two elements, `x` is the next element from `R()` after the first one.**
