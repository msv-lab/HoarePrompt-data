Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer between -1 and 10^4 - 3, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `a` is a list containing `[0, 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`, `q` is 0, `i` is `n`, `j` is `n-1`, `l` is the first element from `R()`, `r` is the second element from `R()`, `p` is the last element from `R()`**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` is decremented by 1, so if `t` was initially a non-zero integer between 0 and 10^4 - 2, it is now a non-zero integer between -1 and 10^4 - 3.
- All other variables (`n`, `a`, `q`, `i`, `j`, `l`, `r`, `p`) remain unchanged.
