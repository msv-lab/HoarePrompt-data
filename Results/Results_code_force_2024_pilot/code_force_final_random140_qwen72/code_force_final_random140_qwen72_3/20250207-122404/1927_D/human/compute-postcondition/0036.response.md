To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1.
- `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5.
- `a` is a list containing integers starting with 0 followed by the sequence of `j` values determined by the loop.
- `q` is the first element from `R()` minus 3 and must be non-zero.
- `p` is the last element from `R()`.
- `i` is the length of `R()`.
- `j` is 0 if the last two elements of `R()` are the same, otherwise `j` is 1.
- `l` is the first element from `R()`.
- `r` is the second element from `R()`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(*((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the values of `l` and `r`:**
   - `l` is the first element from `R()`.
   - `r` is the second element from `R()`.

2. **Determine the value of `a[r]`:**
   - `a` is a list that starts with 0 and is followed by a sequence of `j` values.
   - `j` is 0 if the last two elements of `R()` are the same, otherwise `j` is 1.
   - Therefore, `a[r]` will be either 0 or 1 depending on the value of `j`.

3. **Evaluate the condition `a[r] < l`:**
   - If `a[r]` is 0 and `l` is any positive integer, the condition `a[r] < l` will be true.
   - If `a[r]` is 1 and `l` is 1 or greater, the condition `a[r] < l` will be false.
   - If `a[r]` is 1 and `l` is 0, the condition `a[r] < l` will be false.

4. **Determine the output based on the condition:**
   - If `a[r] < l` is true, the tuple `(a[r], r)` will be printed.
   - If `a[r] < l` is false, the list `[-1, -1]` will be printed.

### Final Output:
- If `a[r]` is 0 and `l` is any positive integer, the output will be `a[r]` and `r`.
- If `a[r]` is 1 and `l` is 1 or greater, the output will be `[-1, -1]`.
- If `a[r]` is 1 and `l` is 0, the output will be `[-1, -1]`.

Given the initial state and the logic, the most precise description of the output is:

Output: **(a[r], r) if a[r] < l, otherwise [-1, -1]** (where `a[r]` is the value at index `r` in the list `a`, and `r` is the second element from `R()`, and `l` is the first element from `R()`)
