Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is a non-zero integer between 0 and 10^4 - 2.
- `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5.
- `a` is a list containing `[0, 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`.
- `q` is now `q - 1`.
- `i` is `n`.
- `j` is `n-1`.
- `l` is the first element from `R()`.
- `r` is the second element from `R()`.
- `p` is the last element from `R()`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(*((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **List `a`**:
   - The list `a` starts with `[0, 0]` followed by the sequence `[1, 2, ..., n-1]`.
   - Therefore, `a` looks like `[0, 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., n-1]`.

2. **Variables `l` and `r`**:
   - `l` and `r` are elements from the function `R()`, which is not explicitly defined but assumed to return a tuple of two elements.
   - Let's assume `R()` returns `(l, r)` where `l` and `r` are integers.

3. **Condition `a[r] < l`**:
   - We need to check if the element at index `r` in the list `a` is less than `l`.
   - If `a[r] < l`, the expression `((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l]` will evaluate to `[-1, -1]`.
   - If `a[r] >= l`, the expression will evaluate to `(a[r], r)`.

4. **Print Statement**:
   - The `*` operator unpacks the tuple or list.
   - If `a[r] < l`, the print statement will print `-1, -1`.
   - If `a[r] >= l`, the print statement will print `a[r], r`.

### Final Output:
Since the exact values of `l` and `r` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical values. However, we can describe the possible outputs based on the condition `a[r] < l`.

- If `a[r] < l`, the output will be `-1, -1`.
- If `a[r] >= l`, the output will be `a[r], r`.

Output: **-1, -1 (if a[r] < l) or a[r], r (if a[r] >= l) (where a[r] is the element at index r in the list a and r is the second element from R())**
