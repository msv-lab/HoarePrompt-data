Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `a` is a list containing integers starting with 0 followed by the sequence of `j` values determined by the loop, `q` is the first element from `R()` minus 2 and must be non-zero, `p` is the last element from `R()`, `i` is the length of `R()`, `j` is 0 if the last two elements of `R()` are the same, otherwise `j` is 1, `l` is the first element from `R()`, `r` is the second element from `R()`**

Explanation:
- The code `l, r = R()` assigns the first element of the iterable returned by `R()` to `l` and the second element to `r`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `q`, `p`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment.
- The new values of `l` and `r` are explicitly stated as the first and second elements of `R()`, respectively.
