Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer between -1 and 10^4 - 3, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `a` is a list of length `n` starting with `[0]` followed by the sequence of indices where `x` was different from `p`, `i` is `n`, `j` is 0, `l` is the first element from `R()`, `r` is the second element from `R()`, `p` is the last element of the iterable returned by `R()`, `q` is a non-zero value decreased by 1 and must still be non-zero, `q` is now a non-zero value decreased by 2 and must still be non-zero.**
