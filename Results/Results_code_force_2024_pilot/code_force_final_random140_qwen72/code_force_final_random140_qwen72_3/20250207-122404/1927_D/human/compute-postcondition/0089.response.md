Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer between -1 and 10^4 - 3, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `a` is `[0, 0, 1]` if `x` is not equal to `p`, otherwise `a` is `[0, 0, 0]`, `q` is 0, `i` is 2, `j` is 2 if `x` is not equal to `p`, otherwise `j` is 0, `l` is the first element from `R()`, `r` is the second element from `R()`, `p` is now equal to the second element of the iterable returned by `R()`, `x` is the third element of the iterable returned by `R()`**

Explanation:
- The code `j = (j, i)[x != p]` updates the value of `j` based on whether `x` is not equal to `p`.
- If `x` is not equal to `p`, `j` is set to `i`, which is 2.
- If `x` is equal to `p`, `j` remains 0.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
