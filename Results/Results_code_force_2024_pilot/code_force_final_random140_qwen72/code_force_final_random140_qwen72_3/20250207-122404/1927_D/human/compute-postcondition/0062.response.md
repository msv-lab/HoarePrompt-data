Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer between 0 and 10^4 - 2, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `a` is a list containing `[0, 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`, `q` is now `q - 1`, `i` is `n`, `j` is `n-1`, `l` is the first element from `R()`, `r` is the second element from `R()`, `p` is the last element from `R()`**

Explanation:
- The code `l, r = R()` assigns the first element from the function `R()` to `l` and the second element from `R()` to `r`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `q`, `i`, `j`, and `p` remain unchanged.
- The new values of `l` and `r` are directly taken from the function `R()`, which provides two elements.
- All other conditions and values from the initial state remain valid.
