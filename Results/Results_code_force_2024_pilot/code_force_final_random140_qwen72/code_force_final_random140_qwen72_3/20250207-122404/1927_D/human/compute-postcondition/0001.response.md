The code snippet `t, = R()` calls the function `R` which maps input split by spaces to integers. The result of `R()` is expected to be a single integer, which is then assigned to the variable `t`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, representing the length of the array `a`.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6.
- `q` is an integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 2·10^5, representing the number of queries.
- Each query is represented by two integers `l` and `r` where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n.
- The sum of `n` and `q` across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
- A function `R` is defined to map input split by spaces to integers.

After executing the code snippet:
- `t` is now assigned the value returned by `R()`, which is an integer between 1 and 10^4.

The other variables (`n`, `a`, `q`, `l`, `r`) remain unchanged and their initial conditions still hold.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, representing the length of the array `a`. `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6. `q` is an integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 2·10^5, representing the number of queries. Each query is represented by two integers `l` and `r` where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n. The sum of `n` and `q` across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**
