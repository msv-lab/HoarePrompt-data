Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer between -1 and 10^4 - 3, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `a` is a list of length `n` starting with `[0]` followed by the sequence of indices where `x` was different from `p`, `q` is 0, `i` is `n`, `j` is 0, `l` is the first element from `R()`, `r` is the second element from `R()`, `p` is the last element of the iterable returned by `R()`.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`n`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`a`**: Initially starts with `[0]`. For each iteration, if `x` is different from `p`, `j` is set to `i` and appended to `a`. If `x` is the same as `p`, `j` remains `0` and `0` is appended to `a`. After `n` iterations, `a` will have a length of `n`.
- **`q`**: Remains `0` as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`i`**: Increments by 1 in each iteration, so after `n` iterations, `i` will be `n`.
- **`j`**: After `n` iterations, `j` will be `0` because the last value of `j` is determined by the last comparison of `x` and `p`.
- **`l`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`r`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`p`**: After `n` iterations, `p` will be the last element of the iterable returned by `R()`.
