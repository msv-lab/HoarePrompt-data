The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` was 2, so the new value of `i` is 3. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `a` is [0, 0, 0, j], `q` is an integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 2·10^5, each query is represented by two integers `l` and `r` where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n, the sum of `n` and `q` across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5, `p` is the next element from `R()` after the second one, `i` is 3, `j` is 2 if `x` is not equal to `p`, otherwise `j` is 0, `R()` returns an iterable with at least two elements, `x` is the next element from `R()` after the third one.**
