Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer between -1 and 10^4 - 3, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `a` is a list containing `[0]`, `q` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `l` is the first element from `R()`, `r` is the second element from `R()`, `p` is 0**. 

Explanation: The variables `i`, `j`, and `p` are all set to 0. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `q`, `l`, and `r`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
