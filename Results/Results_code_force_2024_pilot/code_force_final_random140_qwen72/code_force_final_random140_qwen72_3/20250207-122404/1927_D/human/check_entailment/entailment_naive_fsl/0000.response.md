Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to correctly identify pairs of indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(a_i \ne a_j\) within the specified range for certain inputs.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
1
5
1 1 2 1 1
3
1 5
1 2
1 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2 3
-1 -1
1 3
```

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
2 5
-1 -1
1 3
```

For the query `(1, 5)`, the program outputs `2 5`, but the correct output should be `2 3` because `a[2] = 1` and `a[3] = 2` are different and both indices are within the range `[1, 5]`.

This shows that the program does not always find the correct pair of indices for the given range, leading to incorrect results for some queries. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
