Reasoning:  
The program aims to solve the problem of finding a pair of indices \(i\) and \(j\) within a specified range \([l, r]\) such that \(a_i \ne a_j\). The approach taken by the program is to preprocess the array to store the last index where a change occurred in the array. This is done by iterating through the array and updating the list `a` with the current index whenever a new value is encountered that is different from the previous value (`p`).

However, there are a few issues with the implementation:

1. **Incorrect Array Initialization**: The array `a` is initialized with `[0]`, and then the indices are appended to this list. This means that the actual indices stored in `a` are offset by 1 compared to the original array indices. For example, if the original array is `[1, 1, 2, 1, 1]`, the processed `a` will be `[0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3]`. This can lead to incorrect results when checking the condition `a[r] < l`.

2. **Incorrect Query Handling**: The query handling logic is flawed. The program checks if `a[r] < l` to determine if a valid pair exists. However, this check is not sufficient because it only considers the last index where a change occurred, not whether there are any distinct elements within the range \([l, r]\).

3. **Output Format**: The output format is incorrect. The program prints the indices directly without ensuring that they are within the range \([l, r]\). Additionally, the use of `*` in `print(*((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l])` is not clear and can lead to incorrect outputs.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
