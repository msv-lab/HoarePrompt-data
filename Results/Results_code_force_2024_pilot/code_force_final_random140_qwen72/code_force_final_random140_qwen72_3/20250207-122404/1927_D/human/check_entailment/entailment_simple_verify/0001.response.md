### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The function `R` is defined to read a line of input and split it into integers.
   - The variable `t` is set to the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, the length of the array `n` is read but not used directly.
   - The array `a` is initialized with a dummy value `0` to handle 1-based indexing.

2. **Array Construction**:
   - The loop iterates over the elements of the array `a` as read from input.
   - The variable `j` is updated to the current index `i` if the current element `x` is different from the previous element `p`.
   - The array `a` is extended with the value of `j` at each step.
   - The variable `p` is updated to the current element `x`.
   - The index `i` is incremented.

3. **Query Processing**:
   - The number of queries `q` is read.
   - For each query, the range `[l, r]` is read.
   - The function checks if `a[r]` (which stores the last index where a different element was found) is less than `l`.
   - If `a[r] < l`, it means there are no different elements in the range `[l, r]`, so it prints `-1 -1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints the pair `(a[r], r)`.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness**:
  - The logic correctly identifies the last index `j` where a different element was found up to the current index `i`.
  - For each query, it checks if this last index `a[r]` is within the range `[l, r]`.
  - If `a[r]` is within the range, it prints the pair `(a[r], r)`, which ensures that `a[a[r]] != a[r]`.
  - If `a[r]` is not within the range, it prints `-1 -1`, indicating no different elements exist in the range.

### Issues:
- **Edge Case Handling**:
  - The program assumes that the array `a` will always have at least one different element. However, if the entire array consists of the same element, the program might not handle this correctly.
  - Specifically, if the array is `[1, 1, 1, 1]` and the query is `[1, 4]`, the program will incorrectly print `(1, 4)` instead of `(-1, -1)` because `a[r]` will be `1`, which is within the range but does not satisfy the condition `a_i != a_j`.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle the edge case where the entire subarray within the query range consists of the same element. Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
