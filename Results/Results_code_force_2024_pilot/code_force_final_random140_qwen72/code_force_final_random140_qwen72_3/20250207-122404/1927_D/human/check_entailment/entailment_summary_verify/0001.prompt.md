You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of n integers, and q queries.

Each query is represented by two integers l and r (1 \le l \le r \le n ). Your
task is to find, for each query, two indices i and j (or determine that they
do not exist) such that:

  * l \le i \le r ; 
  * l \le j \le r ; 
  * a_i \ne a_j . 

In other words, for each query, you need to find a pair of different elements
among a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r , or report that such a pair does not exist.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of the array a .

The third line of each test case contains a single integer q (1 \le q \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of queries.

The next q lines contain two integers each, l and r (1 \le l < r \le n ) — the
boundaries of the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of the
values of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each query, output two integers separated by space: i and j (l \le i, j
\le r ), for which a_i \ne a_j . If such a pair does not exist, output i=-1
and j=-1 .

You may separate the outputs for the test cases with empty lines. This is not
a mandatory requirement.

- Program:

    R = lambda : map(int, input().split())
    (t,) = R()
    while t:
        t -= 1
        R()
        a = [0]
        p = i = j = 0
        for x in R():
            j = (j, i)[x != p]
            a += (j,)

        (q,) = R()

            q -= 1
            (l, r) = R()
            print(*((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l])



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each involving an array and a set of queries. For each test case, it reads the array and constructs a new list `a` that tracks the positions where the elements change. For each query, it prints the result based on the constructed list `a` and the query parameters. After processing all test cases, the function ensures that all input has been read and processed, and the state variables related to the current test case are reset or exhausted.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The function `R` is defined to read a line of input and split it into integers.
   - The variable `t` is set to the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, the length of the array `n` is read but not used directly.
   - The array `a` is initialized with a dummy value `0` to handle 1-based indexing.

2. **Array Construction**:
   - The loop iterates over the elements of the array `a` as read from input.
   - The variable `j` is updated to the current index `i` if the current element `x` is different from the previous element `p`.
   - The array `a` is extended with the value of `j` at each step.
   - The variable `p` is updated to the current element `x`.
   - The index `i` is incremented.

3. **Query Processing**:
   - The number of queries `q` is read.
   - For each query, the range `[l, r]` is read.
   - The function checks if `a[r]` (which stores the last index where a different element was found) is less than `l`.
   - If `a[r] < l`, it means there are no different elements in the range `[l, r]`, so it prints `-1 -1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints the pair `(a[r], r)`.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness**:
  - The logic correctly identifies the last index `j` where a different element was found up to the current index `i`.
  - For each query, it checks if this last index `a[r]` is within the range `[l, r]`.
  - If `a[r]` is within the range, it prints the pair `(a[r], r)`, which ensures that `a[a[r]] != a[r]`.
  - If `a[r]` is not within the range, it prints `-1 -1`, indicating no different elements exist in the range.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It handles the input and output format correctly and implements the logic to find pairs of different elements within the specified ranges.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
