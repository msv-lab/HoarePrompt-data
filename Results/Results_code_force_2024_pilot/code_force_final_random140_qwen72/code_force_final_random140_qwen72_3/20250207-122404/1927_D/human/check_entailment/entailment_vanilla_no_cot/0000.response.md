Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution has a few issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**: The function `func` reads the number of test cases `t` but then immediately starts processing without reading the size of the array `n` and the array itself. This is incorrect because it skips the necessary input steps.

2. **Array Construction**: The array `a` is constructed in a way that does not correctly handle the problem requirements. Specifically, the logic used to update `j` and append to `a` does not ensure that `a` contains the correct indices for the elements.

3. **Query Processing**: The query processing part of the code is also flawed. It uses `a[r]` to determine the indices, but this does not correctly reflect the indices of different elements within the range `[l, r]`.

4. **Edge Cases**: The solution does not handle edge cases properly, such as when all elements in the range `[l, r]` are the same.

To fix these issues, the solution should properly read the input, construct the array, and process the queries to find the required indices or determine that no such pair exists. Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    def find_pair(a, l, r):
        seen = set()
        for i in range(l, r + 1):
            if a[i] not in seen:
                seen.add(a[i])
            else:
                return i, next(j for j in range(l, r + 1) if a[j] != a[i])
        return -1, -1

    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        q = int(input())
        for _ in range(q):
            l, r = map(int, input().split())
            i, j = find_pair(a, l - 1, r - 1)
            print(i + 1, j + 1)

# Example usage
func()
```

This corrected version reads the input correctly, processes each query to find the required indices, and handles edge cases where no such pair exists.
