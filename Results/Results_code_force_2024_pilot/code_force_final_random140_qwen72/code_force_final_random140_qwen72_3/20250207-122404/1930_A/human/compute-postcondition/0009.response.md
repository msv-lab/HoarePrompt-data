Initial State: 
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 4999.
- `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50.
- `A` is a list of integers read from input.

Code Snippet:
```python
print(sum(A[::2]))
```

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. **Understanding `A[::2]`**:
   - The expression `A[::2]` creates a new list that contains every second element from the original list `A`, starting from the first element (index 0).
   - For example, if `A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, then `A[::2]` would be `[1, 3, 5]`.

2. **Summing the Elements**:
   - The `sum` function calculates the sum of all elements in the list `A[::2]`.
   - Continuing the example, if `A[::2]` is `[1, 3, 5]`, then `sum(A[::2])` would be `1 + 3 + 5 = 9`.

3. **Printing the Result**:
   - The `print` statement outputs the sum of the elements in `A[::2]`.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the output will be the sum of the elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) in the list `A`.

Output: **sum of elements at even indices in the list A** (where the elements at even indices are the elements at positions 0, 2, 4, etc., in the list A)
