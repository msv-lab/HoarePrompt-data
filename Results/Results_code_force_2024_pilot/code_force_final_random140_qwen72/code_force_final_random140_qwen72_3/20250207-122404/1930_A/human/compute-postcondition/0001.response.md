The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is non-zero, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000. Since `t` is already guaranteed to be within this range, it ensures that `t` is non-zero and thus the loop will execute at least once.

State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and a list of 2n integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n}` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7**
