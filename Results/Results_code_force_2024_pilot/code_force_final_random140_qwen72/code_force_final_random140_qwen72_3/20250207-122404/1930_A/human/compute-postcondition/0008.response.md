The code snippet `A = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into parts based on whitespace, converts each part to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `A`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 4999
- `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50
- `A` is a list of 2n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7

After executing the code snippet, the list `A` is updated to contain the integers from the input. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 4999, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `A` is a list of integers read from input.**
