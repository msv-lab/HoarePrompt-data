Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000.
- `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50.
- `A` is a list of 2n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(sum(A[::2]))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **List `A`**: 
   - `A` is a list of 2n integers. This means `A` has an even number of elements, specifically 2n elements.
   - Each element in `A` is an integer between 1 and 10^7.

2. **Slicing `A[::2]`**:
   - The slicing operation `A[::2]` selects every second element from the list `A`, starting from the first element (index 0).
   - For example, if `A = [a1, a2, a3, a4, ..., a(2n-1), a(2n)]`, then `A[::2]` will be `[a1, a3, a5, ..., a(2n-1)]`.

3. **Summing the Sliced List**:
   - The `sum(A[::2])` function calculates the sum of the elements selected by the slicing operation.
   - This means it will sum up all the elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ..., 2n-2).

### Final Output:
The `print(sum(A[::2]))` statement will print the sum of the elements at even indices in the list `A`.

Output: **sum of the elements at even indices in the list A (where A is a list of 2n integers, and each element is an integer between 1 and 10^7)**
