The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is non-zero, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 4998. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be a non-zero value.

State: **`t` is a non-zero integer where 0 < t ≤ 4998, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `A` is a list of integers read from input.**
