Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `A` is a list of 2n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.**

### Explanation:
- **`t` is 0**: After all iterations of the loop have completed, the variable `t` will be decremented to 0 because the loop runs until `t` becomes 0.
- **`n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50**: The value of `n` is determined by the input for each test case, and it remains within the specified range for each iteration.
- **`A` is a list of 2n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7**: The list `A` is populated with 2n integers for each test case, and these integers are within the specified range.

This output state reflects the final condition of the variables after the loop has executed all its iterations.
