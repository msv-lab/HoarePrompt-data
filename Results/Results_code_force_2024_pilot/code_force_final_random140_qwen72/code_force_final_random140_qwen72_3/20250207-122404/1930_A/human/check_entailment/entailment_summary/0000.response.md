Reasoning:  
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem as described. The goal is to maximize the score by repeatedly selecting two numbers and adding the minimum of the two to the score. However, the solution simply sums the elements at even indices of the list, which does not necessarily yield the maximum possible score.

To illustrate why this is incorrect, consider the example test case:
- Input: `2 1 1 2 1`
- Expected Output: `2`
- Actual Output: `1 + 1 = 2`

While the actual output matches the expected output in this specific case, it is by coincidence. The correct approach would involve sorting the list and then summing the first `n` elements (since the smallest `n` elements will always be the ones chosen as the minimum in each pair).

For instance, in the test case `2 1 1 2 1`, the sorted list is `[1, 1, 1, 2]`. The first `n` elements (where `n = 2`) are `[1, 1]`, and their sum is `2`, which is the correct maximum score.

Therefore, the provided solution is not correct for the general case.

Correctness: **False**
