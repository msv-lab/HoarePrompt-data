You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        n = int(input())
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        print(sum(A[::2]))
        t = t - 1



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and a list of 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7, representing the numbers written on the whiteboard.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        n = int(input())
        
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        print(sum(A[::2]))
        
        t = t - 1
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `A` is a list of 2n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of 2n integers. It then prints the sum of the elements at even indices (0-based) of the list for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function terminates with `t` set to 0.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  

To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's break down the problem and the solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Objective**: Maximize the score by selecting pairs of integers from the whiteboard and adding the minimum of each pair to the score.
2. **Constraints**:
   - There are `2n` integers on the whiteboard.
   - Each test case has `n` pairs of integers.
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the minimum values of these pairs.

### Solution Analysis:
The provided program reads the input, processes each test case, and prints the result. Let's examine the logic:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n` and the list of `2n` integers `A`.

2. **Processing the List**:
   - The program prints the sum of every other element starting from the first element (`A[::2]`).

### Correctness Check:
- **Optimal Strategy**:
  - To maximize the score, we should always pair the smallest available integers together. This ensures that the minimum value in each pair is as large as possible.
  - Sorting the list and then pairing the elements in order (i.e., the first with the second, the third with the fourth, etc.) would achieve this optimal strategy.

- **Program Logic**:
  - The program does not sort the list before summing every other element.
  - By summing every other element without sorting, the program does not guarantee that the pairs are formed optimally.

### Example Verification:
Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **Test Case 1**:
   - Input: `2 3`
   - Expected Output: `2`
   - Program Output: `2` (Correct, but coincidental because the list is already sorted)

2. **Test Case 2**:
   - Input: `1 1 2 1`
   - Expected Output: `2`
   - Program Output: `2` (Correct, but coincidental because the list is already sorted)

3. **Test Case 3**:
   - Input: `1 1 1 1 1 1`
   - Expected Output: `3`
   - Program Output: `3` (Correct, but coincidental because the list is already sorted)

However, consider a different example where the list is not sorted:
- **Test Case**:
  - Input: `3 1 4 2 5 6 3`
  - Expected Output: `9` (Pairs: (1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6))
  - Program Output: `8` (Sum of 3, 2, 3)

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle unsorted lists and thus does not always produce the maximum possible score. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
