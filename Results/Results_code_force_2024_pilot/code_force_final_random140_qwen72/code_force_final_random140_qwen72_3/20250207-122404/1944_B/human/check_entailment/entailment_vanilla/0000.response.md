### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the array `a`.

2. **Array Splitting**: The array `a` is split into two halves, `b` and `c`, where `b` contains the first half of `a` and `c` contains the second half. This is done using slicing: `b = a[:n]` and `c = a[n:]`.

3. **Sorting**: Both `b` and `c` are sorted. Sorting helps in easily finding pairs of identical elements, which is crucial for forming the subsets `l` and `r`.

4. **Forming Subsets**:
   - The function initializes `ans1` and `ans2` as empty lists to store the subsets.
   - It uses a variable `k` to keep track of the number of elements needed for each subset. Initially, `k` is set to `2 * k` because each subset should have `2k` elements.
   - The function iterates through the sorted array `b` to find pairs of identical elements. When a pair is found, both elements are added to `ans1`, and `k` is decremented by 2.
   - If a pair is not found, the element is added to a temporary list `l` for later use.
   - The same process is repeated for the sorted array `c` to form `ans2`.

5. **Handling Remaining Elements**:
   - After processing `b` and `c`, if there are still elements needed to complete the subsets, the function uses the elements stored in `l` to fill the remaining spots in `ans1` and `ans2`.

6. **Output**: The function prints the elements of `ans1` and `ans2` for each test case.

### Potential Issues:
- **Edge Cases**: The function assumes that the input is always valid and that the required pairs will always be found. However, it does not handle edge cases where the input might be invalid or the required pairs might not be found.
- **Efficiency**: The function sorts the arrays `b` and `c`, which has a time complexity of \(O(n \log n)\). This is efficient enough given the constraints, but it could be optimized further if needed.
- **Redundant Checks**: The function checks if an element is already in `ans1` before adding it to `l`. This check is redundant because the elements are added to `l` only if they are not part of a pair in `b`.

### Conclusion:
Despite the potential issues mentioned, the function appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It handles the input and output as required and forms the subsets `l` and `r` with the correct properties.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
