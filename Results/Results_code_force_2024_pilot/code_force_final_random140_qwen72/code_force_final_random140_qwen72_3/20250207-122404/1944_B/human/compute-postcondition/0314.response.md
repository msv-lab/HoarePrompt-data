To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the state of the object `rdb` since it is the only object in the loop head (`for elem in rdb:`).

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `n` is an input integer greater than 1
- `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of their preceding element
- `sz` is 0
- `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `_` remain unchanged
- `ldb` must be a non-empty list
- `sng` has been fully iterated over, meaning it has no more elements left to process

For the loop to execute, `rdb` must contain at least one element. The other variables and lists mentioned in the state do not affect the loop's ability to execute directly.

State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `rdb` must contain at least one element, `sz` is 0, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `_` remain unchanged, `ldb` must be a non-empty list, and `sng` has been fully iterated over, meaning it has no more elements left to process**
