The code snippet `ans2.append(l[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `l` to the list `ans2`.

- Initial State: `i` is 1, `l` is a non-empty list containing elements from `b` that are not in `ans1` and were encountered before the loop terminated. `ans1` now contains the first element of `l` and the second element of `l`. `ans2` now contains the first element of `l`. If `k` == 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

- Impact of the Code: The element at index `i` (which is 1) of the list `l` is appended to `ans2`.

- Calculation of Result: Since `i` is 1, `l[1]` is appended to `ans2`. Initially, `ans2` contains the first element of `l`, so after appending `l[1]`, `ans2` will contain both the first and second elements of `l`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `l` is a non-empty list containing elements from `b` that are not in `ans1` and were encountered before the loop terminated. `ans1` now contains the first element of `l` and the second element of `l`. `ans2` now contains the first element of `l` and the second element of `l`. If `k` == 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
