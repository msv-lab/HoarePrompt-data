The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings using spaces as delimiters, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000
- `n` and `k` are integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50000 and 1 ≤ k ≤ floor(n/2)
- `a` is a list of 2n integers where 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ n, and each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice in `a`
- `q` is 0
- `n` and `k` are updated to the values provided by the user input

After executing the code snippet, the list `a` is updated to contain the integers read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `n` and `k` are integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50000 and 1 ≤ k ≤ floor(n/2), `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `q` is 0, `n` and `k` are updated to the values provided by the user input.**
