Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `n-1`, `ans1` contains repeated elements from `b` where consecutive duplicates were found, `k` is `req`, `l` contains elements from `b` that are not in `ans1` and are not consecutive duplicates, the loop has completed all iterations, and if `b[n-1]` is not in `ans1`, `l` now includes `b[n-1]`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if k == 0:
        break
    if c[i] == c[i - 1]:
        ans2.append(c[i])
        ans2.append(c[i])
        k -= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. If `c[1]` is equal to `c[0]`, `ans2` contains the value of `c[1]` and `c[1]`. If `k` is -2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2. If `c[1]` is equal to `c[0]`, `ans2` initially contains the value of `c[1]` and `c[1]`. If `c[2]` is equal to `c[1]`, `ans2` now includes the value of `c[2]`, and `k` is decreased by 2. If `k` is 0, the program continues normally. If `k` is -2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `c[2]` is not equal to `c[1]`, `ans2` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3. If `c[3] == c[2]`, `ans2` is updated by appending the element at index 3 of `c`, and `k` is decreased by 2. If `k` becomes 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans2` and `k` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
