Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of their preceding element, `sz` is either 2 or 4 depending on whether `2 * k - sz` was initially greater than or equal to 2, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `sng`, `_` remain unchanged, `ldb` must be a non-empty list with at least 3 elements, `elem` is the third element in `ldb`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
