To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `elem` and `sng`.

### Analysis:
- **`elem`**: This variable holds the current element being iterated over from `sng`.
- **`sng`**: This is an iterable that must have at least one more element to iterate over for the loop to continue.

### Given State:
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `n` is an input integer greater than 1
- `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of their preceding element
- `sz` is the total number of elements printed (in pairs) before the condition `2 * k - sz < 2` becomes true, plus 2. If `sz` is at least `2 * k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `sz` remains less than `2 * k`.
- `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `_` remain unchanged
- `ldb` must be a non-empty list
- `sng` must be a non-empty iterable with at least one more element to iterate over
- `elem` is the next element in `sng`

### Adjustments Needed:
- For the loop to execute one more time, `sng` must still be a non-empty iterable with at least one more element to iterate over.
- The value of `elem` will change to the next element in `sng`.

### Updated State:
- `i` remains `n - 1`
- `n` remains an input integer greater than 1
- `rdb` remains unchanged
- `sz` remains the same (it does not change based on the loop head)
- `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `_` remain unchanged
- `ldb` remains a non-empty list
- `sng` must be a non-empty iterable with at least one more element to iterate over
- `elem` is the next element in `sng`

### Final State:
State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of their preceding element, `sz` is the total number of elements printed (in pairs) before the condition `2 * k - sz < 2` becomes true, plus 2. If `sz` is at least `2 * k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `sz` remains less than `2 * k`. `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `_` remain unchanged, `ldb` must be a non-empty list, and `sng` must be a non-empty iterable with at least one more element to iterate over, `elem` is the next element in `sng`.**
