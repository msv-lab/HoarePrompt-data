The code snippet `ans2.append(c[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `c` to the list `ans2`. Given the initial state:

- `i` is 3
- `n` is greater than 3
- The values of `k` and `ans2` remain unchanged unless `c[i] == c[i - 1]`. If `c[i] == c[i - 1]`, then `k` is reduced by 2, and `ans2` now includes the elements `c[3]` and `c[3]`. If `k` becomes 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

After executing the code snippet:

- `ans2` now includes the element `c[3]`.
- The values of `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged unless the condition `c[i] == c[i - 1]` is met, which is not specified in the code snippet provided.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, `ans2` now includes the element `c[3]`, and the values of `k` and `ans2` remain unchanged unless `c[i] == c[i - 1]`. If `c[i] == c[i - 1]`, then `k` is reduced by 2, and `ans2` now includes the elements `c[3]` and `c[3]`. If `k` becomes 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
