The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1 because the loop starts at 1 and goes up to `n-1`. The initial state indicates that `i` is `n-1`, but for the loop to start, `i` should be 1.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
