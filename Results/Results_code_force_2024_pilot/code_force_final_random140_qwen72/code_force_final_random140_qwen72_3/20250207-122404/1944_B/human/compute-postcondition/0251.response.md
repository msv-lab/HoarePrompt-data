The code snippet `ans2.append(c[i])` appends the value of `c[i]` to the list `ans2`. Given the initial state, `i` is 3, so the value `c[3]` is appended to `ans2`.

- `i` remains 3.
- `n` remains greater than 3.
- `k` remains -4.
- `ans2` now includes an additional element, which is `c[3]`.
- The condition about `c[2]` being equal to `c[1]` does not affect the current operation.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, `k` is -4, `ans2` includes an additional element `c[3]`, and `ans2` may still include an additional element if `c[2]` is equal to `c[1]`.**
