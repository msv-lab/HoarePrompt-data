The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 2. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, `k` is -2, and `ans1` now contains the value of `b[i]` twice. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, `k` is 0. If `b[i - 1]` is not in the list `ans1`, `l` now contains `b[0]`. Otherwise, there is no change to `l`.**
