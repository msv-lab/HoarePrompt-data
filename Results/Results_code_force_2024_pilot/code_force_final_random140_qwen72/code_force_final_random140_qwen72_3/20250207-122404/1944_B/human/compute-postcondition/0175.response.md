The code snippet `ans2.append(l[i])` appends the element at index `i` of list `l` to the list `ans2`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 1
- `len(l)` is greater than 1
- `ans1` contains the first element of `l` and the second element of `l`
- `ans2` contains the first element of `l`
- If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement

After executing the code snippet:
- `ans2` now contains the first element of `l` and the second element of `l` (since `i` is 1, `l[i]` is the second element of `l`)

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`i` is 1, `len(l)` is greater than 1, `ans1` contains the first element of `l` and the second element of `l`, `ans2` contains the first element of `l` and the second element of `l`, if `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
