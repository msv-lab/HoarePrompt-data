Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of their preceding element, `sz` is 2, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `sng`, `_` remain unchanged, `ldb` must be a non-empty list, `elem` is the first element in `ldb`, and the value of `2 * k - sz` is at least 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `sz` is incremented by 2, changing its value from 0 to 2.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged as specified in the initial state.
