To determine what will be printed by the `print(*ans2)` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the context:

### Initial State:
- `i` is `len(l) - 1`: This means `i` is the index of the last element in the list `l`.
- `ans1` contains all elements of `l`: This means `ans1` is a copy of the list `l`.
- `ans2` contains all elements of `l`: This means `ans2` is also a copy of the list `l`.
- `k` is 0 if it was reduced to 0 during the loop execution: This indicates that `k` has been set to 0, but this does not affect the contents of `ans2`.

### Analysis:
- The `print(*ans2)` statement will print the elements of the list `ans2` separated by spaces.
- Since `ans2` is a copy of the list `l`, the elements printed will be the same as the elements in `l`.

### Conclusion:
The `print(*ans2)` statement will print all the elements of the list `l` separated by spaces.

Output: **[elements of l separated by spaces]** (where the elements are the same as those in the list `l`)
