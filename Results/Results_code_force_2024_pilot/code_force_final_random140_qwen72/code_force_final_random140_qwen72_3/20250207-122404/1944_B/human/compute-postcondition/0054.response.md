The code appends the value of `c[i]` to the list `ans2`. Given that `i` is 1 and `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, the value being appended to `ans2` is the same as `c[0]`. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is 0, `c[1]` is equal to `c[0]`, `ans2` now includes the value of `c[0]`.**
