Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `n - 1`, where `n` is an input integer greater than 1.
- `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of their preceding element.
- `sz` is the total number of elements printed (in pairs) before the condition `2 * k - sz < 2` becomes true, plus 1. If `sz` is at least `2 * k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `sz` remains less than `2 * k`.
- `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `_` remain unchanged.
- `ldb` must be a non-empty list.
- `sng` must be a non-empty iterable with at least one more element to iterate over.
- `elem` is the next element in `sng`.

Given this context, the `print` statement will print the next element in the iterable `sng` followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

Output: **[elem] (where elem is the next element in the iterable sng)**
