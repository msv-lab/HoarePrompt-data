Output State: **`i` is 1, `l` is a non-empty list containing elements from `b` that are not in `ans1` and were encountered before the loop terminated. `ans1` now contains the first element of `l`. `ans2` now contains the first element of `l`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
