To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the state of the object `sng` in the loop head, as this is the only object that directly affects whether the loop will run.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `n` is an input integer greater than 1
- `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of their preceding element
- `sz` is the total number of elements printed (in pairs) before the condition `2 * k - sz < 2` becomes true
- `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `sng`, `_` remain unchanged
- `ldb` must be a non-empty list
- The loop stops when `2 * k - sz < 2` or when there are no more elements in `ldb` to process

For the loop to execute, `sng` must be a non-empty iterable. This is because the loop iterates over each element in `sng`, and if `sng` is empty, the loop will not execute even once.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `sng` to ensure it is non-empty.

State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of their preceding element, `sz` is the total number of elements printed (in pairs) before the condition `2 * k - sz < 2` becomes true, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `_` remain unchanged, `ldb` must be a non-empty list, `sng` must be a non-empty iterable**
