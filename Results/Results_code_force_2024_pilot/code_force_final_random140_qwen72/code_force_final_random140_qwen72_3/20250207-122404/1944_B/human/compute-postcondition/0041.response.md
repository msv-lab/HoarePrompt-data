Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50000, `k` is an integer where 0 ≤ k ≤ 2 * floor(n/2), `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `q` is 0, `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a` in ascending order, `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` starting from index `n` to the end, `ans1` is either an empty list or a list containing the second smallest element of `b` twice, followed by the third smallest element of `b` if `b[i] == b[i - 1]`, otherwise `ans1` remains as it was (either empty or containing the second smallest element of `b` twice), `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is equal to `k`, `l` is either an empty list or contains the element `b[0]` and the second smallest element of `b` if `b[i - 1]` is not in `ans1`, otherwise `l` remains as it was (either empty or containing the element `b[0]`), `i` is 3, and `l` now contains the element `b[2]`. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
