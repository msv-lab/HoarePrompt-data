Output State: **The loop has executed `T` times, where `T` is the number of test cases. For each test case, the lists `lft` and `rgt` have been sorted, and the elements from these lists have been processed according to the conditions specified in the loop. The variable `sz` has reached or exceeded `2 * k` for each test case, and all elements from the `sng` list have been printed or the condition `sz >= 2 * k` has been met. The lists `ldb` and `rdb` contain the repeated elements from `lft` and `rgt` respectively, and `sng` contains the unique elements from `lft` that were not part of any pair. The final output for each test case includes the elements printed from `ldb`, `sng`, and `rdb` up to the limit of `2 * k`.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop, the following conditions hold true:
- The loop has processed all `T` test cases.
- For each test case, the lists `lft` and `rgt` have been sorted, and the elements have been processed to form the lists `ldb`, `rdb`, and `sng`.
- The variable `sz` has been incremented to ensure that the total number of elements printed does not exceed `2 * k`.
- The final output for each test case includes the elements from `ldb`, `sng`, and `rdb` up to the limit of `2 * k`.
- The lists `ldb` and `rdb` contain the repeated elements from `lft` and `rgt`, respectively.
- The list `sng` contains the unique elements from `lft` that were not part of any pair, and it has been fully iterated over for each test case.
