Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, `k` is -2, and `ans1` now contains the value of `b[i]` twice. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, `k` is 0. If `b[i - 1]` is not in the list `ans1`, `l` now contains `b[0]`. Otherwise, there is no change to `l`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
