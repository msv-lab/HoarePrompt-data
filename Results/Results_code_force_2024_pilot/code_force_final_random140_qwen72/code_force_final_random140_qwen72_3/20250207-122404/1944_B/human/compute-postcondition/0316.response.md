To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `i` is `n - 1`, where `n` is an input integer greater than 1.
- `rdb` must contain at least one element.
- `sz` is 0.
- `k` is a variable whose value is not explicitly given but is known to be at least 1 (since `2 * k - sz >= 2` and `sz` is 0).
- `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `_` remain unchanged.
- `ldb` must be a non-empty list.
- `sng` has been fully iterated over, meaning it has no more elements left to process.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(elem, elem, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement prints two values of `elem` followed by a space (`end=' '`).
- The variable `elem` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we need to infer its value from the context.

Given the initial state:
- `elem` is not directly mentioned, but since `sng` has been fully iterated over, it suggests that `elem` might be the last element processed from `sng`.

However, without knowing the specific value of `elem` from the iteration of `sng`, we cannot determine its exact value. Therefore, we can only describe it in general terms.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will print the value of `elem` twice, followed by a space. Since the exact value of `elem` is not provided, we describe it as the last element processed from `sng`.

Output: **elem elem (where elem is the last element processed from sng)**
