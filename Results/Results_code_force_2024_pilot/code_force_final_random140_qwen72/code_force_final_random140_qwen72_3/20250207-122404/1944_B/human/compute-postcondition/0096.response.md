Output State: **`i` is `len(l)-1`, `ans1` contains all elements of `l`, `ans2` contains all elements of `l`, `k` is the second integer from the input, `q` is `q + 1`, `t` must be greater than `q + 1`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `b` contains the first `n` elements of `a`.** 

Explanation: The code `b = a[:n]` creates a new list `b` that contains the first `n` elements from the list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
