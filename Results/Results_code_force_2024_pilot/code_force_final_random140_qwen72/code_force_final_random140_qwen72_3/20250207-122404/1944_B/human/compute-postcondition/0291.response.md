The value of `sz` is incremented by 2. Since `sz` was initially either 2 or 4, it will now be either 4 or 6, respectively. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of their preceding element, `sz` is either 4 or 6 depending on whether `2 * k - sz` was initially greater than or equal to 2, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `sng`, `_` remain unchanged, `ldb` must be a non-empty list with at least 3 elements, `elem` is the third element in `ldb`.**
