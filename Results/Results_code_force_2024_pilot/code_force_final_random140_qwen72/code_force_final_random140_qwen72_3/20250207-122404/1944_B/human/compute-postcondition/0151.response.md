Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2. If `c[1]` is equal to `c[0]`, `ans2` contains the value of `c[1]` and `c[1]`. If `k` is -2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.** 

The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is currently in, but it does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged except for the control flow, which now indicates that the program has broken out of the loop or if statement.
