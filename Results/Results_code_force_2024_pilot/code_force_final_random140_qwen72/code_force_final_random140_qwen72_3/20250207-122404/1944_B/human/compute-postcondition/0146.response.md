The value of `c[i]` is appended to the list `ans2`. Since `i` is 1, the value `c[1]` (which is equal to `c[0]` according to the initial state) is added to `ans2`. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, if `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, `c[1]` is equal to `c[0]`, `ans2` contains the value of `c[1]`.**
