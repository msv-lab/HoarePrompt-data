To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1 because the range function `range(1, n)` will generate numbers from 1 up to but not including `n`. If `n` is 1 or less, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `n-1`
- `n` is an input integer

For the loop to execute:
- `i` should start at 1 (the beginning of the range specified in the loop).
- `n` must be greater than 1 to ensure there is at least one iteration.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
