Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, `k` and `ans2` remain unchanged unless `c[i] == c[i - 1]`. If `c[i] == c[i - 1]`, then `k` is reduced by 2, and `ans2` now includes the elements `c[3]` and `c[3]`. If `k` becomes 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. `ans2` now includes the element `c[3]`.**
