Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `ans1` contains repeated elements from `b` where consecutive duplicates were found, `k` is reduced by 2 for each pair of duplicates added to `ans1`, `l` contains elements from `b` that are not in `ans1` and are not consecutive duplicates, and the loop has completed all iterations.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `1` to `n-1`.
- For each iteration, if `b[i]` is equal to `b[i-1]`, `ans1` appends `b[i]` twice, and `k` is reduced by 2.
- If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i-1]` and `b[i-1]` is not in `ans1`, `l` appends `b[i-1]`.
- The loop completes when `i` reaches `n-1` or when `k` becomes 0.
- After the loop, `i` will be `n-1`, `ans1` will contain the repeated elements from `b` where consecutive duplicates were found, `k` will be reduced by 2 for each pair of duplicates added to `ans1`, and `l` will contain elements from `b` that are not in `ans1` and are not consecutive duplicates.
