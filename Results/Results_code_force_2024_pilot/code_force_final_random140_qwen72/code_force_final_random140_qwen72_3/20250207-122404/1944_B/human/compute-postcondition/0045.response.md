Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50000, `k` is an integer where 0 ≤ k ≤ 2 * floor(n/2), `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `q` is 0, `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a` in ascending order, `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` starting from index `n` to the end, `ans1` is a list containing pairs of consecutive duplicate elements from `b` up to the point where `k` becomes 0 or there are no more consecutive duplicates, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is equal to `k`, `l` is a list containing elements from `b` that are not in `ans1` and are not consecutive duplicates, `i` is the last index that was processed in the loop, which is less than `n` and greater than or equal to 1. Additionally, the last element of `b` (i.e., `b[n-1]`) is not in the list `ans1`.**
