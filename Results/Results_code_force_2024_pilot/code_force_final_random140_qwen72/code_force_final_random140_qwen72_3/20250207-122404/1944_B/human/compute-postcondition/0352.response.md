Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases, each defined by integers `n` and `k`, and a list `a` of 2n integers. For each test case, it splits the list `a` into two halves, sorts them, and then prints pairs of elements from the first half (`lft`) and the second half (`rgt`) up to a total of `2 * k` elements. If there are not enough pairs, it prints unique elements from the first half. The function does not return any value; instead, it prints the results directly to the console. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the program state reflects the completion of all test cases with the specified outputs printed. **
