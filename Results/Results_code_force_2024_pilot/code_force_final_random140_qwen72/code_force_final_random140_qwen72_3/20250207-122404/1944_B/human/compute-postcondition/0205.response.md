Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `k` is 0, `q` is `t`, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `b` is the first `n` elements of `a` sorted in ascending order, `c` is the elements of `a` starting from index `n` to the end and is now sorted in ascending order, `req` is 0, `l` is an empty list, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Additionally, `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, and `b[i - 1]` is not in `ans1`.**
