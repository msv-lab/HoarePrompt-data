Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `rdb` must contain at least one element, `sz` is the maximum even number such that `2 * k - sz >= 2` holds true, or `sz` is the last value before the condition fails, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `_` remain unchanged, `ldb` must be a non-empty list, and `sng` has been fully iterated over, meaning it has no more elements left to process.**

In natural language, this means:
- The variable `i` remains `n - 1`.
- The variable `n` is still an input integer greater than 1.
- The list `rdb` must contain at least one element.
- The variable `sz` will be the largest even number such that `2 * k - sz >= 2` is true. If this condition fails at any point, `sz` will be the last value it had before the condition failed.
- The variables `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, and `_` remain unchanged.
- The list `ldb` must still be a non-empty list.
- The iterable `sng` has been fully iterated over and has no more elements left to process.
