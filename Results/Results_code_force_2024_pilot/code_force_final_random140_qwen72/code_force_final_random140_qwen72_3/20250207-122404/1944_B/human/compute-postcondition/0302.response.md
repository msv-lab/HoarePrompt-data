Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of their preceding element, `sz` is the total number of elements printed (in pairs) before the condition `2 * k - sz < 2` becomes true, plus 1. If `sz` is at least `2 * k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `sz` remains less than `2 * k`. `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `_` remain unchanged, `ldb` must be a non-empty list, and `sng` must be a non-empty iterable with at least one more element to iterate over, `elem` is the next element in `sng`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
