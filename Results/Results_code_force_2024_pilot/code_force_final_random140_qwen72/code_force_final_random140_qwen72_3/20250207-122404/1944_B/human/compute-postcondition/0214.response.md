The value of `k` is decremented by 2. Initially, `k` is -2 if `b[i]` equals `b[i-1]`, otherwise `k` is 0. After the decrement, `k` will be -4 if `b[i]` equals `b[i-1]`, or -2 if `b[i]` does not equal `b[i-1]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `ans1` contains the values of `b[i]` and `b[i-1]` if they are equal, or contains only `b[i]` if they were not equal initially, and now also contains `b[2]`, `ans2` is an empty list, `k` is -4 if `b[i]` equals `b[i-1]` otherwise `k` is -2, `q` is `t`, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `b` is the first `n` elements of `a` sorted in ascending order, `c` is the elements of `a` starting from index `n` to the end and is now sorted in ascending order, `req` is 0, `l` is an empty list if `b[i]` equals `b[i-1]` or contains the element `b[0]` if `b[i]` does not equal `b[i-1]`.**
