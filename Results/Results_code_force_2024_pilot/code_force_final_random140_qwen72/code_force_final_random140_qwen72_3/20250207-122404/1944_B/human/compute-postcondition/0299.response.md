To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the context provided:

### Initial State:
- `i` is `n - 1`, where `n` is an input integer greater than 1.
- `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of their preceding element.
- `sz` is the total number of elements printed (in pairs) before the condition `2 * k - sz < 2` becomes true.
- If `sz` is at least `2 * k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `sz` remains less than `2 * k`.
- `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `_` remain unchanged.
- `ldb` must be a non-empty list.
- `sng` must be a non-empty iterable.

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is `print(elem, end=' ')`.
- The variable `elem` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it must be a part of the context where this `print` statement is executed.
- Since `elem` is being printed with `end=' '`, it suggests that `elem` is one of the elements being processed in a loop or a sequence of operations.

### Determining `elem`:
- Given that `sz` is the total number of elements printed in pairs, and the condition `2 * k - sz < 2` is checked, it implies that `elem` is likely an element from a list or iterable that is being processed in pairs.
- The condition `2 * k - sz < 2` suggests that the loop or sequence of operations will stop once `sz` reaches or exceeds `2 * k`.

### Conclusion:
- Without the exact value of `elem`, we can only describe it based on the context.
- `elem` is an element from a list or iterable that is being processed in pairs, and it is printed with a space as the end character.

### Final Output:
Output: **elem (where elem is an element from a list or iterable being processed in pairs, and it is printed with a space as the end character)**
