To determine what will be printed by the `print(elem, end=' ')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n - 1`, where `n` is an input integer greater than 1.
   - `rdb` must contain at least one element.
   - `sz` is the maximum even number such that `2 * k - (sz + 1) >= 2` holds true, or `sz` is the last value before the condition fails.
   - `sz` is then incremented by 1 (`sz = sz + 1`).
   - `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `_` remain unchanged.
   - `ldb` must be a non-empty list.
   - `sng` must have at least two elements left to process.
   - `elem` is the next element in `sng`.

2. **Conditions:**
   - If `sz` is greater than or equal to `2 * k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Given these conditions, the key variable to focus on is `elem`, which is the next element in the list `sng`.

Since `sng` must have at least two elements left to process, `elem` will be the next element in `sng` when the `print` statement is executed.

Therefore, the output will be the next element in the list `sng`, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

Output: **[elem] (where elem is the next element in the list sng)**
