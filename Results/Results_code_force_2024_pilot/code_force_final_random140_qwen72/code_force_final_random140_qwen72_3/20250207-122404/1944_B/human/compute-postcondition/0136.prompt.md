Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `len(l)-1`, `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `k` is `2 * (the second integer from the input)`, `q` is `q + 1`, `t` must be greater than `q + 1`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `b` contains the first `n` elements of `a` sorted in ascending order, `c` contains the elements of `a` starting from index `n` to the end, sorted in ascending order, `req` is `2 * (the second integer from the input)`, `l` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if k == 0:
        break
    if b[i] == b[i - 1]:
        ans1.append(b[i])
        ans1.append(b[i])
        k -= 2
    elif b[i - 1] not in ans1:
        l.append(b[i - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, `k` is -2, and `ans1` now contains the value of `b[i]` twice. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, `k` is 0. If `b[i - 1]` is not in the list `ans1`, `l` now contains `b[0]`. Otherwise, there is no change to `l`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, `k` is -2, and `ans1` now contains the value of `b[i]` appended to its previous content, while `l` remains unchanged. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, `k` is 0, and if `b[i - 1]` is not in the list `ans1`, `l` now contains `b[0]` and `b[i - 1]`. Otherwise, `l` now contains `b[i - 1]`. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3. If `b[3] == b[2]`, `k` is reduced by 2, and `ans1` now contains the element at index 3 of `b` appended to its previous content. If `b[3] != b[2]` and `b[2]` is not in `ans1`, `l` includes the element `b[2]`. If `k` is 0 at any point, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
