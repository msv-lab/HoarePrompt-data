Postcondition: ***`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of their preceding element, `sz` is either 2 or 0 depending on whether `2 * k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `sng`, `_` remain unchanged, `ldb` must be a non-empty list, `elem` is the first element in `ldb`. If `2 * k - sz` is at least 2, `sz` is set to 2. Otherwise, if `2 * k - sz` is less than 2, `sz` remains 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
