The code `ans1.append(b[i])` appends the value of `b[i]` to the list `ans1`. Given that `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, the value being appended to `ans1` is the same as `b[i - 1]`. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is 0, `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, `ans1` now contains the value of `b[i]` (which is also `b[i - 1]`).**
