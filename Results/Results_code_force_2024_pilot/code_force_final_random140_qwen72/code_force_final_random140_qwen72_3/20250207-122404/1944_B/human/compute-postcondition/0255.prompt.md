Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `n-1`, `n` is an input integer, `ans1` contains pairs of repeated elements from `b` if they are equal, up to the point where `k` reaches 0, `ans2` is an empty list, `k` is 0 if it was reduced to 0 during the loop execution, otherwise `k` is 2 times its original input value minus the total reduction due to the loop, `q` is `t`, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `b` is the first `n` elements of `a` sorted in ascending order, `c` is the elements of `a` starting from index `n` to the end and is now sorted in ascending order, `req` is 0 if `k` was reduced to 0 during the loop execution, otherwise `req` is 2 times the original input value of `k`, `l` contains elements from `b` that are not in `ans1` and were encountered before the loop terminated. If `b[n-1]` is not in `ans1`, then the last element of `b` (i.e., `b[n-1]`) is included in `l`, `k` is now equal to `req`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if k == 0:
        break
    if c[i] == c[i - 1]:
        ans2.append(c[i])
        ans2.append(c[i])
        k -= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. If `k` is -2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `c[1]` is equal to `c[0]`, `ans2` contains the value of `c[1]` (which is also `c[0]`), and `ans2` now includes an additional element which is `c[1]` (or equivalently `c[0]`).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, and `k` is -4. If `c[2]` is equal to `c[1]`, `ans2` now includes an additional element which is `c[2]`. If `k` is 0, `c[1]` is equal to `c[0]`, and `ans2` contains the value of `c[1]` (which is also `c[0]`). The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, `k` is -4 unless `c[3] == c[2]`, in which case `k` is -6. `ans2` may include an additional element if `c[2]` is equal to `c[1]`. If `c[3] == c[2]`, `ans2` includes `c[3]` appended twice. If `k` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
