The value of `k` is decremented by 2. The previous value of `k` was -4, so after the operation, `k` becomes -6. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, `k` is -6, `ans2` includes an additional element `c[3]` and now also includes `c[3]` appended again, and `ans2` may still include an additional element if `c[2]` is equal to `c[1]`.**
