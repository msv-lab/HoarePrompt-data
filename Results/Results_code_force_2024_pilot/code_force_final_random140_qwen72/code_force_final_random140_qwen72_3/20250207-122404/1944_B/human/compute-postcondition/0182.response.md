To determine what will be printed by the `print(*ans1)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the implications:

### Initial State:
- `i` is `len(l) - 1`: This means `i` is the last index of the list `l`.
- `ans1` contains all elements of `l`: This means `ans1` is a list that has the same elements as `l`.
- `ans2` contains all elements of `l`: This means `ans2` is another list that also has the same elements as `l`.
- `k` is 0 if it was reduced to 0 during the loop execution: This information is not directly relevant to the `print(*ans1)` statement, but it indicates that `k` might have been used in a loop to modify `ans1` or `ans2`.

### Analysis:
- Since `ans1` contains all elements of `l`, the `print(*ans1)` statement will print all elements of `ans1` separated by spaces. The `*` operator unpacks the list, so each element will be printed individually.

### Conclusion:
The `print(*ans1)` statement will print all elements of the list `l` separated by spaces.

Output: **all elements of l separated by spaces**
