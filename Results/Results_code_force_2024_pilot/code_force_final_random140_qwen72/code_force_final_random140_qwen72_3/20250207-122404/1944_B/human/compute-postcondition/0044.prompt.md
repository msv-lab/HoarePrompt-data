Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `n` and `k` are integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50000 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 2 * floor(n/2), `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `q` is 0, `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a` in ascending order, `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` starting from index `n` to the end, `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is equal to `k`, `l` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if k == 0:
        break
    if b[i] == b[i - 1]:
        ans1.append(b[i])
        ans1.append(b[i])
        k -= 2
    elif b[i - 1] not in ans1:
        l.append(b[i - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50000, `k` is an integer where 0 ≤ k ≤ 2 * floor(n/2), `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `q` is 0, `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a` in ascending order, `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` starting from index `n` to the end, `ans1` is either an empty list or a list containing the second smallest element of `b` twice, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is equal to `k`, `l` is either an empty list or contains the element `b[0]`, and `i` is 1. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `ans1` contains the second smallest element of `b` twice. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]` and `b[i - 1]` is not in `ans1`, then `l` contains the element `b[0]`. Otherwise, `l` remains an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50000, `k` is an integer where 0 ≤ k ≤ 2 * floor(n/2), `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `q` is 0, `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a` in ascending order, `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` starting from index `n` to the end, `ans1` is either an empty list or a list containing the second smallest element of `b` twice, followed by the third smallest element of `b` if `b[i] == b[i - 1]`, otherwise `ans1` remains as it was (either empty or containing the second smallest element of `b` twice), `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is equal to `k`, `l` is either an empty list or contains the element `b[0]` and the second smallest element of `b` if `b[i - 1]` is not in `ans1`, otherwise `l` remains as it was (either empty or containing the element `b[0]`), and `i` is 2. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50000, `k` is an integer where 0 ≤ k ≤ 2 * floor(n/2), `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `q` is 0, `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a` in ascending order, `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` starting from index `n` to the end, `ans1` is either an empty list or a list containing the second smallest element of `b` twice, followed by the third smallest element of `b` if `b[i] == b[i - 1]`, and possibly the 4th and 5th smallest elements of `b` if `b[i] == b[i - 1]`, otherwise `ans1` remains as it was (either empty or containing the second smallest element of `b` twice), `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is equal to `k`, `l` is either an empty list or contains the element `b[0]` and the second smallest element of `b` if `b[i - 1]` is not in `ans1`, otherwise `l` remains as it was (either empty or containing the element `b[0]`), `i` is 4 if `b[i] == b[i - 1]`, otherwise `i` is 3. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
