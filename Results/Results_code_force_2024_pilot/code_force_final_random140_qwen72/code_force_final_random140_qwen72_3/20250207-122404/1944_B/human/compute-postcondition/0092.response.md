Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `len(l)-1`, meaning `i` is the last index of the list `l`.
- `ans1` contains all elements of `l`.
- `ans2` contains all elements of `l`.
- `k` is 0 if it reached 0 during the loop execution.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `q`, `b`, `c`, `req`, and `l` remain unchanged.

Given the `print` statement:
```python
print(*ans2)
```

This statement will print all elements of the list `ans2`, separated by spaces. Since `ans2` contains all elements of `l`, the output will be the same as printing all elements of `l`.

Output: **all elements of l separated by spaces**.
