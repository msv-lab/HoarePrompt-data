Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50000, `k` is an integer where 0 ≤ k ≤ 2 * floor(n/2), `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `q` is 0, `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a` in ascending order, `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` starting from index `n` to the end, `ans1` is a list containing pairs of consecutive duplicate elements from `b` up to the point where `k` becomes 0 or there are no more consecutive duplicates, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is equal to `k`, `l` is a list containing elements from `b` that are not in `ans1` and are not consecutive duplicates, and `i` is the last index that was processed in the loop, which is less than `n` and greater than or equal to 1. If `b[n-1]` is not in `ans1`, then `b[n-1]` is appended to `l`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if k == 0:
        break
    if c[i] == c[i - 1]:
        ans2.append(c[i])
        ans2.append(c[i])
        k -= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. If `c[1]` is equal to `c[0]`, `k` is set to -2, and `ans2` now includes the value of `c[0]` and `c[1]`. If `c[1]` is not equal to `c[0]`, `k` remains 0 and `ans2` is unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, and the values of `k` and `ans2` remain unchanged unless `c[i] == c[i - 1]`. If `c[i] == c[i - 1]`, then `k` is reduced by 2, and `ans2` now includes the elements `c[2]` and `c[2]`. If `k` becomes 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, and the values of `k` and `ans2` remain unchanged unless `c[i] == c[i - 1]`. If `c[i] == c[i - 1]`, then `k` is reduced by 2, and `ans2` now includes the elements `c[3]` and `c[3]`. If `k` becomes 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
