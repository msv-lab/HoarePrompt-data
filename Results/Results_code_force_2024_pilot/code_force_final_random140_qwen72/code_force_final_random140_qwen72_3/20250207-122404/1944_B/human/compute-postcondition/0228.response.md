Postcondition: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is an input integer, `ans1` contains pairs of repeated elements from `b` if they are equal, up to the point where `k` reaches 0, `ans2` is an empty list, `k` is 0 if it was reduced to 0 during the loop execution, otherwise `k` is 2 times its original input value minus the total reduction due to the loop, `q` is `t`, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `b` is the first `n` elements of `a` sorted in ascending order, `c` is the elements of `a` starting from index `n` to the end and is now sorted in ascending order, `req` is 0 if `k` was reduced to 0 during the loop execution, otherwise `req` is 2 times the original input value of `k`, `l` contains elements from `b` that are not in `ans1` and were encountered before the loop terminated, and the last element of `b` (i.e., `b[n-1]`) is not in `ans1`.**
