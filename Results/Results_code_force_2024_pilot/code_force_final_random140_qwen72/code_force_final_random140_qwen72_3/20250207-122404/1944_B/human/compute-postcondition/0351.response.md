The function `func` accepts no parameters directly within its definition but operates under the context of processing multiple test cases. Each test case includes two integers, `n` and `k`, and a list `a` of 2n integers. The function processes these inputs according to the following rules:

- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000), representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - `n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 50000).
  - `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋).
  - `a` is a list of 2n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n), where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 50000.

The function returns the result of processing each test case, which involves some operation on the list `a` given the parameters `n` and `k`.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n` and `k`, and a list `a` of 2n integers. It returns the result of an operation on `a` for each test case, considering the constraints on `n`, `k`, and the composition of `a`.**
