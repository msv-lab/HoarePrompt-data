Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `ans1` is either an empty list or contains the values of `b[i]` and `b[i-1]` if they are equal, `ans2` is an empty list, `k` is -2 if `b[i]` equals `b[i-1]` otherwise `k` is 0, `q` is `t`, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `b` is the first `n` elements of `a` sorted in ascending order, `c` is the elements of `a` starting from index `n` to the end and is now sorted in ascending order, `req` is 0, `l` is a list containing the element `b[i-1]` if `b[i]` equals `b[i-1]` or contains the element `b[0]` and `b[i-1]` if `b[i]` does not equal `b[i-1]`.**
