The function `func` processes a series of test cases, each defined by the parameters `n`, `k`, and an array `a`. For each test case, `n` is an integer representing the length of the array divided by 2, `k` is an integer, and `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. The function splits the array `a` into two halves, `b` and `c`, sorts both halves, and then selects pairs of identical elements from these halves to form two new lists, `ans1` and `ans2`. It ensures that the total number of selected pairs is equal to `2 * k`. If there are not enough pairs in `b` or `c`, it uses additional elements from a list `l` that contains unique elements from `b` not already in `ans1`. The function prints the contents of `ans1` and `ans2` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function terminates, leaving the input variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `q`, `b`, `c`, and `req` unchanged.
