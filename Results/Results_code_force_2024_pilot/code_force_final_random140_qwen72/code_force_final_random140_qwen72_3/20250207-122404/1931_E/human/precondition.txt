t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and m are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5 and 0 ≤ m ≤ 2 × 10^6, representing the number of integers in the list and the parameter determining when Sasha wins, respectively. The list a contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.
