To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `y` and the result of `int(input())`.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains two integers `n` and `m`, and the second line contains `n` integers.

The loop head is:
```python
for y in range(int(input())):
```

For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be greater than 0. Since `t` represents the number of test cases and each test case will provide input, `int(input())` should be equal to `t`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `int(input())` is greater than 0, which means `t` must be greater than 0. Additionally, `y` should start from 0.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `y` is 0, and `int(input())` must be greater than 0 (which is ensured by `t` being greater than 0)**
