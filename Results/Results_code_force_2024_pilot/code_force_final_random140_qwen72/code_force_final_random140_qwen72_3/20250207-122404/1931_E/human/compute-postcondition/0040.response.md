Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `y` is 1, `list_len` must be greater than 2, `max_power` is the second part of the input provided, `operational_list` is a list of strings sorted by the difference between the length of the string without trailing zeros and the original length of the string, `x` is 2, `rev_res` is the concatenation of the first string in `operational_list`, the second string in `operational_list` (without trailing zeros if `x` was even), and the third string in `operational_list`.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `x` is 2.
- The initial state also specifies that `rev_res` is already the concatenation of the first and second strings in `operational_list` (with the second string possibly without trailing zeros if `x` was even).
- The code `rev_res += operational_list[x]` appends the third string in `operational_list` to `rev_res`.
- All other variables (`t`, `y`, `list_len`, `max_power`, `operational_list`) remain unchanged.
