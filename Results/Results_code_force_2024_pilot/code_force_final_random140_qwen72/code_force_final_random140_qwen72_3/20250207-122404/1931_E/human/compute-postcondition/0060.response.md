The code snippet `rev_res += operational_list[x]` appends the string at index `x` in the `operational_list` to the existing value of `rev_res`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `y` is 2
- `list_len` is a positive integer greater than 1
- `max_power` is the second part of the input provided
- `operational_list` is a list of strings sorted by the difference between the length of the string without trailing zeros and the original length of the string
- `x` is 1
- If `x` is even, `rev_res` is the string `operational_list[0]` with trailing zeros removed. Otherwise, `rev_res` is the first string in `operational_list`

Since `x` is 1 (which is odd), `rev_res` is initially set to the first string in `operational_list`. The code then appends the string at index `x` (which is 1) in `operational_list` to `rev_res`.

Therefore, the new value of `rev_res` is the concatenation of the first string in `operational_list` and the second string in `operational_list`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `y` is 2, `list_len` is a positive integer greater than 1, `max_power` is the second part of the input provided, `operational_list` is a list of strings sorted by the difference between the length of the string without trailing zeros and the original length of the string, `x` is 1, `rev_res` is the concatenation of the first string and the second string in `operational_list`.**
