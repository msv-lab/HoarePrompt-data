Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `y` is 2, `list_len` is the first part of the input provided, `max_power` is the second part of the input provided, `operational_list` is a list of strings sorted by the difference between the length of the string without trailing zeros and the original length of the string, `x` is `list_len` - 1, and `rev_res` is an empty string.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `list_len` and `max_power` are provided as input, and the code snippet splits the input into these two variables.
- The values of `t`, `y`, `operational_list`, `x`, and `rev_res` remain unchanged.
- `list_len` and `max_power` now hold the values from the input split by the space character.
- The output state reflects the updated values of `list_len` and `max_power` while keeping the rest of the initial state intact.
