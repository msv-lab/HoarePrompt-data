Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `y` is 2, `list_len` is a positive integer, `max_power` is the second part of the input provided, `operational_list` is a list of strings sorted by the difference between the length of the string without trailing zeros and the original length of the string, `x` is `list_len` - 1, and `rev_res` is the concatenation of all strings in `operational_list` where strings at even indices (0-based) have their trailing zeros removed, and strings at odd indices are concatenated as they are. Additionally, the length of `rev_res` is less than `int(max_power) + 1`.**
