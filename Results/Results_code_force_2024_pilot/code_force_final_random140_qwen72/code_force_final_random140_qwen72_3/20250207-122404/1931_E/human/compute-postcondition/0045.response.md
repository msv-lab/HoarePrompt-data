Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `y` is 1, `list_len` is the first part of the input provided, `max_power` is the second part of the input provided, `operational_list` is a list of strings sorted by the difference between the length of the string without trailing zeros and the original length of the string, `x` is `list_len` - 1, and `rev_res` is the concatenation of all strings in `operational_list` with every other string (starting from the first) having trailing zeros removed. Additionally, the length of `rev_res` is less than `int(max_power) + 1`.***
