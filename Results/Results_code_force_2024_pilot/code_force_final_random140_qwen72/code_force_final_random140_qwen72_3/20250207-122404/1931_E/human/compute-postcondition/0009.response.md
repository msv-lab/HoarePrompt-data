Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `y` is 0, `list_len` is a string representing the first part of the input and must be greater than 0 when converted to an integer, `max_power` is a string representing the second part of the input, `operational_list` is a list of strings sorted by the difference between the length of the string without trailing zeros and the original length of the string, `x` is 0. If `x` is even, `rev_res` is the string obtained by stripping trailing zeros from the first element of `operational_list`. If `x` is odd, `rev_res` is the first element of `operational_list`.***
