Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `y` is 2, `list_len` is the first part of the input provided, `max_power` is the second part of the input provided, `operational_list` is now a list of strings sorted by the difference between the length of the string without trailing zeros and the original length of the string, `x` is `list_len` - 1, and `rev_res` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for x in range(int(list_len)):
    if x % 2 == 0:
        rev_res += operational_list[x].rstrip('0')
    else:
        rev_res += operational_list[x]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `y` is 2, `list_len` is a positive integer greater than 0, `max_power` is the second part of the input provided, `operational_list` is a list of strings sorted by the difference between the length of the string without trailing zeros and the original length of the string, `x` is 0. If `x` is even, `rev_res` is the string `operational_list[0]` with trailing zeros removed. Otherwise, `rev_res` is the first string in `operational_list`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `y` is 2, `list_len` is a positive integer greater than 1, `max_power` is the second part of the input provided, `operational_list` is a list of strings sorted by the difference between the length of the string without trailing zeros and the original length of the string, `x` is 1. If `x` is even, `rev_res` is the concatenation of the initial `rev_res` and the string `operational_list[1]` with trailing zeros removed. Otherwise, `rev_res` is the concatenation of the first string and the second string in `operational_list`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `y` is 2, `list_len` is a positive integer greater than 2, `max_power` is the second part of the input provided, `operational_list` is a list of strings sorted by the difference between the length of the string without trailing zeros and the original length of the string, `x` is 2, and `rev_res` is the concatenation of the first string and the second string in `operational_list`. If `x` is even, `rev_res` is further concatenated with the third string in `operational_list` with trailing zeros removed. If `x` is odd, `rev_res` is concatenated with the third string in `operational_list` without removing trailing zeros.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
