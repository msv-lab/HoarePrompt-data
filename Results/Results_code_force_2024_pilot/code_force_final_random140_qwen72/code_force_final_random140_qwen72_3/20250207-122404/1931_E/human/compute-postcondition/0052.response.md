To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for x in range(int(list_len)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head involves the variable `x` and the expression `int(list_len)`.
   - The loop will execute if `int(list_len)` is greater than 0.

2. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (not directly relevant to the loop).
   - `y` is 2 (not directly relevant to the loop).
   - `list_len` is the first part of the input provided.
   - `max_power` is the second part of the input provided (not directly relevant to the loop).
   - `operational_list` is now a list of strings sorted by the difference between the length of the string without trailing zeros and the original length of the string (not directly relevant to the loop).
   - `x` is `list_len` - 1 (this will be adjusted by the loop).
   - `rev_res` is an empty string (not directly relevant to the loop).

3. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - For the loop to execute, `int(list_len)` must be greater than 0.
   - The variable `x` will be initialized by the loop, starting from 0 up to `int(list_len) - 1`.

### Adjusted State:
- `list_len` must be a positive integer (greater than 0) for the loop to execute.
- `x` will be initialized by the loop, starting from 0.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `y` is 2, `list_len` is a positive integer greater than 0, `max_power` is the second part of the input provided, `operational_list` is now a list of strings sorted by the difference between the length of the string without trailing zeros and the original length of the string, `x` is 0, and `rev_res` is an empty string.**
