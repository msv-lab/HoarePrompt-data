Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `y` is 1, `list_len` must be greater than 2, `max_power` is the second part of the input provided, `operational_list` is a list of strings sorted by the difference between the length of the string without trailing zeros and the original length of the string, `x` is 2, `rev_res` is the concatenation of the first string in `operational_list`, the second string in `operational_list` (or the second string without trailing zeros if `x` was initially even), and the third string in `operational_list` without trailing zeros.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `x` is 2.
- The code `rev_res += operational_list[x].rstrip('0')` appends the third string in `operational_list` (since `x` is 2) to `rev_res`, but with any trailing zeros removed.
- Since `x` is 2, which is even, the initial value of `rev_res` is the concatenation of the first string in `operational_list` and the second string in `operational_list` without trailing zeros.
- After executing the code, `rev_res` now includes the third string in `operational_list` without trailing zeros appended to its initial value.
- All other variables (`t`, `y`, `list_len`, `max_power`, and `operational_list`) remain unchanged.
