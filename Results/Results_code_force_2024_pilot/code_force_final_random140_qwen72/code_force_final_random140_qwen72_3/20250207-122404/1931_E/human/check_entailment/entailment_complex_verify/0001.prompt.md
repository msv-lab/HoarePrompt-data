You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha gave Anna a list a of n integers for Valentine's Day. Anna doesn't need
this list, so she suggests destroying it by playing a game.

Players take turns. Sasha is a gentleman, so he gives Anna the right to make
the first move.

  * On her turn, Anna must choose an element a_i from the list and reverse the sequence of its digits. For example, if Anna chose the element with a value of 42 , it would become 24 ; if Anna chose the element with a value of 1580 , it would become 851 . Note that leading zeros are removed. After such a turn, the number of elements in the list does not change.
  * On his turn, Sasha must extract two elements a_i and a_j (i \ne j ) from the list, concatenate them in any order and insert the result back into the list. For example, if Sasha chose the elements equal to 2007 and 19 , he would remove these two elements from the list and add the integer 200719 or 192007 . After such a turn, the number of elements in the list decreases by 1 .

Players can't skip turns. The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, i.e.
after Anna's move there is exactly one number left in the list. If this
integer is not less than 10^m (i.e., \ge 10^m ), Sasha wins. Otherwise, Anna
wins.

It can be shown that the game will always end. Determine who will win if both
players play optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Then follows the description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains integers n , m (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 , 0 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^6 ) — the number of integers in the list and the
parameter determining when Sasha wins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the list that Sasha gave to Anna.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output:

  * "Sasha", if Sasha wins with optimal play; 
  * "Anna", if Anna wins with optimal play.

    Anna
    Sasha
    
Note

Consider the first test case.

Anna can reverse the integer 2 , then Sasha can concatenate the integers 2 and
14 , obtaining the integer 214 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . If Anna
had reversed the integer 14 , Sasha would have concatenated the integers 41
and 2 , obtaining the integer 412 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . Anna
has no other possible moves, so she loses.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains two integers n and m where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5 and 0 ≤ m ≤ 2 × 10^6, representing the number of integers in the list and the parameter determining when Sasha wins, respectively. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the list of integers. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.

    #State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `y` is `t` - 1, `list_len` is a positive integer, `max_power` is the second part of the input provided, `operational_list` is a list of strings sorted by the difference between the length of the string without trailing zeros and the original length of the string, `x` is `list_len` - 1, and `rev_res` is the concatenation of all strings in `operational_list` where strings at even indices (0-based) have their trailing zeros removed, and strings at odd indices are concatenated as they are. If the length of `rev_res` is greater than or equal to `int(max_power) + 1`, the condition is met. Otherwise, the length of `rev_res` is less than `int(max_power) + 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a list of integers and a threshold value. It constructs a string by concatenating the elements of the list, removing trailing zeros from elements at even indices. If the resulting string's length meets or exceeds the threshold plus one, it prints "Sasha"; otherwise, it prints "Anna". The function handles multiple test cases and outputs the result for each.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` using `int(input())`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m` using `input().split()` and converts them to integers.
   - It then reads the list of integers and splits them into a list of strings.

2. **Sorting the List**:
   - The list is sorted based on the length of the number after removing trailing zeros. This is done using `sorted(input().split(), key=lambda x: len(x.rstrip('0')) - len(x))`.
   - The sorting key is `len(x.rstrip('0')) - len(x)`, which effectively sorts the numbers by their length after removing trailing zeros. However, this key is incorrect because it should be `len(x.rstrip('0'))` to sort by the length of the number without trailing zeros.

3. **Reversing and Concatenating**:
   - The function iterates over the sorted list and concatenates the numbers into a single string `rev_res`.
   - For even indices, it removes trailing zeros before concatenating.
   - For odd indices, it concatenates the number as is.

4. **Winning Condition**:
   - After concatenating all the numbers, it checks if the length of the resulting string `rev_res` is greater than or equal to `m + 1`.
   - If the condition is met, it prints "Sasha"; otherwise, it prints "Anna".

### Issues:
- **Sorting Key**: The sorting key `len(x.rstrip('0')) - len(x)` is incorrect. It should be `len(x.rstrip('0'))` to correctly sort the numbers by their length after removing trailing zeros.
- **Concatenation Logic**: The logic for concatenating the numbers is flawed. It does not correctly simulate the game rules where Anna reverses the digits of a chosen number and Sasha concatenates two numbers. Instead, it simply concatenates the numbers in a specific order.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Reverse the digits of each number in the list
        a = [int(str(x)[::-1]) for x in a]
        
        # Sort the list in descending order
        a.sort(reverse=True)
        
        # Concatenate the numbers
        result = ''.join(map(str, a))
        
        # Check the winning condition
        if len(result) >= m + 1:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Anna')

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Input Parsing**: Same as before.
2. **Reverse Digits**: Each number in the list is reversed using `int(str(x)[::-1])`.
3. **Sort in Descending Order**: The list is sorted in descending order to maximize the concatenated result.
4. **Concatenate Numbers**: The numbers are concatenated into a single string.
5. **Winning Condition**: The length of the concatenated string is checked against `m + 1` to determine the winner.

Correctness: **False**
