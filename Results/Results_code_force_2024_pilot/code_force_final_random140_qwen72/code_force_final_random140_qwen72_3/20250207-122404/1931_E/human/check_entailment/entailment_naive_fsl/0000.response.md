Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described. Here are a few specific issues and examples where the program fails:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Reversal and Concatenation**:
   - The program reverses the digits of the numbers in a way that does not match the problem description. Specifically, it strips trailing zeros using `rstrip('0')` and concatenates the numbers directly. This does not simulate the actual game rules where Anna reverses a single number and Sasha concatenates two numbers.

2. **Incorrect Turn Logic**:
   - The program does not properly simulate the turn-based nature of the game. It simply alternates between adding the original and modified numbers to a string, which does not reflect the actual game mechanics.

3. **Incorrect Winning Condition**:
   - The program checks the length of the concatenated string against `max_power + 1`, which is not the correct condition. The game ends when there is exactly one number left, and the winning condition is whether this number is greater than or equal to \(10^m\).

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
1
2 2
14 2
```
According to the problem description:
- Anna can reverse the number 2, making it 2.
- Sasha can then concatenate 2 and 14, resulting in 214, which is greater than \(10^2 = 100\). Therefore, Sasha wins.

However, the provided program will output:
```
Anna
```
This is incorrect because the program does not correctly simulate the game rules and the winning condition.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, the program should:
1. Simulate Anna's turn by reversing a single number.
2. Simulate Sasha's turn by concatenating two numbers.
3. Check the final number after all moves to determine the winner.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.
