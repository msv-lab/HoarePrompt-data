The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n` (the number of sale days), `m` (the maximum number of tickets purchasable each day), `k` (the total number of tickets to buy), and `prices` (a list of prices per ticket for each day). It calculates and returns the minimum amount of money needed to purchase exactly `k` tickets by selecting the lowest available prices from the sorted `prices` list. After the function concludes, `total_cost` holds the minimum spending required to buy `k` tickets, `tickets_bought` equals `k`, and `prices` is sorted in ascending order. The original values of `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged.
