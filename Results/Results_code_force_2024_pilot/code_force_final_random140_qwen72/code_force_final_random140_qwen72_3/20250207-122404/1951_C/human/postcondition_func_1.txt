The function `func_2` processes multiple test cases, where each test case involves reading inputs `n`, `m`, `k`, and a list of prices. It then calls another function `func_1` with these inputs and prints the result. After processing all test cases, the function completes its execution. The final state of the program includes the printed results for each test case, and the input variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `prices` are no longer relevant. The function itself does not return any value.
