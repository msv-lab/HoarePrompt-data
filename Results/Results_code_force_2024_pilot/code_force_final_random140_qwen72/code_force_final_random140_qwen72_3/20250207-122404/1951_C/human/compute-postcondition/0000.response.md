The provided code snippet is a comment and does not perform any operations that would alter the state of the variables. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. n, m, and k are positive integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9). prices is a list of n positive integers, each representing the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days, where 1 ≤ prices[i] ≤ 10^9.**
