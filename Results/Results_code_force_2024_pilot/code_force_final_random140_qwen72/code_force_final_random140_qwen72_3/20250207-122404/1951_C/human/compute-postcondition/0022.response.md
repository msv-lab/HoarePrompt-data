Output State: **`total_cost` is `tickets_to_buy * prices[0] + tickets_to_buy * prices[1] + tickets_to_buy * prices[2]`, `tickets_bought` is `tickets_bought + min(m, k - tickets_bought)`, `prices` is sorted in ascending order, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `tickets_to_buy` is `min(m, k - tickets_bought)`. If `tickets_bought` equals `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- The value of `total_cost` is updated by adding `cost` to its current value. Since `cost` is defined as `tickets_to_buy * prices[2]`, the new value of `total_cost` is `tickets_to_buy * prices[0] + tickets_to_buy * prices[1] + tickets_to_buy * prices[2]`.
- All other variables (`tickets_bought`, `prices`, `n`, `i`, `tickets_to_buy`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The condition to break out of the most internal loop or if statement remains valid if `tickets_bought` equals `k`.
