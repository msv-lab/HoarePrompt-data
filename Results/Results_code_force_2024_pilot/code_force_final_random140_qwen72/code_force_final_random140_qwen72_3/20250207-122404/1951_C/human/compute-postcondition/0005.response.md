The code snippet calls the function `func_1` with the arguments `n`, `m`, `k`, and `prices`. The result of this function call is assigned to the variable `result`. Since the function `func_1` is not defined in the provided code, we cannot determine the exact value of `result`. However, we know that `result` now holds the value returned by `func_1`.

The initial state specifies that `t` must be greater than 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers, and `prices` is a list of integers provided by the user. These conditions remain unchanged, except that `result` now holds the value returned by `func_1`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers, `prices` is a list of integers provided by the user, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, m, k, prices)`**.
