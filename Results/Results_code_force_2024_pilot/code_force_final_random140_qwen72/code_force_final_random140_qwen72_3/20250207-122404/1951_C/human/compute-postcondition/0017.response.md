Output State: **`t` is 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers, `prices` is a list of integers provided by the user, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, m, k, prices)` for each iteration.**

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have completed, the variable `t` will be 0 because the loop has run `t` times, decrementing `t` by 1 each time. The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers that are read from the user for each iteration, and `prices` is a list of integers provided by the user for each iteration. The `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, m, k, prices)` for each iteration, and it is printed out after each call to `func_1`. The loop stops when `t` reaches 0, indicating that all iterations have been completed.
