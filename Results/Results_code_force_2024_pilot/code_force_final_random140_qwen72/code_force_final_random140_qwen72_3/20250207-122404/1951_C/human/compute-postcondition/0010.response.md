Output State: **`t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers, `prices` is a new list of integers provided by the user, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, m, k, prices)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` remains `t - 1` and must be greater than 0.
- The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` remain as input integers.
- The list `prices` remains a new list of integers provided by the user.
- The variable `result` is now assigned the value returned by the function `func_1(n, m, k, prices)`.
