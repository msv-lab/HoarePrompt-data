To determine what will be printed when the `print(result)` statement is executed, let's break down the initial state and the context:

### Initial State:
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers.
- `prices` is a list of integers provided by the user.
- `result` is the value returned by the function `func_1(n, m, k, prices)`.

### Analysis:
1. **Input Variables**:
   - `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers provided by the user.
   - `prices` is a list of integers also provided by the user.

2. **Function Call**:
   - The function `func_1(n, m, k, prices)` is called with the provided inputs.
   - The return value of this function is stored in the variable `result`.

3. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print(result)` statement will print the value of `result`.

### Determining the Output:
- Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `result`.
- However, we know that `result` is the value returned by `func_1` when it is called with the specified parameters.

### Final Output:
The `print(result)` statement will print the value returned by the function `func_1(n, m, k, prices)`. Without the specific implementation of `func_1`, we can only describe the output in terms of the function's return value.

Output: **result (where result is the value returned by the function `func_1(n, m, k, prices)`)**
