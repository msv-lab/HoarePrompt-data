To determine what will be printed by the `print(result)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the context:

### Initial State:
- `t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than 0.
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers.
- `prices` is a list of integers provided by the user.
- `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, m, k, prices)`.

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `t`:**
   - The statement `t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than 0 implies that `t` is being decremented by 1, but it must remain positive. This suggests that `t` is part of a loop or conditional check where it is being decremented until it reaches 1.

2. **Variables `n`, `m`, and `k`:**
   - These are input integers. Their specific values are not provided, but they are used as arguments in the function `func_1`.

3. **List `prices`:**
   - This is a list of integers provided by the user. The exact values of the list are not specified, but it is used as an argument in the function `func_1`.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1(n, m, k, prices)` is called with the input integers `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list `prices`. The return value of this function is stored in the variable `result`.

### What is printed:
- The `print(result)` statement will print the value returned by the function `func_1(n, m, k, prices)`.

Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the precise numerical value of `result`. However, we can describe the output based on the given information.

### Final Output:
Output: **result (where result is the value returned by the function `func_1(n, m, k, prices)`)**
