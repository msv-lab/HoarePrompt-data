The code reads a line of input and splits it into three parts, which are then converted to integers and assigned to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. The initial state specifies that `t` must be greater than 0, but this state is not affected by the code.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers.**
