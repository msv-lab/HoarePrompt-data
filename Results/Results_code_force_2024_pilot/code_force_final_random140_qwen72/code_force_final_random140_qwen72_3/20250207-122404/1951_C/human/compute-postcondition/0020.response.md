Output State: **`total_cost` is `tickets_to_buy * prices[0] + tickets_to_buy * prices[1]`, `tickets_bought` is `tickets_bought + min(m, k - tickets_bought)`, `prices` is sorted in ascending order, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `tickets_to_buy` is `min(m, k - tickets_bought)`. If `tickets_bought` equals `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The code snippet `tickets_to_buy = min(m, k - tickets_bought)` updates the value of `tickets_to_buy` to the minimum of `m` and `k - tickets_bought`. This update does not change the other variables or conditions specified in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the updated value of `tickets_to_buy`.
