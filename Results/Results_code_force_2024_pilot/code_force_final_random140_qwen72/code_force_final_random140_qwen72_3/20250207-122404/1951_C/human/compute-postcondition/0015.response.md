Output State: **`t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers, `prices` is a list of integers provided by the user, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, m, k, prices)`**

Explanation: The value of `result` is updated to the value returned by the function `func_1(n, m, k, prices)`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `prices`) remain unchanged from their initial state. The condition that `t` must be greater than 0 after being decremented by 1 is still valid.
