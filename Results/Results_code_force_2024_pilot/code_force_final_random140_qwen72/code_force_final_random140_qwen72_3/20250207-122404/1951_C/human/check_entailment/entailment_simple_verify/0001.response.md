### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires purchasing `k` tickets over `n` days with a daily purchase limit of `m` tickets.
   - The price of tickets increases after each purchase, so the strategy should minimize the total cost.

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` sorts the prices in ascending order. This ensures that we always buy tickets at the lowest possible price first.
   - The loop iterates through the sorted prices, buying as many tickets as possible up to the limit `m` or until we reach the required `k` tickets.
   - The cost is calculated by multiplying the number of tickets bought by the current price.
   - The total cost is accumulated and returned once `k` tickets are bought.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where `k` is less than or equal to `m` by buying all required tickets in one go.
   - The function also handles the case where `k` is greater than `m` by distributing the purchases over multiple days.
   - The function correctly handles the scenario where the number of tickets to be bought is exactly `k`.

4. **Input Handling**:
   - `func_2` reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - It reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, and the list of prices for each test case.
   - It calls `func_1` to compute the result and prints it.

5. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The provided example test cases are correctly handled by the program.
   - The logic of sorting the prices and buying tickets in the cheapest order is sound and aligns with the problem requirements.
   - The program correctly accounts for the increase in ticket prices after each purchase.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct and meets the problem's requirements.

Final: **True**
