Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum cost to purchase `k` tickets over `n` days, with constraints on the maximum number of tickets that can be purchased per day (`m`) and the increasing prices after purchasing tickets. The approach taken by the program is as follows:

1. **Sorting Prices**: The `prices` list is sorted in ascending order to ensure that the cheapest tickets are bought first. This is a crucial step because it ensures that the minimum possible cost is achieved.

2. **Iterative Purchase**: The program iteratively buys tickets starting from the cheapest day until it has bought `k` tickets. It ensures that no more than `m` tickets are bought on any single day.

3. **Cost Calculation**: For each day, the program calculates the cost of buying the tickets and adds this cost to the total cost. It also keeps track of the number of tickets bought so far.

4. **Early Termination**: The loop terminates early once `k` tickets have been bought, which is efficient and avoids unnecessary computations.

5. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The `func_2` function handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases `t` and then processing each test case individually.

The logic and implementation appear to be correct and align with the problem requirements. The sorting step ensures that the minimum cost is always found, and the constraints are respected by limiting the number of tickets bought per day.

Correctness: **True**
