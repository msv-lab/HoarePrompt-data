Correctness: **True**

The provided solution correctly implements the logic to find the minimum spending required to purchase `k` tickets under the constraints described. The approach sorts the prices to ensure that tickets are bought at the lowest possible cost first, which is a key strategy to minimize total spending. The function `func_1` iterates through the sorted prices, buying up to `m` tickets per day until the required `k` tickets are purchased. This ensures that the constraints of the problem are respected, and the solution is efficient enough to handle the specified input sizes. The handling of multiple test cases in `func_2` is also done correctly, reading inputs and printing outputs as expected.
