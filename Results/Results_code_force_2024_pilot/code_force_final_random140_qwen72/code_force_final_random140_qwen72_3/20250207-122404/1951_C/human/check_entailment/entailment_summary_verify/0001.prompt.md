You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
[Maître Gims - Est-ce que tu m'aimes ?](https://youtu.be/6TpyRE_juyA)

ඞ

As the CEO of a startup company, you want to reward each of your k employees
with a ticket to the upcoming concert. The tickets will be on sale for n days,
and by some time travelling, you have predicted that the price per ticket at
day i will be a_i . However, to prevent ticket hoarding, the concert
organizers have implemented the following measures:

  * A person may purchase no more than m tickets per day. 
  * If a person purchases x tickets on day i , all subsequent days (i.e. from day i+1 onwards) will have their prices per ticket increased by x . 

For example, if a = [1, 3, 8, 4, 5] and you purchase 2 tickets on day 1 , they
will cost 2 in total, and the prices from day 2 onwards will become [5, 10, 6,
7] . If you then purchase 3 more tickets on day 2 , they will cost in total an
additional 15 , and the prices from day 3 onwards will become [13, 9, 10] .

Find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
n \le 3 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le m \le 10^9, 1 \le k \le \min(nm, 10^9) ) — the
number of sale days, the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, and
the number of tickets to be bought at the end.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the minimum amount of money needed to
purchase exactly k tickets.

Note

In the first test case, one optimal way to buy 3 tickets is as follows:

  * Buy 0 tickets on the first day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [6, 4, 2] . 
  * Buy 0 tickets on the second day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [4, 2] . 
  * Buy 1 ticket on the third day with cost 4 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [3] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 6 . 

In the second test case, there is only one way to buy 8 tickets:

  * Buy 2 tickets on the first day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6, 4] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the second day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the third day with cost 16 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [8] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 16 .

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` processes multiple test cases, where each test case involves reading inputs `n`, `m`, `k`, and a list of prices. It then calls another function `func_1` with these inputs and prints the result. After processing all test cases, the function completes its execution. The final state of the program includes the printed results for each test case, and the input variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `prices` are no longer relevant. The function itself does not return any value.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to purchase `k` tickets over `n` days with the constraint that we can buy at most `m` tickets per day.
   - The price of tickets increases after each purchase, so the strategy should minimize the total cost.

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` sorts the prices in ascending order. This ensures that we always buy tickets at the lowest possible price first.
   - The loop iterates through the sorted prices, buying as many tickets as possible up to the limit `m` or until we reach the required `k` tickets.
   - The cost is calculated by multiplying the number of tickets bought by the current price.
   - The total cost is accumulated and returned once `k` tickets are bought.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where `k` is less than or equal to `m` by buying all required tickets in one go.
   - The function also handles the case where `k` is greater than `m` by distributing the purchases over multiple days.

4. **Input Handling**:
   - `func_2` reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - It reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, and the list of prices for each test case.
   - It calls `func_1` to compute the result and prints it.

5. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The provided example test cases are correctly handled by the program.
   - The logic of sorting the prices and buying tickets in the cheapest order is sound and aligns with the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct and meets the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **True**
