Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum spending to purchase `k` tickets under the given constraints. Here's a breakdown of why the program works for every potential case:

1. **Sorting Prices**: The prices are sorted in ascending order, ensuring that the cheapest tickets are purchased first. This is a crucial step because it allows the algorithm to minimize the total cost by buying the least expensive tickets available.

2. **Ticket Purchase Logic**: The program iterates through the sorted prices and calculates the number of tickets to buy on each day (`tickets_to_buy`). It ensures that no more than `m` tickets are bought on any single day and that the total number of tickets bought does not exceed `k`.

3. **Cost Calculation**: For each day, the cost of buying the tickets is calculated and added to the total cost. The program also keeps track of the total number of tickets bought so far (`tickets_bought`).

4. **Early Termination**: The loop breaks once the required number of tickets (`k`) has been bought, which optimizes the process and avoids unnecessary calculations.

5. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The `func_2` function handles multiple test cases by reading the input and calling `func_1` for each test case, printing the result for each case.

Given these points, the program appears to handle all edge cases and potential inputs correctly, ensuring that the minimum spending is calculated accurately for any valid input. Therefore, the program is correct.
