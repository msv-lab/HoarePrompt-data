### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program and the original assessment in detail:

1. **Sorting Prices**:
   - The program sorts the `prices` list in ascending order. This ensures that the cheapest tickets are considered first, which is essential for minimizing the total cost.
   - **Annotation**: The `prices` list is sorted in ascending order, which is correct and necessary for the algorithm to work as intended.

2. **Ticket Purchase Logic**:
   - The program iterates through the sorted `prices` list and calculates the number of tickets to buy on each day (`tickets_to_buy`). It ensures that no more than `m` tickets are bought on any single day and that the total number of tickets bought does not exceed `k`.
   - **Annotation**: The variable `tickets_to_buy` is correctly calculated as `min(m, k - tickets_bought)`, which ensures that the program adheres to the constraints of purchasing no more than `m` tickets per day and buying exactly `k` tickets in total.

3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - For each day, the cost of buying the tickets is calculated and added to the total cost. The program also keeps track of the total number of tickets bought so far (`tickets_bought`).
   - **Annotation**: The cost calculation `cost = tickets_to_buy * prices[i]` is correct, and the total cost is updated accordingly.

4. **Early Termination**:
   - The loop breaks once the required number of tickets (`k`) has been bought, which optimizes the process and avoids unnecessary calculations.
   - **Annotation**: The condition `if tickets_bought == k` correctly terminates the loop when the required number of tickets is reached.

5. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**:
   - The `func_2` function handles multiple test cases by reading the input and calling `func_1` for each test case, printing the result for each case.
   - **Annotation**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n`, `m`, `k`, and `prices`, then calling `func_1` and printing the result.

### Potential Issues:
- **Price Increase Due to Ticket Purchases**: The problem statement mentions that the price per ticket increases by the number of tickets purchased on a given day for all subsequent days. However, the provided program does not account for this price increase. This is a significant oversight because it means the program does not correctly simulate the dynamic pricing changes as described in the problem.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment states that the program is correct. However, the program fails to account for the price increase due to ticket purchases, which is a critical part of the problem statement. This oversight means that the program does not correctly solve the problem as specified.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
