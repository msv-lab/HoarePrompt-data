Output State: **If `i` is '@': `ret` is 1, `thorn` is 1. If `i` is not '@' and not '*': `ret` is 0, `thorn` is 1. If `i` is '*': If `thorn` was 1: `ret` is 0, `thorn` is 2. If `thorn` was 2: `ret` is 0, `thorn` is 3, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.** 

The values of `ret` and `thorn` remain unchanged, but the `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is currently in.
