Postcondition: ***`_` is a placeholder, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 2 characters, `i` is the second character in `s`. If `i` is '@', `ret` is 1 and `thorn` is 1. If `i` is not '@' and `i` is '*', `thorn` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ret` remains 0 and `thorn` is 1.***
