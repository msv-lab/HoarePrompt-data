Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `len` is the new input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string, `ret` is 0, `thorn` is 0.**

Explanation: The code snippet sets `thorn` to 0, overriding its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged. The initial condition that `thorn` is 2 if two consecutive '*' characters are found is no longer applicable because `thorn` is explicitly set to 0.
