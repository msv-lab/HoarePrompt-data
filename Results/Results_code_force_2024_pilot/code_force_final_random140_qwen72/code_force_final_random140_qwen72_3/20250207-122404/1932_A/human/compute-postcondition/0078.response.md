The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a counter for the number of iterations specified by `int(input())`. Since the loop iterates a fixed number of times, the only adjustment needed is to increment `_` by 1 for the next iteration. The other variables (`ret`, `thorn`, `t`, `len`, and `s`) are not part of the loop head and thus should not be adjusted here.

Given that the loop will stop executing when it encounters the second '*' character in the string `s`, setting `thorn` to 2, and potentially incrementing `ret` based on the presence of '@' characters before the second '*', the state of these variables remains as described but does not affect the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration, considering only the objects in the loop head, is:
State: **`_` is incremented by 1**
