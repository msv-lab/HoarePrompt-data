The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is used as a placeholder to iterate over the range. The loop's execution depends on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must return a positive integer.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, representing the length of the path.
- The path is represented by a string of `n` characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns.
- The first cell of the path is always empty ('.').

To ensure the loop executes, `int(input())` should return a value that is at least 1. Since `t` is already defined to be within the range 1 to 1000, we can assume that `int(input())` will be equal to `t`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that the loop will execute based on the value of `t`.

State: **`_` is a placeholder, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, ensuring the loop will execute `t` times**
