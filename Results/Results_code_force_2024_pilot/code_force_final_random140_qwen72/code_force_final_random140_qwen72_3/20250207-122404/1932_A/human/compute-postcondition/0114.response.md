Postcondition: **`_` is incremented by 1, `len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 3 characters, and `i` is the third character in the list `s`. If `i` is `@`, `ret` is 2 and `thorn` is 0. If `i` is `*`, `ret` is 0 and `thorn` is 1. If `i` is neither `@` nor `*`, `ret` is 0 and `thorn` remains 0. If `thorn` is 2, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
