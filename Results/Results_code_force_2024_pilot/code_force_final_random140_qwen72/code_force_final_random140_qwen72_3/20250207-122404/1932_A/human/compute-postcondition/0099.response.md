The value of `ret` is incremented by 1. The initial state specifies that `ret` is either 0 or 1 depending on the value of `i`. If `i` is `@`, `ret` was initially 1, and now it becomes 2. If `i` is not `@`, `ret` was initially 0, and now it becomes 1. The values of `_`, `len`, `s`, and `thorn` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 2 characters, `i` is the second character in the list `s`. If `i` is `@`, `ret` is 2 and `thorn` is 0. If `i` is not `@`, `ret` is 1. If `i` is `*`, `thorn` is set to 1; otherwise, `thorn` is 0.**
