Postcondition: ***If `i` is '@', `ret` is 1 and `thorn` is 1. If `i` is not '@' and not '*', `ret` is 0 and `thorn` is 1. If `i` is '*' and `thorn` was 1, `ret` is 0 and `thorn` is 2. If `i` is '*' and `thorn` was 2, `ret` is 0, `thorn` is 3, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
