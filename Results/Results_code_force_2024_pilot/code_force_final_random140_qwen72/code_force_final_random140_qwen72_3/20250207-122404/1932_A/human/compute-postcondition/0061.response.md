The value of `thorn` is incremented by 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Since the initial state specifies conditions for `thorn` based on the value of `i`, we need to consider these conditions:

- If `i` is '@', `ret` is 1 and `thorn` is 0. After the code executes, `thorn` becomes 1.
- If `i` is not '@' and not '*', `ret` is 0 and `thorn` is 0. After the code executes, `thorn` becomes 1.
- If `i` is '*', `ret` is 0 and `thorn` is 1 or 2. If `thorn` was 1, it becomes 2. If `thorn` was 2, it becomes 3, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

Therefore, the Output State is:
- If `i` is '@': `ret` is 1, `thorn` is 1.
- If `i` is not '@' and not '*': `ret` is 0, `thorn` is 1.
- If `i` is '*':
  - If `thorn` was 1: `ret` is 0, `thorn` is 2.
  - If `thorn` was 2: `ret` is 0, `thorn` is 3, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **If `i` is '@': `ret` is 1, `thorn` is 1. If `i` is not '@' and not '*': `ret` is 0, `thorn` is 1. If `i` is '*': If `thorn` was 1: `ret` is 0, `thorn` is 2. If `thorn` was 2: `ret` is 0, `thorn` is 3, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
