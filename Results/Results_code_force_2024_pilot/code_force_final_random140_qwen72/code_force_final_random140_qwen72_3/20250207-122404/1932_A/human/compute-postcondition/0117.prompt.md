Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, representing the length of the path. The path is represented by a string of n characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns. The first cell of the path is always empty ('.').
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    len = int(input())
    s = list(input())
    ret = 0
    thorn = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '@':
            thorn = 0
            ret += 1
        elif i == '*':
            thorn += 1
            if thorn == 2:
                break
        else:
            thorn = 0
    print(ret)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `_` is a placeholder, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `ret` is the number of '@' characters encountered before two consecutive '*' characters, and `thorn` is 2 if two consecutive '*' characters are found, otherwise it is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The loop will stop executing when it encounters the second '*' character in the string `s`, setting `thorn` to 2 and potentially incrementing `ret` based on the presence of '@' characters before the second '*'. The final value of `ret` will be the count of '@' characters encountered before the loop breaks due to the second '*' character. The final value of `thorn` will be 2 or 3 depending on whether the loop broke due to the second '*' character or if an additional '*' was processed after reaching `thorn` = 2. The values of `t` and `len` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After the loop executes all iterations, `_` is incremented by the length of the list `s`, `len` remains the same input integer, `s` remains the same list of characters from the input string, `ret` is the number of times the character `@` appears in `s`, and `thorn` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the last character processed was `*` and did not cause a break due to reaching 2 consecutive `*` characters. If two consecutive `*` characters were encountered, the loop breaks early, and `thorn` would be 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
