Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `_` is incremented by the length of the list `s`, `len` remains the same input integer, `s` remains the same list of characters from the input string, `ret` is the number of times the character `@` appears in `s`, and `thorn` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the last character processed was `*` and did not cause a break due to reaching 2 consecutive `*` characters. If two consecutive `*` characters were encountered, the loop breaks early, and `thorn` would be 2.**
