Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `len` is the new input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string that must have at least 1 character, `ret` is 1, `thorn` is 0, and the first character `i` in `s` is '@'.**

Explanation: The value of `ret` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
