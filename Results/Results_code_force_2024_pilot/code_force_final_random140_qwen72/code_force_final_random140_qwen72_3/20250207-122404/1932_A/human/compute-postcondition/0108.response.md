The value of `ret` is incremented by 1. The initial state specifies that `ret` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `i` is `@` or not. After incrementing, `ret` will be 1 if it was initially 0, or 2 if it was initially 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 3 characters, `i` is the third character in the list `s`. If `i` is `@`, `ret` is 2 and `thorn` is 0. If `i` is not `@`, `ret` is 1. If `i` is `*`, `thorn` is set to 1; otherwise, `thorn` remains 0. `thorn` is now 0.**
