Based on the initial state provided:

- The loop stops when it encounters the second '*' character in the string `s`.
- `thorn` is set to 2 when the second '*' is encountered.
- `ret` is incremented for each '@' character encountered before the second '*'.
- `t` and `len` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.

Given this information, the `print(ret)` statement will output the count of '@' characters encountered before the second '*' character in the string `s`.

Output: **ret (where ret is the count of '@' characters encountered before the second '*' character in the string s)**
