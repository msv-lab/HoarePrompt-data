To determine what will be printed by the `print(ret)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `_` is a placeholder (not relevant to the output).
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000 (not directly relevant to the output).
   - `len` is an input integer (the length of the input string `s`).
   - `s` is a list of characters from the input string.
   - `ret` is the number of '@' characters encountered before two consecutive '*' characters.
   - `thorn` is 2 if two consecutive '*' characters are found, otherwise it is 0.

2. **Understanding `ret`:**
   - `ret` counts the number of '@' characters in the list `s` before encountering two consecutive '*' characters.
   - If no two consecutive '*' characters are found, `ret` will count all '@' characters in the list `s`.

3. **Understanding `thorn`:**
   - `thorn` is used to indicate whether two consecutive '*' characters are found.
   - If two consecutive '*' characters are found, `thorn` is set to 2.
   - If no two consecutive '*' characters are found, `thorn` remains 0.

4. **Output Determination:**
   - The `print(ret)` statement will print the value of `ret`.
   - The value of `ret` depends on the content of the list `s` and the presence of two consecutive '*' characters.

Given the initial state, the value of `ret` is determined by the following logic:
- Count the number of '@' characters in `s` until two consecutive '*' characters are found.
- If no two consecutive '*' characters are found, count all '@' characters in `s`.

Since the exact content of `s` is not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the conditions given.

Output: **ret (where ret is the number of '@' characters encountered before two consecutive '*' characters in the list s)**
