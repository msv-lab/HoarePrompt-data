Postcondition: ***`_` is incremented by 1, `len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character, `i` is the first character in the list `s`, `ret` is 0, and `i` is not equal to '@'. If `i` is `'*'`, `thorn` is set to 1, otherwise, `thorn` remains 0. If `thorn` is 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
