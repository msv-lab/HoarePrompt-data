Functionality: ** The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and a string `s` representing a path. The path consists of characters '.', '@', and '*', with the first character always being '.'. For each test case, the function counts the number of '@' characters encountered in the path until it encounters two consecutive '*' characters, at which point it stops counting. The function prints the count for each test case. The function does not return any value; instead, it directly outputs the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function terminates. **
