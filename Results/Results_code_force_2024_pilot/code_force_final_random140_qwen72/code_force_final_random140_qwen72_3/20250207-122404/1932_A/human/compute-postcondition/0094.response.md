Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character, `i` is the first character in the list `s`, `ret` is 0, `thorn` is 0, and `i` is not equal to '*'**

The code snippet `thorn = 0` does not change the value of `thorn` since it was already set to 0 in the initial state. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
