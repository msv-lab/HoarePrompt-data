Postcondition: ***`_` is a placeholder, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 3 characters, `i` is the third character in `s`. If `i` is '@', `ret` is 1 and `thorn` is 0. If `i` is '*', `thorn` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is neither '@' nor '*', `thorn` is 1 and `ret` remains 0.***
