The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `s`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `s` must have at least one more character. At the end of the last iteration, `s` had at least 1 character, and `i` was the first character in the list `s`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `s` must now have at least 2 characters, and `i` will be the second character in the list `s`.

State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 2 characters, `i` is the second character in the list `s`. If `i` is `@`, `ret` is 1 and `thorn` is 0. If `i` is not `@`, `ret` is 0. If `i` is `*`, `thorn` is set to 1; otherwise, `thorn` remains 0. If `thorn` is 2, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
