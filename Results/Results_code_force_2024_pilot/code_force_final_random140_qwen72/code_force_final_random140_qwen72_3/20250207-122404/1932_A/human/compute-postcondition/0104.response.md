Postcondition: **`_` is incremented by 1, `len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 2 characters, `i` is the second character in the list `s`. If `i` is `@`, `ret` is 1 and `thorn` is 0. If `i` is not `@`, `ret` is 0. If `i` is `*`, `thorn` is set to 1. If `thorn` is 2, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `thorn` is 0.**
