Postcondition: **`_` is a placeholder, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `len` is the new input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string that must have at least 3 characters, `i` is the third character in `s`. If `i` is '*', `thorn` is updated to 4, `ret` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `thorn` was 2. Otherwise, if `i` is not '@' and not '*', `thorn` is 0 and `ret` is 0. If `i` is '@', `thorn` is 1 and `ret` is 2.**
