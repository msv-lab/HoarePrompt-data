t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, representing the length of the path. The path is represented by a string of n characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns. The first cell of the path is always empty ('.').
