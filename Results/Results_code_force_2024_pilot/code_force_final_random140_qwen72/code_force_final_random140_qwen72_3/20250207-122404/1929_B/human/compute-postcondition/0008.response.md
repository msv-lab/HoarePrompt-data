The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the variable `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1.

State: **`t` is greater than 0 (specifically, `t` is now `t - 1`), `n` and `k` are input integers. If `k` is an even number such that when divided by 2, the result is an odd number, then the specific actions for the if part are taken. Otherwise, if `k` is odd or divisible by 4, then the specific actions for the else part are taken.**
