The provided Python code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. This action updates the values of `n` and `k` based on the input provided. The initial state specifies that `t` is greater than 0 and is now `t - 1`, and the conditions for `n` and `k` are described but not directly altered by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 (specifically, `t` is now `t - 1`), `n` and `k` are updated to the input integers.**
