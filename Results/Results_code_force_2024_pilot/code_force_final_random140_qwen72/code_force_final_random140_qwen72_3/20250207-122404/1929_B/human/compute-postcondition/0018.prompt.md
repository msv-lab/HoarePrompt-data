Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `n` and `k` are integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    if k % 2 == 0 and k // 2 % 2 == 1:
        print(k // 2 + 1)
    else:
        print(ceil(k / 2))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are input integers. If `k` is an even number such that when divided by 2, the result is an odd number, then the specific actions for the if part are taken. Otherwise, if `k` is odd or divisible by 4, then the specific actions for the else part are taken.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 0 (specifically, `t` is now `t - 1`), and `n` and `k` are updated to the input integers, regardless of whether `k` is even and its half is odd or not.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 0 (specifically, `t` is now `t - 1`), `n` is an input integer, and `k` is an input integer. If `k` is even and half of `k` is odd, then the condition is met. Otherwise, the condition is not met.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
