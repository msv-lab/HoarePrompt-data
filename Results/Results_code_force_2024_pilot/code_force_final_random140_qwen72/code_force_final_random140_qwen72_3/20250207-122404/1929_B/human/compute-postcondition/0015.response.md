Initial State: `t` is greater than 0 (specifically, `t` is now `t - 1`), `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.

Given the initial state, we know that `t` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1, but this does not affect the `print` statement directly. The `print` statement is:

```python
print(k // 2 + 1)
```

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Variable `k`**: `k` is an input integer. The exact value of `k` is not specified, but it is an integer.
2. **Expression `k // 2`**: This performs integer division of `k` by 2, which means it returns the largest integer less than or equal to the result of the division.
3. **Expression `k // 2 + 1`**: After performing the integer division, 1 is added to the result.

Therefore, the `print` statement will output the result of the expression `k // 2 + 1`.

Output: **k // 2 + 1 (where k is the input integer)**
