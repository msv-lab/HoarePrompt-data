To determine what will be printed by the `print(ceil(k / 2))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code:

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0, and it is now `t - 1`.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.

### Code:
```python
print(ceil(k / 2))
```

### Analysis:
- The `ceil` function from the `math` module rounds a number up to the nearest integer.
- The expression `k / 2` divides the integer `k` by 2.
- The `ceil` function then takes the result of `k / 2` and rounds it up to the nearest integer.

### Output:
The `print(ceil(k / 2))` statement will print the ceiling of `k / 2`.

Since `k` is an input integer, the exact value of `k` is not specified, but the output will be the smallest integer greater than or equal to `k / 2`.

Output: **ceil(k / 2) (where ceil(k / 2) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to k / 2)**
