To determine what will be printed by the `print(ceil(k / 2))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code:

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0, and it is specifically `t - 1` (this means `t` has been decremented by 1).
- `n` and `k` are updated to the input integers.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(ceil(k / 2))
```

### Analysis:
- The `ceil` function from the `math` module rounds a number up to the nearest integer.
- `k` is an integer that has been updated to an input value.
- The expression `k / 2` divides `k` by 2.
- `ceil(k / 2)` then rounds the result of this division up to the nearest integer.

### Output:
- The `print` statement will output the ceiling of `k / 2`.

Since `k` is an integer, the value of `ceil(k / 2)` will be:
- If `k` is even, `k / 2` is already an integer, so `ceil(k / 2)` will be `k / 2`.
- If `k` is odd, `k / 2` will be a float with a fractional part of 0.5, and `ceil(k / 2)` will round this up to the next integer, which is `(k // 2) + 1`.

Therefore, the output will be the smallest integer greater than or equal to `k / 2`.

Output: **ceil(k / 2) (where ceil(k / 2) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to k / 2)**
