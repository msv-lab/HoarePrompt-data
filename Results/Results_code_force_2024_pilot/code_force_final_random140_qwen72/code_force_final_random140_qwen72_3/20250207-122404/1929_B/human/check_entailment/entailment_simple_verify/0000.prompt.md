You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

Example

Input

    7
    
    3 4
    
    3 3
    
    3 10
    
    3 9
    
    4 7
    
    7 11
    
    2 3

Output

    2
    2
    6
    5
    4
    6
    2
    
Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

- Program: 
from math import ceil

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k % 2 == 0 and k // 2 % 2 == 1:
            print(k // 2 + 1)

            print(ceil(k / 2))



- Annotated Code: 
from math import ceil

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and k are integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2, representing the size of the square grid and the minimum number of diagonals that must contain at least one colored cell, respectively.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        if k % 2 == 0 and k // 2 % 2 == 1:
            print(k // 2 + 1)
        else:
            print(ceil(k / 2))
        
    #State: `t` is 0, and the loop has completed all its iterations. For each iteration, `n` and `k` were input integers. If `k` was an even number such that when divided by 2, the result was an odd number, then `k // 2 + 1` was printed. Otherwise, if `k` was odd or divisible by 4, then `ceil(k / 2)` was printed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic used to calculate the minimum number of cells to color does not account for the structure of the grid and the distribution of diagonals properly.

Consider the following test case:
- Input: `n = 3, k = 4`

According to the problem, we need to color at least 4 diagonals with at least one colored cell. The program outputs `2`, which is correct for this specific case. However, let's consider another test case:

- Input: `n = 3, k = 9`

The program outputs `5`, but the correct answer should be `6`. To cover 9 diagonals, we need to color 6 cells in a 3x3 grid. The program fails to handle this case correctly because it does not account for the fact that some diagonals may overlap, and thus, the number of cells needed to cover a certain number of diagonals is not always simply `ceil(k / 2)`.

Here is a more detailed breakdown of the issue:
- For `n = 3` and `k = 9`, the grid has 10 diagonals in total.
- To cover 9 diagonals, we need to color 6 cells, as shown in the example provided in the problem statement.
- The program's logic does not correctly account for the overlapping nature of diagonals and the minimum number of cells required to cover them.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
