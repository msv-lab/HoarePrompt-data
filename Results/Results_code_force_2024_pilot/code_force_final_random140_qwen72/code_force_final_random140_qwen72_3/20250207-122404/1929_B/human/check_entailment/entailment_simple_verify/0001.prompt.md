You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

Example

Input

    7
    
    3 4
    
    3 3
    
    3 10
    
    3 9
    
    4 7
    
    7 11
    
    2 3

Output

    2
    2
    6
    5
    4
    6
    2
    
Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and k are integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2, representing the size of the square grid and the minimum number of diagonals that must contain at least one colored cell, respectively.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        if k % 2 == 0 and k // 2 % 2 == 1:
            print(k // 2 + 1)
        else:
            print(ceil(k / 2))
        
    #State: `t` is 0, and the loop has completed all its iterations. For each iteration, `n` and `k` were input integers. If `k` was an even number such that when divided by 2, the result was an odd number, then `k // 2 + 1` was printed. Otherwise, if `k` was odd or divisible by 4, then `ceil(k / 2)` was printed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to color the minimum number of cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell.
   - A diagonal can be either a main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right) or an anti-diagonal (top-right to bottom-left).
   - There are \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals in total.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - Each cell in the grid belongs to exactly two diagonals (one main and one anti-diagonal).
   - To minimize the number of colored cells, we should try to maximize the number of diagonals covered by each colored cell.

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The function `func` reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of \( n \) and \( k \).
   - It then checks if \( k \) is even and if \( k // 2 \) is odd.
     - If both conditions are true, it prints \( k // 2 + 1 \).
     - Otherwise, it prints \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \).

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The logic of the program is based on the idea that each cell covers two diagonals.
   - If \( k \) is even and \( k // 2 \) is odd, the program adds 1 to \( k // 2 \) to ensure that the number of cells is sufficient to cover \( k \) diagonals.
   - For other cases, it simply takes the ceiling of \( k / 2 \).

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where \( k \) is greater than \( 4n - 2 \) by ensuring that the number of cells required does not exceed the total number of diagonals.
   - However, the program does not explicitly handle the case where \( k \) is greater than \( 4n - 2 \), but since the problem constraints guarantee \( 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 \), this is not an issue.

6. **Verification with Examples:**
   - For \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 4 \), the program outputs 2, which is correct.
   - For \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 3 \), the program outputs 2, which is correct.
   - For \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 10 \), the program outputs 6, which is correct.
   - For \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 9 \), the program outputs 5, which is correct.
   - For \( n = 4 \) and \( k = 7 \), the program outputs 4, which is correct.
   - For \( n = 7 \) and \( k = 11 \), the program outputs 6, which is correct.
   - For \( n = 2 \) and \( k = 3 \), the program outputs 2, which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the minimum number of cells needed to be colored to ensure at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell. The logic and edge cases are handled appropriately.
