Reasoning:  
The provided program snippet is a part of the solution but not the complete solution. The snippet demonstrates the core functionality required to solve the problem, which is to calculate the sum of the digits of a number. However, it lacks the structure to handle multiple test cases and the actual logic to sum the results for all numbers from 1 to `n`.

1. **Functionality of `func_1`**: The function `func_1` correctly computes the sum of the digits of a given integer `n`. This is essential for the problem, as it needs to replace each number with the sum of its digits.

2. **Loop and Summation**: The loop in the annotated program (`for i in range(13):`) is a simplified version that sums the results of `func_1` for numbers from 0 to 12. This is not the final solution, as it should iterate from 1 to `n` and handle multiple test cases.

3. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The problem requires handling multiple test cases, each with a different value of `n`. The provided snippet does not include the logic to read the number of test cases `t` and process each test case individually.

4. **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of the provided function `func_1` is O(d), where `d` is the number of digits in `n`. Since `n` can be as large as \(2 \times 10^5\), the overall time complexity for processing all numbers from 1 to `n` would be O(n * d). Given the time limit of 0.5 seconds, this approach might be too slow for large values of `n`.

Given these points, the provided program snippet is incomplete and does not fully address the problem requirements, particularly the handling of multiple test cases and the efficiency needed to meet the time limit.

Correctness: **False**
