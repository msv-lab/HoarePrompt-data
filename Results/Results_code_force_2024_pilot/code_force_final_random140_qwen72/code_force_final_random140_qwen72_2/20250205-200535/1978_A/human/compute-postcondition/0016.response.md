Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `ls` is a list of strings from the new user input with one less element (the last element has been removed), `last` is the integer value of the last element that was removed from the previous `ls`, `other` is the largest integer value from the sorted current `ls`.**
