Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100.
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
   - `ls` is a list of strings from user input with one less element.
   - `last` is the integer value of the last element that was removed from `ls`.
   - `other` is the largest integer value from the sorted list `ls`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(last + other)
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - `ls` is a list of strings from user input with one less element. This means `ls` initially contains `n-1` elements.
   - The last element of `ls` is removed and converted to an integer, which is stored in `last`.
   - The remaining elements in `ls` are sorted, and the largest integer value from this sorted list is stored in `other`.

4. **Determine the Values:**
   - `last` is the integer value of the last element that was removed from `ls`.
   - `other` is the largest integer value from the sorted list `ls`.

5. **Output Calculation:**
   - The `print` statement will output the sum of `last` and `other`.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the output will be the sum of the integer value of the last element removed from `ls` and the largest integer value from the sorted list `ls`.

Output: **last + other (where last is the integer value of the last element removed from ls and other is the largest integer value from the sorted list ls)**
