Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 1.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100.
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
   - `ls` is a list of strings from the new user input with one less element.
   - `last` is the integer value of the last element that was removed from the previous `ls`.
   - `other` is the largest integer value from the sorted current `ls`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(last + other)
   ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

- **`ls`**: This is a list of strings from the new user input, but it has one less element compared to some previous state. This implies that an element has been removed from `ls`.

- **`last`**: This is the integer value of the last element that was removed from the previous `ls`. Since `ls` has one less element, `last` is the value of the element that was removed.

- **`other`**: This is the largest integer value from the sorted current `ls`. After removing the last element, `ls` is sorted, and `other` is the largest value in this sorted list.

### Calculation:

- The print statement `print(last + other)` will add the integer value of the last removed element (`last`) to the largest integer value in the current `ls` (`other`).

### Final Output:

Since the exact values of `last` and `other` depend on the specific input and the state of `ls`, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **last + other (where last is the integer value of the last element removed from the previous ls, and other is the largest integer value from the sorted current ls)**
