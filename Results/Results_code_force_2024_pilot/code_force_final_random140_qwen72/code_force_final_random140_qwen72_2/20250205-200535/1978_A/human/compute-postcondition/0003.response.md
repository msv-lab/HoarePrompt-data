The code `ls = input().split()` reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings, which is then assigned to the variable `ls`. This operation does not affect the other variables mentioned in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 (updated from user input), `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `ls` is a list of strings from user input.**
