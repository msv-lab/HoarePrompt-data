The code `last = int(ls.pop())` removes the last element from the list `ls` and assigns its integer value to the variable `last`. The length of `ls` is reduced by one, and the value of `last` is updated to the integer value of the removed element.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `ls` is a list of strings from the new user input with one less element, `last` is the integer value of the last element that was removed from the previous `ls`, `other` is the largest integer value from the sorted previous `ls`.**
