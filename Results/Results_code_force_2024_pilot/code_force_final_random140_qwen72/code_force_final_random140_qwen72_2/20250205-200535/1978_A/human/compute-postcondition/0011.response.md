Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `ls` is a list of strings from the new user input with one less element, `last` is the integer value of the last element that was removed from the previous `ls`, `other` is the largest integer value from the sorted current `ls`.**

Explanation:
- The code `other = int(sorted(ls).pop())` sorts the list `ls` and then removes and returns the last (largest) element from the sorted list, converting it to an integer and assigning it to `other`.
- The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `a`, `ls`, and `last` remain unchanged.
- The new value of `other` is the largest integer value from the sorted current `ls`.
