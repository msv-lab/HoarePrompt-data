The code snippet `t = int(input().strip())` reads an input from the user, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and converts the input to an integer, which is then assigned to the variable `t`. This operation changes the value of `t` from its initial state (an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500) to the specific integer value provided by the user.

The other parts of the initial state (`n` being an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `a` being a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value provided by the user, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.**
