### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of books `n` and the list of pages `ls`.

2. **Processing the Books**:
   - The function removes the last element from the list `ls` and converts it to an integer, storing it in `last`.
   - It then sorts the remaining elements in `ls`, removes the last element (which is the largest), and converts it to an integer, storing it in `other`.

3. **Output**:
   - The function prints the sum of `last` and `other`.

### Analysis:

- **Objective**: The goal is to find the maximum total number of pages Alice can read by dividing the books into two piles and reading the book with the highest number of pages in each pile.
- **Approach**:
  - The function assumes that the last book in the list will be in one pile and the largest book in the remaining list will be in the other pile.
  - This approach is flawed because it does not consider all possible ways to divide the books into two piles. It only considers a specific division where the last book is always in one pile and the largest book in the remaining list is in the other pile.

### Counterexample:

Consider the input:
```
1
4
1 2 3 4
```

- The function will:
  - Remove the last element `4` and store it in `last`.
  - Sort the remaining list `[1, 2, 3]` and remove the largest element `3` and store it in `other`.
  - Print `4 + 3 = 7`.

However, the correct answer should be `6` (by dividing the books into piles `[1, 4]` and `[2, 3]` and reading the books with 4 and 3 pages).

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly solve the problem as it does not consider all possible ways to divide the books into two piles. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
