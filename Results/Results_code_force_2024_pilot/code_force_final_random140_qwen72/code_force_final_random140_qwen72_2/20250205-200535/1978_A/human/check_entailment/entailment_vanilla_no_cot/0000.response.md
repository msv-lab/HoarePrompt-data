Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The given solution does not correctly solve the problem. The issue lies in how the books are divided into two piles and how the maximum number of pages is calculated. According to the problem, Alice should divide the books into two non-empty piles and then read the book with the highest number of pages in each pile. The goal is to maximize the sum of the pages of these two books.

However, the provided code simply takes the last book and the second-highest book from the list and adds their page counts. This approach does not ensure that the two books selected are indeed the ones with the highest number of pages in two separate piles.

A correct approach would be to sort the list of books by the number of pages and then select the two books with the highest number of pages. Since the problem requires that the books be divided into two non-empty piles, the two largest books should be placed in different piles to maximize the total number of pages Alice reads.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input().strip())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        ls = list(map(int, input().split()))
        ls.sort(reverse=True)
        print(ls[0] + ls[1])
```

This version sorts the list in descending order and then prints the sum of the two largest elements, which correctly solves the problem.
