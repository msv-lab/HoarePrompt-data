To determine what will be printed by the `print(gap[0][0])` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant parts of the code:

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`a`**: A list of integers.
2. **`n` and `m`**: Both are greater than 0.
3. **`k`**: A list of integers obtained from input split by spaces and converted to integers.
4. **`b`**: A sorted list of integers from a new input split by spaces and converted to integers.
5. **`f`**: A sorted list of integers from the latest input split by spaces and converted to integers.
6. **`i`**: Set to `m-1`.
7. **`j`**: The index of the first element in `f` that is not less than `mid - b[m-1]`.
8. **`s`**: 
   - If `j == k`, then `s = f[j - 1] + b[m-1]`.
   - If `j < 1`, then `s = f[j] + b[m-1]`.
   - If `j >= 1`, then `s = f[j - 1] + b[m-1]`.
9. **`gap`**: A list of tuples.
10. **`start`**: The second element of the first tuple in the `gap` list.
11. **`end`**: The third element of the first tuple in the `gap` list.
12. **`mid`**: Calculated as `(start + end) // 2`.
13. **`nd`**: 
   - If the length of `gap` is 1, then `nd = 0`.
   - Otherwise, `nd` is the first element of the second tuple in the `gap` list.
14. **`remain`**: Calculated as `mid - b[m-1]`.
15. **`res`**: The minimum value found during the loop execution of the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd` for all valid `s` values within the range `start < s < end`. Initially, `res` is set to infinity (`inf`).

### Print Statement Analysis:
The statement `print(gap[0][0])` will print the first element of the first tuple in the `gap` list.

### Explanation:
- **`gap`**: This is a list of tuples. The first tuple in this list is `gap[0]`.
- **`gap[0][0]`:** This is the first element of the first tuple in the `gap` list.

Given the initial state, the exact value of `gap[0][0]` is not explicitly provided, but it is a part of the `gap` list, which is a list of tuples.

### Final Output:
Output: **gap[0][0] (where gap[0][0] is the first element of the first tuple in the `gap` list)**
