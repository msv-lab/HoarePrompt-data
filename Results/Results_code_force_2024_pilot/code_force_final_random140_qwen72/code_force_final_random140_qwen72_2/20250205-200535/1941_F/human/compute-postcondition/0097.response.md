Output State: **`s` is `f[j - 1] + b[i]`, `res` is initially set to infinity. If `start < s < end`, `res` is updated to the minimum of its current value (infinity) and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`. All other variables (`_`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `gap`, `start`, `end`, `mid`, `nd`, `i`, `remain`, `j`) remain unchanged. Additionally, `j` is greater than or equal to 1. If `s` is not between `start` and `end`, `res` remains infinity and all other variables remain unchanged.**
