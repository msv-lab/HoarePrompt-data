Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers, `n` and `m` are greater than 0, `k` are assigned the values from the input split by spaces, converted to integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers from the new input split by spaces, converted to integers, `f` is a sorted list of integers from the latest input split by spaces, converted to integers, `i` is 1, `j` is the index of the first element in `f` that is not less than `remain`, `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[i]`, `_`, `t`, `gap`, `start` is set to the second element of the first tuple in the `gap` list, `end` is set to the third element of the first tuple in the `gap` list, `mid` is set to `(start + end) // 2`, `nd` is 0 if the length of `gap` is 1, otherwise `nd` is the first element of the second tuple in the `gap` list, `remain` is updated to `mid - b[1]`, `res` remains unchanged unless `start < s < end`, in which case `res` is updated to the minimum of `res` and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`.***
