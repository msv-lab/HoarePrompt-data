Postcondition: ***`j` is the index of the first element in `f` that is not less than `mid - b[x + 2]`, `i` is `x + 2`, `m` is greater than `x + 2`, `remain` is `mid - b[x + 2]`. If `j == k`, `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[i]`, and if `start < s < end`, `res` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`. If `j != k` and `j >= 1`, `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[i]`, and if `start < s < end`, `res` is updated to the minimum of the previous `res` and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`. If `j != k` and `j < 1`, `s` is `f[j] + b[i]`, and if `start < s < end`, `res` is updated to the minimum of the previous `res` and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`. If `s` is not within the range `start < s < end`, `res` remains unchanged. All other variables (`_`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `gap`, `start`, `end`, `mid`, `nd`) remain unchanged.***
