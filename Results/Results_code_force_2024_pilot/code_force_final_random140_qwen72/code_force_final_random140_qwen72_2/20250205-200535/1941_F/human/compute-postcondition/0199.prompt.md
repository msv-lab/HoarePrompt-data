Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list of integers, `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values from the input split by spaces, converted to integers. `b` is a sorted list of integers from the new input split by spaces, converted to integers. `f` is a sorted list of integers from the latest input split by spaces, converted to integers. `res` is set to `inf`. `i` remains unchanged, `j` remains unchanged, `remain` remains unchanged, `s` remains unchanged, `_`, `t`, `gap`, `start` is set to the second element of the first tuple in the sorted `gap` list, `end` is set to the third element of the first tuple in the `gap` list, `mid` is set to `(start + end) // 2`, `nd` is 0 if the length of `gap` is 1, otherwise `nd` is the first element of the second tuple in the `gap` list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(m):
    remain = mid - b[i]
    j = bisect.bisect_left(f, remain)
    if j == k:
        s = f[j - 1] + b[i]
        if start < s < end:
            res = min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))
    else:
        s = f[j] + b[i]
        if start < s < end:
            res = min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))
        if j >= 1:
            s = f[j - 1] + b[i]
            if start < s < end:
                res = min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a list of integers, `n` and `m` are greater than 0, `k` are assigned the values from the input split by spaces, converted to integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers from the new input split by spaces, converted to integers, `f` is a sorted list of integers from the latest input split by spaces, converted to integers, `i` is 0, `j` is the index of the first element in `f` that is not less than `mid - b[0]`, `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[i]` if `j` is equal to `k`, otherwise `s` is `f[j] + b[i]` if `j` is greater than or equal to 1, otherwise `s` remains unchanged. `_`, `t`, `gap`, `start` is set to the second element of the first tuple in the `gap` list, `end` is set to the third element of the first tuple in the `gap` list, `mid` is set to `(start + end) // 2`, `nd` is 0 if the length of `gap` is 1, otherwise `nd` is the first element of the second tuple in the `gap` list, `remain` is set to `mid - b[0]`. If `j` is equal to `k` and `start < s < end`, `res` is the minimum of the previous `res` and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`. If `j` is not equal to `k` and `j` is greater than or equal to 1 and `start < s < end`, `res` is set to the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a list of integers, `n` and `m` are greater than 0, `k` are assigned the values from the input split by spaces, converted to integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers from the new input split by spaces, converted to integers, `f` is a sorted list of integers from the latest input split by spaces, converted to integers, `i` is 1, `j` is the index of the first element in `f` that is not less than `remain`. If `j == k`, `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[i]`. If `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[i]`. Otherwise, `s` remains unchanged. `gap` is a list of tuples, `start` is the second element of the first tuple in the `gap` list, `end` is the third element of the first tuple in the `gap` list, `mid` is `(start + end) // 2`, `nd` is 0 if the length of `gap` is 1, otherwise `nd` is the first element of the second tuple in the `gap` list, `remain` is `mid - b[1]`. If `start < s < end`, `res` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`a` is a list of integers, `n` and `m` are greater than 0, `k` are assigned the values from the input split by spaces, converted to integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers from the new input split by spaces, converted to integers, `f` is a sorted list of integers from the latest input split by spaces, converted to integers, `i` is 2, `j` is the index of the first element in `f` that is not less than `remain`, `s` is either `f[j - 1] + b[2]` if `j == k` or `f[j] + b[2]` if `j < 1` or `f[j - 1] + b[2]` if `j >= 1`, `gap` is a list of tuples, `start` is the second element of the first tuple in the `gap` list, `end` is the third element of the first tuple in the `gap` list, `mid` is `(start + end) // 2`, `nd` is 0 if the length of `gap` is 1, otherwise `nd` is the first element of the second tuple in the `gap` list, `remain` is `mid - b[2]`, `m` must be greater than 2. If `start < s < end`, `res` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
