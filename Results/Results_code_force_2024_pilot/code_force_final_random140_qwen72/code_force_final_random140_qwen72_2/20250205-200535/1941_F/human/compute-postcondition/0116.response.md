Postcondition: ***`res` is the value determined by the conditions described in the task, `i` is `x + 1`, `m` is greater than `x + 1`, `remain` is `mid - b[x + 1]`, `j` is the index of the first element in `f` that is not less than `remain`, and `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[i]`. If `j == k` and `start < s < end`, `res` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`. If `j != k` and `j >= 1` and `start < s < end`, `res` is updated to the minimum of its original value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`. If `j != k` and either `j < 1` or `s` is not within the range `start < s < end`, none of the variables are modified. All other variables (`_`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `gap`, `start`, `end`, `mid`, `nd`) remain unchanged.***
