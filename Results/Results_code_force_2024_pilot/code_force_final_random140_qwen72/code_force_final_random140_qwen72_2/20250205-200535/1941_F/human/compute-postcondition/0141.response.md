Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values from the input split by spaces, converted to integers. `b` is a list of integers from the new input split by spaces, converted to integers. `f` is a list of integers from the latest input split by spaces, converted to integers. `res` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, `j` remains unchanged, `remain` remains unchanged, `s` remains unchanged, `_`, `t`, `gap`, `start`, `end`, `mid`, `nd` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `f = [*map(int, input().split())]` reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, converts each part to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `f`. All other variables retain their previous values or states.
