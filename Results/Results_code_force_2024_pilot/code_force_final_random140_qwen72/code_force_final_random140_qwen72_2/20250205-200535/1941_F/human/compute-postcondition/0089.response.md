Output State: **`res` is updated to the minimum value between its original value (infinity) and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`. All other variables remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The value of `res` is updated to the minimum of its current value (which is infinity) and the maximum of three values: `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`.
- Since `res` was initially set to infinity, the new value of `res` will be the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`.
- All other variables (`_`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `gap`, `start`, `end`, `mid`, `nd`, `i`, `remain`, `j`, `s`) remain unchanged.
