Output State: **`_` is 0, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `b` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `f` is a list of integers from the input, `gap` is a list of tuples sorted in descending order by the first element of each tuple, `start` is the second element of the first tuple in `gap`, `end` is the third element of the first tuple in `gap`, `mid` is (start + end) // 2, `nd` is 0 if the length of `gap` is 1, otherwise `nd` is the first element of the second tuple in `gap`.**

Explanation:
- The `b.sort()` function sorts the list `b` in ascending order.
- All other variables (`_`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `f`, `gap`, `start`, `end`, `mid`, `nd`) remain unchanged.
- The list `b` is now sorted, which affects its order but not its content or length.
