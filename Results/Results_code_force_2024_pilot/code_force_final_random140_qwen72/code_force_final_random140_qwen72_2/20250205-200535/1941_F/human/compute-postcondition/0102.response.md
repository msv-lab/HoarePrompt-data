Postcondition: ***`res` is initially set to infinity. After the if-else block, if `j == k` and `start < s < end`, `res` is updated to the minimum value between its original value (infinity) and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`. If `j` is not equal to `k`, and `j` is greater than or equal to 1, and `start < s < end` where `s = f[j - 1] + b[i]`, `res` is updated to the minimum of its current value (initially infinity) and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`. In all other cases, `res` remains at its initial value (infinity). All other variables (`_`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `gap`, `start`, `end`, `mid`, `nd`, `i`, `remain`, `j`, `s`) remain unchanged.***
