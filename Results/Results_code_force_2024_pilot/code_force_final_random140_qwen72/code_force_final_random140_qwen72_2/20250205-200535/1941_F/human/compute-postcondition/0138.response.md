Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values from the input split by spaces, converted to integers. `res` will be the minimum value found among all iterations based on the conditions specified in the loop. If `res` was initially `inf`, it remains `inf` if no valid `s` was found; otherwise, it is updated to the minimum valid value. If `res` was not `inf`, it retains its updated value from the loop. `i` will be equal to `m`, indicating the loop has completed all iterations. `j` will be the last computed index of the first element in `f` that is not less than `mid - b[m-1]`. `remain` will be the last computed value of `mid - b[m-1]`, and `s` will be the last computed value of `f[j - 1] + b[i]` or `f[j] + b[i]` depending on the conditions. All other variables (`_`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `gap`, `start`, `end`, `mid`, `nd`) will remain unchanged.**
