Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers, `n` and `m` are greater than 0, `k` are assigned the values from the input split by spaces, converted to integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers from the new input split by spaces, converted to integers, `f` is a sorted list of integers from the latest input split by spaces, converted to integers, `i` is 1, `j` is the index of the first element in `f` that is not less than `remain`, `s` is `f[j] + b[i]` if `j` is greater than or equal to 1, otherwise `s` remains unchanged, `gap` is a list of tuples, `start` is the second element of the first tuple in the `gap` list, `end` is the third element of the first tuple in the `gap` list, `mid` is `(start + end) // 2`, `nd` is 0 if the length of `gap` is 1, otherwise `nd` is the first element of the second tuple in the `gap` list, `remain` is `mid - b[1]`, and `res` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd` if `start < s < end`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.***
