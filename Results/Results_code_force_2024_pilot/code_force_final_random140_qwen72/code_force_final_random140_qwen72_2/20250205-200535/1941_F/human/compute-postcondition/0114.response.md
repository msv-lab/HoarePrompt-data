Postcondition: ***If `start < s < end`, `res` is updated to the minimum of its original value and the maximum of `(end - s)`, `(s - start)`, and `nd`; `i` is `x + 1`; `m` is greater than `x + 1`; `remain` is `mid - b[x + 1]`; `j` is the index of the first element in `f` that is not less than `remain`; `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[i]`. All other variables (`_`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `gap`, `start`, `end`, `mid`, `nd`) remain unchanged. If `s` is not within the range `start < s < end`, none of the variables are modified.***
