Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers, `n` and `m` are greater than 0, `k` are assigned the values from the input split by spaces, converted to integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers from the new input split by spaces, converted to integers, `f` is a sorted list of integers from the latest input split by spaces, converted to integers, `i` is 2, `j` is the index of the first element in `f` that is not less than `remain`, `s` is either `f[j] + b[2]` if `j < 1` or `f[j - 1] + b[2]` if `j >= 1`, `gap` is a list of tuples, `start` is the second element of the first tuple in the `gap` list, `end` is the third element of the first tuple in the `gap` list, `mid` is `(start + end) // 2`, `nd` is 0 if the length of `gap` is 1, otherwise `nd` is the first element of the second tuple in the `gap` list, `remain` is `mid - b[2]`, `m` must be greater than 2. If `start < s < end`, `res` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.***
