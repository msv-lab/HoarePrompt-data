Output State: **`_` is 0, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `b` is a list of integers from the input, `f` is a list of integers from the input, `gap` is a list of tuples where each tuple is `(y - x, x, y)` for consecutive elements `x` and `y` in `a`.**

Explanation: The code creates a new list `gap` using a list comprehension. Each element in `gap` is a tuple `(y - x, x, y)` where `x` and `y` are consecutive elements from the list `a`. The values of `_`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, and `f` remain unchanged.
