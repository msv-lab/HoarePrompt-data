Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n, m, and k are integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ m, k ≤ 2 × 10^5; a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 2 × 10^9 and a_i < a_{i+1}; d is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ d_i ≤ 10^9; f is a list of k integers where 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m, k = [*map(int, input().split())]
    a = [*map(int, input().split())]
    b = [*map(int, input().split())]
    f = [*map(int, input().split())]
    gap = [(y - x, x, y) for y, x in zip(a[1:], a)]
    gap.sort(reverse=True)
    start = gap[0][1]
    end = gap[0][2]
    mid = (start + end) // 2
    nd = 0 if len(gap) == 1 else gap[1][0]
    b.sort()
    f.sort()
    res = inf
    for i in range(m):
        remain = mid - b[i]
        j = bisect.bisect_left(f, remain)
        if j == k:
            s = f[j - 1] + b[i]
            if start < s < end:
                res = min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))
        else:
            s = f[j] + b[i]
            if start < s < end:
                res = min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))
            if j >= 1:
                s = f[j - 1] + b[i]
                if start < s < end:
                    res = min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))
    if res == inf:
        print(gap[0][0])
    else:
        print(res)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: _ is 0, t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n and m are integers greater than 0, k are integers from the input, a is a list of integers from the input, b is a sorted list of integers from the input, f is a sorted list of integers from the input, gap is a list of tuples sorted in descending order by the first element of each tuple, start is the second element of the first tuple in gap, end is the third element of the first tuple in gap, mid is (start + end) // 2, nd is 0 if the length of gap is 1, otherwise nd is the first element of the second tuple in gap, i is m-1, and res is the minimum value found during the loop execution of the maximum of end - s, s - start, and nd for all valid s values within the range (start, end). If res was initially infinity (inf), it has been updated to a finite value.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the loop has completed all its iterations, `res` will be the minimum value found among all iterations based on the conditions specified in the loop. Specifically, for each iteration, `res` is updated if `s` (calculated as `f[j - 1] + b[i]` or `f[j] + b[i]` depending on the conditions) falls within the range `start < s < end` and is the minimum of its current value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`. The variable `i` will be equal to `m` (indicating the loop has completed all iterations), and `j` will be the last computed index of the first element in `f` that is not less than `mid - b[m-1]`. The variable `remain` will be the last computed value of `mid - b[m-1]`, and `s` will be the last computed value of `f[j - 1] + b[i]` or `f[j] + b[i]` depending on the conditions. All other variables (`_`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `gap`, `start`, `end`, `mid`, `nd`) will remain unchanged. If `res` was initially `inf`, it remains `inf` if no valid `s` was found; otherwise, it is updated to the minimum valid value. If `res` was not `inf`, it retains its updated value from the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *After all iterations of the loop, `a` remains a list of integers, `n` and `m` are greater than 0, `k` are assigned the values from the input split by spaces, converted to integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers from the new input split by spaces, converted to integers, `f` is a sorted list of integers from the latest input split by spaces, converted to integers, `i` is `m-1`, `j` is the index of the first element in `f` that is not less than `mid - b[m-1]`, `s` is either `f[j - 1] + b[m-1]` if `j == k` or `f[j] + b[m-1]` if `j < 1` or `f[j - 1] + b[m-1]` if `j >= 1`, `gap` is a list of tuples, `start` is the second element of the first tuple in the `gap` list, `end` is the third element of the first tuple in the `gap` list, `mid` is `(start + end) // 2`, `nd` is 0 if the length of `gap` is 1, otherwise `nd` is the first element of the second tuple in the `gap` list, `remain` is `mid - b[m-1]`, `res` is the minimum value found during the loop execution of the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd` for all valid `s` values within the range `start < s < end`. If `res` is equal to infinity (`inf`), the function behaves as described under the if part. Otherwise, if `res` is not equal to infinity (`inf`), the function behaves as described under the else part.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
