You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Rudolf has prepared a set of n problems with complexities a_1 < a_2 < a_3 <
\dots < a_n . He is not entirely satisfied with the balance, so he wants to
add at most one problem to fix it.

For this, Rudolf came up with m models of problems and k functions. The
complexity of the i -th model is d_i , and the complexity of the j -th
function is f_j . To create a problem, he selects values i and j (1 \le i \le
m , 1 \le j \le k ) and by combining the i -th model with the j -th function,
he obtains a new problem with complexity d_i + f_j (a new element is inserted
into the array a ).

To determine the imbalance of the set, Rudolf sorts the complexities of the
problems in ascending order and finds the largest value of a_i - a_{i - 1} (i
> 1 ).

What is the minimum value of imbalance that Rudolf can achieve by adding at
most one problem, created according to the described rules?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of testcases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (2 \le
n \le 10^5 , 1 \le m, k \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of prepared problems,
the number of models, and the number of functions, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots a_n
(1 \le a_i \le 2 \cdot 10^9 , a_i < a_{i+1} ) — the complexities of the
prepared problems.

The third line of each test case contains m integers d_1, d_2, d_3, \dots d_m
(1 \le d_i \le 10^9 ) — the complexities of the models.

The fourth line of each test case contains k integers f_1, f_2, f_3, \dots f_k
(1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ) — the complexities of the functions.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of m over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of k over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each testcase, output a single number — the minimum imbalance that Rudolf
can achieve.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
