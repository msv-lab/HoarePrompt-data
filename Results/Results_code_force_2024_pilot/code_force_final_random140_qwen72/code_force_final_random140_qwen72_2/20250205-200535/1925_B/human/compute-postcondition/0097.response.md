Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is a non-negative integer, `n` is an input integer, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n` (i.e., `k = x // n`), `i` is `int(x ** 0.5) + 2`, `ans` is the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`, and `l` is the list of divisors considered during the loop execution.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.
- For each `i`, if `x % i == 0`, it checks if `i` and `x // i` are less than or equal to `k`.
- It updates `ans` to the maximum value among `ans`, `i`, and `x // i` if they are valid divisors.
- After the loop completes, `i` will be `int(x ** 0.5) + 2` because the loop runs until `i` reaches `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` and then increments `i` one more time.
- `ans` will hold the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`.
- `l` is a temporary list used within the loop to store potential divisors, but it is not retained outside the loop. Therefore, its final state is not relevant to the output state.
