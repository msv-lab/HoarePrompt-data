Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an input integer that must be at least 0, `n` is an input integer, `k = x // n`, `i` is 3, and `l` is a list. If `x % 3 == 0` and `i > k`, then `l` contains `[ans]` and `ans` is `1`. If `x % 3 == 0` and `i <= k`, then `l` contains `[ans, 3]` and `ans` is the maximum of the elements in `l`. If `x % 3 != 0`, `l` remains an empty list and `ans` remains `1`.***
