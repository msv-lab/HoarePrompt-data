Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^8, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= x, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`, `i` is 3, `ans` is `x // 2` if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 2, and `l` is `[ans, 3]` if `i` is less than or equal to `k`. Otherwise, `l` is `[ans]`.***
