Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an input integer that must be at least 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n` (i.e., `k = x // n`), `ans` is 1, `i` is 1, `x % i` is 0, `l` is a list containing `[1, 1]`, and `i` is less than or equal to `k`.**

Explanation: The code appends the current value of `i` (which is 1) to the list `l`. Initially, `l` contains `[1]`, so after appending `i`, the list `l` becomes `[1, 1]`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
