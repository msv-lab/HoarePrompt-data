The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder to iterate over the range specified by `int(input())`. The value of `t` is a positive integer that determines the number of iterations, but it is not directly modified within the loop head. Since the loop is iterating a fixed number of times based on the input, no variables in the loop head need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time. The loop will execute as many times as specified by the input.

Therefore, the state remains unchanged except for the implicit increment of the loop counter, which is not explicitly represented in the state.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n` (i.e., `k = x // n`), `ans` is the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`, `i` is the integer part of the square root of `x` plus 1.**
