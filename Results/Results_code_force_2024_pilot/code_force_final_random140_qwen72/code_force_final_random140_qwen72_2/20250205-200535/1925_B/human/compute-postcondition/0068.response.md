Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n` (i.e., `k = x // n`), `ans` is the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`, `i` is the integer part of the square root of `x` plus 1.** 

Explanation:
- The value of `k` is updated to the integer division of `x` by `n`.
- The values of `t`, `x`, `n`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state.
