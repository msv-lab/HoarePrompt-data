Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is a non-negative integer, `n` is an input integer, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n` (i.e., `k = x // n`), `ans` is `x` if `x // i <= k` is true, otherwise `ans` is `1`, `i` is 1, and `l` is `[1, 1, x]` if `x // i <= k` is true, otherwise `l` is `[1, 1]`. If `x % i` is 0, these conditions apply; otherwise, `ans` remains 1 and `l` remains `[1, 1]`.***
