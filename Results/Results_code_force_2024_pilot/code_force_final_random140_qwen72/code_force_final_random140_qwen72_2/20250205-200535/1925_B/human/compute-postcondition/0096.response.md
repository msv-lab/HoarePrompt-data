Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is a non-negative integer, `n` is an input integer, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n` (i.e., `k = x // n`), `i` is 3. If `x % 3 == 0`, then `ans` is the maximum of `ans`, `3`, and `x // 3` if `i` is less than or equal to `k`, or the maximum of `ans` and `x // 3` otherwise.***
