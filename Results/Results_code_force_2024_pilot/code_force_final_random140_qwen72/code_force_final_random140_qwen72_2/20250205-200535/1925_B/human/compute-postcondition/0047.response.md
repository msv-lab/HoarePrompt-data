Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an input integer that must be at least 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n` (i.e., `k = x // n`), `ans` is 1, `i` is 1. If `x % i` is 0, `ans` is the maximum value in `l`, where `l` is `[1, 1, x // i]` if `x // i <= k` or `[1, 1]` otherwise.***
