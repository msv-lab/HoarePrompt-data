To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
   - `x` is an input integer.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n` (i.e., \( k = x // n \)).
   - `ans` is the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`.
   - `i` is the integer part of the square root of `x` plus 1 (i.e., \( i = \lfloor \sqrt{x} \rfloor + 1 \)).

2. **Determine the Value of `k`:**
   - `k` is calculated as \( k = x // n \). This means `k` is the largest integer such that \( k \times n \leq x \).

3. **Determine the Value of `ans`:**
   - `ans` is the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`.
   - To find `ans`, we need to check all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to `k` and select the largest one.

4. **Determine the Value of `i`:**
   - `i` is the integer part of the square root of `x` plus 1 (i.e., \( i = \lfloor \sqrt{x} \rfloor + 1 \)).
   - This value is used to limit the range of potential divisors of `x` to check, but it does not directly affect the value of `ans`.

5. **Finding `ans`:**
   - We need to iterate from `k` down to 1 and check if each number is a divisor of `x`.
   - The first number found that divides `x` without a remainder will be `ans`.

Given the above steps, the value of `ans` will be the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`.

**Output:**
Output: **ans (where ans is the largest divisor of x that is less than or equal to k)**
