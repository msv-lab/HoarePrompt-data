Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is a non-negative integer, `n` is an input integer, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n` (i.e., `k = x // n`), `ans` is 1, `i` is 1, `x % i` is 0, `l` is a list containing `[1, 1]`. Additionally, the current value of `i` is less than or equal to `k`.** 

Explanation: The code appends the value of `i` (which is 1) to the list `l`. Initially, `l` contained `[1]`, and after appending `i`, `l` now contains `[1, 1]`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
