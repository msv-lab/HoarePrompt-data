The value of `i` which is 3 is appended to the list `l`. The list `l` initially contains `[ans]`, so after appending `i`, the list `l` will contain `[ans, 3]`. The values of `t`, `x`, `n`, `k`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an input integer that must be at least 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n` (i.e., `k = x // n`), `i` is 3, `l` is a list containing `[ans, 3]`, and `ans` is 1 if `x % 2 != 0` or `x // 2 > k`, otherwise `ans` is `x // 2`.**
