Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is a non-negative integer, `n` is an input integer, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n` (i.e., `k = x // n`), `i` is 2. If `x % i == 0`, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, and `l` is `[ans, x // 2]` if `i > k`, otherwise `l` is `[ans, 2, x // 2]`. If `x % i != 0`, `ans` remains 1 and `l` remains `[1, 1]`.***
