Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is a non-negative integer, `n` is an input integer, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n` (i.e., `k = x // n`), `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, `i` is 2, and `l` is `[ans, x // 2]` if `i > k`, otherwise `l` is `[ans, 2, x // 2]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated to the maximum value in the list `l`.
- The list `l` remains unchanged from its initial state, which depends on whether `i > k`.
- All other variables (`t`, `x`, `n`, `k`, `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
