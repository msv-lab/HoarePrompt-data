To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and the expression `int(x ** 0.5) + 2`.

1. **Variable `i`:** The loop variable `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` must be greater than or equal to 1.

2. **Expression `int(x ** 0.5) + 2`:** This expression determines the upper bound of the loop. For the loop to execute at least once, `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` must be greater than or equal to 1, which simplifies to `int(x ** 0.5) >= 0`. Since `x` is an input integer, and `int(x ** 0.5)` is always non-negative for any non-negative `x`, this condition is always satisfied.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3
- `x` is an input integer
- `n` is an input integer
- `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n` (i.e., `k = x // n`)
- `ans` is 1
- `i` is `x`

We need to adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute. The loop will execute if `x` is at least 0, because `int(x ** 0.5)` will be at least 0, making `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` at least 1.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an input integer that must be at least 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n` (i.e., `k = x // n`), `ans` is 1, `i` is 1**
