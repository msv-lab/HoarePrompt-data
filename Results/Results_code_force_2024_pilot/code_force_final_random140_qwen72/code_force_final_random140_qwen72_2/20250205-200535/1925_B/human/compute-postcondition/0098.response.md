Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `x` is a non-negative integer.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n` (i.e., `k = x // n`).
- `i` is `int(x)`. This is redundant because `x` is already a non-negative integer, so `int(x)` is just `x`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(ans)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `ans` is not defined in the initial state or in the code snippet provided. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of `ans` based on the given information.
- Since `ans` is not defined, attempting to print it will result in a `NameError`.

### Conclusion:
Given that `ans` is not defined, the code will raise a `NameError` when executed. However, if we assume that `ans` is supposed to be a variable that is defined elsewhere in the code, we cannot determine its value from the provided information.

### Final Output:
Output: **NameError (since `ans` is not defined)**

If you have additional context or if `ans` is defined elsewhere in the code, please provide that information so I can give a more precise answer.
