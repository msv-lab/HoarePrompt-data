Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `k` is the integer division of the new `x` by the new `n` (i.e., `k = x // n`), `ans` is the largest divisor of the new `x` that is less than or equal to `k`, `i` is the integer part of the square root of the new `x` plus 1.**

Explanation:
- The values of `t`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The values of `x` and `n` are updated to the integers provided by the user input.
- `k` is recalculated as the integer division of the new `x` by the new `n`.
- `ans` remains the largest divisor of the new `x` that is less than or equal to the new `k`.
- `i` remains the integer part of the square root of the new `x` plus 1.
