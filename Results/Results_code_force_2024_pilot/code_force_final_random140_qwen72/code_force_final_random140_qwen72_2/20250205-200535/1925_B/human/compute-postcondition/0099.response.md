Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is a positive integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^8, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= x, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n` (i.e., `k = x // n`), `ans` is the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`, `i` is the integer part of the square root of `x` plus 1.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: The variable `t` remains a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^3, as it is the number of test cases and is not modified within the loop.
- **`x` and `n`**: For each iteration of the outer loop, `x` and `n` are read from the input. Each pair `(x, n)` is processed independently, and `x` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^8, while `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to `x`.
- **`k`**: `k` is calculated as the integer division of `x` by `n` (i.e., `k = x // n`). This value is specific to each test case.
- **`ans`**: After processing the inner loop, `ans` is set to the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`. This value is specific to each test case.
- **`i`**: The variable `i` is used in the inner loop to iterate from 1 to the integer part of the square root of `x` plus 1. After the inner loop completes, `i` will be the integer part of the square root of `x` plus 1.

This output state reflects the final state of the variables after all iterations of the loop have completed, with each test case being processed independently.
