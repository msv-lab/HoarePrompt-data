Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is a non-negative integer, `n` is an input integer, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n` (i.e., `k = x // n`), `i` is 3, and `l` is a list. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` contains two elements `[ans, 3]`. Otherwise, `l` contains a single element `ans`.***
