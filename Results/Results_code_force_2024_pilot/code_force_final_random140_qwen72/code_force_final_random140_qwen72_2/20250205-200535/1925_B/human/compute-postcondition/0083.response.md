The code `l.append(i)` adds the value of `i` to the list `l`. Given that `i` is 2 and `l` initially contains `[ans]`, after executing the code, `l` will contain `[ans, 2]`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is a non-negative integer, `n` is an input integer, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n` (i.e., `k = x // n`), `ans` is `x` if `x // i <= k` is true, otherwise `ans` is `1`, `i` is 2, and `l` is `[ans, 2]`.**
