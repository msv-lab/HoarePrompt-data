You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (x, n) = map(int, input().split())
        k = x // n
        ans = 1
        for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 2):
            if x % i == 0:
                l = [ans]
                if i <= k:
                    l.append(i)
                if x // i <= k:
                    l.append(x // i)
                ans = max(l)
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `n`. It then calculates the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to the integer division of `x` by `n` (`x // n`). This largest divisor is printed for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After the function concludes, `t` remains a positive integer between 1 and 10^3, `x` and `n` are positive integers within their respective ranges, and the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `x // n` has been printed for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program attempts to find the maximum GCD of the sub-problems' difficulties, but it has a logical flaw in how it determines the maximum balance. Specifically, the program iterates over potential divisors of `x` and checks if they are less than or equal to `k` (which is `x // n`). However, this approach does not always yield the correct maximum GCD.

A counterexample is when `x = 10` and `n = 4`. The correct answer should be `2` because the sub-problems can be divided as `[2, 2, 2, 4]`, which gives a GCD of `2`. However, the program will output `1` because it does not correctly handle the case where the divisor is greater than `k`.

Here is a more detailed breakdown of the issue:
- For `x = 10` and `n = 4`, the program calculates `k = 10 // 4 = 2`.
- It then iterates over potential divisors of `10` (i.e., `1, 2, 5, 10`).
- It checks if these divisors are less than or equal to `k` (which is `2`).
- The only valid divisors are `1` and `2`.
- The program then prints `2` as the maximum balance, but it does not consider the possibility of using `5` as a divisor, which would also be valid since `10 // 5 = 2` and `2 <= 2`.

To fix this, the program should consider all divisors of `x` and check if they can be used to form `n` sub-problems with the required sum. The correct approach would involve finding the greatest common divisor of `x` and `n` and ensuring that the sum of the sub-problems equals `x`.
