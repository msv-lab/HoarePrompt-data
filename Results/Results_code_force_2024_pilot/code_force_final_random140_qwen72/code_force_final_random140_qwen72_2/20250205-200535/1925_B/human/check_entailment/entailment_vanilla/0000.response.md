### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the maximum GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of a set of `n` positive integers whose sum is `x`.
   - The GCD of the set should be maximized.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - The GCD of the set of numbers must divide `x` because the sum of the numbers is `x`.
   - Therefore, the GCD must be a divisor of `x`.

3. **Algorithm Explanation**:
   - The program iterates over all divisors of `x` up to the square root of `x` to find the maximum possible GCD.
   - For each divisor `i` of `x`, it checks if `i` can be a valid GCD by ensuring that `i` is less than or equal to `k = x // n`.
   - Similarly, it checks if `x // i` can be a valid GCD.
   - It keeps track of the maximum valid GCD found.

4. **Code Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `x` and `n`.
   - It calculates `k = x // n`, which is the maximum possible value for any sub-problem difficulty.
   - It initializes `ans` to 1, which is the smallest possible GCD.
   - It iterates over all potential divisors `i` of `x` up to the square root of `x`.
   - For each divisor `i`, it checks if `i` and `x // i` are valid GCDs by comparing them to `k`.
   - It updates `ans` to the maximum valid GCD found.
   - Finally, it prints the maximum GCD for each test case.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `n = 1` correctly, as the GCD of a single number is the number itself.
   - It also handles the case where `x` is a prime number, where the only valid GCD is 1.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum GCD of a set of `n` positive integers whose sum is `x`. The approach is efficient and handles all edge cases correctly.

### Correctness:
**True**
