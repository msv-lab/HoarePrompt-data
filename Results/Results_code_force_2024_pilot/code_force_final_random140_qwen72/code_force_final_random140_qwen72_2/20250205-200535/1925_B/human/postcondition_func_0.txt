The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `n`. It then calculates the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to the integer division of `x` by `n` (`x // n`). This largest divisor is printed for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After the function concludes, `t` remains a positive integer between 1 and 10^3, `x` and `n` are positive integers within their respective ranges, and the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `x // n` has been printed for each test case.
