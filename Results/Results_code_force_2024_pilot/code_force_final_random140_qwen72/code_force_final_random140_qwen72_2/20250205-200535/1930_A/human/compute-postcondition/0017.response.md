The function `func` does not explicitly define its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the context, it seems to process multiple test cases. Each test case involves an integer `n` and a list of `2n` integers. The function's purpose is to handle these inputs according to the specified constraints and produce an appropriate output for each test case.

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50.
- A list of `2n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n}` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7, representing the numbers written on the whiteboard.

The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case. However, the specific output is not detailed in the provided information. Assuming the function returns some form of processed data based on the input list, the functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `2n` integers. It processes each test case and returns a result for each one.**
