Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `2n` integers. It then calculates the sum of the elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) of the list and prints this sum. After processing all test cases, the function terminates with `t` set to 0, and `n` and `A` being undefined as they are redefined for each test case. **
