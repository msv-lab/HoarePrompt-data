Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is undefined (as it is redefined for each iteration), and `A` is undefined (as it is redefined for each iteration).** 

This means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `t` will be 0 because it is decremented by 1 with each iteration until it reaches 0, which causes the loop to terminate. The variables `n` and `A` are redefined in each iteration of the loop, so they do not retain any specific value after the loop finishes; they are effectively undefined outside the context of the loop.
