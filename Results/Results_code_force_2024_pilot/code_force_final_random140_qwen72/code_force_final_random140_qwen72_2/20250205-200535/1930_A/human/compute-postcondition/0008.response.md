The code snippet `A = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `A`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 4999
- `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50
- `A` is a list of 2n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7
- `n` is now the new input integer

After executing the code:
- `A` is updated to a list of integers read from the input.
- The length of `A` will be 2n, where `n` is the new input integer.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 4999, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `A` is a list of 2n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7, and `n` is now the new input integer.**
