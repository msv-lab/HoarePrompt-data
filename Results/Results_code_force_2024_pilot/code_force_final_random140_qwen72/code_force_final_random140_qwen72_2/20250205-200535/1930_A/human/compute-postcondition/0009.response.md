Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 4999.
- `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50.
- `A` is a list of 2n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.
- `n` is now the new input integer.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(sum(A[::2]))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **List `A`**: 
   - `A` is a list of 2n integers, where each integer \( a_i \) satisfies 1 ≤ \( a_i \) ≤ 10^7.
   - The length of `A` is 2n, meaning it contains an even number of elements.

2. **Slicing `A[::2]`**:
   - The slice `A[::2]` selects every second element from the list `A`, starting from the first element (index 0).
   - For example, if `A = [a1, a2, a3, a4, ..., a(2n-1), a(2n)]`, then `A[::2]` will be `[a1, a3, a5, ..., a(2n-1)]`.

3. **Summing the Sliced List**:
   - The `sum(A[::2])` function calculates the sum of the elements in the sliced list.
   - This means it sums up all the elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ..., 2n-2).

### Final Output:
The `print(sum(A[::2]))` statement will print the sum of the elements at even indices in the list `A`.

Since the exact values of the elements in `A` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of the sum. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the sum of the elements at even indices in the list `A`.

Output: **sum of elements at even indices in the list A (where A is a list of 2n integers, and the sum is the total of elements at indices 0, 2, 4, ..., 2n-2)**
