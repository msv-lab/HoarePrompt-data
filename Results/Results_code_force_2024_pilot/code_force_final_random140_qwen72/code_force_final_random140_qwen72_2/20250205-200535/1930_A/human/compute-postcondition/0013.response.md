The code snippet reads a line of input and splits it into individual strings, which are then converted to integers and stored in the list `A`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 4998, `n` is a new input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `A` is a list of 2n integers where each integer is read from the input and converted to an integer.**
