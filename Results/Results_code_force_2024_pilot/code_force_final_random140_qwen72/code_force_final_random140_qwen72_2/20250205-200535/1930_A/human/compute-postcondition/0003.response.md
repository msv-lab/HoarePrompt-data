The code `A = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into parts based on spaces, converts each part to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `A`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000
- `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50
- A list of 2n integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n}` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7

After executing the code, the list `A` will contain the 2n integers read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `A` is a list of 2n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.**
