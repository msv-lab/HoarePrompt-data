Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 4998, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `A` is a list of 2n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7, and `n` is now the new input integer.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is decremented by 1, so the new range for `t` is from 0 to 4998. The other variables (`n` and `A`) remain unchanged, maintaining their initial conditions.
