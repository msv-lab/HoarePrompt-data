Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 4998.
- `n` is a new input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50.
- `A` is a list of 2n integers, where each integer is read from the input and converted to an integer.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(sum(A[::2]))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `A[::2]`**:
   - The expression `A[::2]` creates a new list that contains every second element of the list `A`, starting from the first element (index 0).
   - For example, if `A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, then `A[::2]` would be `[1, 3, 5]`.

2. **Summing the Elements**:
   - The `sum(A[::2])` function calculates the sum of the elements in the list `A[::2]`.
   - Continuing the example, if `A[::2]` is `[1, 3, 5]`, then `sum(A[::2])` would be `1 + 3 + 5 = 9`.

3. **Final Output**:
   - The `print` statement will output the sum of the elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) of the list `A`.

### Conclusion:
The code will print the sum of the elements at even indices in the list `A`.

Output: **sum of the elements at even indices in the list A (where A is a list of 2n integers read from the input)**
