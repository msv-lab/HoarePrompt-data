Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 4997, `n` is a new input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `A` is a list of 2n integers where each integer is read from the input and converted to an integer.** 

Explanation: The value of `t` is decremented by 1, so the new range for `t` is 0 to 4997. The values of `n` and the list `A` remain unchanged.
