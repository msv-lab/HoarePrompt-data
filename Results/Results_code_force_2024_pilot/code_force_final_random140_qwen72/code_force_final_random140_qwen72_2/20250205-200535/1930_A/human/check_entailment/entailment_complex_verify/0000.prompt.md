You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        n = int(input())
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        print(sum(A[::2]))
        t = t - 1



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and a list of 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7, representing the numbers written on the whiteboard.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        n = int(input())
        
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        print(sum(A[::2]))
        
        t = t - 1
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `n` is undefined (as it is redefined for each iteration), and `A` is undefined (as it is redefined for each iteration).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `2n` integers. It then calculates the sum of the elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) of the list and prints this sum. After processing all test cases, the function terminates with `t` set to 0, and `n` and `A` being undefined as they are redefined for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The issue lies in the way the program calculates the sum. Instead of selecting pairs of integers and adding the minimum of each pair to the score, the program simply sums every other element in the list `A`. This approach does not guarantee that the maximum possible score is achieved.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
2
4 1 2 3
```
The correct output should be 4, because you can choose pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4), which gives a score of 1 + 3 = 4. However, the program will output 5, because it sums the elements at even indices (4 and 1), which is incorrect.

Thus, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly and is therefore incorrect.
