You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        n = int(input())
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        print(sum(A[::2]))
        t = t - 1



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and a list of 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7, representing the numbers written on the whiteboard.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        n = int(input())
        
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        print(sum(A[::2]))
        
        t = t - 1
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `n` is undefined (as it is redefined for each iteration), and `A` is undefined (as it is redefined for each iteration).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `2n` integers. It then calculates the sum of the elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) of the list and prints this sum. After processing all test cases, the function terminates with `t` set to 0, and `n` and `A` being undefined as they are redefined for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

To solve this problem, we need to maximize the sum of the minimum values chosen in each move. The key insight is that to maximize the score, we should always pair the smallest available numbers together. This ensures that the smaller numbers are used as the minimum values, which contributes more to the total score.

### Analysis of the Given Program

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n` and the list of `2n` integers `A`.

2. **Calculating the Score:**
   - The program calculates the sum of every other element starting from the first element (`A[::2]`).
   - It prints this sum as the result for each test case.

### Issues with the Program

- **Incorrect Logic:**
  - The program assumes that the sum of every other element starting from the first element will give the correct score. This is incorrect because the problem requires pairing the smallest numbers to maximize the score.
  - The correct approach would be to sort the list `A` and then sum the first `n` elements (since the first `n` elements in the sorted list will be the smallest and thus contribute the most to the score).

### Correct Approach

1. **Sort the List:**
   - Sort the list `A` in non-decreasing order.
2. **Sum the First n Elements:**
   - Sum the first `n` elements of the sorted list to get the maximum score.

### Corrected Program

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        n = int(input())
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        A.sort()
        print(sum(A[:n]))
        t = t - 1
```

### Conclusion

The given program is incorrect because it does not follow the correct logic to maximize the score. The correct approach involves sorting the list and summing the first `n` elements.

Correctness: **False**
