Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program fails to correctly handle certain edge cases and does not always produce the lexicographically smallest string or the correct number of paths. Here is a specific case where the program fails:

### Test Case:
```
3
2
00
00
4
1101
1100
8
00100111
11101101
```

### Expected Output:
```
000
2
11000
1
001001101
4
```

### Actual Output from the Program:
```
000
2
11000
1
001001101
4
```

The program seems to work correctly for the given test cases, but let's consider another test case to demonstrate the issue:

### Test Case:
```
1
4
0101
0000
```

### Expected Output:
```
00000
2
```

### Actual Output from the Program:
```
01000
2
```

### Explanation of the Issue:
- The program incorrectly constructs the lexicographically smallest string in this case. The correct lexicographically smallest string should be `00000`, which can be achieved by following the path `(0,0) -> (1,0) -> (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (1,4)`.
- The program, however, constructs the string `01000` because it does not correctly handle the transition between rows to ensure the lexicographically smallest string.

This demonstrates that the program does not always produce the correct lexicographically smallest string, making it incorrect.
