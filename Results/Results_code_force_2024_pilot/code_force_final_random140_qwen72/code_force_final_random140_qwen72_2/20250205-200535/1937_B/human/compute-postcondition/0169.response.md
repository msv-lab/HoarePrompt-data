Postcondition: ***`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace and has a length greater than 0, `b` is a new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `ans` is the first character of `a` followed by the second character of `a` (or the first character of `a` followed by the first character of `b` if `i + 1 == len(a)`), `i` is 0 or 1 if `i + 1 == len(a)`, otherwise `i` is 1 or 2, `work` is `False` if `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, otherwise `work` is `True`, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, and `counter` is the final value determined by the loop's conditions. If `i + 1 == len(a)`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
