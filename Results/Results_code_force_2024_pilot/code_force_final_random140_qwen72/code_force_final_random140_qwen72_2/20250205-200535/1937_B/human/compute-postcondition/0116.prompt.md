Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is a new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `ans` is an empty string, `i` is 0, `work` is `True`, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, and `counter` is the final value after all iterations, which depends on the specific characters in `a` and `b`.
Code of the loop:
while i < len(a):
    if work:
        ans += a[i]
        if i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]:
            work = False
        elif i + 1 == len(a):
            ans += b[i]
            break
        else:
            i += 1
    else:
        ans += b[i]
        i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace and has a length greater than 0, `b` is a new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `ans` is either the first character of `a` or the first character of `b` depending on the condition, `i` is 0 or 1, `work` is `True` or `False` based on the condition, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, and `counter` is the final value after all iterations, which depends on the specific characters in `a` and `b`. If `work` is `True`, `ans` is the first character of `a`, and if `i + 1` is less than the length of `a` and `b[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]`, then `work` becomes `False`. Otherwise, `work` remains `True`, and if `i + 1` equals `len(a)`, `ans` is updated to include the first character of `b`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `work` is `False`, `ans` is the first character of `b`, `i` is 1, and `work` remains `False`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace and has a length greater than 0, `b` is a new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `ans` is now the first character of `a` or the first character of `b` followed by the character at index `i` of `a` or `b` (depending on the condition and the value of `i`), `i` is 0, 1, or 2, `work` is `False` if `i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]`, otherwise `work` is `True` or `False` based on the condition, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, and `counter` is the final value after all iterations, which depends on the specific characters in `a` and `b`. If `i + 1 == len(a)`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace and has a length greater than 0, `b` is a new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `ans` is now the first character of `a` or the first character of `b` followed by the character at index `i` of `a` or `b` (depending on the condition and the value of `i`). If `work` is `True`, `ans` is further appended by the character at index `i` of `a`, and possibly the character at index `i` of `b`. If `work` is `False`, `ans` is further appended by the character at index `i` of `b`. `i` is 0, 1, or 2 if `work` is `True`, and 1, 2, or 3 if `work` is `False`. `work` is `False` if `i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]`, otherwise `work` is `True` or `False` based on the condition. `j` is `len(a) - 2`, and `counter` is the final value after all iterations, which depends on the specific characters in `a` and `b`. If `i + 1 == len(a)`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
