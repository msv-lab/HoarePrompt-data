The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be initialized to a specific value before the loop starts.

Given that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and it is now the integer value of the input, the loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `t` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
