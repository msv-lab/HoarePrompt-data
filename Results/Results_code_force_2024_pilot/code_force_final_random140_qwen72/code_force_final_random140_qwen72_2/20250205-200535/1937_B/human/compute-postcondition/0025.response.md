Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is a new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `ans` is the first character of `a` or `b` depending on the conditions. If `work` is True, `ans` is the first character of `a`. If `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, then `work` is False. Otherwise, `work` remains True, and `ans` is the first character of `a` followed by the first character of `b` if `i + 1` equals the length of `a`; otherwise, `ans` is just the first character of `a`. If `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, `i` is 0; otherwise, `i` is 1. If `work` is False, `ans` is the first character of `b`, `i` is 1, and `work` is False.***
