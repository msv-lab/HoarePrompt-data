Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, and `a_{11} a_{12} ... a_{1n}` and `a_{21} a_{22} ... a_{2n}` are binary strings of length `n`, where each character is either '0' or '1'. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5. The next line of input is read and stored in the variable `input`. `t` is now the integer value of the input.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = input().strip()
    b = input().strip()
    ans = ''
    i = 0
    work = True
    while i < len(a):
        if work:
            ans += a[i]
            if i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]:
                work = False
            elif i + 1 == len(a):
                ans += b[i]
                break
            else:
                i += 1
        else:
            ans += b[i]
            i += 1
    print(ans)
    counter = 1
    for j in range(len(a) - 1):
        if a[j + 1] == b[j]:
            counter += 1
        if a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1':
            counter = 1
    print(counter)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is a new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `ans` is a string that contains characters from `a` and `b` based on the conditions specified in the loop, `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `work` is either `True` or `False` depending on the last iteration's condition, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, and `counter` is the final value after all iterations, which depends on the specific characters in `a` and `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace and has a length greater than 0, `b` is a new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `ans` is a string that contains characters from `a` and `b` based on the conditions specified in the loop, `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `work` is `False` if the loop broke due to `i + 1 == len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]` being true at any point, otherwise `work` is `True` or `False` based on the last iteration's condition, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, and `counter` is the final value determined by the loop's conditions.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace and has a length greater than 0, `b` is a new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `ans` is a string that combines characters from `a` and `b` based on the conditions within the loop, `i` is `len(a)`, `work` is `False` if the loop encountered a condition where `b[i] < a[i + 1]` before reaching the end of `a`, otherwise `work` is `True`, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, and `counter` is the final value of `counter` after the loop completes. The final value of `counter` depends on the characters in `a` and `b` and how they match the conditions in the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
