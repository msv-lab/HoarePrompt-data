Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace and has a length greater than 2, `b` is a new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `ans` is a string that contains characters from `a` and `b` based on the conditions specified in the loop, `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `work` is `False` if the loop broke due to `i + 1 == len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]` being true at any point, otherwise `work` is `True` or `False` based on the last iteration's condition, `j` is 2, and `counter` is 2 if `a[j + 1] == b[j]` and it was initially 1, or 4 if it was initially 2. If `a[j + 1] != b[j]`, `counter` remains 1 if it was initially 1, or becomes 3 if it was initially 2.***
