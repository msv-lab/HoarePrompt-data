Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is a new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `ans` is the first character of `a` followed by the first character of `b` if `i + 1` equals the length of `a`; otherwise, `ans` is just the first character of `a`. `i` is 0 if `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, otherwise `i` is 1. `work` remains True, and either `i + 1 >= len(a)` or `b[i] >= a[i + 1]` holds true.***
