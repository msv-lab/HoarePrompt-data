Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace and has a length greater than 0, `b` is a new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `ans` is `b[0]`, `i` is 0, `work` is `False`, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, and `counter` is the final value determined by the loop's conditions.**

Explanation: The code `ans += b[i]` appends the character at index `0` of the string `b` to the string `ans`. Since `i` is `0`, `ans` now contains the first character of `b`. All other variables remain unchanged.
