Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace and has a length greater than 0, `b` is a new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `ans` is the first character of `a` followed by the first character of `b`, `i` is 0, `work` is `True`, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, `counter` is the final value determined by the loop's conditions, and `i + 1 == len(a)`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
