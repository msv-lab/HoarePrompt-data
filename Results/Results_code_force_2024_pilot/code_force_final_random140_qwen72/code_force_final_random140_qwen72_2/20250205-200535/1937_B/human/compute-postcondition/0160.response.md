Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace and has a length greater than 0, `b` is a new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `ans` is `b[0]`, `i` is 1, `work` is `False`, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, and `counter` is the final value determined by the loop's conditions.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing from 0 to 1.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
