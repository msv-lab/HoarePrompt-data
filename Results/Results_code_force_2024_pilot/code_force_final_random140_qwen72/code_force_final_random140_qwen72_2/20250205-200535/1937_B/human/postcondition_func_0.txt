The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two binary strings `a` and `b` of equal length. For each test case, it constructs a new string `ans` by interleaving characters from `a` and `b` based on specific conditions. It then prints the constructed string `ans`. Additionally, it calculates and prints a counter value that reflects the number of consecutive matching characters between `a` and `b` under certain conditions. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results for each test case.
