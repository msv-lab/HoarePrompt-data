You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two distinct non-negative integers x and y . Consider two
infinite sequences a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots and b_1, b_2, b_3, \ldots , where

  * a_n = n \oplus x ; 
  * b_n = n \oplus y . 

Here, x \oplus y denotes the [bitwise
XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) operation of
integers x and y .

For example, with x = 6 , the first 8 elements of sequence a will look as
follows: [7, 4, 5, 2, 3, 0, 1, 14, \ldots] . Note that the indices of elements
start with 1 .

Your task is to find the length of the longest common subsegment^\dagger of
sequences a and b . In other words, find the maximum integer m such that a_i =
b_j, a_{i + 1} = b_{j + 1}, \ldots, a_{i + m - 1} = b_{j + m - 1} for some i,
j \ge 1 .

^\dagger A subsegment of sequence p is a sequence p_l,p_{l+1},\ldots,p_r ,
where 1 \le l \le r .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0 \le x, y \le
10^9, x \neq y ) — the parameters of the sequences.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the length of the longest common
subsegment.

Example

Input

    4
    
    0 1
    
    12 4
    
    57 37
    
    316560849 14570961

Output

    1
    8
    4
    33554432
    
Note

In the first test case, the first 7 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,\ldots]

b = [0, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6,\ldots]

It can be shown that there isn't a positive integer k such that the sequence
[k, k + 1] occurs in b as a subsegment. So the answer is 1 .

In the third test case, the first 20 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [56, 59, 58, 61, 60, 63, 62, 49, 48, 51, 50, 53, 52, 55, 54, \textbf{41,
40, 43, 42}, 45, \ldots]

b = [36, 39, 38, 33, 32, 35, 34, 45, 44, 47, 46, \textbf{41, 40, 43, 42}, 53,
52, 55, 54, 49, \ldots]

It can be shown that one of the longest common subsegments is the subsegment
[41, 40, 43, 42] with a length of 4 .

The variable `n` is the length of `l1`, and `cnt` is the number of leading matching bits between `l1` and `l2` up to the point where they differ or until the end of the shorter list, whichever comes first.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program fails to correctly compute the length of the longest common subsegment for certain inputs.

### Issue Analysis:
1. **Incorrect Bitwise Handling**: The program attempts to convert `x` and `y` into their binary representations and then compares the bits. However, this approach is flawed because it does not correctly handle the bitwise XOR operation and its implications on the sequences `a` and `b`.

2. **Incorrect Length Calculation**: The program calculates the length of the longest common subsegment based on the number of matching bits from the least significant bit (LSB) to the most significant bit (MSB). This approach is incorrect because the length of the longest common subsegment is determined by the position of the first differing bit from the MSB to the LSB.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input `x = 3` and `y = 5`. The sequences `a` and `b` are:
- `a = [n ⊕ 3]` for `n = 0, 1, 2, ...`
- `b = [n ⊕ 5]` for `n = 0, 1, 2, ...`

For the first few values of `n`:
- `a = [3, 2, 1, 0, 7, 6, 5, 4, ...]`
- `b = [5, 4, 7, 6, 3, 2, 1, 0, ...]`

The longest common subsegment here is `[3, 2, 1, 0]`, which has a length of 4. However, the program will incorrectly calculate the length based on the number of matching bits from the LSB, which is not the correct approach.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle the problem as described, and thus it is incorrect.
