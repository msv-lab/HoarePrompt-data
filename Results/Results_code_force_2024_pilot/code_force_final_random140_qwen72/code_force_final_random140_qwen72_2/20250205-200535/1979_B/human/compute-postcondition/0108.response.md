Output State: **`x` is a non-zero integer, `y` is the second integer from the user input, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is incremented by 1, `l1` is a list containing one element which is `x % 2`, `l2` is an empty list, `n` is the length of `l1` (which is now 1), `i` is `n-1` (which is now 0), if all elements in `l1` are equal to the corresponding elements in `l2`, `cnt` is `n`. Otherwise, `cnt` is the index of the first mismatched element in `l1` and `l2`.**
