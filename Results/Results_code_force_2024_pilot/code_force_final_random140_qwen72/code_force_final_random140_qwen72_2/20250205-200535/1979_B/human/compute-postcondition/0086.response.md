Postcondition: ***`x` is 0, `y` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is incremented by the number of iterations, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the original `x` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing the binary digits of the original `y` in reverse order. If the length of `l2` is less than the length of `l1`, an additional 0 is appended to `l2` to make its length equal to the length of `l1`. `n` is the length of `l1`, and `cnt` is 0.***
