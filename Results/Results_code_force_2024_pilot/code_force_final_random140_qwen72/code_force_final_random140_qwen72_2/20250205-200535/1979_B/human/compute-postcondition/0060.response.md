Output State: **`x` is a non-zero integer divided by 2 and must be at least 2, `y` are input integers, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is incremented by 1, `l1` is [x % 2, x % 2], `l2` is an empty list, `n` is 0, `cnt` is 0**

Explanation:
- The code `l1.append(x % 2)` adds the value of `x % 2` to the list `l1`.
- Initially, `l1` was `[x % 2]`.
- After appending `x % 2` again, `l1` becomes `[x % 2, x % 2]`.
- All other variables (`x`, `y`, `t`, `_`, `l2`, `n`, `cnt`) remain unchanged.
