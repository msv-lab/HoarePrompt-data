Output State: **`x` is 0, `y` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is incremented by the number of iterations, `l1` and `l2` are lists containing the binary representations of the initial `x` and `y` in reverse order, respectively, with equal lengths, `n` is the length of `l1`, `i` is `n-1`. If all elements in `l1` are equal to the corresponding elements in `l2`, `cnt` is `n`. Otherwise, `cnt` is the index of the first differing element in `l1` and `l2` (starting from 0).**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each index `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
- For each iteration, it checks if the elements at index `i` in `l1` and `l2` are equal.
- If they are equal, `cnt` is incremented by 1.
- If they are not equal, the loop breaks immediately, and `cnt` remains at the index where the difference was found.
- If all elements are equal, `cnt` will be `n` after the loop completes.
- The variable `_` is incremented by the number of iterations, but its exact value is not specified.
- The variables `x`, `y`, and `t` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
