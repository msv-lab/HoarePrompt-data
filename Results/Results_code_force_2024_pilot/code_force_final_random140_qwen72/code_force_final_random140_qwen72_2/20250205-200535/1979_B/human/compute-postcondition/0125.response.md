The code `l2.append(y % 2)` appends the result of `y % 2` to the list `l2`.

- `y` is the second integer from the user input divided by 4, and it is non-zero.
- `l2` initially contains `[y % 2, y % 2]`.

After appending `y % 2` to `l2`, the new state of `l2` will be `[y % 2, y % 2, y % 2]`.

The other variables (`x`, `y`, `t`, `_`, `l1`, `n`, `i`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is 0, `y` is the second integer from the user input divided by 4 (still non-zero), `t` is greater than 0, `_` is incremented by the number of iterations, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the initial `x` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing `[y % 2, y % 2, y % 2]`, `n` is the length of `l1`, `i` is `n-1`, if all elements in `l1` are equal to the corresponding elements in `l2`, `cnt` is `n`. Otherwise, `cnt` is the index of the first mismatched element in `l1` and `l2`.**
