Postcondition: ***`x` is 0, `y` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and not explicitly set, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the initial `x` in reverse order, and `l2` is a list containing the binary digits of the original `y` in reverse order. If `len(l1) < len(l2)`, `l1` has an additional 0 appended, ensuring the length of `l2` is still greater than or equal to the length of `l1`.***
