Output State: **`x` is 0, `y` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is incremented by the number of iterations, `l1` and `l2` are lists containing the binary representations of the initial `x` and `y` in reverse order, respectively, with equal lengths, `n` is the length of `l1` and must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `cnt` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
