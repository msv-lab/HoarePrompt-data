Output State: **`x` is 0, `y` is the second integer from the user input and must be non-zero, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is incremented by the number of iterations, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the initial `x` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing `[y % 2]`, `n` is the length of `l1`, `i` is `n-1`, if all elements in `l1` are equal to the corresponding elements in `l2`, `cnt` is `n`. Otherwise, `cnt` is the index of the first mismatched element in `l1` and `l2`.**

Explanation:
- The code `l2.append(y % 2)` adds the remainder of `y` divided by 2 to the list `l2`.
- Since `y` is a non-zero integer, `y % 2` will be either 0 or 1.
- The list `l2` now contains a single element, which is the result of `y % 2`.
- All other variables (`x`, `y`, `t`, `_`, `l1`, `n`, `i`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged or their conditions are still valid.
