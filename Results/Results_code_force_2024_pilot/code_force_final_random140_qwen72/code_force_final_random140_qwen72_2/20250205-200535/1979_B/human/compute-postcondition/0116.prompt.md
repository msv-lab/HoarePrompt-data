Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `x` is the first integer from the user input, `y` is the second integer from the user input, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is incremented by 1, `l1` is an empty list, `l2` is an empty list, `n` is the length of `l1`, `i` is `n-1`, if all elements in `l1` are equal to the corresponding elements in `l2`, `cnt` is `n`. Otherwise, `cnt` is the index of the first mismatched element in `l1` and `l2`.
Code of the loop:
while x:
    l1.append(x % 2)
    x //= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `x` is a non-zero integer divided by 2 (using floor division), `y` is the second integer from the user input, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is incremented by 1, `l1` is a list containing one element which is `x % 2` (where `x` is the updated value), `l2` is an empty list, `n` is 1, `i` is 0, if all elements in `l1` are equal to the corresponding elements in `l2`, `cnt` is `n`. Otherwise, `cnt` is the index of the first mismatched element in `l1` and `l2`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `x` is a non-zero integer greater than 0 and is now `x // 2`, `y` is the second integer from the user input, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is incremented by 1, `l1` is a list containing two elements where the first element is `x % 2` and the second element is also `x % 2`, `l2` is an empty list, `n` is 1, `i` is 0, if all elements in `l1` are equal to the corresponding elements in `l2`, `cnt` is `n`. Otherwise, `cnt` is the index of the first mismatched element in `l1` and `l2`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `x` is a non-zero integer greater than 0 and is now `x // 2` (where `x` was an even number greater than 2 before the division), `y` is the second integer from the user input, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is incremented by 1, `l1` is a list containing three elements where the first two elements are `x % 2` and the third element is also `x % 2`, `l2` is an empty list, `n` is 1, `i` is 0, if all elements in `l1` are equal to the corresponding elements in `l2`, `cnt` is `n`. Otherwise, `cnt` is the index of the first mismatched element in `l1` and `l2`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
