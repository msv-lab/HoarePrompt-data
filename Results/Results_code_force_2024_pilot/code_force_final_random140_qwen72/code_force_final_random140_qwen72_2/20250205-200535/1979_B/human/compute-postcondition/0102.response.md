Output State: **`x` is 0, `y` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is incremented by the number of iterations, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the original `x` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing the binary digits of the original `y` in reverse order (with an additional 0 appended if necessary to match the length of `l1`), `n` is the length of `l1`, `i` is `n-1`. If all elements in `l1` are equal to the corresponding elements in `l2`, `cnt` is `n`. Otherwise, `cnt` is the index of the first mismatched element in `l1` and `l2`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates `n` times, where `n` is the length of `l1`.
- For each iteration, the loop checks if the elements at the current index `i` in `l1` and `l2` are equal.
- If they are equal, `cnt` is incremented by 1.
- If they are not equal, the loop breaks, and `cnt` will be the index of the first mismatched element.
- After all iterations, `i` will be `n-1` (the last index of the lists).
- If all elements in `l1` and `l2` are equal, `cnt` will be `n`.
- If there is a mismatch, `cnt` will be the index of the first mismatched element.
