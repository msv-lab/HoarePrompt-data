Output State: **`x` is the first integer from the user input, `y` is the second integer from the user input, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is incremented by 1, `l1` is an empty list, `l2` is an empty list, `n` is the length of `l1`, `i` is `n-1`, if all elements in `l1` are equal to the corresponding elements in `l2`, `cnt` is `n`. Otherwise, `cnt` is the index of the first mismatched element in `l1` and `l2`.**

Explanation:
- The lists `l1` and `l2` are reset to empty lists.
- The lengths of `l1` and `l2` are now 0, so `n` is 0.
- Since `n` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, which is -1.
- Since both `l1` and `l2` are empty, there are no elements to compare, so `cnt` remains undefined in terms of the initial conditions. However, since `n` is 0, `cnt` would be 0 if all elements were to be considered equal (which they are, because there are no elements).
- All other variables (`x`, `y`, `t`, `_`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
