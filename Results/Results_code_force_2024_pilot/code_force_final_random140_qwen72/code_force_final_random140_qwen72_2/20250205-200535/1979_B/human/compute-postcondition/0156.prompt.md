Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: x and y are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, t is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    l1, l2 = [], []
    while x:
        l1.append(x % 2)
        x //= 2
    while y:
        l2.append(y % 2)
        y //= 2
    if len(l2) < len(l1):
        l2.append(0)
    elif len(l1) < len(l2):
        l1.append(0)
    n = len(l1)
    if len(l2) < len(l1):
        n = len(l2)
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if l1[i] == l2[i]:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            break
    print(2 ** cnt)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and not explicitly set, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the initial `x` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing the binary digits of the original `y` in reverse order, if `len(l2) < len(l1)`, `l2` has an additional 0 appended, making the length of `l2` one less than the length of `l1`. If `len(l1) <= len(l2)`, `l1` has an additional 0 appended, ensuring the length of `l2` is still greater than or equal to the length of `l1`. `n` is the length of `l1`, `cnt` is the number of leading matching bits between `l1` and `l2` up to the point where they differ or until the end of the shorter list, whichever comes first.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is incremented by the number of iterations, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the original `x` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing the binary digits of the original `y` in reverse order (with an additional 0 appended if necessary to match the length of `l1`), `n` is the length of `l1`, `i` is `n-1`. If all elements in `l1` are equal to the corresponding elements in `l2`, `cnt` is `n`. Otherwise, `cnt` is the index of the first mismatched element in `l1` and `l2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is incremented by the number of iterations, `l1` and `l2` are lists containing the binary representations of the initial `x` and `y` in reverse order, respectively, with equal lengths, `n` is the length of `l1`, `i` is `n-1`. If all elements in `l1` are equal to the corresponding elements in `l2`, `cnt` is `n`. Otherwise, `cnt` is the index of the first differing element in `l1` and `l2` (starting from 0).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
