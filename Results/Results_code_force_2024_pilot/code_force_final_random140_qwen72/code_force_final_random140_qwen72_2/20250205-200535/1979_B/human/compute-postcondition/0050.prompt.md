Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and not explicitly set, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the initial `x` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing the binary digits of the original `y` in reverse order, if `len(l2) < len(l1)`, `l2` has an additional 0 appended, making the length of `l2` one less than the length of `l1`. If `len(l1) <= len(l2)`, `l1` has an additional 0 appended, ensuring the length of `l2` is still greater than or equal to the length of `l1`. `n` is the length of `l1`, `cnt` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if l1[i] == l2[i]:
        cnt += 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`x` is 0, `y` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and not explicitly set, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the initial `x` in reverse order and must have at least one element, `l2` is a list containing the binary digits of the original `y` in reverse order, if `len(l2) < len(l1)`, `l2` has an additional 0 appended, making the length of `l2` one less than the length of `l1`. If `len(l1) <= len(l2)`, `l1` has an additional 0 appended, ensuring the length of `l2` is still greater than or equal to the length of `l1`. `n` is the length of `l1` and must be greater than 0. If `l1[i]` equals `l2[i]`, `cnt` is incremented by 1. If `l1[i]` does not equal `l2[i]`, `cnt` remains 0 and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`x` is 0, `y` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and not explicitly set, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the initial `x` in reverse order and must have at least one element, `l2` is a list containing the binary digits of the original `y` in reverse order, if `len(l2) < len(l1)`, `l2` has an additional 0 appended, making the length of `l2` one less than the length of `l1`. If `len(l1) <= len(l2)`, `l1` has an additional 0 appended, ensuring the length of `l2` is still greater than or equal to the length of `l1`. `n` is the length of `l1` and must be greater than 0, `i` is 1. If `l1[i] == l2[i]`, `cnt` is incremented by 1 (or 2 if the previous condition was met). Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0 (or 1 if the previous condition was met), and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`x` is 0, `y` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and not explicitly set, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the initial `x` in reverse order and must have at least one element, `l2` is a list containing the binary digits of the original `y` in reverse order, if `len(l2) < len(l1)`, `l2` has an additional 0 appended, making the length of `l2` one less than the length of `l1`. If `len(l1) <= len(l2)`, `l1` has an additional 0 appended, ensuring the length of `l2` is still greater than or equal to the length of `l1`. `n` is the length of `l1` and must be greater than 0, `i` is 2. If `l1[i] == l2[i]`, `cnt` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0 (or 1 if the previous condition was met), and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
