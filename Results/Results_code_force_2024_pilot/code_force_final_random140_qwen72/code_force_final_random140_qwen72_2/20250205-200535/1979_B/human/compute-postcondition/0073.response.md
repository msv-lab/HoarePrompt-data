Output State: **`x` is 0, `y` is now `y // 2` and must be greater than 0, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is incremented by 1, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the original `x` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing the value `y % 2` (with one additional element added), `n` is 0, `cnt` is 0**

Explanation:
- The code `l2.append(y % 2)` adds the value of `y % 2` to the list `l2`.
- Since `y` is now `y // 2` and must be greater than 0, the value of `y % 2` is either 0 or 1.
- The list `l2` now contains one additional element, which is the result of `y % 2`.
- All other variables (`x`, `y`, `t`, `_`, `l1`, `n`, `cnt`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
