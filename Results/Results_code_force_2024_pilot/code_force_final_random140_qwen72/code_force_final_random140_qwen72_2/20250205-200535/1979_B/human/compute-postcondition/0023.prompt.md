Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `x` is 0, `y` is the integer provided by the input, `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and not explicitly set, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the initial `x` in reverse order, `l2` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
while y:
    l2.append(y % 2)
    y //= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `x` is 0, `y` is the integer provided by the input divided by 2 (and must be non-zero), `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and not explicitly set, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the initial `x` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing the least significant bit (LSB) of the original `y`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `x` is 0, `y` is the integer provided by the input divided by 4 (and must be non-zero), `t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and not explicitly set, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the initial `x` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing the least significant bit (LSB) of the original `y` and the new least significant bit (LSB) of `y` after the operation.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `x` is 0, `y` is the integer provided by the input divided by 8 (and must be non-zero), `t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and not explicitly set, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the initial `x` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing the least significant bit (LSB) of the original `y` and the new least significant bit (LSB) of `y` after the operation, and `l2` now contains one additional element which is the new least significant bit (LSB) of `y`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
