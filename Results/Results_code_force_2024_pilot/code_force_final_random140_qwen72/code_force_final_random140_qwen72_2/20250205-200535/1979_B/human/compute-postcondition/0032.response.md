Postcondition: **`x` is 0, `y` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and not explicitly set. `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the initial `x` in reverse order, and `l2` is a list containing the binary digits of the original `y` in reverse order. The length of `l2` is less than the length of `l1`, and `l2` has an additional 0 appended, making the length of `l2` one less than the length of `l1`. `n` is the length of `l1`.**
