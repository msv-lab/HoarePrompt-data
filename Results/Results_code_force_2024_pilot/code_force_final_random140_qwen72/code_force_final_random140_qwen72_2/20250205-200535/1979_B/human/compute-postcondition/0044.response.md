Output State: **`x` is 0, `y` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and not explicitly set, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the initial `x` in reverse order and must have at least one element, `l2` is a list containing the binary digits of the original `y` in reverse order, if `len(l2) < len(l1)`, `l2` has an additional 0 appended, making the length of `l2` one less than the length of `l1`. If `len(l1) <= len(l2)`, `l1` has an additional 0 appended, ensuring the length of `l2` is still greater than or equal to the length of `l1`. `n` is the length of `l1` and must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `cnt` is 0 (or 1 if the previous condition was met), and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
