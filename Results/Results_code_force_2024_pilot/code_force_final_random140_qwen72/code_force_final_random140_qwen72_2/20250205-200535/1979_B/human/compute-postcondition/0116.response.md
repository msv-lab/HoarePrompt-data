Output State: **`x` is 0, `y` is the second integer from the user input, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is incremented by the number of iterations, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the initial `x` in reverse order, `l2` is an empty list, `n` is the length of `l1`, `i` is `n-1`, if all elements in `l1` are equal to the corresponding elements in `l2`, `cnt` is `n`. Otherwise, `cnt` is the index of the first mismatched element in `l1` and `l2`.**

### Explanation:
- **`x`**: After all iterations, `x` will be 0 because the loop continues to divide `x` by 2 until it becomes 0.
- **`y`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`t`**: Remains greater than 0 as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`_`**: This variable is incremented by 1 for each iteration of the loop, so it will be equal to the number of iterations.
- **`l1`**: This list will contain the binary representation of the initial `x` in reverse order. Each iteration appends the remainder of `x` divided by 2 to `l1`.
- **`l2`**: Remains an empty list as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`n`**: The length of `l1` will be the number of iterations, which is the number of bits in the binary representation of the initial `x`.
- **`i`**: This is `n-1`, which is the last index of `l1`.
- **`cnt`**: Since `l2` is always empty, `cnt` will be 0 because there are no elements in `l2` to compare with `l1`.
