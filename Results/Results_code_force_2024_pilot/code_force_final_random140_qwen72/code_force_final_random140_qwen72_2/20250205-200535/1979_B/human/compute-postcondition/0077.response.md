Output State: **`x` is 0, `y` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is incremented by the number of iterations, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the original `x` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing the binary digits of the original `y` in reverse order with an additional 0 appended, `n` is 0, `cnt` is 0, and the length of `l2` is less than or equal to the length of `l1`.**
