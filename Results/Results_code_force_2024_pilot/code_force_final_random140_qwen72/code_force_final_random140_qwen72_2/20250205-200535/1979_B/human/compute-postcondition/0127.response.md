Output State: **`x` is 0, `y` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is incremented by the number of iterations, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the initial `x` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the initial `y` in reverse order, `n` is the length of `l1`, `i` is `n-1`, if all elements in `l1` are equal to the corresponding elements in `l2`, `cnt` is `n`. Otherwise, `cnt` is the index of the first mismatched element in `l1` and `l2`.**

### Explanation:
- **`x`**: Remains 0 as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`y`**: After the loop completes, `y` will be 0 because the loop continues until `y` becomes 0.
- **`t`**: Remains greater than 0 as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`_`**: Incremented by the number of iterations, which is the number of times the loop runs.
- **`l1`**: Remains a list containing the binary representation of the initial `x` in reverse order, which is `[0]` since `x` is 0.
- **`l2`**: Contains the binary representation of the initial `y` in reverse order. Each iteration appends the least significant bit of `y` to `l2`, and `y` is then right-shifted by dividing by 2.
- **`n`**: The length of `l1`, which remains unchanged as `l1` is not modified.
- **`i`**: Remains `n-1`, which is 0 since `n` is 1.
- **`cnt`**: If all elements in `l1` are equal to the corresponding elements in `l2`, `cnt` is `n`. Otherwise, `cnt` is the index of the first mismatched element in `l1` and `l2`. Since `l1` is `[0]` and `l2` is the binary representation of the initial `y` in reverse order, `cnt` will be 0 unless `y` was initially 0.
