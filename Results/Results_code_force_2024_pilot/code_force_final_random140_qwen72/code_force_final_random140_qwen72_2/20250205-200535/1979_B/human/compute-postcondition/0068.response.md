Output State: **`x` is 0, `y` is now `y // 2`, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is incremented by 1, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the original `x` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing the value `y % 2`, `n` is 0, `cnt` is 0**

Explanation: The value of `y` is updated to `y // 2`, which means `y` is now the integer division of `y` by 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
