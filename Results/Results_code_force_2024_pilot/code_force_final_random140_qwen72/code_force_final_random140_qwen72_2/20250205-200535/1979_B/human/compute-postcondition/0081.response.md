Postcondition: ***`x` is 0, `y` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is incremented by the number of iterations, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the original `x` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing the binary digits of the original `y` in reverse order, `n` is 0, `cnt` is 0, and the length of `l2` is greater than or equal to the length of `l1`. If the length of `l1` is less than the length of `l2`, `l1` has an additional 0 appended to it.***
