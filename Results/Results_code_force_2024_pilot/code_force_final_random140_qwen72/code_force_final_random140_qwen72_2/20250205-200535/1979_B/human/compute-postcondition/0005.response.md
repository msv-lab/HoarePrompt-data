Output State: **`x` and `y` are the integers provided by the input, `x` must be non-zero, `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and not explicitly set, `l1` is a list containing `[x % 2]`, `l2` is an empty list.** 

Explanation: The code appends the result of `x % 2` (which is the remainder when `x` is divided by 2) to the list `l1`. Since `x` is non-zero, `x % 2` will be either 0 or 1. The list `l1` now contains one element, which is the result of `x % 2`. The list `l2` remains unchanged and is still an empty list. All other conditions from the initial state remain valid.
