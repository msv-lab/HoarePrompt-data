Let's break down the initial state and the logic leading up to the `print` statement:

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `x` is 0.
   - `y` is 0.
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `_` is incremented by the number of iterations (not directly relevant to the final print statement).
   - `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the original `x` in reverse order.
   - `l2` is a list containing the binary digits of the original `y` in reverse order, with an additional 0 appended if necessary to match the length of `l1`.
   - `n` is the length of `l1`.
   - `i` is `n-1`.

2. **Binary Representations:**
   - Since `x` is 0, the binary representation of `x` is `0`. Therefore, `l1` is `[0]`.
   - Since `y` is 0, the binary representation of `y` is `0`. Therefore, `l2` is `[0]`.

3. **Length and Index:**
   - `n` is the length of `l1`, which is 1.
   - `i` is `n-1`, which is 0.

4. **Comparison of Lists:**
   - We need to compare `l1` and `l2` to determine `cnt`.
   - Both `l1` and `l2` are `[0]`, so all elements in `l1` are equal to the corresponding elements in `l2`.
   - Therefore, `cnt` is `n`, which is 1.

5. **Final Calculation:**
   - The `print` statement calculates `2 ** cnt`.
   - Since `cnt` is 1, `2 ** 1` is 2.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is:
Output: **2**
