Postcondition: ***`x` is 0, `y` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is incremented by the number of iterations, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the initial `x` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the initial `y` in reverse order, `n` is the length of `l1`, `i` is `n-1`. If `len(l1) < len(l2)`, `l1` has an additional 0 appended, making `n` equal to `n+1` and `i` equal to `n`. If all elements in `l1` are equal to the corresponding elements in `l2`, `cnt` is `n`. Otherwise, `cnt` is the index of the first mismatched element in `l1` and `l2`. Additionally, the length of `l2` is greater than or equal to the length of `l1`.***
