Output State: **`x` is a non-zero integer divided by 4 and must be at least 1, `y` are input integers, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is incremented by 1, `l1` is [x % 2, x % 2], `l2` is an empty list, `n` is 0, `cnt` is 0**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is updated by performing integer division by 2 (`x //= 2`). Since `x` was initially a non-zero integer divided by 2 and must be at least 2, after dividing by 2 again, `x` is now a non-zero integer divided by 4 and must be at least 1.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
