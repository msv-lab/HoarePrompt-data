Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `x` is 0.
2. `y` is 0.
3. `t` is greater than 0.
4. `_` is incremented by the number of iterations (though this variable is not used in the print statement).
5. `l1` and `l2` are lists containing the binary representations of the initial `x` and `y` in reverse order, respectively, with equal lengths.
6. `n` is the length of `l1`.
7. `i` is `n-1`.
8. If all elements in `l1` are equal to the corresponding elements in `l2`, `cnt` is `n`. Otherwise, `cnt` is the index of the first differing element in `l1` and `l2` (starting from 0).

### Analysis:
- Since `x` and `y` are both 0, their binary representations are both `0`.
- The binary representation of 0 in reverse order is still `0`.
- Therefore, `l1` and `l2` are both `[0]`.
- The length `n` of `l1` (and `l2`) is 1.
- `i` is `n-1`, which is 0.
- Since `l1` and `l2` are both `[0]`, all elements in `l1` are equal to the corresponding elements in `l2`.
- Therefore, `cnt` is `n`, which is 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(2 ** cnt)
```

### Calculation:
- `cnt` is 1.
- `2 ** cnt` is `2 ** 1`, which is 2.

### Final Output:
Output: **2**
