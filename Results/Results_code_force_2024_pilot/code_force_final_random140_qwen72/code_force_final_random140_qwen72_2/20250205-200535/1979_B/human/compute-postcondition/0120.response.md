The value of `y` is updated by performing an integer division by 2 (`y //= 2`). This operation reduces `y` to half its original value, discarding any fractional part. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is 0, `y` is the second integer from the user input divided by 2 (still non-zero), `t` is greater than 0, `_` is incremented by the number of iterations, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the initial `x` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing `[y % 2]`, `n` is the length of `l1`, `i` is `n-1`, if all elements in `l1` are equal to the corresponding elements in `l2`, `cnt` is `n`. Otherwise, `cnt` is the index of the first mismatched element in `l1` and `l2`.**
