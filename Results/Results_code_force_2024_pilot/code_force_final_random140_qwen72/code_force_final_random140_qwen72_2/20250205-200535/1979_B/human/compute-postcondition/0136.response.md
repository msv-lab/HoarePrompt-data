Postcondition: **`x` is 0, `y` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is incremented by the number of iterations, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the initial `x` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the initial `y` in reverse order. The length of `l2` is less than the length of `l1`. `l2` has an additional 0 appended, making the lengths of `l1` and `l2` equal. `n` is the length of `l1`, and `i` is `n-1`. If all elements in `l1` are equal to the corresponding elements in `l2`, `cnt` is `n`. Otherwise, `cnt` is the index of the first mismatched element in `l1` and `l2`. `n` is now the length of `l1`.**
