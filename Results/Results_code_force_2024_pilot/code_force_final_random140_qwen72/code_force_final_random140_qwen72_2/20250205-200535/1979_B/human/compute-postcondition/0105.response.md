The code snippet `x, y = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the user input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`.

Given the initial state:
- `x` is 0
- `y` is 0
- `t` is greater than 0
- `_` is incremented by 1
- `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the original `x` in reverse order
- `l2` is a list containing the binary digits of the original `y` in reverse order (with an additional 0 appended if necessary to match the length of `l1`)
- `n` is the length of `l1`
- `i` is `n-1`
- If all elements in `l1` are equal to the corresponding elements in `l2`, `cnt` is `n`. Otherwise, `cnt` is the index of the first mismatched element in `l1` and `l2`

After executing the code snippet:
- `x` is assigned the first integer from the user input
- `y` is assigned the second integer from the user input

The other variables (`t`, `_`, `l1`, `l2`, `n`, `i`, `cnt`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is the first integer from the user input, `y` is the second integer from the user input, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is incremented by 1, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the original `x` in reverse order, `l2` is a list containing the binary digits of the original `y` in reverse order (with an additional 0 appended if necessary to match the length of `l1`), `n` is the length of `l1`, `i` is `n-1`, if all elements in `l1` are equal to the corresponding elements in `l2`, `cnt` is `n`. Otherwise, `cnt` is the index of the first mismatched element in `l1` and `l2`.**
