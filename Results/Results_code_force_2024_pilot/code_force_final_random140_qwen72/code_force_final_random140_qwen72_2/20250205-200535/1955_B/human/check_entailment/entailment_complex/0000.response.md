### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Input and Sorting:**
   - The program reads the input and sorts the list `l`. This ensures that the elements are in non-decreasing order, which is necessary for the subsequent checks.

2. **Check the Range of Values:**
   - The program checks if the difference between the largest and smallest elements in `l` is equal to `(n - 1) * (c + d)`. This is a crucial step because it ensures that the elements in `l` can form a progressive square with the given `c` and `d`.

3. **Check the Middle Element for Odd `n`:**
   - If `n` is odd, the program checks if the middle element of the sorted list `l` is equal to half the sum of the smallest and largest elements. This is necessary because the middle element should be the average of the first and last elements in a progressive square when `n` is odd.

4. **Symmetry Check:**
   - The program checks if each pair of symmetric elements around the center of the sorted list `l` are equal. This ensures that the elements can be arranged in a symmetric pattern, which is a requirement for a progressive square.

5. **Return 'yes' or 'no':**
   - If all the above conditions are satisfied, the program returns 'yes'. Otherwise, it returns 'no'.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly implements the logic to check if the given list `l` can form a progressive square with the given `n`, `c`, and `d`.
- The conditions checked are necessary and sufficient to ensure that the elements can be arranged in the required pattern.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Correctness: **True****
