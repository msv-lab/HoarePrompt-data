Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
A progressive square of size n is an n \times n matrix. Maxim chooses three
integers a_{1,1} , c , and d and constructs a progressive square according to
the following rules:

For example, if n = 3 , a_{1,1} = 1 , c=2 , and d=3 , then the progressive
square looks as follows:

Last month Maxim constructed a progressive square and remembered the values of
n , c , and d . Recently, he found an array b of n^2 integers in random order
and wants to make sure that these elements are the elements of that specific
square.

It can be shown that for any values of n , a_{1,1} , c , and d , there exists
exactly one progressive square that satisfies all the rules.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le {10} ^ 4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , c , and d (2 \le
n \le 500 , 1 \le c, d \le 10^6 ) — the size of the square and the values of c
and d as described in the statement.

The second line of each test case contains n \cdot n integers b_1, b_2, \dots,
b_{n \cdot n} (1 \le b_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements found by Maxim.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n ^ 2 over all test cases does not exceed 25
\cdot {10} ^ 4 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" in a separate line if a progressive square
for the given n , c , and d can be constructed from the array elements a ,
otherwise output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

def func_1(n, c, d, l):

    #State: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6, and `l` is a list of n^2 integers where each integer b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, and `l` is sorted in non-decreasing order.

        #State: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, and `n` is odd. `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6. `l` is a list of n^2 integers where each integer b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, and `l` is sorted in non-decreasing order. The difference between the last element and the first element of `l` is equal to (n - 1) * (c + d). `a` is equal to `l[0] + l[-1]`. `r` is equal to n^2 // 2. Additionally, `l[r]` is equal to `a // 2`.
    #State: *`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6, `l` is a list of n^2 integers where each integer b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, and `l` is sorted in non-decreasing order. The difference between the last element and the first element of `l` is equal to (n - 1) * (c + d). `a` is equal to `l[0] + l[-1]`. `r` is equal to n^2 // 2. If `n` is odd, `l[r]` is equal to `a // 2`.

    #State: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6, `l` is a list of n^2 integers where each integer b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, and `l` is sorted in non-decreasing order, the difference between the last element and the first element of `l` is equal to (n - 1) * (c + d), `a` is equal to `l[0] + l[-1]`, `r` is equal to n^2 // 2, if `n` is odd, `l[r]` is equal to `a // 2`, `k` is r-1, and for all indices `i` from 0 to r-1, `l[i]` is equal to `l[-1 - i]`. If any `l[i]` is not equal to `l[-1 - i]`, the program returns 'no'. Otherwise, the loop completes without returning anything.
    return 'yes'
    #The program returns 'yes'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes four parameters: `n` (an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500), `c` and `d` (integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6), and `l` (a list of n^2 integers where each integer b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9). It sorts the list `l` and checks several conditions. If the difference between the largest and smallest elements in `l` is not equal to (n - 1) * (c + d), it returns 'no'. If `n` is odd and the middle element of `l` is not equal to half the sum of the smallest and largest elements, it returns 'NO'. If any pair of symmetric elements around the center of the sorted list `l` are not equal, it returns 'no'. If all conditions are satisfied, it returns 'yes'.
