Reasoning:  
The program aims to verify if a given set of numbers can form a progressive square based on the rules provided. The key steps in the program are:

1. **Sorting the List**: The list `l` is sorted to facilitate the checking of conditions.
2. **Checking the Range**: The program checks if the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the sorted list is equal to `(n - 1) * (c + d)`. This condition ensures that the range of the elements matches the expected range for a progressive square.
3. **Middle Element Check**: If `n` is odd, the program checks if the middle element of the sorted list is equal to half the sum of the smallest and largest elements. This ensures that the middle element is correctly positioned in the progressive square.
4. **Symmetry Check**: The program checks if each pair of symmetric elements around the center of the sorted list are equal. This ensures that the elements form a symmetric pattern, which is a characteristic of a progressive square.

However, there are a few issues with the implementation:

- **Return Values**: The function uses both 'no' and 'NO' as return values, which are inconsistent with the required output format ('YES' or 'NO').
- **Symmetry Check**: The symmetry check should ensure that the sum of each pair of symmetric elements is equal to the sum of the smallest and largest elements (`a`). The current implementation only checks if the elements are equal, which is not sufficient to ensure the correct formation of the progressive square.

Given these issues, the program is not fully correct as it does not meet the specified requirements and may produce incorrect results in some cases.

Correctness: **False**
