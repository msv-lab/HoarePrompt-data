You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A progressive square of size n is an n \times n matrix. Maxim chooses three
integers a_{1,1} , c , and d and constructs a progressive square according to
the following rules:

For example, if n = 3 , a_{1,1} = 1 , c=2 , and d=3 , then the progressive
square looks as follows:

Last month Maxim constructed a progressive square and remembered the values of
n , c , and d . Recently, he found an array b of n^2 integers in random order
and wants to make sure that these elements are the elements of that specific
square.

It can be shown that for any values of n , a_{1,1} , c , and d , there exists
exactly one progressive square that satisfies all the rules.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le {10} ^ 4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , c , and d (2 \le
n \le 500 , 1 \le c, d \le 10^6 ) — the size of the square and the values of c
and d as described in the statement.

The second line of each test case contains n \cdot n integers b_1, b_2, \dots,
b_{n \cdot n} (1 \le b_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements found by Maxim.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n ^ 2 over all test cases does not exceed 25
\cdot {10} ^ 4 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" in a separate line if a progressive square
for the given n , c , and d can be constructed from the array elements a ,
otherwise output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, c, d) = map(int, input().split())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, c, d, l))

def func_1(n, c, d, l):
    l.sort()
    if not l[-1] - l[0] == (n - 1) * (c + d):
        return 'no'
    a = l[0] + l[-1]
    r = n ** 2 // 2
    if n % 2 != 0:
        if not l[r] == a // 2:
            return 'NO'
    for k in range(r):
        if not l[k] == l[-1 - k]:
            return 'no'
    return 'yes'



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` takes four parameters: `n` (an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500), `c` and `d` (integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6), and `l` (a list of n^2 integers where each integer b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9). It sorts the list `l` and checks several conditions. If the difference between the largest and smallest elements in `l` is not equal to (n - 1) * (c + d), it returns 'no'. If `n` is odd and the middle element of `l` is not equal to half the sum of the smallest and largest elements, it returns 'NO'. If any pair of symmetric elements around the center of the sorted list `l` are not equal, it returns 'no'. If all conditions are satisfied, it returns 'yes'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. Each test case involves reading `n`, `c`, and `d`, followed by the list of integers `l`.

2. **Sorting the List**: The program sorts the list `l`. This is necessary because the properties of the progressive square need to be checked against the sorted list of elements.

3. **Range Check**: The program checks if the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the sorted list is equal to `(n - 1) * (c + d)`. This ensures that the elements span the correct range for the progressive square.

4. **Sum Check**: The program calculates the sum of the first and last elements in the sorted list (`a = l[0] + l[-1]`). This sum should be consistent with the properties of the progressive square.

5. **Middle Element Check**: If `n` is odd, the program checks if the middle element of the sorted list is equal to `a // 2`. This is a necessary condition for the progressive square when `n` is odd.

6. **Symmetry Check**: The program checks if the elements in the first half of the sorted list are symmetric to the elements in the second half. This ensures that the elements form a valid progressive square.

7. **Return Values**: The program returns 'no' if any of the conditions fail, and 'yes' if all conditions are met. However, the output should be 'NO' and 'YES' as specified in the problem statement.

8. **Function Call**: The function `func_1` is called within the loop for each test case, and the result is printed.

**Issues**:
- The function `func_1` returns 'no' and 'yes' instead of 'NO' and 'YES'. This is a minor issue but will cause the output to be incorrect according to the problem statement.

**Conclusion**:
The program is almost correct but has a minor issue with the output format. The output should be 'NO' and 'YES' instead of 'no' and 'yes'.

Correctness: **False**
