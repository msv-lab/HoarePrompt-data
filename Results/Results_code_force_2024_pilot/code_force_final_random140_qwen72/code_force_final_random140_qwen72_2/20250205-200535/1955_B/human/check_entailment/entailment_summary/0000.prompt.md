Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
A progressive square of size n is an n \times n matrix. Maxim chooses three
integers a_{1,1} , c , and d and constructs a progressive square according to
the following rules:

For example, if n = 3 , a_{1,1} = 1 , c=2 , and d=3 , then the progressive
square looks as follows:

Last month Maxim constructed a progressive square and remembered the values of
n , c , and d . Recently, he found an array b of n^2 integers in random order
and wants to make sure that these elements are the elements of that specific
square.

It can be shown that for any values of n , a_{1,1} , c , and d , there exists
exactly one progressive square that satisfies all the rules.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le {10} ^ 4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , c , and d (2 \le
n \le 500 , 1 \le c, d \le 10^6 ) — the size of the square and the values of c
and d as described in the statement.

The second line of each test case contains n \cdot n integers b_1, b_2, \dots,
b_{n \cdot n} (1 \le b_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements found by Maxim.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n ^ 2 over all test cases does not exceed 25
\cdot {10} ^ 4 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" in a separate line if a progressive square
for the given n , c , and d can be constructed from the array elements a ,
otherwise output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

# Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, c, d) = map(int, input().split())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, c, d, l))

def func_1(n, c, d, l):
    l.sort()
    if not l[-1] - l[0] == (n - 1) * (c + d):
        return 'no'
    a = l[0] + l[-1]
    r = n ** 2 // 2
    if n % 2 != 0:
        if not l[r] == a // 2:
            return 'NO'
    for k in range(r):
        if not l[k] == l[-1 - k]:
            return 'no'
    return 'yes'





# Execution Summary:
The function `func_1` takes four parameters: `n` (an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500), `c` and `d` (integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6), and `l` (a list of n^2 integers where each integer b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9). It sorts the list `l` and checks several conditions. If the difference between the largest and smallest elements in `l` is not equal to (n - 1) * (c + d), it returns 'no'. If `n` is odd and the middle element of `l` is not equal to half the sum of the smallest and largest elements, it returns 'NO'. If any pair of symmetric elements around the center of the sorted list `l` are not equal, it returns 'no'. If all conditions are satisfied, it returns 'yes'.
