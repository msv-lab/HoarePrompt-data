Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, and `n` is odd. `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6. `l` is a list of n^2 integers where each integer b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, and `l` is sorted in non-decreasing order. The difference between the last element and the first element of `l` is equal to (n - 1) * (c + d). `a` is equal to `l[0] + l[-1]`. `r` is equal to n^2 // 2. Additionally, `l[r]` is equal to `a // 2`.**
