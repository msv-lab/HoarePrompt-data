Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6, `l` is a list of n^2 integers where each integer b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, and `l` is sorted in non-decreasing order. Additionally, the difference between the last element and the first element of `l` is equal to (n - 1) * (c + d). `a` is equal to `l[0] + l[-1]`. `r` is equal to n^2 // 2.** 

Explanation: The code `r = n ** 2 // 2` calculates the integer division of `n` squared by 2 and assigns the result to `r`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
