The function `func_1` takes four parameters: `n` (an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500), `c` and `d` (integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6), and `l` (a list of n^2 integers where each integer b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9). It sorts the list `l` and checks several conditions. If the difference between the largest and smallest elements in `l` is not equal to (n - 1) * (c + d), it returns 'no'. If `n` is odd and the middle element of `l` is not equal to half the sum of the smallest and largest elements, it returns 'NO'. If any pair of symmetric elements around the center of the sorted list `l` are not equal, it returns 'no'. If all conditions are satisfied, it returns 'yes'.
