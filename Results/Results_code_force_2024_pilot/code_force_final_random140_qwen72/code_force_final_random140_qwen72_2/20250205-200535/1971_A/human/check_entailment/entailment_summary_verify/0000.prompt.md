You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

Input

    10
    
    1 9
    
    8 4
    
    1 4
    
    3 4
    
    2 0
    
    2 4
    
    6 9
    
    3 3
    
    0 0
    
    9 9

Output

    1 9
    4 8
    1 4
    3 4
    0 2
    2 4
    6 9
    3 3
    0 0
    9 9

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        print(max(a, b), min(a, b))



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, where `1 <= t <= 100`. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` (both between 0 and 9). It then prints the maximum and minimum of these two integers. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the state of the program is such that `t` test cases have been processed, and for each test case, the maximum and minimum of the two input integers have been printed.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program prints the maximum of `a` and `b` first, followed by the minimum of `a` and `b`. However, according to the problem description, the output should be the minimum of `a` and `b` followed by the maximum of `a` and `b`. This discrepancy means the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.

Example of incorrect behavior:
- Input: `1 9`
- Expected Output: `1 9`
- Actual Output: `9 1`

This example shows that the program does not produce the correct output as specified in the problem description.
