Reasoning:

1. The function `func()` starts by reading an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases.
2. It then enters a loop that runs `t` times, processing each test case.
3. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input using `input().split()`, and converts them to integers using `map(int, ...)`.
4. It then prints the maximum of `a` and `b` followed by the minimum of `a` and `b`.

However, there is a mistake in the order of printing the results. According to the problem statement, the output should be the minimum of `a` and `b` followed by the maximum of `a` and `b`. The current implementation prints the maximum first and the minimum second, which is incorrect.

Corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        print(min(a, b), max(a, b))
```

Given the original program's mistake, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
