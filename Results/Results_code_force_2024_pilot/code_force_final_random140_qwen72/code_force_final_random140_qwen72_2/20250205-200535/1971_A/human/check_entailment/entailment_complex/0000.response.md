Reasoning:  
The program is almost correct but has a minor issue with the order of printing the minimum and maximum values. According to the problem description, the output should be the minimum of `x` and `y` followed by the maximum of `x` and `y`. However, the current implementation prints the maximum followed by the minimum. This is a straightforward mistake that can be fixed by swapping the order of the `print` statement.

Here is the corrected version of the `print` statement:
```python
print(min(a, b), max(a, b))
```

Given the current implementation:
```python
print(max(a, b), min(a, b))
```
The program will print the maximum value first and the minimum value second, which is incorrect according to the problem description.

Therefore, the current program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
