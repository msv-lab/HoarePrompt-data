Reasoning:

1. The function `func()` correctly reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases.
2. It enters a loop that runs `t` times, processing each test case.
3. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input using `input().split()`, and converts them to integers using `map(int, ...)`.
4. The function then prints the maximum of `a` and `b` followed by the minimum of `a` and `b`.

According to the problem statement, the output should be the minimum of `a` and `b` followed by the maximum of `a` and `b`. However, the current implementation prints the maximum first and the minimum second, which is incorrect.

The function summary confirms that the function processes `t` test cases and prints the maximum and minimum of the two input integers for each test case. This aligns with the observation that the order of printing is reversed.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate in identifying the mistake in the order of printing the results.

Final: **False**
