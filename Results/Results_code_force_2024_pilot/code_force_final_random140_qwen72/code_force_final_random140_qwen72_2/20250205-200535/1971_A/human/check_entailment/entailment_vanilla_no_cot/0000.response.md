Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program prints the maximum value before the minimum value, which is the reverse of what the problem statement requires. The correct order should be the minimum value followed by the maximum value. To fix this, the `print` statement should be changed to:

```python
print(min(a, b), max(a, b))
```
