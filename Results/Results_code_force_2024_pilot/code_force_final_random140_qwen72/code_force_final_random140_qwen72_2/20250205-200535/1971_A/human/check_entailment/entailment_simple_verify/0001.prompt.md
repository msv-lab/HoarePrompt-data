You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

Input

    10
    
    1 9
    
    8 4
    
    1 4
    
    3 4
    
    2 0
    
    2 4
    
    6 9
    
    3 3
    
    0 0
    
    9 9

Output

    1 9
    4 8
    1 4
    3 4
    0 2
    2 4
    6 9
    3 3
    0 0
    9 9

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        print(max(a, b), min(a, b))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each test case, x and y are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        print(max(a, b), min(a, b))
        
    #State: `t` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `_` is a placeholder and does not need adjustment, `a` and `b` are the integers entered by the user for each iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. The function `func()` starts by reading an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases.
2. It then enters a loop that runs `t` times, processing each test case.
3. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input using `input().split()`, and converts them to integers using `map(int, ...)`.
4. It then prints the maximum of `a` and `b` followed by the minimum of `a` and `b`.

However, there is a mistake in the order of printing the results. According to the problem statement, the output should be the minimum of `a` and `b` followed by the maximum of `a` and `b`. The current implementation prints the maximum first and the minimum second, which is incorrect.

Corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        print(min(a, b), max(a, b))
```

Given the original program's mistake, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
