The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, where `1 <= t <= 100`. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` (both between 0 and 9). It then prints the maximum and minimum of these two integers. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the state of the program is such that `t` test cases have been processed, and for each test case, the maximum and minimum of the two input integers have been printed.
