The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the parameter constraints and the context, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts parameters `t`, `x`, and `y`. Here, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 100. For each of the `t` test cases, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 <= x, y <= 9.

However, since the function signature does not specify these parameters, and the output is not provided, I will assume the function is designed to handle these parameters internally, possibly through user input or predefined data structures.

Given the constraints and the typical structure of such functions, the functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 100). For each test case, it takes two integers `x` and `y` (0 <= x, y <= 9) and returns a result based on these inputs. The specific output for each test case is not specified, but it is implied that the function will produce some form of output for each combination of `x` and `y` within the given constraints.**
