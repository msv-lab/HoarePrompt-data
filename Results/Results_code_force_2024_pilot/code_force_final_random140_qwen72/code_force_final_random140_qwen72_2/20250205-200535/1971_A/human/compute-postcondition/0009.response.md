The code snippet `a, b = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into two parts, and converts each part into an integer, assigning these integers to `a` and `b`.

- The initial state specifies that `t` must be greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder and does not need adjustment, and `a` and `b` are the integers entered by the user.
- After executing the code, `a` and `b` are updated to the integers provided by the user.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder and does not need adjustment, `a` and `b` are the integers entered by the user.**
