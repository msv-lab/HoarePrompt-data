Initial State: `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and does not need adjustment, `a` and `b` are the integers entered by the user.

Given the initial state, the variables `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user. The `print` statement will output the maximum and minimum of these two integers.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. `a` and `b` are integers input by the user.
2. `max(a, b)` will return the larger of the two integers.
3. `min(a, b)` will return the smaller of the two integers.
4. The `print` statement will output these two values in the order: maximum value followed by the minimum value.

Therefore, the output will be the maximum and minimum of the integers `a` and `b`.

Output: **max(a, b), min(a, b) (where max(a, b) is the larger of the two integers and min(a, b) is the smaller of the two integers)**
