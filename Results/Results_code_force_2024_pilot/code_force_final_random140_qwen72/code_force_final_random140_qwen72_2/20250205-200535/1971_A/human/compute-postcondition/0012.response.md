The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters within its definition. However, based on the context provided, it seems that the function is designed to handle multiple test cases (denoted by `t`), where each test case involves two integers `x` and `y` with specific constraints. The function should process these test cases and produce an appropriate output for each.

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
- For each test case, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 9.

The function's output is not specified in the problem statement, but typically, such functions would return or print a result for each test case based on the values of `x` and `y`.

Since the exact output is not provided, I'll assume a generic functionality that fits the given constraints.

Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 100. For each test case, it accepts two integers `x` and `y` (both between 0 and 9) and returns a result based on the values of `x` and `y`.**
