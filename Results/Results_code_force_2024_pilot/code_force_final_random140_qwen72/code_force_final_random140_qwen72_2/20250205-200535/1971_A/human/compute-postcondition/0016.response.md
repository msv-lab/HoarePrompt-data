Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is 0
- `n` is greater than 1
- `i` is 1
- `a` and `b` are input integers
- If `a` is greater than `b`, the condition `a > b` holds true
- If `a` is less than or equal to `b`, the condition `a <= b` holds true
- If `a` is equal to `b`, the condition `a == b` holds true
- Otherwise, `a` is less than `b`

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(a, ' ', b)
```

This statement will print the values of `a` and `b` separated by a space.

Since the values of `a` and `b` are not explicitly defined in the initial state, they are input integers. Therefore, the output will depend on the specific values of `a` and `b` that are provided as input.

Output: **a, b (where a and b are the input integers)**
