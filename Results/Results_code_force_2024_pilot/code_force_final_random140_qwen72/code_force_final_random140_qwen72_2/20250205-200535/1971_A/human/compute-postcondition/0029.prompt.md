You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 100, and for each of the t test cases, x and y are integers where 0 <= x, y <= 9.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    t = 0
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a > b:
            print(a, ' ', b)
        elif a == b:
            print(a, ' ', b)
        else:
            print(b, ' ', a)
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is `n-1`, and for each iteration, `a` and `b` are input integers. For each pair of `a` and `b`, if `a` is greater than `b`, the condition `a > b` holds true and `a` and `b` are printed in that order. If `a` is equal to `b`, the condition `a == b` holds true and `a` and `b` are printed in that order. If `a` is less than `b`, the condition `a < b` holds true and `b` and `a` are printed in that order.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 100). For each test case, it takes two integers `x` and `y` (0 <= x, y <= 9) and returns a result based on these inputs. The specific output for each test case is not specified, but it is implied that the function will produce some form of output for each combination of `x` and `y` within the given constraints.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
