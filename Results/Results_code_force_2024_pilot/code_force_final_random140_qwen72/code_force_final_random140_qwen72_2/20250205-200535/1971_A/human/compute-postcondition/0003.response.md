Initial State: `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and does not need adjustment, `a` and `b` are the integers entered by the user.

Given the initial state, the variables `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user. The `print` statement will output the maximum and minimum of these two integers.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. `max(a, b)` will return the larger of the two integers `a` and `b`.
2. `min(a, b)` will return the smaller of the two integers `a` and `b`.
3. The `print` statement will print these two values in the order: maximum value first, followed by the minimum value.

Since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **max(a, b), min(a, b) (where max(a, b) is the larger of the two integers a and b, and min(a, b) is the smaller of the two integers a and b)**
