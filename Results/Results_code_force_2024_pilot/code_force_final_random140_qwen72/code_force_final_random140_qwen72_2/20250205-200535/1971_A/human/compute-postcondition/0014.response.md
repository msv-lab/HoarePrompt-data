Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` and `b` are input integers. If `a` is greater than `b`, the condition `a > b` holds true. If `a` is less than or equal to `b`, the condition `a <= b` holds true. If `a` is equal to `b`, the condition `a == b` holds true. Otherwise, `a` is less than `b`.** 

Explanation: The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged. The values of `a` and `b` are updated to the input integers provided by the user. The conditions regarding the relationship between `a` and `b` (whether `a` is greater than, less than or equal to, or equal to `b`) are still valid based on the new values of `a` and `b`.
