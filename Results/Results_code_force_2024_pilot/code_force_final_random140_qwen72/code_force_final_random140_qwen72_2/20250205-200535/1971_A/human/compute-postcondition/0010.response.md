Initial State: `t` must be greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder and does not need adjustment, `a` and `b` are the integers entered by the user.

Given the initial state, we know:
- `t` is a variable that must be greater than 1.
- `_` is a placeholder and does not affect the execution of the code.
- `a` and `b` are integers entered by the user.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(max(a, b), min(a, b))
```

This code will print the maximum and minimum of the two integers `a` and `b`.

Explanation:
- `max(a, b)` returns the larger of the two integers `a` and `b`.
- `min(a, b)` returns the smaller of the two integers `a` and `b`.

Therefore, the output will be the larger integer followed by the smaller integer.

Output: **max(a, b), min(a, b) (where max(a, b) is the larger of the two integers a and b, and min(a, b) is the smaller of the two integers a and b)**
