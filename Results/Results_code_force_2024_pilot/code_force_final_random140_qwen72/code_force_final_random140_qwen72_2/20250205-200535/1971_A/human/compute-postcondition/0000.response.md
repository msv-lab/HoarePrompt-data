The value of `t` is updated to the integer value provided by the user input. The constraints for `t` (1 <= t <= 100) and the conditions for `x` and `y` (0 <= x, y <= 9) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer provided by the user input, 1 <= t <= 100, and for each test case, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 9.**
