The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be explicitly set.

Given that `t` is an integer provided by the user input and is within the range 1 <= t <= 100, the loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. Therefore, the state needs to ensure that `t` is at least 1.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and does not need adjustment**
