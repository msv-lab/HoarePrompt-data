Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `n` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`. It then prints the larger of the two integers followed by the smaller one. After processing all test cases, the function ends with no return value. The variables `t` and `i` are not used in the function's logic and do not affect the output. **
