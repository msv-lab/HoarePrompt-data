Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is `n-1`, and for each iteration, `a` and `b` are input integers. For each pair of `a` and `b`, if `a` is greater than `b`, the condition `a > b` holds true and `a` and `b` are printed in that order. If `a` is equal to `b`, the condition `a == b` holds true and `a` and `b` are printed in that order. If `a` is less than `b`, the condition `a < b` holds true and `b` and `a` are printed in that order.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop, the variable `t` remains 0 (as it is not modified within the loop), `n` is the total number of iterations that the loop has executed, and `i` is the last index of the loop, which is `n-1`. For each iteration, the values of `a` and `b` are determined by the input, and the conditions within the loop determine the order in which they are printed.
