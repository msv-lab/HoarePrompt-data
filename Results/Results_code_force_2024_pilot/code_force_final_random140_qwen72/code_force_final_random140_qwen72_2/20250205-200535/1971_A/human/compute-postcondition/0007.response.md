The only object in the loop head that can be adjusted is the variable `_` (which is a placeholder and does not need adjustment) and `t`. The loop's continuation depends on the value of `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0, but since `_` is incremented by 1 each time through the loop, the effective state is that `t` must be greater than 1 at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder and does not need adjustment, `a` and `b` are the integers entered by the user.**
