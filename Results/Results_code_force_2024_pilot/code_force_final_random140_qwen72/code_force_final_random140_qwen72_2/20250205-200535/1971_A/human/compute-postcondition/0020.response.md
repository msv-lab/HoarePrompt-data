The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`t` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are input integers. If `a` is greater than `b`, the condition `a > b` holds true. If `a` is equal to `b`, the condition `a == b` holds true. If `a` is less than `b`, the condition `a < b` holds true.**
