Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and for each of the `t` test cases, `n` is an input integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `a` is an input integer within the range \(1 \leq a \leq 30\), `b` is an input integer within the range \(1 \leq b \leq 30\), `s1` is equal to `n * a`, `s2` is equal to `b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a`. The loop has printed the minimum value between `s1` and `s2` for each test case.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `t` remains a positive integer within the specified range, and for each of the `t` test cases, the variables `n`, `a`, and `b` have been processed according to the given constraints. For each test case, the loop has calculated `s1` as `n * a` and `s2` as `b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a`, and it has printed the smaller of these two values. This process has been repeated for all `t` test cases.
