You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, n, a, and b are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        s1 = n * a
        
        s2 = b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a
        
        print(min(s1, s2))
        
    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and for each of the `t` test cases, `n` is an input integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `a` is an input integer within the range \(1 \leq a \leq 30\), `b` is an input integer within the range \(1 \leq b \leq 30\), `s1` is equal to `n * a`, `s2` is equal to `b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a`. The loop has printed the minimum value between `s1` and `s2` for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a positive integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` within specified ranges. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
