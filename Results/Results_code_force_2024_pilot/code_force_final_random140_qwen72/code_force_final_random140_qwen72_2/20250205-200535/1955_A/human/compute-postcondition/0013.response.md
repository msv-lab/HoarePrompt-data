The code snippet updates the value of `s2` to be equal to `b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a`. Let's break down the impact:

- `n // 2` gives the integer division of `n` by 2.
- `n % 2` gives the remainder when `n` is divided by 2, which will be 0 if `n` is even and 1 if `n` is odd.
- `b * (n // 2)` multiplies `b` by the integer division of `n` by 2.
- `n % 2 * a` multiplies `a` by the remainder of `n` divided by 2.
- The new value of `s2` is the sum of these two expressions.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an input integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 10^4\).
- `a` is an input integer within the range \(1 \leq a \leq 10^4\).
- `b` is an input integer within the range \(1 \leq b \leq 10^4\).
- `s1` is equal to `n * a`.
- `s2` was initially equal to `b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a`.

After executing the code:
- `s2` is updated to `b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a`.

Since the expression for `s2` remains the same, the value of `s2` does not change.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 10^4\), `a` is an input integer within the range \(1 \leq a \leq 10^4\), `b` is an input integer within the range \(1 \leq b \leq 10^4\), `s1` is equal to `n * a`, `s2` is equal to `b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a`.**
