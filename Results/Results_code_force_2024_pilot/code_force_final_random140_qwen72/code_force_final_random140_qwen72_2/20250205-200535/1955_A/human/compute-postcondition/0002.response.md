Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 10^4\), `a` is a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq a \leq 10^4\), `b` is a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq b \leq 10^4\), `s1` is equal to `n * a`.** 

The variable `s1` is now assigned the value of the product of `n` and `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
