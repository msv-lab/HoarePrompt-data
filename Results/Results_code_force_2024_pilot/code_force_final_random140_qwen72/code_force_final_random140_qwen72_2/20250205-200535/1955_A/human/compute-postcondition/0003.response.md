The code snippet `s2 = b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a` calculates the value of `s2` based on the given values of `b`, `n`, and `a`. Here's the step-by-step calculation:

1. `n // 2` computes the integer division of `n` by 2, which gives the quotient.
2. `n % 2` computes the remainder when `n` is divided by 2, which is 0 if `n` is even and 1 if `n` is odd.
3. `b * (n // 2)` multiplies the quotient by `b`.
4. `n % 2 * a` multiplies the remainder by `a`.
5. The sum of these two results is assigned to `s2`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 10^4\)
- `a` is a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq a \leq 10^4\)
- `b` is a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq b \leq 10^4\)
- `s1` is equal to `n * a`

After executing the code snippet, the new state is:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 10^4\)
- `a` is a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq a \leq 10^4\)
- `b` is a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq b \leq 10^4\)
- `s1` is equal to `n * a`
- `s2` is equal to `b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a`

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 10^4\), `a` is a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq a \leq 10^4\), `b` is a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq b \leq 10^4\), `s1` is equal to `n * a`, `s2` is equal to `b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a`**
