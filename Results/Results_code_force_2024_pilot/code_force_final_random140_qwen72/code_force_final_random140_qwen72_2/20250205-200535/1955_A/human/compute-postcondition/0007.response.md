Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 10^4\), `a` is an input integer within the range \(1 \leq a \leq 10^4\), `b` is an input integer within the range \(1 \leq b \leq 10^4\), `s1` is equal to `n * a`, `s2` is equal to the old value of `b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `s1` is updated to `n * a`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `s2`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
