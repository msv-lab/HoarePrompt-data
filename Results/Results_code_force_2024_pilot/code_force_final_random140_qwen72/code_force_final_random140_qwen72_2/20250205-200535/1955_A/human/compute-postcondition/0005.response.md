The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is the loop counter. The loop iterates a number of times specified by the user input, which is converted to an integer. Since the loop counter `_` is not explicitly managed or modified within the loop head, it is incremented implicitly by the `for` loop mechanism.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state includes the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `s1`, and `s2`. However, these variables are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are iterations left based on the user input.

Since the loop counter `_` is not explicitly tracked in the given state, we assume that the loop has not yet completed all its iterations if the user input specifies more than one iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration remains unchanged for `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `s1`, and `s2`. The only change is that the loop counter `_` is incremented by 1, but this is implicit and not part of the state description.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 10^4\), `a` is a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq a \leq 10^4\), `b` is a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq b \leq 10^4\), `s1` is equal to `n * a`, `s2` is equal to `b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a`**
