The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the parameter constraints and relationships described, it is implied that the function accepts parameters related to a series of test cases. Specifically, it accepts a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, it also accepts three integers: `n`, `a`, and `b`, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30.

However, since the output of the function is not specified in the problem statement, I cannot definitively describe what the function returns. Assuming the function processes these inputs and returns some result for each test case, the general functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` within specified ranges. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case.**
