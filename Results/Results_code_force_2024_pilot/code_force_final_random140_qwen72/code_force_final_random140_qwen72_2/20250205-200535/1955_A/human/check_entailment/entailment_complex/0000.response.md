Reasoning:  
The program correctly addresses the problem statement by calculating the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts under the given conditions. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually. This aligns with the problem statement which specifies multiple test cases.

2. **Cost Calculation**:
   - `s1` is calculated as `n * a`, which represents the total cost if all yogurts are bought at the regular price.
   - `s2` is calculated as `b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a`, which represents the total cost if as many pairs of yogurts as possible are bought at the promotional price, and any remaining single yogurt is bought at the regular price.

3. **Minimum Cost Selection**: The program prints the minimum of `s1` and `s2` for each test case, ensuring that the least expensive option is chosen.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `n` is even, `n % 2` will be 0, so the formula simplifies to `b * (n // 2)`.
   - If `n` is odd, `n % 2` will be 1, so the formula accounts for the extra single yogurt at the regular price.

5. **Output**: The program prints the result for each test case, which matches the expected output format.

Given these points, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem and handles all specified edge cases.

Correctness: **True**
