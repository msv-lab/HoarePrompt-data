Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program correctly handles the problem description for all potential cases. It calculates the total cost of buying `n` yogurts either at the regular price (`s1`) or using the promotion price where applicable (`s2`). The program then prints the minimum of these two costs. This approach ensures that the minimum cost is always found, whether the promotion is beneficial or not. The logic correctly accounts for the remainder when `n` is odd, ensuring that the last yogurt is bought at the regular price if necessary. Therefore, the program works correctly for all inputs within the specified constraints.
