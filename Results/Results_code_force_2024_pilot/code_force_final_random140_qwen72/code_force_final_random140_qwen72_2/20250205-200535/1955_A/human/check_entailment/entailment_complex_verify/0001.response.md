Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to find the minimum cost to buy `n` yogurts given two pricing options: buying each yogurt individually at `a` burles, or buying two yogurts together at `b` burles. This is correctly understood and implemented in the program.

2. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading `n`, `a`, and `b`. This is done using `int(input())` for `t` and `map(int, input().split())` for `n`, `a`, and `b`.

3. **Calculating Costs**:
   - `s1` calculates the total cost if all yogurts are bought individually: `n * a`. This is straightforward and correct.
   - `s2` calculates the total cost if as many pairs of yogurts as possible are bought at the promotion price `b`, and any remaining single yogurt is bought at the individual price `a`. This is done using the formula `b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a`. This formula is also correct and handles both even and odd values of `n` appropriately.

4. **Finding the Minimum Cost**: The program then prints the minimum of the two calculated costs using `min(s1, s2)`. This ensures that the least expensive option is chosen, which is the correct approach.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `n` is even, `n % 2` will be 0, so the formula simplifies to `b * (n // 2)`.
   - If `n` is odd, `n % 2` will be 1, so the formula becomes `b * (n // 2) + a`.
   - Both scenarios are correctly handled by the program.

6. **Verification with Example**:
   - For `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`:
     - `s1 = 2 * 5 = 10`
     - `s2 = 9 * (2 // 2) + 2 % 2 * 5 = 9`
     - Output: `9`
   - For `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`:
     - `s1 = 3 * 5 = 15`
     - `s2 = 9 * (3 // 2) + 3 % 2 * 5 = 9 + 5 = 14`
     - Output: `14`
   - For `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`:
     - `s1 = 3 * 5 = 15`
     - `s2 = 11 * (3 // 2) + 3 % 2 * 5 = 11 + 5 = 16`
     - Output: `15`
   - For `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`:
     - `s1 = 4 * 5 = 20`
     - `s2 = 11 * (4 // 2) + 4 % 2 * 5 = 11 * 2 = 22`
     - Output: `20`

All calculations match the expected outputs, confirming that the program works correctly.

Final: **True**
