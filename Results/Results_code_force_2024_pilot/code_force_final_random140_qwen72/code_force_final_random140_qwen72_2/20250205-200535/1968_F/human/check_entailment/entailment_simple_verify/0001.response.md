### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The function `func_1` is used to parse input and convert it to the specified type (int in this case). This is correctly implemented.
   - The main function `func_3` reads the number of elements `n` and the number of queries `q`.
   - It then reads the array `a` and initializes a prefix XOR array `x` with an initial value of 0.
   - A dictionary `inds` is used to store the indices of each prefix XOR value. This is also correctly implemented.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation:**
   - The prefix XOR array `x` is calculated such that `x[i]` is the XOR of the first `i` elements of `a`. This is done correctly in the loop:
     ```python
     for i in a:
         x.append(x[-1] ^ i)
         inds[x[-1]].append(len(x) - 1)
     ```
   - This allows us to quickly compute the XOR of any subarray using the formula `x[r] ^ x[l-1]`.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query `(l, r)`, the function checks if the subarray `a[l-1:r]` is interesting.
   - If `x[l-1] == x[r]`, it means the XOR of the subarray is 0, which is always interesting. This condition is correctly checked.
   - Otherwise, it uses binary search (`func_2`) to find the positions of `x[r]` and `x[l-1]` in the `inds` dictionary.
   - The binary search function `func_2` is used to find the largest index less than `l` for `x[r]` and the smallest index greater than or equal to `r` for `x[l-1]`.
   - The conditions for checking if there is a valid partition are:
     ```python
     if upper > lower and l <= upper <= r and l <= lower <= r:
         print('Yes')
     else:
         print('No')
     ```
   - These conditions ensure that there is a valid partition where the XOR of each segment is the same.

4. **Binary Search Function:**
   - The function `func_2` performs a binary search to find the largest index less than `l` for `x[r]` and the smallest index greater than or equal to `r` for `x[l-1]`.
   - The binary search is implemented correctly and efficiently.

5. **Output:**
   - If the conditions for an interesting subarray are met, it prints "Yes".
   - Otherwise, it prints "No".

### Final Evaluation:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is interesting based on the given problem description. The use of prefix XOR and binary search ensures efficient query processing. The conditions checked in the query processing are logically sound and cover all necessary cases.

Final: **True**
