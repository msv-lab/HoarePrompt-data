Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles the input using `func_1` to read the number of test cases, the size of the array, and the queries. This is done efficiently and correctly.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation**: The function `func_3` calculates the prefix XOR array `x` and stores the indices of each XOR value in a dictionary `inds`. This is a crucial step for efficiently answering the queries.

3. **Query Processing**: For each query, the program checks if the XOR of the subarray `a[l-1:r]` is zero. If it is, the subarray is trivially interesting, and the program prints "Yes". If not, it uses binary search (`func_2`) to find the appropriate indices in the `inds` dictionary to check if the subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR values. The conditions for checking the indices are correctly implemented.

4. **Binary Search Function**: The function `func_2` performs a binary search to find the largest index in the list `arr` for which the predicate is true. This is used to efficiently find the required indices in the `inds` dictionary.

5. **Output**: The program correctly prints "Yes" or "No" for each query based on the conditions checked.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
