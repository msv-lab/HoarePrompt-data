### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to determine if a subarray `a[l-1:r]` can be divided into more than one part such that the bitwise XOR of each part is the same.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1`**: This function reads input and converts it to the specified type. It is used to read the number of test cases `t` and the array `a` and queries.
   - **`func_2`**: This function performs a binary search to find the largest index in `arr` where the predicate is true. It is used to find specific indices in the `inds` dictionary.
   - **`func_3`**: This function processes each test case. It constructs a prefix XOR array `x` and a dictionary `inds` that maps each unique XOR value to its indices. For each query, it checks if the subarray `a[l-1:r]` is interesting by comparing the XOR values and using binary search to find appropriate indices.

3. **Key Points**:
   - **Prefix XOR Array**: The prefix XOR array `x` is constructed such that `x[i]` is the XOR of the first `i` elements of `a`. This helps in quickly calculating the XOR of any subarray.
   - **Dictionary `inds`**: This dictionary maps each unique XOR value to its indices in the prefix XOR array. This helps in efficiently checking if there are indices that satisfy the conditions for the subarray to be interesting.
   - **Query Processing**: For each query `(l, r)`, the function checks if `x[l-1] == x[r]` (which means the XOR of the subarray is zero). If not, it uses binary search to find indices that satisfy the conditions for the subarray to be interesting.

4. **Correctness**:
   - The construction of the prefix XOR array and the dictionary `inds` is correct and efficient.
   - The logic for checking if a subarray is interesting is implemented correctly using the properties of XOR and binary search.
   - The function handles all edge cases and constraints mentioned in the problem description.

### Conclusion:
