You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

from collections import defaultdict
#Function 1:
def func_1(cast):
    return map(cast, input().split())

#Function 2:
def func_2(arr, predicate):
    (l, r) = (0, len(arr))
    while l + 1 < r:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        if predicate(arr[mid]):
            l = mid
        else:
            r = mid
    if predicate(arr[l]):
        return l
    return None

    a = list(func_1(int))
    x = [0]

    for i in a:
        x.append(x[-1] ^ i)
        inds[x[-1]].append(len(x) - 1)
    for i in range(q):
        (l, r) = func_1(int)
        if x[l - 1] == x[r]:
            print('Yes')
            continue
        lower = func_2(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or -1
        upper = func_2(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)
        lower = inds[x[r]][lower + 1]
        upper = inds[x[l - 1]][upper]
        if upper > lower and l <= upper <= r and (l <= lower <= r):
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function `func_3` processes a series of queries on a list of integers. It takes no explicit parameters but internally uses `func_1` to obtain the values of `n` (the length of the list `a`), `q` (the number of queries), and the list `a` itself. For each query, it receives two integers `l` and `r` (1 ≤ l < r ≤ n). The function computes a prefix XOR array `x` and a dictionary `inds` mapping each unique XOR value to its indices in `x`. For each query, it checks if the XOR of the subarray `a[l-1:r]` is zero or if there exist indices within the subarray that satisfy certain conditions. If these conditions are met, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. After processing all queries, the function does not return any value, but it has printed the results for each query.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The function `func_1` is used to parse input and convert it to the specified type (int in this case).
   - The main function `func_3` reads the number of elements `n` and the number of queries `q`.
   - It then reads the array `a` and initializes a prefix XOR array `x` with an initial value of 0.
   - A dictionary `inds` is used to store the indices of each prefix XOR value.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation:**
   - The prefix XOR array `x` is calculated such that `x[i]` is the XOR of the first `i` elements of `a`.
   - This allows us to quickly compute the XOR of any subarray using the formula `x[r] ^ x[l-1]`.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query `(l, r)`, the function checks if the subarray `a[l-1:r]` is interesting.
   - If `x[l-1] == x[r]`, it means the XOR of the subarray is 0, which is always interesting.
   - Otherwise, it uses binary search (`func_2`) to find the positions of `x[r]` and `x[l-1]` in the `inds` dictionary.
   - It checks if there exists a valid partition where the XOR of each segment is the same.

4. **Binary Search Function:**
   - The function `func_2` performs a binary search to find the largest index less than `l` for `x[r]` and the smallest index greater than or equal to `r` for `x[l-1]`.
   - This helps in determining if there is a valid partition.

5. **Output:**
   - If the conditions for an interesting subarray are met, it prints "Yes".
   - Otherwise, it prints "No".

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is interesting based on the given problem description. The use of prefix XOR and binary search ensures efficient query processing. The conditions checked in the query processing are logically sound and cover all necessary cases.

Correctness: **True**
