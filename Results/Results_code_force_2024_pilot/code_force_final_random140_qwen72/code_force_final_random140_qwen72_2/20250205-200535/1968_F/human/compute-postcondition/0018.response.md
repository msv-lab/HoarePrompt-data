Let's break down the initial state and the provided Python code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`a`**: A non-empty list of integers.
2. **`n` and `q`**: Updated to the values returned by `func_1(int)`, with the constraint that `q` must be greater than 0.
3. **`l` and `r`**: Updated to the values returned by `func_1(int)`.
4. **`x`**: A list constructed such that each element `x_i` is the result of the XOR operation between the previous element in `x` and the corresponding element in `a`. Specifically, `x` starts with `[0, x_1, x_2, ..., x_m]` where `x_1 = a[0]`, `x_2 = x_1 ^ a[1]`, and so on.
5. **`inds`**: A defaultdict of lists where each key is an element from `x` and the value is a list of indices where that element appears in `x`.
6. **`i`**: Set to 0.
7. **Element at index `l - 1` in `x` is equal to the element at index `r` in `x`**.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Yes')
```

### Analysis:
- The condition given is that the element at index `l - 1` in `x` is equal to the element at index `r` in `x`.
- This condition is explicitly stated in the initial state, meaning it is true by definition.
- Therefore, the `print` statement will execute and print the string `'Yes'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **Yes**
