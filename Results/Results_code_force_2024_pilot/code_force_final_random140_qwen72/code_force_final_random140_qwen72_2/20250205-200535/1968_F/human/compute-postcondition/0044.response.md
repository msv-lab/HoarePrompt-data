To determine what will be printed by the `print('Yes')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the context provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `a` is a non-empty list of integers.
   - `n` and `q` are updated to the values returned by `func_1(int)`, with the constraint that `q` must be greater than 1.
   - `l` and `r` are updated to the new values returned by `func_1(int)`.
   - `x` is a list containing the elements `[0, x_1, x_2, ..., x_m]`, where each `x_i` is the result of the XOR operation between the previous element in `x` and the corresponding element in `a`.
   - `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is an element from `x` and the value is a list of indices where that element appears in `x`.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `lower` is the next index in `inds[x[r]]` after the highest index in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l` or -1 if no such index exists.
   - `upper` is the value of `inds[x[l - 1]][upper]`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is simply `print('Yes')`.

Given the initial state and the context, the `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'Yes'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **Yes**
