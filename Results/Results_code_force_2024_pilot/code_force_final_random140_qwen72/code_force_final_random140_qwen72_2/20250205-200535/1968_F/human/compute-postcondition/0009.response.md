Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers, `n` and `q` are updated to the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 â‰¤ l < r â‰¤ n, `x` is a list containing the elements `[0, i_value, x[-1] ^ i]`, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists with `inds[0]` now containing the list `[0]` and `inds[i_value]` now containing the list `[1]`, `i` is the next integer in `a`.**

Explanation:
- The code appends the result of `x[-1] ^ i` to the list `x`.
- `x[-1]` refers to the last element in the list `x`, which is `i_value`.
- `i` is the next integer in the list `a`.
- The new element appended to `x` is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between `i_value` and `i`.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
