Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers, `n` and `q` are updated to the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 â‰¤ l < r â‰¤ n, `x` is a list containing the elements `[0, i_value]`, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists with `inds[0]` now containing the list `[0]` and `inds[i_value]` now containing the list `[1]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `inds[x[-1]].append(len(x) - 1)` appends the index of the last element in `x` (which is `1` since `len(x) - 1` equals `1`) to the list `inds[i_value]`.
- Since `x` contains the elements `[0, i_value]`, `x[-1]` is `i_value`.
- Therefore, `inds[i_value]` now contains the list `[1]`.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
