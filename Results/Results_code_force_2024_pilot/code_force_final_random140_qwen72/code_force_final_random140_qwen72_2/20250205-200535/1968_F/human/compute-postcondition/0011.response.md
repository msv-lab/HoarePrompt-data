The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, which is iterated over the list `a`. Therefore, we can only adjust `i` based on the iteration process.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` was the next integer in `a`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be the subsequent integer in `a`.

State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers, `n` and `q` are updated to the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n, `x` is a list containing the elements `[0, i_value, x[-1] ^ i]`, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists with `inds[0]` containing `[0]`, `inds[i_value]` containing `[1, 2]`, and `i` is the next integer in `a`**
