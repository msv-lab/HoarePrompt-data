To determine what will be printed by the `print('Yes')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Variables and Objects:**
   - `a`: A non-empty list of integers.
   - `n` and `q`: Updated to the values returned by `func_1(int)`, with the condition that `q` must be greater than 0.
   - `l` and `r`: Updated to the values returned by `func_1(int)`.
   - `x`: A list containing the elements `[0, x_1, x_2, ..., x_m]` where each `x_i` is the result of the XOR operation between the previous element in `x` and the corresponding element in `a`.
   - `inds`: A defaultdict of lists where each key is an element from `x` and the value is a list of indices where that element appears in `x`.
   - `i`: Set to 0.
   - `lower`: The next index in `inds[x[r]]` after the highest index in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l` or -1 if no such index exists.
   - `upper`: The index in `inds[x[l - 1]]` at position `upper`, with the condition that `upper` is greater than `lower`.
   - `l` is less than or equal to `upper` which is less than or equal to `r`.
   - `l` is less than or equal to `lower` which is less than or equal to `r`.

2. **Conditions:**
   - The conditions ensure that `l`, `r`, `lower`, and `upper` are within valid ranges and that `upper` is greater than `lower`.

Given these conditions, the `print('Yes')` statement will simply print the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
