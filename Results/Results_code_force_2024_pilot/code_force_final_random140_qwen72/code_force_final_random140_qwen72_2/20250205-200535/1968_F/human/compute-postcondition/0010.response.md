The code `inds[x[-1]].append(len(x) - 1)` appends the index of the last element in the list `x` to the list stored in the dictionary `inds` under the key `x[-1]`.

Let's break down the impact of this code:

- `x[-1]` refers to the last element in the list `x`. Given the initial state, `x` is a list containing the elements `[0, i_value, x[-1] ^ i]`. Therefore, `x[-1]` is `x[-1] ^ i`.
- `len(x) - 1` calculates the index of the last element in the list `x`. Since `x` has 3 elements, `len(x) - 1` is `2`.
- `inds[x[-1]].append(len(x) - 1)` appends `2` to the list in `inds` under the key `x[-1]`.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is a non-empty list of integers.
- `n` and `q` are updated to the values returned by `func_1(int)`.
- `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n.
- `x` is a list containing the elements `[0, i_value, x[-1] ^ i]`.
- `inds` is a defaultdict of lists with `inds[0]` now containing the list `[0]` and `inds[i_value]` now containing the list `[1]`.
- `i` is the next integer in `a`.

After executing the code:
- `inds[x[-1]]` (which is `inds[x[-1] ^ i]`) now contains the list `[1, 2]`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers, `n` and `q` are updated to the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n, `x` is a list containing the elements `[0, i_value, x[-1] ^ i]`, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists with `inds[0]` containing `[0]`, `inds[i_value]` containing `[1, 2]`, and `i` is the next integer in `a`.**
