To determine what will be printed by the `print('Yes')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the context in which the statement is executed:

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`a`**: A non-empty list of integers.
2. **`n` and `q`**: Updated to the values returned by `func_1(int)`, with the constraint that `q` must be greater than 1.
3. **`l` and `r`**: Updated to the new values returned by `func_1(int)`.
4. **`x`**: A list containing the elements `[0, x_1, x_2, ..., x_m]` where each `x_i` is the result of the XOR operation between the previous element in `x` and the corresponding element in `a`.
5. **`inds`**: A defaultdict of lists where each key is an element from `x` and the value is a list of indices where that element appears in `x`.
6. **`i`**: Set to 1.
7. **`lower`**: The next index in `inds[x[r]]` after the highest index in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l` or -1 if no such index exists.
8. **`upper`**: The value of `inds[x[l - 1]][upper]`.
9. **Condition**: If `x[l - 1] == x[r]`, the current iteration of the loop ends and moves to the next iteration. Otherwise, the conditions regarding `upper` and `lower` remain as specified in the precondition, and `lower` is now the value of `inds[x[r]][lower + 1]`.

### Analysis:
- The `print('Yes')` statement is a simple print statement that outputs the string `'Yes'`.
- The initial state and the conditions described do not affect the content of the `print` statement itself. They only describe the state of the program before the `print` statement is executed.

### Conclusion:
The `print('Yes')` statement will simply print the string `'Yes'` regardless of the initial state and the conditions described.

Output: **Yes**
