To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `n` and `q` are updated to the values returned by `func_1(int)`.
- `a` is a list of integers returned by `func_1(int)`.
- `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n.
- `x` is a list containing the single element 0.
- `inds` is a defaultdict of lists with `inds[0]` now containing the list `[0]`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in a:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the elements in the list `a`.
- For the loop to execute, `a` must contain at least one element.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The only object in the loop head that can be adjusted is `a`.
- To ensure the loop executes, `a` must be a non-empty list.

### Final State:
- `a` must be a non-empty list of integers.
- All other variables (`n`, `q`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `inds`) remain as they are, since they are not directly involved in the loop head.

### State:
**`a` is a non-empty list of integers, `n` and `q` are updated to the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n, `x` is a list containing the single element 0, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists with `inds[0]` now containing the list `[0]`**
