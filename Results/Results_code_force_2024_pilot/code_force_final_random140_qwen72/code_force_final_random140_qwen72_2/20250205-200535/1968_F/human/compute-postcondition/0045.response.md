The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. Since there is no loop explicitly shown in the provided code snippet, the effect of `continue` is undefined in isolation. However, assuming this code is part of a larger loop structure, the `continue` statement would cause the program to immediately jump to the next iteration of that loop.

Given the initial state and the presence of `continue`, the values of the variables do not change, but the control flow of the program is affected. Here is the output state:

Output State: **`a` remains a non-empty list of integers, `n` and `q` are updated to the values returned by `func_1(int)` where `q` must be greater than 1, `l` and `r` are updated to the new values returned by `func_1(int)`, `x` is a list containing the elements `[0, x_1, x_2, ..., x_m]` where each `x_i` is the result of the XOR operation between the previous element in `x` and the corresponding element in `a`, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is an element from `x` and the value is a list of indices where that element appears in `x`, `i` is 2, `lower` is the next index in `inds[x[r]]` after the highest index in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l` or -1 if no such index exists, `upper` is the value of `inds[x[l - 1]][upper]`. The program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop.**
