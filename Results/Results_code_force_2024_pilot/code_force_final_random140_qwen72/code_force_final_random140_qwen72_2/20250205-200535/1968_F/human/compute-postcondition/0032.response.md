To determine what will be printed by the `print('Yes')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `a` is a non-empty list of integers.
   - `n` and `q` are updated to the values returned by `func_1(int)` where `q` must be greater than 1.
   - `l` and `r` are updated to the new values returned by `func_1(int)`.
   - `x` is a list containing the elements `[0, x_1, x_2, ..., x_m]` where each `x_i` is the result of the XOR operation between the previous element in `x` and the corresponding element in `a`.
   - `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is an element from `x` and the value is a list of indices where that element appears in `x`.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `lower` is the next index in `inds[x[r]]` after the highest index in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l` or -1 if no such index exists.
   - `upper` is now the index in `inds[x[l - 1]]` at position `upper`.

2. **Conditions:**
   - If `upper` is greater than `lower`, `l` is less than or equal to `upper`, `upper` is less than or equal to `r`, and `l` is less than or equal to `lower`, `lower` is less than or equal to `r`.
   - Otherwise, either `upper` is not greater than `lower`, or `l` is not less than or equal to `upper`, or `upper` is not less than or equal to `r`, or `l` is not less than or equal to `lower`, or `lower` is not less than or equal to `r`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The code snippet contains the line `print('Yes')`.

Given the conditions, the `print('Yes')` statement will execute regardless of the specific values of `upper`, `lower`, `l`, and `r` because the conditions are structured in a way that they either all hold true or none of them do. The `print` statement itself does not depend on these conditions; it simply prints the string `'Yes'`.

Therefore, the output of the code snippet is:

Output: **Yes**
