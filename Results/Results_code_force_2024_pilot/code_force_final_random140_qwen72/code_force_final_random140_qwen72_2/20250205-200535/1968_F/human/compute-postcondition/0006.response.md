The code snippet `x.append(x[-1] ^ i)` appends the result of the XOR operation between the last element of `x` and `i` to the list `x`. Since `i` is not defined in the initial state, it is assumed to be a variable that is defined in the context where this code is executed. However, based on the initial state, `x` starts as a list containing the single element `0`.

Let's assume `i` is a variable that has a specific value (let's denote this value as `i_value`). The operation `x[-1] ^ i` will compute the XOR of `0` (the last element of `x`) and `i_value`, and append the result to `x`.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Initial State:**
   - `a` is a non-empty list of integers.
   - `n` and `q` are updated to the values returned by `func_1(int)`.
   - `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n.
   - `x` is a list containing the single element `0`.
   - `inds` is a defaultdict of lists with `inds[0]` now containing the list `[0]`.

2. **Code Execution:**
   - `x.append(x[-1] ^ i)`:
     - `x[-1]` is `0` (the last element of `x`).
     - `x[-1] ^ i` computes `0 ^ i_value`, which is simply `i_value` (since `0 ^ any_value = any_value`).
     - The result `i_value` is appended to `x`.

3. **Updated State:**
   - `x` now contains `[0, i_value]`.

### Output State:
**`a` is a non-empty list of integers, `n` and `q` are updated to the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n, `x` is a list containing the elements `[0, i_value]`, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists with `inds[0]` now containing the list `[0]`.**
