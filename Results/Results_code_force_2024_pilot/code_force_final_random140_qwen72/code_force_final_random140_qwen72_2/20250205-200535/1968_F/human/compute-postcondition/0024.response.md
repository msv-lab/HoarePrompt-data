Output State: **`a` remains a non-empty list of integers, `n` and `q` are updated to the values returned by `func_1(int)` where `q` must be greater than 0, `l` and `r` are updated to the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `x` is a list containing the elements `[0, x_1, x_2, ..., x_m]` where each `x_i` is the result of the XOR operation between the previous element in `x` and the corresponding element in `a`, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is an element from `x` and the value is a list of indices where that element appears in `x`, `i` is 0, `lower` is the next index in `inds[x[r]]` after the highest index in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l` or -1 if no such index exists, `upper` is now the index in `inds[x[l - 1]]` at position `upper`.**
