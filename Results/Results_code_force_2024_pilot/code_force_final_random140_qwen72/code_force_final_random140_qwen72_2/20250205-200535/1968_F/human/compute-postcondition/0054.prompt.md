Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After all iterations of the loop, `a` remains a non-empty list of integers, `n` and `q` are updated to the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n, `x` is a list containing the elements `[0, x_1, x_2, ..., x_m]` where each `x_i` is the result of the XOR operation between the previous element in `x` and the corresponding element in `a`, and `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is an element from `x` and the value is a list of indices where that element appears in `x`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(q):
    l, r = func_1(int)
    if x[l - 1] == x[r]:
        print('Yes')
        continue
    lower = func_2(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or -1
    upper = func_2(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)
    lower = inds[x[r]][lower + 1]
    upper = inds[x[l - 1]][upper]
    if upper > lower and l <= upper <= r and l <= lower <= r:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` remains a non-empty list of integers, `n` and `q` are updated to the values returned by `func_1(int)` where `q` must be greater than 0, `l` and `r` are updated to the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `x` is a list containing the elements `[0, x_1, x_2, ..., x_m]` where each `x_i` is the result of the XOR operation between the previous element in `x` and the corresponding element in `a`, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is an element from `x` and the value is a list of indices where that element appears in `x`, `i` is 0, `lower` is the next index in `inds[x[r]]` after the highest index in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l` or -1 if no such index exists, `upper` is now the index in `inds[x[l - 1]]` at position `upper`. If `upper` is greater than `lower`, `l` is less than or equal to `upper`, `upper` is less than or equal to `r`, and `l` is less than or equal to `lower`, `lower` is less than or equal to `r`. Otherwise, either `upper` is not greater than `lower`, or `l` is not less than or equal to `upper`, or `upper` is not less than or equal to `r`, or `l` is not less than or equal to `lower`, or `lower` is not less than or equal to `r`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`a` remains a non-empty list of integers, `n` and `q` are updated to the values returned by `func_1(int)` where `q` must be greater than 1, `l` and `r` are updated to the new values returned by `func_1(int)`, `x` is a list containing the elements `[0, x_1, x_2, ..., x_m]` where each `x_i` is the result of the XOR operation between the previous element in `x` and the corresponding element in `a`, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is an element from `x` and the value is a list of indices where that element appears in `x`, `i` is 1, `lower` is the next index in `inds[x[r]]` after the highest index in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l` or -1 if no such index exists, `upper` is the value of `inds[x[l - 1]][upper]`. If `x[l - 1] == x[r]`, the current iteration of the loop ends and moves to the next iteration. If `upper > lower` and both `upper` and `lower` are within the range `[l, r]`, then `lower` is updated to the next index in `inds[x[r]]` after the current `lower`. Otherwise, the conditions regarding `upper` and `lower` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`a` remains a non-empty list of integers, `n` and `q` are updated to the values returned by `func_1(int)` where `q` must be greater than 1, `l` and `r` are updated to the new values returned by `func_1(int)`, `x` is a list containing the elements `[0, x_1, x_2, ..., x_m]` where each `x_i` is the result of the XOR operation between the previous element in `x` and the corresponding element in `a`, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is an element from `x` and the value is a list of indices where that element appears in `x`, `i` is 2, `lower` is the next index in `inds[x[r]]` after the highest index in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l` or -1 if no such index exists, `upper` is the value of `inds[x[l - 1]][upper]`, `lower` is now the value of `inds[x[r]][lower + 1]`. If `upper > lower` and `l <= upper <= r` and `(l <= lower <= r)`, then the conditions specified in the if part hold true. Otherwise, the conditions specified in the else part hold true.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
