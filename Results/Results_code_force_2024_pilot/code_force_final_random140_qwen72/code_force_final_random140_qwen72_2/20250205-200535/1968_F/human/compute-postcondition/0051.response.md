Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`a`**: A non-empty list of integers.
2. **`n` and `q`**: Updated to the values returned by `func_1(int)`, with the constraint that `q` must be greater than 1.
3. **`l` and `r`**: Updated to the new values returned by `func_1(int)`.
4. **`x`**: A list containing the elements `[0, x_1, x_2, ..., x_m]` where each `x_i` is the result of the XOR operation between the previous element in `x` and the corresponding element in `a`.
5. **`inds`**: A defaultdict of lists where each key is an element from `x` and the value is a list of indices where that element appears in `x`.
6. **`i`**: Set to 2.
7. **`lower`**: The next index in `inds[x[r]]` after the highest index in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l` or -1 if no such index exists.
8. **`upper`**: The value of `inds[x[l - 1]][upper]`.
9. **`lower`**: Now the value of `inds[x[r]][lower + 1]`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Yes')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement simply prints the string `'Yes'`.
- The initial state provides detailed information about various variables and objects, but none of this information affects the execution of the `print` statement itself.
- The `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or objects mentioned in the initial state.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print the string `'Yes'` regardless of the initial state.

Output: **Yes**
