The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `cast`, which is expected to be a callable capable of converting string inputs to a specified type (such as `int` or `float`). It reads a line of input from the user, splits the input into a list of substrings based on whitespace, and returns an iterator that applies the `cast` function to each substring. The final state of the program includes an iterator ready to yield the converted values when iterated over.
