t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of: n and q are integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the number of elements in the array and the number of queries, respectively. a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30, representing the elements of the array. Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n, describing the query. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
