The function `func_3` processes a series of queries on a list of integers. It takes no explicit parameters but internally uses `func_1` to obtain the values of `n` (the length of the list `a`), `q` (the number of queries), and the list `a` itself. For each query, it receives two integers `l` and `r` (1 ≤ l < r ≤ n). The function computes a prefix XOR array `x` and a dictionary `inds` mapping each unique XOR value to its indices in `x`. For each query, it checks if the XOR of the subarray `a[l-1:r]` is zero or if there exist indices within the subarray that satisfy certain conditions. If these conditions are met, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. After processing all queries, the function does not return any value, but it has printed the results for each query.
