### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually. This part is accurate and works as expected.

2. **Single Character String**: If the string has only one character, the function correctly prints "No" because it's impossible to rearrange a single character to form a different string. This part is also accurate.

3. **All Characters Identical**: The function checks if all characters in the string are the same by counting the occurrences of the first character. If all characters are the same, it prints "No" because it's impossible to rearrange the string to form a different string. This part is accurate as well.

4. **Rearrangement**: The function prints "Yes" and then outputs the sorted version of the string. However, this approach is flawed because sorting the string does not guarantee that the resulting string will be different from the original string. For example, if the input string is "abc", sorting it will still result in "abc", which is the same as the original string. This violates the requirement that the rearranged string must be different from the original string.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Output for Some Cases**: The current implementation always sorts the string, which may not produce a different string if the original string was already sorted. This is a critical issue that affects the correctness of the program.

### Correct Implementation:
To ensure the rearranged string is different from the original string, we need to make a small change. One simple approach is to swap the first two characters if they are different, or swap the first character with any other character that is different.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    cnt_test_cases = int(input())
    for _ in range(cnt_test_cases):
        string = input().strip()
        if len(string) == 1:
            print('No')
        elif len(set(string)) == 1:
            print('No')
        else:
            print('Yes')
            # Swap the first two characters if they are different
            if string[0] != string[1]:
                rearranged = string[1] + string[0] + string[2:]
            else:
                # Find a different character to swap with the first character
                for i in range(1, len(string)):
                    if string[i] != string[0]:
                        rearranged = string[i] + string[1:i] + string[0] + string[i+1:]
                        break
            print(rearranged)
```

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the original program is indeed incorrect. The original assessment accurately pointed out the flaw in the rearrangement logic and provided a correct approach to fix it.

Final: **False**
