Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `cnt_test_cases` must be greater than the length of `string` + 1, `i` is the length of the new `string` + 1, `string` is the input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `m` is the first character of the new `string`, `k` is the number of times the first character `m` appears in the new `string`. If the length of `string` is 1, all characters in `string` are the same as the first character `m`. Otherwise, if `k` equals the length of `string`, all characters in `string` are the same as the first character `m`. Otherwise, `k` is not equal to the length of `string`.** 

Explanation: The code snippet `m = string[0]` assigns the first character of the `string` to the variable `m`. Since `string` is already defined as the input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, and `m` is set to the first character of this `string`, the rest of the initial state remains unchanged. The conditions regarding `k` and the length of `string` remain valid as they were initially stated.
