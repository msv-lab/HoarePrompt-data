The code snippet `string = input().strip()` reads a line of input from the user, removes any leading and trailing whitespace, and assigns the resulting string to the variable `string`. The other variables (`t`, `s`, `cnt_test_cases`, and `i`) are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `cnt_test_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `string` is the input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed.**
