Based on the initial state:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
- `cnt_test_cases` must be greater than the length of `string`.
- `i` is the length of the new `string`.
- `string` is the input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed.
- `m` is the first character of the new `string`.
- `k` is the number of times the first character `m` appears in the new `string`.
- All characters in `string` are the same as the first character `m`.

Given these conditions, the `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print('No')
```

This statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'No'`.

Therefore, the output is:

Output: **No**
