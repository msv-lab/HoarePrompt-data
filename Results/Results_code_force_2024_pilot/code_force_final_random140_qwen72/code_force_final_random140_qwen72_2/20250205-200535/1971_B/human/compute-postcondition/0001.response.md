The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `cnt_test_cases`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `cnt_test_cases`. For the loop to execute, `cnt_test_cases` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` should start from 0, as is typical for Python's `range()` function.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `cnt_test_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
