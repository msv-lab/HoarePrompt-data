Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `cnt_test_cases` must be greater than the length of `string` + 1, `i` is the length of the new `string`, `string` is the input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `m` is the first character of the new `string`. `k` is the number of times the first character `m` appears in the `string`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration of the loop. After all iterations, `i` will be equal to the length of the `string`.
- The variable `k` counts the number of times the first character `m` appears in the `string`. After the loop completes, `k` will hold this count.
- The other variables (`t`, `s`, `cnt_test_cases`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
