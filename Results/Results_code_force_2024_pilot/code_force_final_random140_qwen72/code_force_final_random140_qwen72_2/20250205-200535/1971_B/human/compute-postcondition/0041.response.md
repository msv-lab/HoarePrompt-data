Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `cnt_test_cases` must be greater than the length of `string`, `i` is the length of the new `string`, `string` is the input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `m` is the first character of the new `string`, `k` is the number of times the first character `m` appears in the new `string`.**

### Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `s` also remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `cnt_test_cases` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `i` is incremented in each iteration of the loop and will be equal to the length of the `string` after the loop completes.
- The variable `string` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `m` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `k` is incremented each time a character in the `string` matches the first character `m`. After the loop completes, `k` will be the count of how many times the first character `m` appears in the `string`.
