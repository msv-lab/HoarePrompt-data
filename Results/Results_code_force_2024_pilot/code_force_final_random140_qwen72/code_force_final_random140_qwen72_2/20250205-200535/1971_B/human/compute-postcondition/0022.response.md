The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'Yes'`.

Based on the initial state:
- `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 1000.
- `s` is a string of length at most 10, consisting of lowercase English letters.
- `cnt_test_cases` is greater than 0.
- `i` is the length of the string `string` minus 1.
- `string` is the input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed.
- `m` is the first character of `string`.
- `k` is the number of times the first character `m` appears in `string`.
- `k` is not equal to the length of `string`.

None of these variables or conditions affect the execution of the `print` statement, as the statement simply prints the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
