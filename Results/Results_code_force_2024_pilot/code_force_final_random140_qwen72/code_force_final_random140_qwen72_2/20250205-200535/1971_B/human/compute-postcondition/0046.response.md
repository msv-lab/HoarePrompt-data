Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
- `cnt_test_cases` must be greater than the length of `string`.
- `i` is the length of the new `string`.
- `string` is the input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed.
- `m` is the first character of the new `string`.
- `k` is the number of times the first character `m` appears in the new `string`.
- `k` is not equal to the length of `string`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(''.join(sorted(string)))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **String Preparation**:
   - `string` is the input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed. This means `string` is a trimmed version of `s`.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The `sorted(string)` function sorts the characters in the `string` in ascending order.
   - `''.join(sorted(string))` joins these sorted characters back into a single string.

3. **Output**:
   - The `print` statement will output the sorted version of the `string`.

### Example:
- If `s = "  hello world "`:
  - After removing leading and trailing whitespace, `string = "hello world"`.
  - Sorting the characters in `string` gives `[' ', 'd', 'e', 'h', 'l', 'l', 'l', 'o', 'o', 'r', 'w']`.
  - Joining these characters results in `" dehllloorw"`.

### General Case:
- Since `string` is a trimmed version of `s` and consists of lowercase English letters, the output will be the sorted version of `string`.

### Final Output:
Output: **the sorted version of the trimmed `string` (where `string` is the input string `s` with leading and trailing whitespace removed)**.
