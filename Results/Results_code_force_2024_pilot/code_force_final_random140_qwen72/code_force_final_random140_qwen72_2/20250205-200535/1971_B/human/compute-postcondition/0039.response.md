The value of `k` is incremented by 1. Initially, `k` was 1 or 2 depending on whether the second character of `string` was equal to the first character (`m`). After incrementing, `k` will be 2 or 3 respectively. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `cnt_test_cases` must be greater than the length of `string`, `i` is 2, `string` is the input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed and must have at least 2 characters, `m` is the first character of the new `string`, if the second character of `string` (at index 1) is equal to `m`, then `k` is 3. Otherwise, `k` is 2.**
