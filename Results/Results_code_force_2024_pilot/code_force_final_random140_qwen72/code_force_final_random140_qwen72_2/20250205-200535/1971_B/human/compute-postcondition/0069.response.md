Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
- `cnt_test_cases` must be greater than the length of `string` + 1.
- `i` is the length of the new `string`.
- `string` is the input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed.
- `m` is the first character of the new `string`.
- `k` is the number of times the first character `m` appears in the `string`.
- `k` is not equal to the length of `string`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(''.join(sorted(string)))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **String Preparation**:
   - `string` is the input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed. This means any spaces at the beginning or end of the string are stripped away.
   - For example, if the input string is `"  hello world  "`, the `string` will be `"hello world"`.

2. **Sorting the String**:
   - The `sorted(string)` function sorts the characters in the string in lexicographical order (alphabetical order).
   - For example, if `string` is `"hello world"`, the sorted version will be `" dehllloorw"`.

3. **Joining the Sorted Characters**:
   - The `''.join(sorted(string))` function joins the sorted characters back into a single string.
   - Continuing the example, `''.join(sorted("hello world"))` will result in `" dehllloorw"`.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the sorted version of the `string` with leading and trailing whitespace removed.

Output: **sorted version of the string with leading and trailing whitespace removed**

For example, if the input string `s` is `"  hello world  "`, the output will be:
Output: **dehllloorw**
