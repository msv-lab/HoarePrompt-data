Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `cnt_test_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is the length of `string` - 1, `string` is the input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `m` is the first character of `string`, and `k` is the number of times the first character `m` appears in `string`.**

### Explanation:
- The variable `i` will be equal to the length of `string` minus 1 after the loop has completed all its iterations because the loop iterates from 0 to `len(string) - 1`.
- The variable `k` will count how many times the first character `m` appears in the string `string`. This is because the loop increments `k` each time it encounters a character in `string` that matches `m`.
- All other variables (`t`, `s`, `cnt_test_cases`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
