To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
- `cnt_test_cases` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is the length of `string` - 1.
- `string` is the input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed.
- `m` is the first character of `string`.
- `k` is the number of times the first character `m` appears in `string`.
- `k` is not equal to the length of `string`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(''.join(sorted(string)))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **String Preparation**:
   - `string` is the input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed. This means `string` is a trimmed version of the original input string `s`.

2. **Sorting the String**:
   - The `sorted(string)` function returns a list of characters from `string` in lexicographical order.
   - `''.join(sorted(string))` joins these sorted characters back into a single string.

3. **Output**:
   - The `print` statement will output the sorted version of the string `string`.

### Example:
Let's consider an example to illustrate this:
- Suppose `s = "  bca "` (with leading and trailing spaces).
  - After removing leading and trailing whitespace, `string = "bca"`.
  - Sorting `string` gives `['a', 'b', 'c']`.
  - Joining these characters results in `"abc"`.

### General Case:
- For any input string `s` of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, after trimming and sorting, the output will be the characters of the trimmed string in lexicographical order.

### Final Output:
Output: **the characters of the trimmed input string `s` in lexicographical order**.
