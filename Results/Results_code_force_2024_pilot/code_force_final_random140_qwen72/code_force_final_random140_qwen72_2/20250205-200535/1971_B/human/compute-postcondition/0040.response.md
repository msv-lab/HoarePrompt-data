Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `cnt_test_cases` must be greater than the length of `string`, `i` is 2, `string` is the input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed and must have at least 2 characters, `m` is the first character of the new `string`. If the third character of `string` (at index 2) is equal to `m`, then `k` is 3. Otherwise, `k` is 2.***
