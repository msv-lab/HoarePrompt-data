Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, `cnt_test_cases` has been fully decremented to 0, `i` is the final index of the last iteration (which is `cnt_test_cases - 1`), `string` is the last input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `m` is the first character of the last `string`, and `k` is the number of times the first character `m` appears in the last `string`. If `k` equals the length of the last `string`, all characters in the last `string` are the same as the first character `m`. Otherwise, `k` is not equal to the length of the last `string`.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop have completed, the variable `cnt_test_cases` has been fully decremented to 0, indicating that the loop has run the specified number of times. The variable `i` holds the value of the last index of the loop, which is one less than the total number of test cases. The variable `string` contains the last input string processed, with any leading or trailing whitespace removed. The variable `m` is the first character of this last string, and `k` is the count of how many times this first character appears in the string. If `k` is equal to the length of the string, it means all characters in the string are the same; otherwise, they are not. The variables `t` and `s` remain unchanged from their initial state.
