The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, it reads a string `s` of up to 10 lowercase English letters. It then checks if all characters in the string are the same. If they are, it prints 'No'. If not, it prints 'Yes' followed by the sorted version of the string. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the state includes `t` being an integer within the specified range, `s` being the last processed string, and all test cases having been fully processed.
