Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After the loop executes all iterations, `idx` will be equal to `len(arrs) - 1`. If `arrs[0]` is 0, `cnt0` will be the count of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element. If `arrs[0]` is 1, `cnt0` will be the count of zeros in `arrs`. The value of `ans` will be 0 if `cnt1` is 0 or 1, otherwise, it will be the value of `cnt0`. The variable `_` will be incremented by 1 and must still be less than `t` for the loop to potentially execute again. `cnt1` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for idx in range(len(arrs)):
    if arrs[idx] == 1:
        cnt1 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`idx` is 0, `arrs` has at least one element, and `cnt1` is 0 unless the first element of `arrs` is 1, in which case `cnt1` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`idx` is 1, `arrs` has at least two elements, and `cnt1` is 1 if the first element of `arrs` was 1 and the second element is not 1. If the second element of `arrs` is 1, `cnt1` is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`idx` is 2, `arrs` has at least three elements, and `cnt1` is 1 if the first element of `arrs` was 1 and the second element is not 1. If the second element of `arrs` is 1, `cnt1` is 2. If `arrs[2]` (the third element) is 1, `cnt1` is incremented by 1, making it 2 if the first element was 1 and the second was not 1, or 3 if the second element was 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
