Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is a list of `n` integers, each being 0 or 1, and at least one cell in each test case contains a chip, `length` is an input integer, `arrs` is a list of integers obtained from the new input and must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations, `idx` is `len(arrs) - 1`, `cnt0` is the count of zeros in `arrs` minus 1 if the first and last elements of `arrs` are 0, otherwise `cnt0` remains unchanged, `cnt1` is the total number of 1s in `arrs` if the first element of `arrs` is 0 or not 0, `ans` is 0.**
