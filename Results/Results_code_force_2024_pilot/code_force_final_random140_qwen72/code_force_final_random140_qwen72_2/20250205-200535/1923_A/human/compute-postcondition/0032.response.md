Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is a list of `n` integers, each being 0 or 1, and at least one cell in each test case contains a chip, `length` is an input integer, `arrs` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least `len(arrs)` elements, `idx` is `len(arrs) - 1`. If `arrs[0]` is 0, `cnt0` is the count of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element. If `arrs[0]` is 1, `cnt0` is the count of zeros in `arrs`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each element in `arrs`.
- If the first element of `arrs` is 0, `cnt0` counts the number of zeros in `arrs` starting from the second element (i.e., `arrs[1:]`).
- If the first element of `arrs` is 1, `cnt0` counts the number of zeros in the entire list `arrs`.
- After the loop completes, `idx` will be equal to `len(arrs) - 1`, indicating that the loop has processed all elements in `arrs`.
