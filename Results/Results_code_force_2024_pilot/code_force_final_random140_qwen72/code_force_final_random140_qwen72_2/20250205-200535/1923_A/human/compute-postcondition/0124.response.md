Output State: **`arrs` must have at least 1 element, `idx` is 0, `arrs[0]` is 1, `arrs[idx]` is 0, `cnt0` is increased by 1.** 

The value of `cnt0` is incremented by 1, while the other variables remain unchanged. The initial conditions that `arrs` must have at least 1 element, `idx` is 0, `arrs[0]` is 1, and `arrs[idx]` is 0 are still valid.
