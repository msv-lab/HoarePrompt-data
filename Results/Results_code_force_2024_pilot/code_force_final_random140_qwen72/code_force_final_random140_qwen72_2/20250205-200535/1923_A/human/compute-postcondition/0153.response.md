The value of `cnt1` is incremented by 1. Initially, `cnt1` is 1 if the first element of `arrs` was 1 and the second element is not 1, or `cnt1` is 2 if the second element of `arrs` is 1. After the increment, `cnt1` will be 2 if it was initially 1, or 3 if it was initially 2. The values of `idx` and the contents of `arrs` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`idx` is 2, `arrs` has at least three elements, `cnt1` is 2 if the first element of `arrs` was 1 and the second element is not 1, or `cnt1` is 3 if the second element of `arrs` is 1.**
