Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is a list of `n` integers, each being 0 or 1, and at least one cell in each test case contains a chip, `length` is an input integer, `arrs` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least `len(arrs)` elements, `idx` is `len(arrs) - 1`, `cnt0` is the count of zeros in `arrs` (or excluding the first element if `arrs[0]` is 0), `cnt1` is the count of ones in `arrs`, `ans` is `cnt0`, and `cnt1` is greater than 1.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `cnt0` to `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is now equal to the count of zeros in `arrs` (or excluding the first element if `arrs[0]` is 0). The conditions and values of the other variables remain as specified in the initial state.
