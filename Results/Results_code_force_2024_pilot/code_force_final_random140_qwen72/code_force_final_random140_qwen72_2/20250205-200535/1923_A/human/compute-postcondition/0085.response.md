Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is a list of `n` integers, each being 0 or 1, and at least one cell in each test case contains a chip, `length` is an input integer, `arrs` is a list of integers obtained from the new input and must have at least 3 elements, `idx` is 2, `cnt0` is 0 or 1 or 2 depending on the initial conditions. If `arrs[0]` is 1, and if `arrs[idx]` is 0, `cnt0` is incremented by 1. `cnt1` is the count of ones in the new `arrs`, `ans` is set based on the conditions involving `cnt0` and `cnt1`, and `_` is incremented under certain conditions.***
