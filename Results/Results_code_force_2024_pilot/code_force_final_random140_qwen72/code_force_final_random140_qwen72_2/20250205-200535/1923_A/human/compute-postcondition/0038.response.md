The only objects in the loop head are the variable `idx` and the list `arrs`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `idx` is less than the length of `arrs`.

At the end of the last iteration, `idx` is 0, and `arrs` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element. For the loop to execute one more time, `idx` needs to be incremented by 1, and `arrs` must still have at least 1 element remaining to process.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `idx` will be 1.
- `arrs` must have at least 1 element, meaning it must have at least 2 elements for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is a list of `n` integers, each being 0 or 1, and at least one cell in each test case contains a chip, `length` is an input integer, `arrs` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 2 elements, `idx` is 1, `cnt0` is the count of zeros in `arrs` (or excluding the first element if `arrs[0]` is 0). If `arrs[0]` is 1, then `cnt1` is 1. Otherwise, `cnt1` remains 0.**
