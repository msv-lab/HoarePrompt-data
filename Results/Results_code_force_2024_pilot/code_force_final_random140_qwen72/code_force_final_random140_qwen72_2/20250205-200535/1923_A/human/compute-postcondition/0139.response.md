The value of `cnt0` is incremented by 1. The conditions regarding the values of `arrs[0]`, `arrs[1]`, and `arrs[idx]` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the increment operation.

Output State: **`arrs` must have at least 3 elements, `idx` is 2. If `arrs[0]` is 0 and `arrs[idx]` is 0, `cnt0` is increased by 2. If `arrs[0]` is 0 and `arrs[idx]` is not 0, `cnt0` is increased by 1. If `arrs[0]` is 1 and `arrs[1]` is 0, `cnt0` is increased by 2. Otherwise, `cnt0` is increased by 1.**
