Output State: **`idx` is `len(arrs) - 1`, `arrs` has at least as many elements as its length, `cnt1` is the total number of 1s in `arrs`, and `cnt1` is either 0 or 1, `cnt0` is decreased by 1 if the first and last elements of `arrs` are 0, otherwise `cnt0` remains unchanged, `ans` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `ans = 0` sets the variable `ans` to 0.
- All other variables (`idx`, `arrs`, `cnt1`, `cnt0`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions with the addition that `ans` is now 0.
