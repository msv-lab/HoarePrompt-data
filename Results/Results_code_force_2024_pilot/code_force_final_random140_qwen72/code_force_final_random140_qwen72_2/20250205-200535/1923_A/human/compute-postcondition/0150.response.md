The value of `cnt1` is incremented by 1. Initially, `cnt1` is 0 unless the first element of `arrs` is 1, in which case `cnt1` is 1. After the increment, `cnt1` will be 1 if it was initially 0, or 2 if it was initially 1. The values of `idx` and the condition regarding `arrs` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`idx` is 1, `arrs` has at least two elements, and `cnt1` is 1 if the first element of `arrs` was not 1, otherwise `cnt1` is 2.**
