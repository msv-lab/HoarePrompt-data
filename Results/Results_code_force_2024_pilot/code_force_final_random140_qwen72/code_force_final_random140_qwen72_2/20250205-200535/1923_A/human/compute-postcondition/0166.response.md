Postcondition: ***`idx` is `len(arrs) - 1`, `arrs` has at least as many elements as its length, `cnt1` is the total number of 1s in `arrs`. If `cnt1` is 0 or 1, `cnt0` is decreased by 1 if the first and last elements of `arrs` are 0, otherwise `cnt0` remains unchanged, and `ans` is 0. If `cnt1` is neither 0 nor 1, `cnt0` is decreased by 1 if the first and last elements of `arrs` are 0, otherwise `cnt0` remains unchanged, and `ans` is equal to `cnt0`.***
