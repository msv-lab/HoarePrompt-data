The value of `cnt1` is incremented by 1. The initial state specifies that `cnt1` is 1 if `arrs[0]` is 1, otherwise `cnt1` is 0. After the increment, `cnt1` will be 2 if `arrs[0]` is 1, and 1 if `arrs[0]` is 0. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is a list of `n` integers, each being 0 or 1, and at least one cell in each test case contains a chip, `length` is an input integer, `arrs` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 2 elements, `idx` is 1, `cnt0` is the count of zeros in `arrs` (or excluding the first element if `arrs[0]` is 0), `cnt1` is 2 if `arrs[0]` is 1, otherwise `cnt1` is 1.**
