Output State: **`idx` is `len(arrs) - 1`, `arrs` has at least as many elements as its length, `cnt1` is the total number of 1s in `arrs`, `cnt0` is decreased by 1 if the first and last elements of `arrs` are 0, otherwise `cnt0` remains unchanged, `ans` is equal to `cnt0`, and `cnt1` is neither 0 nor 1.**
