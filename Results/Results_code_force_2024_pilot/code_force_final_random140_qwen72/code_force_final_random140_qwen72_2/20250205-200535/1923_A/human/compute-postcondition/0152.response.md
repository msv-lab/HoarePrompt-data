The only objects in the loop head are the variable `idx` and the list `arrs`, so we can only adjust these.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `idx` is 1
- `arrs` has at least two elements
- `cnt1` is 1 if the first element of `arrs` was 1 and the second element is not 1. If the second element of `arrs` is 1, `cnt1` is 2.

For the loop to execute one more time, `idx` must be incremented by 1, making it 2. The list `arrs` must still have enough elements for the loop to continue, meaning it must have at least three elements.

State: **`idx` is 2, `arrs` has at least three elements, and `cnt1` is 1 if the first element of `arrs` was 1 and the second element is not 1. If the second element of `arrs` is 1, `cnt1` is 2.**
