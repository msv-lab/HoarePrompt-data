The code snippet `cnt0 += 1` increments the value of `cnt0` by 1. Based on the initial conditions:

- `arrs` must have at least 3 elements.
- `idx` is 2.
- If `arrs[0]` is 0 and `arrs[idx]` is 0, `cnt0` is increased by 1.
- If `arrs[0]` is 0 and `arrs[idx]` is not 0, `cnt0` remains unchanged.
- If `arrs[0]` is 1 and `arrs[1]` is 0, `cnt0` is increased by 1.
- Otherwise, `cnt0` remains unchanged.

Since the code snippet `cnt0 += 1` is executed, it means that one of the conditions for increasing `cnt0` was met. However, without knowing the exact values of `arrs[0]`, `arrs[1]`, and `arrs[idx]`, we can only conclude that `cnt0` is incremented by 1.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`arrs` must have at least 3 elements, `idx` is 2, `cnt0` is increased by 1.**
