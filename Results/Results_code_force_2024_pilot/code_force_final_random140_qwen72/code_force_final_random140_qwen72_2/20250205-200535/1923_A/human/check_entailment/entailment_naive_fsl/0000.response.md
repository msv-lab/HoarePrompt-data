Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the chips are already in a single block but are not at the beginning of the ribbon. For example, consider the input:

```
1
5
0 0 1 1 1
```

The output should be `2` because we need to move the first two chips to the left to form a single block without any free cells between them. However, the current program will output `0` because it incorrectly assumes that the number of zeros between the first and last chip is the answer, which is not always true. The program needs to account for the position of the chips and calculate the minimum number of moves required to bring all chips together in a contiguous block.
