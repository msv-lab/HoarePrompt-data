### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The function `R` is defined to read and split input into integers.
   - The variable `t` is set to the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, the length of the array `n` is read but not used directly.
   - The array `a` is initialized with a dummy value `0` to handle 1-based indexing.

2. **Array Processing:**
   - The loop iterates over the input array elements.
   - `j` is updated to the current index `i` if the current element `x` is different from the previous element `p`.
   - The array `a` is extended with the value of `j` at each step.
   - `p` is updated to the current element `x`, and `i` is incremented.

3. **Query Handling:**
   - The number of queries `q` is read.
   - For each query, the range `[l, r]` is read.
   - The function checks if `a[r]` (which is the last index where a different element was found) is less than `l`. If so, it prints `-1 -1` indicating no such pair exists.
   - Otherwise, it prints the pair `(a[r], r)`.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Correctness of Logic:**
  - The logic correctly identifies the last index `j` where a different element was found up to the current index `i`.
  - For each query, it checks if this last index `a[r]` is within the query range `[l, r]`.
  - If `a[r]` is less than `l`, it means there are no different elements in the range `[l, r]`.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The code handles edge cases where the array has all identical elements within the query range.
  - It also handles the case where the array has different elements and correctly identifies the indices.

- **Efficiency:**
  - The code processes the array in O(n) time and handles each query in O(1) time, making it efficient for the given constraints.

### Validation Using Annotations:

- **Initial State:**
  - `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
  - `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.
  - `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6.
  - `q` is an integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5.
  - `l` and `r` are integers for each query where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n.

- **Processing Loop:**
  - `a` is initialized with `[0]` to handle 1-based indexing.
  - `p`, `i`, and `j` are initialized to 0.
  - For each element `x` in the input array:
    - `j` is updated to `i` if `x` is different from `p`.
    - `a` is extended with `j`.
    - `p` is updated to `x`.
    - `i` is incremented.

- **Query Handling:**
  - For each query `(l, r)`:
    - The function checks if `a[r]` is less than `l`.
    - If true, it prints `-1 -1`.
    - Otherwise, it prints `(a[r], r)`.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly solves the problem as described. It efficiently processes the input and handles all edge cases. The annotations confirm that the program maintains the correct state throughout its execution, and the logic for handling queries is sound.

Final: **True**
