Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem of finding a pair of indices within a specified range of an array such that the elements at these indices are different. Let's break down the logic and check if it meets the requirements:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case one by one.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - It reads the length of the array (`n`).
   - It initializes an array `a` with a dummy element `0` to simplify indexing.
   - It reads the elements of the array and constructs a new array `a` where each element is the index of the last occurrence of a different element encountered so far.
   - For each query, it checks if the last different element within the range `[l, r]` is within the bounds of the query. If it is, it prints the indices; otherwise, it prints `-1 -1`.

3. **Key Logic**:
   - The variable `j` keeps track of the last index where a different element was found.
   - The array `a` is constructed such that `a[i]` contains the index of the last different element up to position `i`.
   - For each query, it checks if `a[r]` (the last different element within the range) is within the bounds `[l, r]`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If all elements in the range `[l, r]` are the same, `a[r]` will be less than `l`, and the program correctly prints `-1 -1`.
   - If there are different elements in the range, the program correctly prints the indices.

5. **Efficiency**:
   - The program efficiently processes the array and queries in linear time, which is suitable given the constraints.

Based on the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
