Output State: **`i` is increased by 1, `R()` must return an iterable with at least one element, `j` is updated to `i` if `x != p`, otherwise `j` remains unchanged, `a` is a tuple with the current value of `j` appended to its previous value, `p` is now equal to `x`, `x` is the next element from the iterable returned by `R()`. `a` is updated to include the current value of `j` as its last element.** 

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The conditions and updates for `j`, `a`, `p`, and `x` remain as specified in the initial state, as they are not directly affected by the increment of `i`.
