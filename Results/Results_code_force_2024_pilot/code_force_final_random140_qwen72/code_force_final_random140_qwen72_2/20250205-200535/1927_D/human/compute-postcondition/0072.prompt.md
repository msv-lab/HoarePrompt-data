Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is the length of the iterable returned by `R()`, `a` is a list containing the sequence of values that `j` took during each iteration, `p` is the last element from the iterable returned by `R()`, `j` is the last value of `i` or the second-to-last value of `i` depending on whether the last element of `R()` was different from the second-to-last element, `t` is 0, `n`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged, `q` is the first (and only) element from the iterable returned by `R()`.
Code of the loop:
while q:
    q -= 1
    l, r = R()
    print(*((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is the length of the iterable returned by `R()`, `a` is a list containing the sequence of values that `j` took during each iteration, `p` is the last element from the iterable returned by `R()`, `j` is the last value of `i` or the second-to-last value of `i` depending on whether the last element of `R()` was different from the second-to-last element, `t` is 0, `n` remains unchanged, `l` is the first element from the iterable returned by `R()`, `r` is the second element from the iterable returned by `R()`, `q` is the first (and only) element from the iterable returned by `R()` minus 1 and must be truthy.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `i` is the length of the iterable returned by `R()`, `a` is a list containing the sequence of values that `j` took during each iteration, `p` is the last element from the iterable returned by `R()`, `j` is the last value of `i` or the second-to-last value of `i` depending on whether the last element of `R()` was different from the second-to-last element, `t` is 0, `n` remains unchanged, `l` is the first element from the iterable returned by `R()`, `r` is the second element from the iterable returned by `R()`, `q` is the first (and only) element from the iterable returned by `R()` minus 2 and must be truthy.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `i` is the length of the iterable returned by `R()`, `a` is a list containing the sequence of values that `j` took during each iteration, `p` is the last element from the iterable returned by `R()`, `j` is the last value of `i` or the second-to-last value of `i` depending on whether the last element of `R()` was different from the second-to-last element, `t` is 0, `n` remains unchanged, `l` is the first element from the iterable returned by `R()`, `r` is the second element from the iterable returned by `R()`, `q` is the first (and only) element from the iterable returned by `R()` minus 3 and must be truthy.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
