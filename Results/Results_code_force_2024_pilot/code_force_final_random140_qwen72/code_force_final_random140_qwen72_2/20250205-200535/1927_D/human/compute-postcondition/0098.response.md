Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `i` is the number of elements in the iterable returned by `R()`.
- `j` is the index of the last element in the iterable returned by `R()` if all elements are distinct, otherwise it could be any previous index based on the condition `x != p`.
- `p` is the last element from the iterable returned by `R()`.
- `a` is a list containing `[0, 0, 1, 2, ..., i-1]` if all elements in the iterable are distinct, or a list with some repeated indices based on the condition `x != p`.
- `t` is a truthy value minus 1.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `l` is the first element from the iterable returned by `R()`.
- `r` is the second element from the iterable returned by `R()`.
- `q` is now a truthy value minus 1.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(*((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the value of `a[r]`:**
   - `r` is the second element from the iterable returned by `R()`.
   - `a` is a list where the elements are indices based on the condition `x != p`.

2. **Determine the value of `l`:**
   - `l` is the first element from the iterable returned by `R()`.

3. **Evaluate the condition `a[r] < l`:**
   - This condition checks if the value at index `r` in the list `a` is less than the first element `l` from the iterable.

4. **Determine the output based on the condition:**
   - If `a[r] < l` is `True`, the expression `((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l]` evaluates to `(a[r], r)`.
   - If `a[r] < l` is `False`, the expression `((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l]` evaluates to `[-1, -1]`.

5. **Unpack the tuple or list:**
   - The `*` operator unpacks the tuple or list into separate arguments for the `print` function.

### Final Output:
- If `a[r] < l` is `True`, the output will be the values of `a[r]` and `r`.
- If `a[r] < l` is `False`, the output will be `-1` and `-1`.

Given the initial state, we cannot determine the exact numerical values of `a[r]` and `l` without knowing the specific elements in the iterable returned by `R()`. However, we can describe the output based on the condition.

Output: **(a[r], r) if a[r] < l, otherwise (-1, -1)**

This means:
- If the value at index `r` in the list `a` is less than the first element `l` from the iterable, the output will be the values of `a[r]` and `r`.
- Otherwise, the output will be `-1` and `-1`.
