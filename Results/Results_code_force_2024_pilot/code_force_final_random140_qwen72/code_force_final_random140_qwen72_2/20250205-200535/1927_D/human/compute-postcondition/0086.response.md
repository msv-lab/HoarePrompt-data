The value of `p` is updated to the current value of `x`. All other variables remain unchanged. Since `p` was initially the second element from the iterable returned by `R()`, and now it is set to `x`, the new value of `p` is `x`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 0 if `x == p` or 1 if `x != p`, `p` is `x`, `a` is `[0, 0, 0]` if `x == p` or `[0, 0, 1]` if `x != p`, `t` is a truthy value minus 1, `n` remains unchanged, `l` is the first element from the iterable returned by `R()`, `r` is the second element from the iterable returned by `R()`, `q` is 0, and the iterable returned by `R()` must have at least two elements.**
