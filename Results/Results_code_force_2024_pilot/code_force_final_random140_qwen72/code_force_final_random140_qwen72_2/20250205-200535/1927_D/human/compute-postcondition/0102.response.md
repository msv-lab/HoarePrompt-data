Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `i` is the number of elements in the iterable returned by `R()`.
2. `j` is the index of the last element in the iterable returned by `R()` if all elements are distinct, otherwise it could be any previous index based on the condition `x != p`.
3. `p` is the last element from the iterable returned by `R()`.
4. `a` is a list containing `[0, 0, 1, 2, ..., i-1]` if all elements in the iterable are distinct, or a list with some repeated indices based on the condition `x != p`.
5. `t` is a truthy value minus 1.
6. `n` remains unchanged.
7. `l` is the first element from the iterable returned by `R()`.
8. `r` is the second element from the iterable returned by `R()`.
9. `q` is a truthy value minus 1.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(*((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the value of `a[r]`:**
   - `r` is the second element from the iterable returned by `R()`.
   - `a` is a list where each element corresponds to an index in the iterable returned by `R()`.
   - If all elements in the iterable are distinct, `a` will be `[0, 0, 1, 2, ..., i-1]`.

2. **Determine the value of `l`:**
   - `l` is the first element from the iterable returned by `R()`.

3. **Evaluate the condition `a[r] < l`:**
   - This condition checks if the value of `a` at index `r` is less than the first element `l` from the iterable.

4. **Determine the output based on the condition:**
   - If `a[r] < l` is `True`, the expression `((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l]` will evaluate to `(a[r], r)`.
   - If `a[r] < l` is `False`, the expression will evaluate to `[-1, -1]`.

5. **Unpack the tuple or list:**
   - The `*` operator unpacks the tuple or list.
   - If the condition is `True`, it will print `a[r]` and `r`.
   - If the condition is `False`, it will print `-1` and `-1`.

### Final Output:
- **If `a[r] < l` is `True`:**
  - Output: **a[r], r (where a[r] is the value of a at index r and r is the second element from the iterable returned by R())**
- **If `a[r] < l` is `False`:**
  - Output: **-1, -1**

Given the initial state and the print statement, the output will depend on the specific values of `a[r]` and `l`. Without the exact values of `a` and `l`, we can only describe the output based on the conditions.

Output: **a[r], r (if a[r] < l) or -1, -1 (if a[r] >= l)**
