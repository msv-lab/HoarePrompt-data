The code snippet `a += j,` appends the value of `j` to the list `a`. Given that `a` is initially `[0, 0, 0]` and `j` is either 0 or 2, the new value of `a` will be `[0, 0, 0, 0]` if `j` is 0, or `[0, 0, 0, 2]` if `j` is 2.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`i` is 2, `a` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]` or `[0, 0, 0, 2]` depending on whether `j` is 0 or 2, `p` is the next element from the iterable returned by `R()`, `j` is either 0 or 2 depending on whether `x` is equal to `p` or not, `t` is 0, `n`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged, `q` is 0, `x` is the next element from the iterable returned by `R()`**.
