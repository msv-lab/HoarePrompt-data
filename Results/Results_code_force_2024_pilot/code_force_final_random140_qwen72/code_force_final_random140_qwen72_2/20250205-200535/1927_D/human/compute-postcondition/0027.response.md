To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the statement itself step by step.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`i`**: After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be equal to the length of the iterable `R()`.
2. **`a`**: `a` is a list containing the sequence of values that `j` took during each iteration.
3. **`p`**: `p` will be the last element of the iterable `R()`.
4. **`j`**: `j` will be the last value of `i` or the second-to-last value of `i` depending on whether the last element of `R()` was different from the second-to-last element.
5. **`t`, `n`, `q`**: These values remain unchanged.
6. **`l` and `r`**: `l` and `r` are now the first and second elements of the iterable `R()`, respectively.
7. **`q`**: `q` is now the first (and only) element of the iterable `R()` minus 1 and must be a truthy value.

### Print Statement Analysis:
```python
print(*((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l])
```

#### Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. **`a[r]`**: This is the value in the list `a` at the index `r`. Since `r` is the second element of the iterable `R()`, `a[r]` is the value that `j` took during the iteration corresponding to the second element of `R()`.
2. **`a[r] < l`**: This checks if the value `a[r]` is less than `l`, where `l` is the first element of the iterable `R()`.
3. **`((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)`**: This is a tuple containing two elements:
   - The first element is a tuple `(a[r], r)`.
   - The second element is a list `[-1, -1]`.
4. **`[a[r] < l]`**: This is an indexing operation that selects one of the two elements in the tuple based on the boolean result of `a[r] < l`.
   - If `a[r] < l` is `True`, it selects the first element `(a[r], r)`.
   - If `a[r] < l` is `False`, it selects the second element `[-1, -1]`.

5. **`*`**: The `*` operator unpacks the selected tuple or list into individual arguments for the `print` function.

### Final Output Determination:
- If `a[r] < l` is `True`, the `print` statement will unpack and print `(a[r], r)`.
- If `a[r] < l` is `False`, the `print` statement will unpack and print `[-1, -1]`.

Given the initial state, we need to determine the values of `a[r]` and `l` to decide which branch of the conditional will be taken.

### Example Values:
- Let's assume `R()` is `[5, 3, 2]`.
  - `l` (first element) = 5
  - `r` (second element) = 3
  - `a` (sequence of `j` values) might be `[0, 1, 2]` (assuming `j` increments by 1 each iteration).

- `a[r]` (value at index 3) = `a[1]` = 1
- `a[r] < l` = 1 < 5 = `True`

Since `a[r] < l` is `True`, the `print` statement will unpack and print `(a[r], r)`.

### Final Output:
Output: **(1, 3)**

This is the precise output based on the given initial state and the structure of the `print` statement.
