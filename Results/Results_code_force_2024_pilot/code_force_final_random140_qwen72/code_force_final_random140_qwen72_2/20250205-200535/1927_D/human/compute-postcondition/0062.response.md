Output State: **`i` is the length of the iterable returned by `R()`, `a` is a list containing the sequence of values that `j` took during each iteration, `p` is the last element from the iterable returned by `R()`, `j` is the last value of `i` or the second-to-last value of `i` depending on whether the last element of `R()` was different from the second-to-last element, `t` is 0, `n` remains unchanged, `l` is the first element from the iterable returned by `R()`, `r` is the second element from the iterable returned by `R()`, `q` is the first (and only) element from the iterable returned by `R()` minus 1 and must be truthy.**
