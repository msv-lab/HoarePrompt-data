Functionality: ** The function reads multiple sets of inputs and processes queries on a constructed list. It accepts no explicit parameters but reads from standard input. For each test case defined by `t`, it constructs a list `a` based on the input values and processes `q` queries. Each query consists of two integers `l` and `r`, and the function prints either the value of `a[r]` if it is greater than or equal to `l`, or `-1` otherwise. After processing all queries for all test cases, the function terminates with `t` and `q` set to 0, and the final state of `a` reflects the constructed list for the last test case. **
