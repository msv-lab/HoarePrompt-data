Output State: **`i` is increased by 1, `R()` must return an iterable with at least one element, `j` is updated to `i` if `x != p` (now `p` is equal to `x`), otherwise `j` remains unchanged, `a` is a tuple with the current value of `j` appended to it, `p` is now equal to `x`, `x` is the next element from the iterable returned by `R()`, `a` is a tuple with the current value of `j` appended to its previous value.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` is increased by 1.
- `R()` returns an iterable with at least one element.
- `j` is updated to `i` if `x` is not equal to `p` (and `p` is now set to `x`), otherwise `j` remains unchanged.
- `a` is a tuple with the current value of `j` appended to its previous value.
- `p` is now equal to `x`.
- `x` is the next element from the iterable returned by `R()`.
