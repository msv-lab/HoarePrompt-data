Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `i` is the length of the iterable returned by `R()`.
- `a` is a list containing the sequence of values that `j` took during each iteration.
- `p` is the last element from the iterable returned by `R()`.
- `j` is the last value of `i` or the second-to-last value of `i` depending on whether the last element of `R()` was different from the second-to-last element.
- `t` is 0.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `l` is the first element from the iterable returned by `R()`.
- `r` is the second element from the iterable returned by `R()`.
- `q` is the first (and only) element from the iterable returned by `R()` minus 2 and must be truthy.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(*((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Iterable Returned by `R()`**:
   - Let's assume `R()` returns an iterable with elements `[x1, x2, x3, ..., xn]`.

2. **Variables Derived from `R()`**:
   - `i` is the length of this iterable, so `i = n`.
   - `a` is a list of values that `j` took during each iteration. Since `j` is derived from `i`, `a` will contain the values of `i` during each iteration.
   - `p` is the last element of the iterable, so `p = xn`.
   - `l` is the first element of the iterable, so `l = x1`.
   - `r` is the second element of the iterable, so `r = x2`.
   - `q` is the first element of the iterable minus 2, so `q = x1 - 2`.

3. **Condition in the Print Statement**:
   - The print statement uses a conditional expression: `((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l]`.
   - This means it will print either `(a[r], r)` or `[-1, -1]` depending on whether `a[r]` is less than `l`.

4. **Evaluating the Condition**:
   - `a[r]` is the value of `a` at index `r`, which is the second element of the iterable.
   - `l` is the first element of the iterable.
   - The condition `a[r] < l` checks if the second element of the iterable is less than the first element.

5. **Possible Outcomes**:
   - If `a[r] < l` is true, the print statement will output `(a[r], r)`.
   - If `a[r] < l` is false, the print statement will output `[-1, -1]`.

### Final Output:
- Without knowing the exact values of `x1` and `x2` from the iterable returned by `R()`, we can't determine the exact numerical values of `a[r]` and `l`.
- However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output either `(a[r], r)` or `[-1, -1]` depending on the condition `a[r] < l`.

Output: **(a[r], r) if a[r] < l, otherwise [-1, -1]** (where `a[r]` is the value of `a` at index `r` and `r` is the second element of the iterable returned by `R()`, and `l` is the first element of the iterable returned by `R()`)
