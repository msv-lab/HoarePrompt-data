Output State: **`i` is increased by 1, `R()` must return an iterable with at least one element, `j` is updated to `i` if `x != p` (now `p` is equal to `x`), otherwise `j` remains unchanged, `a` is a tuple with the current value of `j` appended to its previous value, `p` is now equal to `x`, `x` is the next element from the iterable returned by `R()`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` is incremented by 1.
- The conditions and updates for `j`, `a`, `p`, and `x` remain as described in the initial state, as the provided code snippet only affects `i`.
