Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`i`**: The length of the iterable returned by `R()`.
2. **`a`**: A list containing the sequence of values that `j` took during each iteration.
3. **`p`**: The last element from the iterable returned by `R()`.
4. **`j`**: The last value of `i` or the second-to-last value of `i` depending on whether the last element of `R()` was different from the second-to-last element.
5. **`t`**: 0.
6. **`n`**: Remains unchanged.
7. **`l`**: The first element from the iterable returned by `R()`.
8. **`r`**: The second element from the iterable returned by `R()`.
9. **`q`**: The first (and only) element from the iterable returned by `R()` minus 1 and must be truthy.

### Print Statement Analysis:
```python
print(*((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l])
```

#### Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. **`a[r]`**: This is the value in the list `a` at the index `r`.
2. **`r`**: The second element from the iterable returned by `R()`.
3. **`l`**: The first element from the iterable returned by `R()`.
4. **`a[r] < l`**: This is a boolean expression that checks if the value at `a[r]` is less than `l`.

The print statement uses a conditional expression to choose between two tuples:
- If `a[r] < l` is `True`, it will print the tuple `(a[r], r)`.
- If `a[r] < l` is `False`, it will print the tuple `[-1, -1]`.

### Determining the Values:
- **`a[r]`**: The value in the list `a` at the index `r`.
- **`r`**: The second element from the iterable returned by `R()`.
- **`l`**: The first element from the iterable returned by `R()`.

Since the exact values of `a`, `r`, and `l` are not explicitly provided, we need to consider the possible outcomes based on the conditions given.

### Possible Outcomes:
1. **If `a[r] < l` is `True`**:
   - The print statement will output the tuple `(a[r], r)`.
2. **If `a[r] < l` is `False`**:
   - The print statement will output the tuple `[-1, -1]`.

### Final Output:
Without the exact values of `a`, `r`, and `l`, we can only describe the output based on the conditions. Therefore, the output will be one of the following:

- **If `a[r] < l` is `True`**:
  Output: **(a[r], r) (where a[r] is the value at index r in the list a, and r is the second element from the iterable returned by R())**
- **If `a[r] < l` is `False`**:
  Output: **(-1, -1)**

Since we cannot determine the exact values without more information, we provide both possible outputs:

Output: **(a[r], r) (where a[r] is the value at index r in the list a, and r is the second element from the iterable returned by R()) or (-1, -1)**
