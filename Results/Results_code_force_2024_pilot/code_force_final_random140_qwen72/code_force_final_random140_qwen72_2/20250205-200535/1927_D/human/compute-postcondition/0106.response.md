To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `i` is the number of elements in the iterable returned by `R()`.
2. `j` is the index of the last element in the iterable returned by `R()` if all elements are distinct, otherwise it could be any previous index based on the condition `x != p`.
3. `p` is the last element from the iterable returned by `R()`.
4. `a` is a list containing `[0, 0, 1, 2, ..., i-1]` if all elements in the iterable are distinct, or a list with some repeated indices based on the condition `x != p`.
5. `t` is a truthy value minus 1.
6. `n` remains unchanged.
7. `l` is the first element from the iterable returned by `R()`.
8. `r` is the second element from the iterable returned by `R()`.
9. `q` is a truthy value minus 1.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(*((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Evaluate `a[r] < l`:**
   - `a[r]` is the value at index `r` in the list `a`.
   - `l` is the first element from the iterable returned by `R()`.
   - This condition checks if the value at index `r` in `a` is less than the first element of the iterable.

2. **Determine the Tuple to Unpack:**
   - If `a[r] < l` is `True`, the expression `((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l]` evaluates to `(a[r], r)`.
   - If `a[r] < l` is `False`, the expression `((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l]` evaluates to `[-1, -1]`.

3. **Unpack the Tuple:**
   - If `a[r] < l` is `True`, the print statement will unpack and print `a[r]` and `r`.
   - If `a[r] < l` is `False`, the print statement will unpack and print `-1` and `-1`.

### Final Output:
- **If `a[r] < l` is `True`:**
  - Output: **a[r], r (where a[r] is the value at index r in the list a, and r is the second element from the iterable returned by R())**
- **If `a[r] < l` is `False`:**
  - Output: **-1, -1**

Since the exact values of `a`, `r`, and `l` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical values. However, based on the conditions, the output will be one of the two formats described above.

Output: **a[r], r (where a[r] is the value at index r in the list a, and r is the second element from the iterable returned by R())** or **-1, -1** depending on whether `a[r] < l` is `True` or `False`.
