The value of `t` is decremented by 1. Since `t` was initially an integer read from input within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, after decrementing, `t` will be within the range 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1. The values of `n`, `a`, `q`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, `q` is an integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5, `l` and `r` are integers for each query where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n.**
