### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Parsing:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly reads the dimensions of the grid, initializes the grid, and populates the `elements` dictionary with the initial positions of all entities (players, goals, and the Quaffle).
   - It also initializes the `allPlayers` dictionary to track which players are carrying the Quaffle, the `goal` lists to store the positions of the goals for each team, and the `points` list to keep track of the scores.

2. **Command Processing:**
   - The function processes a series of commands over `t` steps. Each command can be either a movement (`U`, `D`, `L`, `R`), a catch (`C`), or a throw (`T`).
   - For movements, it updates the position of the entity and checks for special conditions like scoring a goal or eliminating a player.
   - For catches, it updates the `allPlayers` dictionary to indicate that a player is now carrying the Quaffle.
   - For throws, it updates the `allPlayers` dictionary to indicate that the player is no longer carrying the Quaffle and checks if the throw results in a goal.

3. **Scoring and Special Events:**
   - The function correctly identifies when a goal is scored by checking if the player's position is in the opponent's goal. It updates the score and prints the appropriate message.
   - It also handles the special case where a player scores in their own goal, awarding the point to the opposing team.

4. **Final Score:**
   - After processing all commands, the function prints the final score of the game.

5. **Helper Functions:**
   - The `goalIn` function correctly checks if a position is in one of the goal sets and returns the appropriate index.
   - The `isPlayer` function correctly identifies whether a given entity is a player based on its representation.

### Conclusion:
The provided functions and their execution summaries suggest that the program correctly simulates the Quidditch game according to the problem description. It handles all the required actions, scoring, and special events as specified.

**Correctness: **True****
