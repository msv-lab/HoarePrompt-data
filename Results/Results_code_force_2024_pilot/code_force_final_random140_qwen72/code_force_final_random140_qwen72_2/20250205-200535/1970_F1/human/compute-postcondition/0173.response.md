The code snippet `points[team] += 10` increments the value in the `points` list at the index specified by `team` by 10. Let's break down the impact of this code:

- `t` is greater than 2 (unchanged).
- `time` is 2 (unchanged).
- `command` is a list of strings read from standard input (unchanged).
- `obj` is the second element of `command` if `len(command) > 3`, otherwise it is the first element of `command` (unchanged).
- `com` is the third element of `command` if `len(command) > 3`, otherwise it is the second element of `command` (unchanged).
- `el` is the fourth element of `command` if `len(command) > 3`, otherwise it is the third element of `command` (unchanged).
- `team` is 1 if the first character of `obj` is 'B', otherwise `team` is 0 (unchanged).

The only variable that changes is `points[team]`, which is incremented by 10.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `time` is 2, `command` is a list of strings read from standard input, `obj` is the second element of `command` if `len(command) > 3` otherwise it is the first element of `command`, `com` is the third element of `command` if `len(command) > 3` otherwise it is the second element of `command`, `el` is the fourth element of `command` if `len(command) > 3` otherwise it is the third element of `command`, `team` is 1 if the first character of `obj` is 'B' otherwise `team` is 0, `points[team]` is increased by 10.**
