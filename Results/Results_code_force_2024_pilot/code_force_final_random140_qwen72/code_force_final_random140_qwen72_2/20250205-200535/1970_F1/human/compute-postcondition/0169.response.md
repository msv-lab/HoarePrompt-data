Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `time` is 2, `command` is a list of strings read from standard input. If `len(command) == 3`, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, and `el` is the third element of `command`. All other variables remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The code reads a line from standard input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and splits it into a list of strings, which is assigned to `command`.
- The initial state variables `t` and `time` remain unchanged.
- The new variable `command` now holds the list of strings read from standard input.
- If the length of `command` is 3, the variables `obj`, `com`, and `el` are assigned the first, second, and third elements of `command`, respectively.
- No other changes are made to the initial state variables.
