The value of `team` is determined based on the first character of `obj`. If the first character of `obj` is 'B', `team` is set to 1; otherwise, `team` is set to 0. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `time` is 2, `command` is a list of strings read from standard input, `obj` is the second element of `command`, `com` is the third element of `command`, `el` is the fourth element of `command`. If `len(command) == 3`, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, and `el` is the third element of `command`. `team` is 1 if the first character of `obj` is 'B', otherwise `team` is 0.**
