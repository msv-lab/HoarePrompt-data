Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` is `n`, `n` and `m` remain integers such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd. `grid` is a list containing `n` elements, each element being a list of strings read from the input. `elements` is a dictionary that includes keys for each non-'..' element found in any of the lines, with their corresponding indices as tuples (row, column). `points` remains [0, 0]. `allPlayers` is a dictionary that contains keys for each player character found in any of the lines, each mapped to `False`. `goal` is a list containing two lists, where each sublist contains tuples representing the positions of 'G' characters found in any of the lines, with the first sublist for 'B' characters and the second sublist for 'R' characters. `ind` is the last index processed in the final iteration, which is `m - 1`. `t` is an integer read from the input.
Code of the loop:
for time in range(t):
    comand = stdin.readline().strip().split()
    if len(comand) == 3:
        obj, com, el = comand
        if el == '.Q':
            allPlayers[obj] = True
        elif el == '.S':
            team = 1 if obj[0] == 'B' else 0
            points[team] += 10
            print('%d %s CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' % (time, GoalName[team]))
    else:
        obj, com = comand
        pos = elements[obj]
        nxt = pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]
        if obj == '.B' and isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]) or isPlayer(obj
            ) and elements['.B'] == nxt:
            player = obj if isPlayer(obj) else grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]
            print('%d %s ELIMINATED' % (time, player))
        elif com == 'T':
            allPlayers[obj] = False
            if goalIn(pos) != -1:
                team = goalIn(pos)
                print('%d %s GOAL' % (time, GoalName[team]))
                points[team] += 1
        elif isPlayer(obj):
            elements[obj] = nxt
        if obj == '.B':
            elements[obj] = nxt


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `time` is 0, and `command` is a list of strings read from standard input. If `len(command) == 3`, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, and `el` is the third element of `command`. If `el` is ".Q", `allPlayers[obj]` is True. If `el` is ".S", `team` is 1 if `obj[0]` is 'B', otherwise `team` is 0, and `points[team]` is increased by 10. If `el` is neither ".Q" nor ".S", the state remains unchanged. If `len(command) != 3`, a `NameError` is raised due to undefined variables `elements` or `nxt`. If `obj` is equal to ".B", `player` remains unchanged. If `obj` is not equal to ".B", no changes are made to `player` or any other variables, and the same `NameError` is still raised.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 1, `time` is 1, and `command` is updated to the list of strings read from standard input. If `len(command) == 3`, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, and `el` is the third element of `command`. If `el` is equal to '.Q', then `allPlayers[obj]` is `True`. If `el` is equal to '.S', then `team` is set to 1 if `obj[0]` is 'B', otherwise `team` is set to 0, and `points[team]` is incremented by 10. If `len(command) != 3`, `pos` is assigned the value of `elements[obj]`, and `nxt` is a tuple containing the values `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`. If `obj == '.B'`, `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`. If `obj == '.B' and isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])` or `(isPlayer(obj) and elements['.B'] == nxt)`, `player` is `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` returns `True`, otherwise `player` is `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`. Otherwise, if `com` is 'T', `allPlayers[obj]` is `False`. If `goalIn(pos)` does not return -1, `team` is the result of `goalIn(pos)`, and `points[team]` is incremented by 1. If `com` is not 'T' and `isPlayer(obj)` is true, `elements[obj]` is updated to `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 2, `time` is 2, and `command` is a list of strings read from standard input. If `len(command) == 3`, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, and `el` is the third element of `command`. If `len(command) > 3`, `obj` is the second element of `command`, `com` is the third element of `command`, and `el` is the fourth element of `command`. If `el == '.Q'`, `allPlayers[obj]` is `True`. If `el == '.S'`, `team` is 1 if the first character of `obj` is 'B', otherwise `team` is 0, and `points[team]` is increased by 10. If `len(command) < 3`, `obj` is the second element of `command`, `com` is the third element of `command`, and `el` is undefined. `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`, and `nxt` is (`pos[0] + mov[com][0]`, `pos[1] + mov[com][1]`). If `obj == '.B' and (isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]) or (isPlayer(obj) and elements['.B'] == nxt))`, `player` is `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` returns True, otherwise `player` is `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`. If `obj == '.B' and com == 'T'`, `allPlayers[obj]` is `False`. If `obj == '.B' and goalIn(pos)` is not -1, `team` is the result of `goalIn(pos)`, and `points[team]` is incremented by 1. If `obj == '.B' and com is not 'T' and isPlayer(obj)` is true, `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`. If `obj` is not '.B', the state remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
