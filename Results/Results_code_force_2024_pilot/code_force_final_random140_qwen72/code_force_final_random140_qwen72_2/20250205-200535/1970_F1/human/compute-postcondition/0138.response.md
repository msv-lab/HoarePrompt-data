Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `time` is 0, `command` is a list of strings read from standard input, and the length of `command` is not equal to 3. A `NameError` is raised due to undefined variables `elements` or `obj`. `nxt` is not defined because `pos`, `mov`, and `com` are not defined. `obj` is equal to `.B`. If `isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])` is true, then `player` is set to `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`. If `isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])` is false, then no changes are made to `player`.**
