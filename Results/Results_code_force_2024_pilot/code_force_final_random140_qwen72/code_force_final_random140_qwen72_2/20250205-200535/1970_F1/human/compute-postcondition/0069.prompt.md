Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `n`, `n` and `m` remain integers such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd, `grid` is now a list containing two elements: the original list `line` and the new list `line`, `elements` is a dictionary that includes additional keys for each non-'..' element in `line`, with their corresponding indices as tuples (0, index), `points` remains [0, 0], `line` is now a list of strings read from the input, `allPlayers` is a dictionary that contains keys for each player character found in `line`, each mapped to `False`, `goal` is a list containing two lists, where each sublist contains tuples representing the positions of 'G' characters in `line`, with the first sublist for 'B' characters and the second sublist for 'R' characters, `ind` is equal to the length of the new `line` minus 1, indicating the last index processed by the loop.
Code of the loop:
for ind in range(len(line)):
    if line[ind] != '..':
        elements[line[ind]] = i, ind
        if isPlayer(line[ind]):
            allPlayers[line[ind]] = False
        elif line[ind][1] == 'G':
            tmp = 0 if line[ind][0] == 'B' else 1
            goal[tmp].append((i, ind))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is `n`, `n` and `m` remain integers such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd, `grid` is a list containing two elements: the original list `line` and the new list `line`, `elements` is a dictionary that includes additional keys for each non-'..' element in `line`, with their corresponding indices as tuples (0, index). If the element at index `ind` in `line` is not '..', `elements` includes the key `line[ind]` with the value `(i, ind)`. `points` remains [0, 0], `line` is now a list of strings read from the input and must have at least one element, `allPlayers` is a dictionary that contains keys for each player character found in `line`, each mapped to `False`. If the element at index `ind` in `line` is a player character, `allPlayers` includes the key `line[ind]` mapped to `False`. If the element at index `ind` in `line` is not a player character and the second character is 'G', `tmp` is 1, and the tuple `(i, ind)` is appended to `goal[tmp]`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `goal`. `ind` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is `n`, `n` and `m` remain integers such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd. `grid` is a list containing two elements: the original list `line` and the new list `line`. `elements` is a dictionary that includes additional keys for each non-'..' element in `line`, with their corresponding indices as tuples (0, index). If the element at index `ind` in `line` is not '..', `elements` includes the key `line[ind]` with the value `(i, ind)`. `points` remains [0, 0]. `line` is now a list of strings read from the input and must have at least one element. `allPlayers` is a dictionary that contains keys for each player character found in `line`, each mapped to `False`. If the element at index `ind` in `line` is a player character, `allPlayers` includes the key `line[ind]` mapped to `False`. If the element at index `ind` in `line` is not a player character and the second character is 'G', `tmp` is 1, and the tuple `(i, ind)` is appended to `goal[tmp]`. If the element at index `ind` in `line` is not '..', `elements` now includes the key `line[1]` with the value `(n, 1)`. If the element at index `ind` in `line` is a player character, `allPlayers` now includes the key `line[1]` mapped to `False`. If the element at index `ind` in `line` is not a player character and the second character is 'G', `tmp` is 0 if the first character of `line[1]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1, and `goal[tmp]` now includes the tuple `(n, 1)`. If the element at index `ind` in `line` is '..', no changes are made to `elements`, `allPlayers`, or `goal`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is `n`, `n` and `m` remain integers such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd. `grid` is a list containing two elements: the original list `line` and the new list `line`. `elements` is a dictionary that includes additional keys for each non-'..' element in `line`, with their corresponding indices as tuples (0, index). `points` remains [0, 0]. `line` is now a list of strings read from the input and must have at least one element. `allPlayers` is a dictionary that contains keys for each player character found in `line`, each mapped to `False`. If `line[ind]` is not '..', `elements` includes the key `line[ind]` with the value `(n, ind)`. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` is true, `allPlayers` includes the key `line[ind]` mapped to `False`. If `line[ind][1]` is 'G', `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1, and `goal[tmp]` is updated to include the tuple `(i, ind)`. `ind` is incremented by 1. The loop will execute again if `ind` is less than `len(line)`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
