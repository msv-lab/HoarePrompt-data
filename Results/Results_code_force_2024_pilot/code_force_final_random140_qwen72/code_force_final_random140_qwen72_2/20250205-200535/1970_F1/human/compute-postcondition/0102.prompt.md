Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` and `m` are integers such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd, `grid` is an empty list, `elements` is a dictionary with the key '.B' mapped to the tuple (0, 0), `allPlayers` is an empty dictionary, `goal` is a list containing two empty lists, `points` is [0, 0].
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    line = stdin.readline().strip().split()
    grid.append(line)
    for ind in range(len(line)):
        if line[ind] != '..':
            elements[line[ind]] = i, ind
            if isPlayer(line[ind]):
                allPlayers[line[ind]] = False
            elif line[ind][1] == 'G':
                tmp = 0 if line[ind][0] == 'B' else 1
                goal[tmp].append((i, ind))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After the loop executes all iterations, `n` and `m` remain integers such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd. `grid` is still a list containing one element which is the list `line`. `elements` is a dictionary that initially had the key '.B' mapped to the tuple (0, 0) and now includes additional keys for each non-'..' element in `line`, with their corresponding indices as tuples (0, index). `points` remains [0, 0], `i` remains 0, and `line` is the original list of strings read from the input. `allPlayers` is a dictionary that contains keys for each player character found in `line` (as determined by `isPlayer`), each mapped to `False`. `goal` is a list containing two lists, where each sublist contains tuples representing the positions of 'G' characters in `line`, with the first sublist for 'B' characters and the second sublist for 'R' characters. If no 'G' characters are found, `goal` remains a list containing two empty lists. The variable `ind` will be equal to the length of `line` minus 1, indicating the last index processed by the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After all iterations of the loop, `i` remains `n`, `n` and `m` remain integers such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd. `grid` is a list containing two elements: the original list `line` and the new list `line`. `elements` is a dictionary that includes additional keys for each non-'..' element in `line`, with their corresponding indices as tuples (0, index). `points` remains [0, 0]. `line` is now a list of strings read from the input. `allPlayers` is a dictionary that contains keys for each player character found in `line`, each mapped to `False`. `goal` is a list containing two lists, where each sublist contains tuples representing the positions of 'G' characters in `line`, with the first sublist for 'B' characters and the second sublist for 'R' characters. `ind` is equal to the length of `line` minus 1, indicating the last index processed by the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `n - 1`, `n` and `m` are integers such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd, `grid` is a list containing three elements: the original list `line`, the new list `line`, and the new `line` appended, `elements` is a dictionary that includes additional keys for each non-'..' element in `line`, with their corresponding indices as tuples (0, index), `points` remains [0, 0], `line` is a list of strings read from the input, `allPlayers` is a dictionary that contains keys for each player character found in `line`, each mapped to `False`, `goal` is a list containing two lists, where each sublist contains tuples representing the positions of 'G' characters in `line`, with the first sublist for 'B' characters and the second sublist for 'R' characters, `ind` is `len(line) - 1`. For each element in `line` that is not '..', `elements` includes the key for that element with the value `(n - 1, index)`. For each player character in `line`, `allPlayers` includes the key for that character with the value `False`. For each element in `line` that is not a player character and ends with 'G', the tuple `(n - 1, index)` is appended to the appropriate sublist in `goal` based on whether the element starts with 'B' or 'R'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
