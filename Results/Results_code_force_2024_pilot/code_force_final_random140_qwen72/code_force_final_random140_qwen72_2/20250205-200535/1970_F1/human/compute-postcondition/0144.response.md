The provided code snippet attempts to unpack the `command` list into three variables: `obj`, `com`, and `el`. However, the initial state specifies that `command` is a list of strings read from standard input, and its exact content is not specified. Assuming `command` contains exactly three elements, each element will be assigned to `obj`, `com`, and `el` respectively.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 1
- `time` is 1
- `command` is updated to the list of strings read from standard input

After executing the code:
- `obj` is assigned the first element of `command`
- `com` is assigned the second element of `command`
- `el` is assigned the third element of `command`

The values of `t` and `time` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `time` is 1, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `el` is the third element of `command`.**
