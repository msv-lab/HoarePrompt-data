Initial State: `t` is greater than 1, `time` is 1, and `command` is a list of strings read from standard input. If `len(command) == 3`, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, and `el` is the third element of `command`. If `el` is ".Q", `allPlayers[obj]` is True. If `el` is ".S", `team` is 1 if `obj[0]` is 'B', otherwise `team` is 0, and `points[team]` is increased by 10. If `el` is neither ".Q" nor ".S", the state remains unchanged. If `len(command) != 3`, a `NameError` is raised due to undefined variables `elements` or `nxt`. If `obj` is equal to ".B", `player` remains unchanged. If `obj` is not equal to ".B", no changes are made to `player` or any other variables, and the same `NameError` is still raised.

Code Snippet:
```
command = stdin.readline().strip().split()
```

Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.

Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. The code reads a line from standard input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and splits it into a list of strings.
2. This list of strings is assigned to the variable `command`.
3. The initial state specifies that `command` is already a list of strings read from standard input, so this operation updates the value of `command` with the new input.
4. No other variables are directly affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `time` is 1, `command` is updated to the list of strings read from standard input.**
