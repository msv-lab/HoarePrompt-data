Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd, `grid` is an empty list, `elements` is a dictionary with the key '.B' mapped to the tuple (0, 0), `allPlayers` is an empty dictionary, `goal` is a list containing two empty lists, `points` is a list of two integers representing the scores of the red and blue teams.**

Explanation: The code snippet `goal = [[], []]` reassigns the variable `goal` to a new list containing two empty lists. This overrides the previous value of `goal`, which was also a list of two lists, each containing tuples of positions (i, ind) of the goals for the respective team. All other variables remain unchanged.
