Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd, `grid` is a list containing one element which is the list `line`, `elements` is a dictionary with the key '.B' mapped to the tuple (0, 0) and the key `line[1]` mapped to the tuple (0, 1), `points` is [0, 0], `i` is 0, `line` is a list of strings read from the input and must have at least two elements, `ind` is 1, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with the key `line[0]` mapped to `False` if `isPlayer(line[0])` returns `True`, otherwise `allPlayers` remains an empty dictionary, `goal` is a list containing two lists, where `goal[1]` contains the tuple (0, 0) if `line[0][1]` is 'G', otherwise `goal` remains a list containing two empty lists, `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1, `goal[tmp]` now contains the tuple (0, 1).**

Explanation:
- The code appends the tuple `(i, ind)` to the list `goal[tmp]`.
- Given `i` is 0 and `ind` is 1, the tuple `(0, 1)` is appended to `goal[tmp]`.
- The value of `tmp` is determined by the condition: if `line[ind][0]` is 'B', then `tmp` is 0; otherwise, `tmp` is 1.
- Therefore, if `line[1][0]` is 'B', `goal[0]` will contain the tuple `(0, 1)`. Otherwise, `goal[1]` will contain the tuple `(0, 1)`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
