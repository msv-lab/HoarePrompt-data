Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` and `m` are integers such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd, `grid` is a list containing one element which is the list `line`, `elements` is a dictionary with the key '.B' mapped to the tuple (0, 0), `allPlayers` is an empty dictionary, `goal` is a list containing two empty lists, `points` is [0, 0], `i` is 0, `line` is a list of strings read from the input.
Code of the loop:
for ind in range(len(line)):
    if line[ind] != '..':
        elements[line[ind]] = i, ind
        if isPlayer(line[ind]):
            allPlayers[line[ind]] = False
        elif line[ind][1] == 'G':
            tmp = 0 if line[ind][0] == 'B' else 1
            goal[tmp].append((i, ind))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` and `m` are integers such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd, `grid` is a list containing one element which is the list `line`, `elements` is a dictionary with the key '.B' mapped to the tuple (0, 0). If `line[0]` is not equal to '..': `elements` also has the key `line[0]` mapped to the tuple (0, 0), `points` is [0, 0], `i` is 0, `line` is a list of strings read from the input and must have at least one element, `ind` is 0. If `isPlayer(line[0])` returns `True`, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with the key `line[0]` mapped to `False`. Otherwise, `allPlayers` remains an empty dictionary. If `line[0][1]` is 'G', then `goal` is a list containing two lists, where `goal[1]` contains the tuple (0, 0), and `tmp` is 1. Otherwise, `goal` remains a list containing two empty lists. If `line[0]` is equal to '..': `allPlayers` remains an empty dictionary, and `goal` remains a list containing two empty lists.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` and `m` are integers such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd. `grid` is a list containing one element which is the list `line`. `elements` is a dictionary with the key '.B' mapped to the tuple (0, 0). If `line[ind]` is not equal to '..': `elements` also has the key `line[1]` mapped to the tuple (0, 1). `points` is [0, 0], `i` is 0, `line` is a list of strings read from the input and must have at least two elements, `ind` is 1. `allPlayers` is a dictionary with the key `line[0]` mapped to `False` if `isPlayer(line[0])` returns `True`. If `isPlayer(line[1])` is true, `allPlayers` also contains the key `line[1]` mapped to `False`. `goal` is a list containing two lists. If `line[0][1]` is 'G', `tmp` is 1 and `goal[1]` contains the tuple (0, 0). If `line[1][1]` is 'G' and `line[1][0]` is 'B', `tmp` is 0 and `goal[0]` contains the tuple (0, 1). Otherwise, if `line[1][1]` is 'G' and `line[1][0]` is not 'B', `tmp` is 1 and `goal[1]` contains the tuple (0, 1). If neither `line[0][1]` nor `line[1][1]` is 'G', `goal` remains a list containing two empty lists, and `tmp` is not defined. If `line[ind]` is equal to '..': `allPlayers` remains an empty dictionary, and `goal` remains a list containing two empty lists.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` and `m` are integers such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd. `grid` is a list containing one element which is the list `line`. `elements` is a dictionary with the key '.B' mapped to the tuple (0, 0). If `line[ind]` is not equal to '..': `elements` also has the key `line[1]` mapped to the tuple (0, 1) and the key `line[2]` mapped to the tuple (0, 2). `points` is [0, 0], `i` is 0, `line` is a list of strings read from the input and must have at least three elements, `ind` is 2. `allPlayers` is a dictionary with the key `line[0]` mapped to `False` if `isPlayer(line[0])` returns `True`. If `isPlayer(line[1])` is true, `allPlayers` also contains the key `line[1]` mapped to `False`. If `isPlayer(line[2])` is true, `allPlayers` now also contains the key `line[2]` mapped to `False`. `goal` is a list containing two lists. If `line[0][1]` is 'G', `tmp` is 1 and `goal[1]` contains the tuple (0, 0). If `line[1][1]` is 'G' and `line[1][0]` is 'B', `tmp` is 0 and `goal[0]` contains the tuple (0, 1). Otherwise, if `line[1][1]` is 'G' and `line[1][0]` is not 'B', `tmp` is 1 and `goal[1]` contains the tuple (0, 1). If `line[2][1]` is 'G' and `line[2][0]` is 'B', `tmp` is 0 and `goal[0]` contains the tuple (0, 2). Otherwise, if `line[2][1]` is 'G' and `line[2][0]` is not 'B', `tmp` is 1 and `goal[1]` contains the tuple (0, 2). If neither `line[0][1]`, `line[1][1]`, nor `line[2][1]` is 'G', `goal` remains a list containing two empty lists, and `tmp` is not defined. If `line[ind]` is equal to '..': `allPlayers` remains an empty dictionary, and `goal` remains a list containing two empty lists.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
