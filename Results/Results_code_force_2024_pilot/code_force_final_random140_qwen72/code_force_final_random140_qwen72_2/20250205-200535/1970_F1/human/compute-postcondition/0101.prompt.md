Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `n - 1`, `n` and `m` remain integers such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd, `grid` is a list containing three elements: the original list `line`, the new list `line`, and the new `line` appended, `elements` is a dictionary that includes additional keys for each non-'..' element in `line`, with their corresponding indices as tuples (0, index), `points` remains [0, 0], `line` is now a list of strings read from the input, `allPlayers` is a dictionary that contains keys for each player character found in `line`, each mapped to `False`, `goal` is a list containing two lists, where each sublist contains tuples representing the positions of 'G' characters in `line`, with the first sublist for 'B' characters and the second sublist for 'R' characters, `ind` is equal to the length of the new `line` minus 1, indicating the last index processed by the loop.
Code of the loop:
for ind in range(len(line)):
    if line[ind] != '..':
        elements[line[ind]] = i, ind
        if isPlayer(line[ind]):
            allPlayers[line[ind]] = False
        elif line[ind][1] == 'G':
            tmp = 0 if line[ind][0] == 'B' else 1
            goal[tmp].append((i, ind))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is `n - 1`, `n` and `m` are integers such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd, `grid` is a list containing three elements: the original list `line`, the new list `line`, and the new `line` appended, `elements` is a dictionary that includes additional keys for each non-'..' element in `line`, with their corresponding indices as tuples (0, index), `points` remains [0, 0], `line` is a list of strings read from the input and must have at least one element, `allPlayers` is a dictionary that contains keys for each player character found in `line`, each mapped to `False`, `goal` is a list containing two lists, where each sublist contains tuples representing the positions of 'G' characters in `line`, with the first sublist for 'B' characters and the second sublist for 'R' characters, `ind` is 0. If the element at index `ind` in `line` is not '..', `elements` now includes the key `line[0]` with the value `(n - 1, 0)`. If the element at index `ind` in `line` is a player character, then `allPlayers` includes the key `line[0]` mapped to `False`. If the element at index `ind` in `line` is not a player character and the second character of the element at index `ind` in `line` is 'G', then `tmp` is 1 and the tuple `(n - 1, 0)` has been appended to `goal[1]`. If the element at index `ind` in `line` is '..', the state remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is `n - 1`, `n` and `m` are integers such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd, `grid` is a list containing three elements: the original list `line`, the new list `line`, and the new `line` appended, `elements` is a dictionary that includes additional keys for each non-'..' element in `line`, with their corresponding indices as tuples (0, index), `points` remains [0, 0], `line` is a list of strings read from the input and must have at least two elements, `allPlayers` is a dictionary that contains keys for each player character found in `line`, each mapped to `False`. If `line[1]` is not '..', `allPlayers[line[1]]` is set to `False` if `line[1]` is a player character, `elements` now includes the key `line[1]` with the value `(n - 1, 1)`, and if `line[1]` is 'G', the tuple `(n - 1, 1)` is appended to the sublist in `goal` indexed by `tmp`, where `tmp` is 0 if `line[1][0]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1. If `line[1]` is '..', none of these changes occur.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is `n - 1`, `n` and `m` are integers such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd, `grid` is a list containing three elements: the original list `line`, the new list `line`, and the new `line` appended, `elements` is a dictionary that includes additional keys for each non-'..' element in `line`, with their corresponding indices as tuples (0, index), `points` remains [0, 0], `line` is a list of strings read from the input and must have at least two elements, `allPlayers` is a dictionary that contains keys for each player character found in `line`, each mapped to `False`, `ind` is `len(line)`. If the last element in `line` is not '..', `elements` now includes a key for the last element in `line` with the value `(i, ind)` where `i` is `n - 1` and `ind` is `len(line)`. If the last element in `line` is a player character, it is included in `allPlayers` with the value `False`. If the last element in `line` is not a player character and the second character of the last element is 'G', `tmp` is 0 if the first character of the last element is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1, and `goal[tmp]` is a list that now includes the tuple `(i, ind)` appended to it. If the last element in `line` is '..', none of these changes occur.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
