Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `time` is 0.
   - `command` is a list of strings read from standard input, and its length is not equal to 3.
   - A `NameError` is raised due to undefined variables `elements` or `obj`.
   - `nxt` is not defined because `pos`, `mov`, and `com` are not defined.
   - Either `obj` is not equal to `.B` or `isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])` is false.
   - Either `isPlayer(obj)` is false or `elements['.B']` is not equal to `nxt`.
   - The current value of `com` is 'T'.
   - `allPlayers[obj]` is set to `False`.
   - The function `goalIn(pos)` returns a value that is not -1.
   - `team` is set to the value returned by `goalIn(pos)`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('%d %s GOAL' % (time, GoalName[team]))
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - `time` is explicitly given as 0.
   - `team` is set to the value returned by `goalIn(pos)`, and it is stated that `goalIn(pos)` returns a value that is not -1. Therefore, `team` is a valid index in the `GoalName` list.
   - `GoalName[team]` will be the string corresponding to the index `team` in the `GoalName` list.

4. **Output:**
   - The print statement will output the current time (which is 0) followed by the string corresponding to the `team` index in the `GoalName` list, followed by "GOAL".

Given the initial state and the print statement, the output will be:
Output: **0 [GoalName[team]] GOAL (where [GoalName[team]] is the string corresponding to the index `team` in the `GoalName` list)**
