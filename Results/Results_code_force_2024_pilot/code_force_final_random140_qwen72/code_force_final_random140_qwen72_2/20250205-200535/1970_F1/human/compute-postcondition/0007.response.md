The line `line = stdin.readline().strip().split()` reads a line from standard input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and splits the line into a list of strings based on whitespace.

Since the initial state does not specify the content of the input, we assume that the input line is read and split into a list of strings, which is then assigned to the variable `line`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd, `grid` is an empty list, `elements` is a dictionary with the key '.B' mapped to the tuple (0, 0), `allPlayers` is an empty dictionary, `goal` is a list containing two empty lists, `points` is [0, 0], `i` is 0, `line` is a list of strings read from the input.**
