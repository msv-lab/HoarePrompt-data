Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 2, `time` is 2, `command` is a list of strings read from standard input. If `len(command) == 3`, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, and `el` is the third element of `command`. If `len(command) > 3`, `obj` is the second element of `command`, `com` is the third element of `command`, and `el` is the fourth element of `command`. If `el == '.Q'`, `allPlayers[obj]` is `True`. If `el == '.S'`, `team` is 1 if the first character of `obj` is 'B', otherwise `team` is 0, and `points[team]` is increased by 10.***
