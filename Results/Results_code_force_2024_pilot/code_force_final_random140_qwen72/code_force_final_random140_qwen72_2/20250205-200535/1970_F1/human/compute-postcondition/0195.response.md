To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - After the loop executes all iterations, `time` is `t - 1`.
   - `command` is the last list of strings read from standard input during the final iteration.
   - If `len(command) == 3`:
     - `obj` is the first element of `command`.
     - `com` is the second element of `command`.
     - `el` is the third element of `command`.
   - If `el == '.Q'`, `allPlayers[obj]` is `True`.
   - If `el == '.S'`, `team` is 1 if `obj[0]` is 'B', otherwise `team` is 0, and `points[team]` is increased by 10.
   - If `len(command) != 3`:
     - `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`.
     - `nxt` is (`pos[0] + mov[com][0]`, `pos[1] + mov[com][1]`).
   - If `obj == '.B' and (isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]) or (isPlayer(obj) and elements['.B'] == nxt))`:
     - `player` is `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` returns `True`, otherwise `player` is `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`.
   - If `obj == '.B' and com == 'T'`, `allPlayers[obj]` is `False`.
   - If `obj == '.B' and goalIn(pos)` is not -1:
     - `team` is the result of `goalIn(pos)`.
     - `points[team]` is incremented by 1.
   - If `obj == '.B' and com is not 'T' and isPlayer(obj)` is true, `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('FINAL SCORE: %d %d' % (points[0], points[1]))
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement will output the final scores for two teams, represented by `points[0]` and `points[1]`.
   - The values of `points[0]` and `points[1]` are determined by the conditions and actions described in the initial state.

4. **Possible Scenarios:**
   - If `el == '.S'` and `obj[0]` is 'B', `points[1]` is increased by 10.
   - If `el == '.S'` and `obj[0]` is not 'B', `points[0]` is increased by 10.
   - If `obj == '.B' and goalIn(pos)` is not -1, `points[team]` is incremented by 1, where `team` is the result of `goalIn(pos)`.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Without specific values for `points[0]` and `points[1]` before the final iteration, we can only describe the final output in terms of the changes made to these points based on the conditions.

Output: **FINAL SCORE: [points[0]] [points[1]] (where points[0] and points[1] are the final scores of the two teams after all iterations and conditions have been applied)**
