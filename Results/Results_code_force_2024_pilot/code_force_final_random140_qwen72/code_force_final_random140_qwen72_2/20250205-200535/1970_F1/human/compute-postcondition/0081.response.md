Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` and `m` are integers such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd, `grid` is a list containing three elements: the original list `line`, the new list `line`, and the new `line` appended, `elements` is a dictionary that includes additional keys for each non-'..' element in `line`, with their corresponding indices as tuples (0, index), `points` remains [0, 0], `line` is a list of strings read from the input and must have at least one element, `allPlayers` is a dictionary that contains keys for each player character found in `line`, each mapped to `False`, `goal` is a list containing two lists, where each sublist contains tuples representing the positions of 'G' characters in `line`, with the first sublist for 'B' characters and the second sublist for 'R' characters, `ind` is 0, `tmp` is 1, the element at index `ind` in `line` is not '..', `elements` now includes the key `line[0]` with the value `(n - 1, 0)`, and the second character of the element at index `ind` in `line` is 'G'. Additionally, the tuple `(n - 1, 0)` has been appended to `goal[1]`.**
