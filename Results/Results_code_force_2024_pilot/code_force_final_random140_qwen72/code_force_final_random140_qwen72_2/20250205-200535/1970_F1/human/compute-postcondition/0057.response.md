Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` and `m` remain integers such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd, `grid` is a list containing two elements: the original list `line` and the new list `line`, `elements` is a dictionary that includes additional keys for each non-'..' element in `line`, with their corresponding indices as tuples (0, index). If the element at index `ind` in `line` is not '..', `elements` includes the key `line[ind]` with the value `(i, ind)`. `points` remains [0, 0], `line` is now a list of strings read from the input and must have at least one element, `allPlayers` is a dictionary that contains keys for each player character found in `line`, each mapped to `False`. If the element at index `ind` in `line` is a player character, `allPlayers` includes the key `line[ind]` mapped to `False`. If the element at index `ind` in `line` is not a player character and the second character is 'G', `tmp` is 1, and the tuple `(i, ind)` is appended to `goal[tmp]`. `ind` is 1, `elements` now includes the key `line[1]` with the value `(n, 1)`, `tmp` is 0 if the first character of `line[1]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1, `goal[tmp]` now includes the tuple `(n, 1)`.**
