Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 2.
   - `time` is 2.
   - `command` is a list of strings read from standard input.
   - `obj` is the second element of `command` if `len(command) > 3`, otherwise it is the first element of `command`.
   - `com` is the third element of `command` if `len(command) > 3`, otherwise it is the second element of `command`.
   - `el` is the fourth element of `command` if `len(command) > 3`, otherwise it is the third element of `command`.
   - `team` is 1 if the first character of `obj` is 'B', otherwise `team` is 0.
   - `points[team]` is increased by 10.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('%d %s CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' % (time, GoalName[team]))
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `time` is explicitly given as 2.
   - `team` is determined by the first character of `obj`:
     - If the first character of `obj` is 'B', then `team` is 1.
     - Otherwise, `team` is 0.
   - `GoalName` is assumed to be a list where `GoalName[0]` and `GoalName[1]` are predefined strings. For example, `GoalName` might be `['GOAL_A', 'GOAL_B']`.

4. **Possible Scenarios:**
   - If `obj` starts with 'B':
     - `team` will be 1.
     - The print statement will use `GoalName[1]`.
   - If `obj` does not start with 'B':
     - `team` will be 0.
     - The print statement will use `GoalName[0]`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - If `obj` starts with 'B':
     - Output: **2 GOAL_B CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH** (assuming `GoalName[1]` is 'GOAL_B').
   - If `obj` does not start with 'B':
     - Output: **2 GOAL_A CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH** (assuming `GoalName[0]` is 'GOAL_A').

Since the exact content of `GoalName` is not provided, we will use the generic terms `GOAL_A` and `GOAL_B` for clarity.

Output: **2 GOAL_[team] CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH (where GOAL_[team] is the value of GoalName[team], and team is 1 if the first character of obj is 'B', otherwise team is 0)**
