The code snippet `points[team] += 10` increments the value in the list `points` at the index determined by the variable `team` by 10. Given the initial conditions:

- `t` is greater than 1 (unchanged)
- `time` is 1 (unchanged)
- `obj` is the first element of `command` (unchanged)
- `com` is the second element of `command` (unchanged)
- `el` is the third element of `command` (unchanged)
- `team` is 1 if `obj[0]` is 'B', otherwise `team` is 0 (unchanged)

If `team` is 1 (because `obj[0]` is 'B'), then `points[1]` is incremented by 10. If `team` is 0 (because `obj[0]` is not 'B'), then `points[0]` is incremented by 10.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `time` is 1, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `el` is the third element of `command`, `team` is 1 if `obj[0]` is 'B', otherwise `team` is 0, `points[team]` is incremented by 10.**
