Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `time` is 0, `command` is a list of strings read from standard input, and the length of `command` is not equal to 3. A `NameError` is raised due to undefined variables `elements` or `obj`. `nxt` is not defined because `pos`, `mov`, and `com` are not defined. If `obj` is equal to `.B` and `isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])` is true, or if `isPlayer(obj)` is true and `elements['.B']` is equal to `nxt`, then `player` is set to `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` is true, otherwise `player` is set to `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`. If `obj` is not equal to `.B` or `isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])` is false, and if `isPlayer(obj)` is false or `elements['.B']` is not equal to `nxt`, then: if `com` is 'T', `allPlayers[obj]` is set to `False`; if `goalIn(pos)` returns a value that is not -1, `team` is set to this value, and `points[team]` is increased by 1; if `com` is not 'T' and `obj` is a player object (i.e., `isPlayer(obj)` is true), attempting to assign `elements[obj] = nxt` results in a `NameError` because `elements` or `obj` is undefined.***
