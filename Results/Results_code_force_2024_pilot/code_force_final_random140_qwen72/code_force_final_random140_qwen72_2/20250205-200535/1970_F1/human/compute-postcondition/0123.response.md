To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `time` is 0.
   - `command` is a list of strings read from standard input, and its length is not equal to 3.
   - A `NameError` is raised due to undefined variables `elements` or `obj`.
   - `nxt` is not defined because `pos`, `mov`, and `com` are not defined.
   - Either:
     - `obj` is equal to `.B` and `isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])` is true, or
     - `isPlayer(obj)` is true and `elements['.B']` is equal to `nxt`.
   - `player` is set to `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` is true, otherwise `player` is set to `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`.

2. **Analysis:**
   - Since `time` is explicitly set to 0, the first part of the print statement will always be `0`.
   - The `player` variable is determined based on the conditions:
     - If `isPlayer(obj)` is true, `player` is set to `obj`.
     - Otherwise, `player` is set to `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`.

3. **Conditions:**
   - `obj` is either `.B` or some other value.
   - If `obj` is `.B`, then `isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])` must be true.
   - If `obj` is not `.B`, then `isPlayer(obj)` must be true and `elements['.B']` must be equal to `nxt`.

Given these conditions, let's consider the possible values of `player`:
- If `obj` is `.B` and `isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])` is true, then `player` is set to `.B`.
- If `obj` is not `.B` and `isPlayer(obj)` is true, then `player` is set to `obj`.
- If `obj` is not `.B` and `isPlayer(obj)` is false, then `player` is set to `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`.

However, since `nxt` is not defined, the condition `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]` cannot be evaluated, and thus `player` will be set to `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` is true.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will output `0` followed by the value of `player`.
   - Given the conditions, `player` will be `.B` if `obj` is `.B` and `isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])` is true, or it will be the value of `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` is true.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **0 .B (if obj is .B and isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]) is true) or 0 [obj] (if obj is not .B and isPlayer(obj) is true)**
