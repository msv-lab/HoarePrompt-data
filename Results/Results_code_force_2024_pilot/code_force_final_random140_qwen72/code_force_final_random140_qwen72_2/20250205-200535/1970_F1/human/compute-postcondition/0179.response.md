Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `time` is 2, `command` is a list of strings read from standard input, if `len(command) == 3`, `obj` is the second element of `command`, `com` is the third element of `command`, `el` is undefined, `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is (`pos[0] + mov[com][0]`, `pos[1] + mov[com][1]`).** 

Explanation: The code snippet calculates the new position `nxt` based on the current position `pos` and the movement direction `mov[com]`. The new position `nxt` is a tuple where the first element is the sum of `pos[0]` and `mov[com][0]`, and the second element is the sum of `pos[1]` and `mov[com][1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
