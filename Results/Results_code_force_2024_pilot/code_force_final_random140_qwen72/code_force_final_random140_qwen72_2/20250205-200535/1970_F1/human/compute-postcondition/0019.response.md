Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers such that 3 <= n, m <= 99 and both are odd, `grid` is a list containing one element which is the list `line`, `elements` is a dictionary with the key '.B' mapped to the tuple (0, 0) and the key `line[0]` mapped to the tuple (0, 0), `points` is [0, 0], `i` is 0, `line` is a list of strings read from the input and must have at least one element, `ind` is 0, the first element of `line` (i.e., `line[0]`) is not equal to '..'. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `True`, `allPlayers` is a dictionary with the key `line[0]` mapped to `False`. Otherwise, `allPlayers` remains an empty dictionary. If `line[ind][1]` is 'G', then `goal` is a list containing two lists, where `goal[1]` contains the tuple (0, 0), and `tmp` is 1. Otherwise, `goal` remains a list containing two empty lists.***
