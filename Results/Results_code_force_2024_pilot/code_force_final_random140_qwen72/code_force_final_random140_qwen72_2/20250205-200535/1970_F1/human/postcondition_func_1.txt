The function `goalIn` accepts a tuple `pos` and checks if this position is in one of the two sets within the list `goal`. The first set represents the red team's goals, and the second set represents the blue team's goals. The function returns 0 if `pos` is in the red team's goals, 1 if `pos` is in the blue team's goals, and -1 if `pos` is not in either set.
