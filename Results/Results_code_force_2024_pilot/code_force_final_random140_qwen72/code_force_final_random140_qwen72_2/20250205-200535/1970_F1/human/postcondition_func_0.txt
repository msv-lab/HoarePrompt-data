The function `func_1` reads and processes a series of inputs to simulate a Quidditch match. It initializes the game state with a grid representing the playing field, a dictionary mapping character pairs to their positions, a dictionary tracking which players are carrying the Quaffle, lists of goal positions for both teams, and the initial scores of both teams set to zero. The function then processes a series of commands over a specified number of turns. Each command can either update the position of a player, transfer the Quaffle, score points, or end the game with a special event like catching the Golden Snitch. After processing all commands, the function prints the final scores of the red and blue teams. The function does not return any value but modifies and uses the game state internally.
