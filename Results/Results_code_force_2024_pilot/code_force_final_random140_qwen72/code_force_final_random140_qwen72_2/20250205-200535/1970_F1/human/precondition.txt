N and M are integers such that 3 <= N, M <= 99 and both are odd. The field is represented as a list of N strings, each containing M pairs of characters separated by spaces, representing the initial state of the field. Each pair of characters can be ".." for an empty cell, "R0" to "R9" or "B0" to "B9" for players, "RG" or "BG" for goals, and ".Q" for the Quaffle. T is an integer such that 0 <= T <= 10000, representing the number of steps in the game. The actions are a list of T strings, each describing an action performed by an entity on the field.
