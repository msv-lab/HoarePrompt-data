### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program uses `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, and `func_5` to handle input. These functions are designed to read different types of input data, such as single integers, lines of text, and lists of integers. This part is correctly implemented and aligns with the problem's input format.

2. **Graph Construction**:
   - The program constructs the graph using a `defaultdict` of lists and maintains a list of edges with their weights. This is done correctly and efficiently, ensuring that the graph is represented accurately.

3. **Edge Sorting**:
   - The edges are sorted in descending order by weight. While this might seem counterintuitive at first, it is actually a valid approach because the program is looking for the lightest edge in a cycle. By sorting in descending order, the first cycle detected will indeed have the lightest edge. This is a clever optimization to ensure that the lightest edge is found early in the process.

4. **Disjoint Set Union (DSU)**:
   - The program uses a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure to manage connected components. This is a standard and efficient way to handle union-find operations. The DSU is used to detect cycles by checking if two nodes belong to the same component before adding an edge. This is correctly implemented and ensures that cycles are detected accurately.

5. **Cycle Detection**:
   - The program detects cycles by checking if the two endpoints of an edge are already in the same component. If they are, it means adding this edge would form a cycle. The program then uses a BFS (Breadth-First Search) to find the cycle and reconstruct the path. This approach is correct and ensures that the cycle is found and the path is reconstructed accurately.

6. **Path Reconstruction**:
   - The BFS is used to find the path from the start node to the end node of the detected cycle. The path is reconstructed using a dictionary to keep track of the previous node in the BFS traversal. This part is correctly implemented and ensures that the cycle is printed in the correct order.

7. **Output**:
   - The program prints the minimum weight of the edge in the cycle and the number of vertices in the cycle, followed by the vertices of the cycle in traversal order. This matches the required output format and is correctly implemented.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. The use of DSU for cycle detection and BFS for path reconstruction are appropriate and well-implemented. The input and output handling are also correct.

Final: **True**
