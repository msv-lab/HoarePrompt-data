### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program uses `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, and `func_5` to handle input. These functions are correctly implemented to read different types of input data, such as single integers, lines of text, and lists of integers. This aligns with the problem's input format.

2. **Graph Construction**:
   - The program constructs the graph using a `defaultdict` of lists and maintains a list of edges with their weights. This is done correctly and efficiently. The graph is built by appending both directions of each edge to ensure the graph is undirected.

3. **Edge Sorting**:
   - The edges are sorted in descending order by weight. This is a bit counterintuitive because we want to find the lightest edge in a cycle. However, the logic in the program compensates for this by breaking when it finds the first cycle, which will be the one with the lightest edge due to the reverse sorting. This approach is valid but could be more intuitive if sorted in ascending order.

4. **Disjoint Set Union (DSU)**:
   - The program uses a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure to manage connected components. This is a standard and efficient way to handle union-find operations. The DSU is used to detect cycles by checking if two nodes belong to the same component before adding an edge. The implementation of the DSU is correct and efficient.

5. **Cycle Detection**:
   - The program detects cycles by checking if the two endpoints of an edge are already in the same component. If they are, it means adding this edge would form a cycle. The program then uses a BFS (Breadth-First Search) to find the cycle and reconstruct the path. This is a correct approach to detecting and reconstructing cycles.

6. **Path Reconstruction**:
   - The BFS is used to find the path from the start node to the end node of the detected cycle. The path is reconstructed using a dictionary to keep track of the previous node in the BFS traversal. This part is correctly implemented and ensures that the path is reconstructed accurately.

7. **Output**:
   - The program prints the minimum weight of the edge in the cycle and the number of vertices in the cycle, followed by the vertices of the cycle in traversal order. This matches the required output format.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. The use of DSU for cycle detection and BFS for path reconstruction are appropriate and well-implemented. The input and output handling are also correct. The only minor issue is the counterintuitive sorting of edges in descending order, but this does not affect the correctness of the solution.

Final: **True**
