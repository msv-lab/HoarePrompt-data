### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program uses functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, and `func_5` to handle input. These functions are correctly implemented to read different types of input data, such as single integers, lines of text, and lists of integers. This aligns with the problem's input format.

2. **Graph Construction**:
   - The program constructs the graph using a `defaultdict` of lists and maintains a list of edges with their weights. This is done correctly and efficiently, ensuring that the graph is represented accurately.

3. **Edge Sorting**:
   - The edges are sorted in descending order by weight. This is a bit counterintuitive because we are looking for the lightest edge in a cycle. However, the logic in the program compensates for this by breaking when it finds the first cycle, which will be the one with the lightest edge due to the reverse sorting. This approach is valid and ensures that the lightest edge in a cycle is found first.

4. **Disjoint Set Union (DSU)**:
   - The program uses a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure to manage connected components. This is a standard and efficient way to handle union-find operations. The DSU is used to detect cycles by checking if two nodes belong to the same component before adding an edge. This is correctly implemented and ensures that cycles are detected accurately.

5. **Cycle Detection**:
   - The program detects cycles by checking if the two endpoints of an edge are already in the same component. If they are, it means adding this edge would form a cycle. The program then uses a BFS (Breadth-First Search) to find the cycle and reconstruct the path. This is a correct and efficient approach to cycle detection and path reconstruction.

6. **Path Reconstruction**:
   - The BFS is used to find the path from the start node to the end node of the detected cycle. The path is reconstructed using a dictionary to keep track of the previous node in the BFS traversal. This part is correctly implemented and ensures that the path is reconstructed accurately.

7. **Output**:
   - The program prints the minimum weight of the edge in the cycle and the number of vertices in the cycle, followed by the vertices of the cycle in traversal order. This matches the required output format and is correctly implemented.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. The use of DSU for cycle detection and BFS for path reconstruction are appropriate and well-implemented. The input and output handling are also correct.

Final: **True**
