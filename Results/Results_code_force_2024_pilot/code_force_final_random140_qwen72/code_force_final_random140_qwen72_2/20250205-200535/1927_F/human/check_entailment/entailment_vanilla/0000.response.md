### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, and `func_5` to handle input. These functions read different types of input data, such as single integers, lines of text, and lists of integers. This part seems to be correctly implemented for the given problem's input format.

2. **Graph Construction**: The program constructs the graph using a `defaultdict` of lists. It also maintains a list of edges with their weights. This is done correctly and efficiently.

3. **Edge Sorting**: The edges are sorted in descending order by weight. This is necessary to find the lightest edge in a cycle, but sorting in descending order is not the most intuitive approach. However, the logic in the program compensates for this by breaking when it finds the first cycle, which will be the one with the lightest edge due to the reverse sorting.

4. **Disjoint Set Union (DSU)**: The program uses a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure to manage connected components. This is a standard and efficient way to handle union-find operations. The DSU is used to detect cycles by checking if two nodes belong to the same component before adding an edge.

5. **Cycle Detection**: The program detects cycles by checking if the two endpoints of an edge are already in the same component. If they are, it means adding this edge would form a cycle. The program then uses a BFS (Breadth-First Search) to find the cycle and reconstruct the path.

6. **Path Reconstruction**: The BFS is used to find the path from the start node to the end node of the detected cycle. The path is reconstructed using a dictionary to keep track of the previous node in the BFS traversal. This part is correctly implemented.

7. **Output**: The program prints the minimum weight of the edge in the cycle and the number of vertices in the cycle, followed by the vertices of the cycle in traversal order. This matches the required output format.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. The use of DSU for cycle detection and BFS for path reconstruction are appropriate and well-implemented. The input and output handling are also correct.

Correctness: **True**
