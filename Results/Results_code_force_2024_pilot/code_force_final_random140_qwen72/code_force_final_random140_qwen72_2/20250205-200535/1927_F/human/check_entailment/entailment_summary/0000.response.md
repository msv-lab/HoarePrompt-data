### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - `func_1` reads the number of test cases.
   - `func_6` reads the number of vertices and edges, and the edges themselves. This is done using `func_3` to parse the input.

2. **Graph Construction:**
   - `func_6` constructs the graph using a `defaultdict` to store the adjacency list and a list to store the edges.
   - The edges are sorted in descending order by weight to ensure that the heaviest edges are considered first.

3. **Finding the Minimum Weight Cycle:**
   - A Disjoint Set Union (DSU) structure is used to keep track of connected components.
   - For each edge, if the two vertices are already in the same component, it means adding this edge would form a cycle. The weight of this edge is recorded as the minimum weight of the cycle.
   - If the vertices are in different components, they are unioned.

4. **Reconstructing the Cycle:**
   - Once a cycle is detected, a breadth-first search (BFS) is performed to find the path from the start node to the end node of the cycle.
   - The path is reconstructed and printed in reverse order.

5. **Handling Multiple Test Cases:**
   - `func_7` handles multiple test cases by calling `func_6` for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly reads the input and constructs the graph.
- The use of DSU ensures that the cycle detection is efficient.
- The BFS is used to reconstruct the cycle path, which is a valid approach.
- The program prints the required output format for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program meets the problem description and handles all the requirements correctly.

### Correctness:
**True**
