The only objects in the loop head are `nei` and `graph[node]`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list of neighbors `graph[node]`. If there are more neighbors left to iterate over, the loop will continue.

At the end of the last iteration, `node` is a key in `graph` with at least two neighbors, and `nei` is the second neighbor in `graph[node]`. For the loop to execute one more time, `graph[node]` must have at least three neighbors, and `nei` should now refer to the third neighbor in `graph[node]`.

State: **`node` is a key in `graph` with at least three neighbors, and `nei` is the third neighbor in `graph[node]`.**
