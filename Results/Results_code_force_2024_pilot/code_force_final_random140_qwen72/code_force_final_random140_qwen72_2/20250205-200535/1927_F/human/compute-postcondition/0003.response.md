The only object in the loop head is the variable `test_cases`. For the loop to execute one more time, `test_cases` must still be greater than 0 at the start of the next iteration. Since the loop does not explicitly modify `test_cases`, it is assumed that the loop will continue to run as long as `test_cases` remains greater than 0.

However, since the loop uses an underscore `_` as the iterator variable, it indicates that the value of the iterator itself is not used within the loop body. This means that the loop simply runs `test_cases` number of times, decrementing an implicit counter each time, but this counter is not directly visible or modifiable in the given context.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, where `test_cases` must be greater than 0, for the loop to execute one more time, `test_cases` must still be greater than 0 at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0**
