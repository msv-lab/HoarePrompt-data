Output State: **`node` is a key in `graph` with at least three neighbors, `nei` is the third neighbor in `graph[node]`, `prev[nei]` is set to `node`, `que` now includes `nei`, and if `node` is equal to `start` and `nei` is equal to `end`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program proceeds as normal.**
