Output State: **`parent_v` is the parent of `v` as determined by the `find` method of `dsu`; `parent_u` is the parent of `u` as determined by the `find` method of `dsu`; `n` and `m` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`; `edges` is a list containing at least one tuple of the form `(w, u, v)` sorted in descending order based on the first element `w`; `graph` is a defaultdict of type list where each key `u` has a list of all `v` values that were appended during the loop, and each key `v` has a list of all `u` values that were appended during the loop; `m` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations; `i` is `m-1`; `dsu` is a new instance of the `DSU` class with the size `n + 1`; `w`, `u`, and `v` are set to the values of the second tuple in `edges`; `_min_edge` is set to the value of `w`; if `parent_u` is equal to `parent_v`, `start` is set to `u`, and `end` is set to `v`; otherwise, `start` remains set to -1, and `end` remains set to -1; `u` and `v` are now in the same connected component according to the `dsu` structure; `start` is set to `u`.** 

Explanation: The code snippet `start = u` updates the variable `start` to the value of `u`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
