Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *All neighbors of `node` have been processed. For each neighbor `nei` of `node` that is not in `prev`, `prev[nei]` is set to `node`, and `nei` is added to `que`. If `node` is equal to `start` and `nei` is equal to `end`, the loop continues to the next iteration. The `que` contains all unvisited neighbors of `node` that were not previously in `prev`. The `prev` dictionary contains all nodes that have been visited and their respective predecessors. `que` must contain at least one element. `node` is now the first element that was in `que` before the `popleft()` operation, and `que` no longer contains this element. If `node` is equal to `end`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Code of the loop:
for nei in graph[node]:
    if node == start and nei == end:
        continue
    if nei not in prev:
        prev[nei] = node
        que.append(nei)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`graph[node]` is a non-empty iterable, `nei` takes on the values from `graph[node]` during each iteration. If `node` is equal to `start` and `nei` is equal to `end`, the current iteration is skipped. If `nei` is not in `prev`, `prev[nei]` is set to `node` and `nei` is appended to `que`. If `nei` is already in `prev`, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`nei` is the next value from `graph[node]`, and `graph[node]` remains unchanged. If `nei` is not in `prev`, `prev[nei]` is set to `node`, and `nei` is added to `que`. If `node` is equal to `start` and `nei` is equal to `end`, the condition is met. Otherwise, the condition is not met.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`nei` is the next value from `graph[node]`, and `graph[node]` remains unchanged. If `nei` is not in `prev`, `prev[nei]` is set to `node`, and `nei` is added to `que`. If `node` is equal to `start` and `nei` is equal to `end`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program proceeds as normal.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
