The only objects in the loop head are `nei` and `graph[node]`, so we can only adjust those.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the state of `graph[node]`. For the loop to execute one more time, `graph[node]` must still contain at least one neighbor that hasn't been processed yet. At the end of the last iteration, `graph[node]` must contain at least one neighbor, and `nei` will take on the values of these neighbors during the loop iterations.

For the loop to execute one more time, `nei` will be set to the next neighbor in `graph[node]`.

State: **`graph[node]` must contain at least one neighbor, and `nei` will take on the value of the next neighbor in `graph[node]` during the next iteration.**
