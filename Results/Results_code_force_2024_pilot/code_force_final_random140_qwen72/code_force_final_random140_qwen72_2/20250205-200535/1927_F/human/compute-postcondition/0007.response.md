Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations the loop has completed, and `func_6()` has been executed the same number of times as the loop has iterated.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the value of `test_cases` must be at least as large as the number of times the loop has run, and the function `func_6()` has been called exactly that many times.
