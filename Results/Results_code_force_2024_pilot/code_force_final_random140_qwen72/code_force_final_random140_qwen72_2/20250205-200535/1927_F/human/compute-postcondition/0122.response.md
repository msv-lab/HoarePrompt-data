The only objects in the loop head are `nei` and `graph[node]`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `graph[node]`. If `graph[node]` contains more neighbors, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `graph[node]` must contain at least one neighbor, and `nei` will take on the value of the next neighbor in `graph[node]` during the next iteration.

For the loop to execute one more time, `graph[node]` must still contain at least one more neighbor that hasn't been processed yet. Therefore, `nei` will be the next neighbor in `graph[node]`.

State: **`graph[node]` must contain at least two neighbors, and `nei` will take on the value of the next (second) neighbor in `graph[node]` during the next iteration.**
