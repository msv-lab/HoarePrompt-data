The loop condition is `curr != -1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `curr` must not be `-1`. According to the state at the end of the previous iteration, `curr` is the predecessor of the predecessor of `end` as stored in the `prev` dictionary, and `end` must not be `-1`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `curr` should still hold a valid node (not `-1`). Since the `prev` dictionary contains all nodes that have been visited along with their respective predecessors, and assuming the path from `start` to `end` exists, `curr` should point to a valid node in the path.

Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `curr` as it already points to a valid node (the predecessor of the predecessor of `end`), and the loop can proceed as long as `curr` is not `-1`.

State: **The loop has processed all nodes in the `que` until it either finds the `end` node or exhausts the queue. The `prev` dictionary contains all nodes that have been visited along with their respective predecessors, forming a path from the `start` node to the `end` node if such a path exists. The `que` is empty, indicating that all reachable nodes have been processed. The `node` variable holds the value of the last node that was processed from the front of `que`. If the `end` node was found, the loop terminated early when `node` became equal to `end`. If the `end` node was not found, the loop terminated because the `que` became empty. `path` is a list containing the `end` node and its predecessor (`curr`). `curr` is now equal to the predecessor of the predecessor of `end` as stored in the `prev` dictionary, and `end` must not be `-1`.**
