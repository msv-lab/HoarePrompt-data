Output State: **`n` and `m` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `edges` is a list containing the tuple `(w, u, v)`, `graph` is a defaultdict of type list where `graph[u]` now contains `v` and `graph[v]` contains `u`, `m` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `u`, `v`, and `w` are assigned the values returned by `func_3()`.**

Explanation:
- The line `graph[u].append(v)` adds `v` to the list `graph[u]`.
- The values of `n`, `m`, `u`, `v`, and `w` are unchanged from their assignments by `func_3()`.
- The structure of `graph` remains a defaultdict of type list, but `graph[u]` now includes `v`.
- All other conditions and variable values remain as specified in the initial state.
