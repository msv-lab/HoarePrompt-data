To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop condition:

- **Loop Condition**: `while curr != -1:`
- **Current State**:
  - The `que` is empty, indicating that all reachable nodes have been processed.
  - The `node` variable holds the value of the last node that was processed from the front of `que`.
  - `path` is an empty list.
  - `curr` is now equal to `end`.

For the loop to execute, `curr` must not be equal to `-1`. Given that `curr` is set to `end`, the loop will execute if `end` is not `-1`.

Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `end` (and consequently `curr`) is not `-1`.

State: **The loop has processed all nodes in the `que` until it either finds the `end` node or exhausts the queue. The `prev` dictionary contains all nodes that have been visited along with their respective predecessors, forming a path from the `start` node to the `end` node if such a path exists. The `que` is empty, indicating that all reachable nodes have been processed. The `node` variable holds the value of the last node that was processed from the front of `que`. If the `end` node was found, the loop terminated early when `node` became equal to `end`. If the `end` node was not found, the loop terminated because the `que` became empty. `path` is an empty list. `curr` is now equal to `end` and `end` must not be `-1`.**
