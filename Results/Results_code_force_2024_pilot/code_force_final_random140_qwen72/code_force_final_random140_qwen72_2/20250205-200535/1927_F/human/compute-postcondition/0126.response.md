Output State: **`graph[node]` must contain at least two neighbors, `nei` will take on the value of the next (second) neighbor in `graph[node]` during the next iteration, `prev[nei]` is now set to `node`, `que` now includes `nei`. If `node` is equal to `start` and `nei` is equal to `end`, the current iteration of the loop ends immediately, and control moves to the next iteration.**
