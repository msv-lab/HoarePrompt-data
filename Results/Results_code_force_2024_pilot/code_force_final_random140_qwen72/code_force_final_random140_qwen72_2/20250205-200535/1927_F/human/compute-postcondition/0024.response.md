To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `w`, `u`, and `v` from the `edges` list. The loop will execute if `edges` contains at least one tuple. Let's break down the necessary adjustments:

1. **`edges`**: This list must contain at least one tuple of the form `(w, u, v)` for the loop to execute.
2. **`w`, `u`, `v`**: These are the elements of the first tuple in the `edges` list.

Given the initial state, we need to ensure that `edges` is non-empty and that the first iteration sets `w`, `u`, and `v` to the values of the first tuple in `edges`.

### Adjusted State
- **`edges`**: Must contain at least one tuple.
- **`w`, `u`, `v`**: Set to the values of the first tuple in `edges`.
- **Other variables**: `n`, `m`, `graph`, `dsu`, `_min_edge`, `start`, and `end` remain as they are because they are not part of the loop head.

### Final State
State: **`n` and `m` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `edges` is a list containing at least one tuple of the form `(w, u, v)` sorted in descending order based on the first element `w`, `graph` is a defaultdict of type list where each key `u` has a list of all `v` values that were appended during the loop, and each key `v` has a list of all `u` values that were appended during the loop, `m` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is `m-1`, `dsu` is a new instance of the `DSU` class with the size `n + 1`, `_min_edge` is set to infinity (`float('inf')`), `start` is set to -1, `end` is set to -1, `w`, `u`, and `v` are set to the values of the first tuple in `edges`**.
