Based on the initial state provided:

- The loop has processed all nodes in the `que` until it either finds the `end` node or exhausts the queue.
- The `prev` dictionary contains all nodes that have been visited along with their respective predecessors, forming a path from the `start` node to the `end` node if such a path exists.
- The `que` is empty, indicating that all reachable nodes have been processed.
- The `node` variable holds the value of the last node that was processed from the front of `que`.
- If the `end` node was found, the loop terminated early when `node` became equal to `end`.
- If the `end` node was not found, the loop terminated because the `que` became empty.
- `path` is a list containing the full path from the `end` node back to the `start` node, in reverse order.
- `curr` is now equal to `-1`, indicating that the loop has completed and the entire path has been reconstructed.

Given this state, the `print(*path[::-1])` statement will print the elements of the `path` list in the correct order, from the `start` node to the `end` node. If no path was found, `path` would be an empty list, and nothing would be printed.

Output: **[start_node, ..., end_node] (where start_node is the starting node and end_node is the ending node, and the ellipsis represents any intermediate nodes in the path from start to end)**

If no path was found, the output would be:
Output: **(nothing printed)**
