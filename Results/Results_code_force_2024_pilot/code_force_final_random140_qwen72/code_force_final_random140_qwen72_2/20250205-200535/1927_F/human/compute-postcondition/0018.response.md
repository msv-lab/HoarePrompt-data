Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `n` and `m` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `edges` is a list containing `m` tuples of the form `(w, u, v)`, `graph` is a defaultdict of type list where each key `u` has a list of all `v` values that were appended during the loop, and each key `v` has a list of all `u` values that were appended during the loop. The value of `m` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, and `i` is `m-1`. For each iteration, `u`, `v`, and `w` are assigned the values returned by `func_3()`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations:
- The variables `n` and `m` are still updated to the values returned by `func_3()`.
- The list `edges` contains `m` tuples, each representing a weighted edge `(w, u, v)` added during the loop.
- The `graph` dictionary (defaultdict of lists) will have keys `u` and `v` with their respective lists containing all the vertices they are connected to.
- The loop runs `m` times, so `i` will be `m-1` when the loop finishes.
- For each iteration, the variables `u`, `v`, and `w` are set to the values returned by `func_3()`.
