The only objects in the loop head are `nei` and `graph[node]`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the neighbors of `node` in the `graph`. If there are more neighbors, the loop will continue to the next neighbor.

At the end of the last iteration, `node` is a key in `graph` with at least one neighbor, and `nei` is the first neighbor in `graph[node]`. For the loop to execute one more time, `nei` needs to be the next neighbor in the list of neighbors of `node`.

State: **`node` is a key in `graph` with at least two neighbors, `nei` is the second neighbor in `graph[node]`**
