The variable `curr` is assigned the value of `end`. This does not affect the state of the `que`, which remains empty, nor does it change the contents of the `prev` dictionary or the `path` list. The `node` variable retains its value, which is the last node processed from the front of `que`.

Output State: **The loop has processed all nodes in the `que` until it either finds the `end` node or exhausts the queue. The `prev` dictionary contains all nodes that have been visited along with their respective predecessors, forming a path from the `start` node to the `end` node if such a path exists. The `que` is empty, indicating that all reachable nodes have been processed. The `node` variable holds the value of the last node that was processed from the front of `que`. If the `end` node was found, the loop terminated early when `node` became equal to `end`. If the `end` node was not found, the loop terminated because the `que` became empty. `path` is an empty list. `curr` is now equal to `end`.**
