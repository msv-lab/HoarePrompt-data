The only object in the loop head is `que`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `que`. If `que` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, all neighbors of `node` have been processed and added to `que` if they were not previously in `prev`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `que` must contain at least one element.

State: **All neighbors of `node` have been processed. For each neighbor `nei` of `node` that is not in `prev`, `prev[nei]` is set to `node`, and `nei` is added to `que`. If `node` is equal to `start` and `nei` is equal to `end`, the loop continues to the next iteration. The `que` contains all unvisited neighbors of `node` that were not previously in `prev`. The `prev` dictionary contains all nodes that have been visited and their respective predecessors. `que` must contain at least one element.**
