The function `func_6()` is called, but there is no information provided about what this function does or what it returns. Since the initial state only specifies that `test_cases` must be greater than 0, and there is no indication that `func_6()` modifies `test_cases` or any other variable, the state remains unchanged except for the fact that `func_6()` has been executed.

Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `func_6()` has been executed.**
