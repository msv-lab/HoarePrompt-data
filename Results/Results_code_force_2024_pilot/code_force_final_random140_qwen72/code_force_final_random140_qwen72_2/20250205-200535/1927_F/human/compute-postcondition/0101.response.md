Output State: **`nei` is the next value from `graph[node]`, `graph[node]` remains unchanged, `prev[nei]` is set to `node`, `que` now includes `nei`, and if `node` is equal to `start` and `nei` is equal to `end`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program proceeds as normal.**
