Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After all iterations of the loop, `n` and `m` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `edges` is a list containing `m` tuples of the form `(w, u, v)` sorted in descending order based on the first element `w`, `graph` is a defaultdict of type list where each key `u` has a list of all `v` values that were appended during the loop, and each key `v` has a list of all `u` values that were appended during the loop. The value of `m` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, and `i` is `m-1`. A new instance of the `DSU` class is created with the size `n + 1` and assigned to the variable `dsu`. `_min_edge` is set to infinity (`float('inf')`). `start` is set to -1. `end` is set to -1.
Code of the loop:
for w, u, v in edges:
    parent_u = dsu.find(u)
    parent_v = dsu.find(v)
    if parent_u == parent_v:
        _min_edge = w
        start = u
        end = v
    else:
        dsu.union(u, v)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` and `m` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `edges` is a list containing at least one tuple of the form `(w, u, v)` sorted in descending order based on the first element `w`, `graph` is a defaultdict of type list where each key `u` has a list of all `v` values that were appended during the loop, and each key `v` has a list of all `u` values that were appended during the loop, `m` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is `m-1`, `dsu` is a new instance of the `DSU` class with the size `n + 1`, `w`, `u`, and `v` are set to the values of the first tuple in `edges`, `parent_u` is the parent of `u` as determined by the `find` method of `dsu`, `parent_v` is the parent of `v` as determined by the `find` method of `dsu`. If `parent_u` is equal to `parent_v`, `_min_edge` is set to `w`, `start` is set to `u`, and `end` is set to `v`. Otherwise, `_min_edge` remains set to infinity (`float('inf')`), `start` remains set to -1, `end` remains set to -1, and `u` and `v` are now in the same connected component according to the `dsu` structure.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `parent_v` is the parent of `v` and `parent_u` is the parent of `u` as determined by the `find` method of `dsu`; `n` and `m` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`; `edges` is a list containing at least one tuple of the form `(w, u, v)` sorted in descending order based on the first element `w`; `graph` is a defaultdict of type list where each key `u` has a list of all `v` values that were appended during the loop, and each key `v` has a list of all `u` values that were appended during the loop; `m` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations; `i` is `m-1`; `dsu` is a new instance of the `DSU` class with the size `n + 1`; `w`, `u`, and `v` are set to the values of the second tuple in `edges`. If `parent_u` is equal to `parent_v`, `_min_edge` is set to `w`, `start` is set to `u`, and `end` is set to `v`. Otherwise, `_min_edge` remains set to infinity (`float('inf')`), `start` remains set to -1, and `end` remains set to -1. In both cases, `u` and `v` are now in the same connected component according to the `dsu` structure.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `parent_v` is the parent of `v` and `parent_u` is the parent of `u` as determined by the `find` method of `dsu`. `n` and `m` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`. `edges` is a list containing at least one tuple of the form `(w, u, v)` sorted in descending order based on the first element `w`. `graph` is a defaultdict of type list where each key `u` has a list of all `v` values that were appended during the loop, and each key `v` has a list of all `u` values that were appended during the loop. `m` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations, and `i` is `m-1`. `dsu` is a new instance of the `DSU` class with the size `n + 1`. `w`, `u`, and `v` are set to the values of the third tuple in `edges`. If `parent_u` is equal to `parent_v`, `_min_edge` is set to `w`, `start` is set to `u`, and `end` is set to `v`. Otherwise, `_min_edge` remains set to infinity (`float('inf')`), `start` remains set to -1, and `end` remains set to -1. In both cases, `u` and `v` are now in the same connected component according to the `dsu` structure.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
