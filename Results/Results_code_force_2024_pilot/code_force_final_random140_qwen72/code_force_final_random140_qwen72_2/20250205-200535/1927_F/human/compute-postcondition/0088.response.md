Output State: **`graph[node]` is a non-empty iterable, `nei` takes on the values from `graph[node]` during each iteration, `nei` is not in `prev`. If `node` is equal to `start` and `nei` is equal to `end`, the current iteration is skipped. `prev[nei]` is set to `node`.** 

Explanation: The code assigns `node` to `prev[nei]` for each `nei` in `graph[node]` unless `node` is equal to `start` and `nei` is equal to `end`, in which case that iteration is skipped. The condition that `nei` is not in `prev` remains unchanged.
