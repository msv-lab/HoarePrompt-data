Output State: **`n` and `m` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `edges` is a list containing the tuples `(w, u, v)` and the new tuple `(w, u, v)`, `graph` is a defaultdict of type list where `graph[u]` now contains `v` and `u` (duplicated) and `v` is appended again, `m` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `u`, `v`, and `w` are assigned the values returned by `func_3()`**

Explanation:
- The code `graph[u].append(v)` appends `v` to the list `graph[u]`.
- Since `graph[u]` already contains `v` and `u` (duplicated), after appending `v` again, `graph[u]` will contain `v`, `u`, and another `v`.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `edges`, `i`, `u`, `v`, and `w`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
