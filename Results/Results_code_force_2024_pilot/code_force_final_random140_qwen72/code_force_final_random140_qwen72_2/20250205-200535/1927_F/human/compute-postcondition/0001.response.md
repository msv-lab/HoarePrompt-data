To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `_` and `test_cases`. The loop will execute if `test_cases` is greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder used to indicate that the loop variable is not used within the loop body, and it does not need to be explicitly set.

Given that `test_cases` is the result of calling `func_1()`, we need to ensure that `func_1()` returns a value greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0**
