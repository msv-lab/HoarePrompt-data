Output State: **`test_cases` is the result of calling `func_1()`.** 

Explanation: The variable `test_cases` is assigned the value returned by the function `func_1()`. Since no variables are passed to `func_7`, and there are no other variables mentioned in the initial state, the only change is the assignment of `test_cases` to the result of `func_1()`.
