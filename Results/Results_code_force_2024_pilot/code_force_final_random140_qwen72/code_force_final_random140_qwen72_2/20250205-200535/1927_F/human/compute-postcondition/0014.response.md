Output State: **`n` and `m` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `edges` is a list containing the tuples `(w, u, v)` and the new tuple `(w, u, v)`, `graph` is a defaultdict of type list where `graph[u]` now contains `v` and `u` (duplicated), `m` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `u`, `v`, and `w` are assigned the values returned by `func_3()`**

Explanation:
- `u`, `v`, and `w` are assigned the values returned by `func_3()`.
- Since `n` and `m` are also updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, they now hold the same values as `u`, `v`, and `w` respectively.
- The condition that `m` must be greater than 2 remains unchanged.
- The list `edges` still contains the tuples `(w, u, v)` and the new tuple `(w, u, v)`.
- The `graph` is still a defaultdict of type list where `graph[u]` contains `v` and `u` (duplicated).
- The value of `i` remains 2.
