Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `n` and `m` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `edges` is a list containing `m` tuples of the form `(w, u, v)` sorted in descending order based on the first element `w`, `graph` is a defaultdict of type list where each key `u` has a list of all `v` values that were appended during the loop, and each key `v` has a list of all `u` values that were appended during the loop. The value of `m` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, and `i` is `m-1`.**
