Output State: **All neighbors of `node` have been processed. For each neighbor `nei` of `node` that is not in `prev`, `prev[nei]` is set to `node`, and `nei` is added to `que`. If `node` is equal to `start` and `nei` is equal to `end`, the loop continues to the next iteration. The `que` contains all unvisited neighbors of `node` that were not previously in `prev`. The `prev` dictionary contains all nodes that have been visited and their respective predecessors. `que` must contain at least one element. `node` is now the first element that was in `que` before the `popleft()` operation, and `que` no longer contains this element. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
