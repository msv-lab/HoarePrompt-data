Functionality: ** The function `func_6` constructs a graph from a given set of edges and finds the minimum weight cycle in the graph. It takes no explicit parameters but internally uses `func_3` to read the number of vertices `n`, the number of edges `m`, and the edges themselves. The function then creates a graph representation using a defaultdict and a list of edges. It sorts the edges in descending order by weight and uses a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) structure to find the minimum weight cycle. If a cycle is found, it determines the start and end nodes of the cycle and reconstructs the path. Finally, it prints the minimum edge weight in the cycle and the length of the path, followed by the nodes in the path in reverse order. If no cycle is found, it prints the minimum edge weight as infinity and an empty path. **
