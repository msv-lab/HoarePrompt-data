To determine what will be printed by the `print(_min_edge, len(path))` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the context:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - The loop has processed all nodes in the `que` until it either finds the `end` node or exhausts the queue.
   - The `prev` dictionary contains all nodes that have been visited along with their respective predecessors, forming a path from the `start` node to the `end` node if such a path exists.
   - The `que` is empty, indicating that all reachable nodes have been processed.
   - The `node` variable holds the value of the last node that was processed from the front of `que`.
     - If the `end` node was found, the loop terminated early when `node` became equal to `end`.
     - If the `end` node was not found, the loop terminated because the `que` became empty.
   - `path` is a list containing the full path from the `end` node back to the `start` node, in reverse order.
   - `curr` is now equal to `-1`, indicating that the loop has completed and the entire path has been reconstructed.

2. **Variables in the Print Statement:**
   - `_min_edge`: This variable is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state. It is likely a variable that holds the minimum edge weight encountered during the path reconstruction or search process. Without more context, we cannot determine its exact value.
   - `len(path)`: This is the length of the `path` list, which contains the full path from the `end` node back to the `start` node. The length of this list represents the number of nodes in the path.

3. **Output Calculation:**
   - Since `_min_edge` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value. However, we know it is a variable that might hold a specific value related to the edges in the graph.
   - The length of the `path` list (`len(path)`) is the number of nodes in the path from the `end` node back to the `start` node.

Given this analysis, the output of the print statement will be:

Output: **_min_edge, len(path) (where _min_edge is the value of the minimum edge weight encountered, and len(path) is the number of nodes in the path from the end node back to the start node)**
