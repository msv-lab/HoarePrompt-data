Postcondition: ***`node` is a key in `graph` with at least two neighbors, and `nei` is the second neighbor in `graph[node]`. If `nei` is not in `prev`, `prev[nei]` is set to `node`, and `que` is updated to include `nei`. If `node` is equal to `start` and `nei` is equal to `end`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.***
