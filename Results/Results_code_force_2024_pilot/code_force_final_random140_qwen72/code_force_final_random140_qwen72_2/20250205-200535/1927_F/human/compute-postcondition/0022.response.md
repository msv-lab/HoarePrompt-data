Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `n` and `m` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `edges` is a list containing `m` tuples of the form `(w, u, v)` sorted in descending order based on the first element `w`, `graph` is a defaultdict of type list where each key `u` has a list of all `v` values that were appended during the loop, and each key `v` has a list of all `u` values that were appended during the loop. The value of `m` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, and `i` is `m-1`. A new instance of the `DSU` class is created with the size `n + 1` and assigned to the variable `dsu`. `_min_edge` is set to infinity (`float('inf')`). `start` is set to -1.**
