The function `func_6()` is called, but there is no information provided about what `func_6()` does or any variables it might affect. Since the initial state only specifies that `test_cases` must be greater than 0, and there is no indication that `func_6()` changes this or any other variable, the output state remains the same.

Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0**
