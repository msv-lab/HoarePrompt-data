The only objects in the loop head are `nei` and `graph[node]`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values in `graph[node]`. If there are more elements in `graph[node]`, the loop will continue to the next element.

At the end of the last iteration, `nei` was the next value from `graph[node]`, and `graph[node]` remains unchanged. For the loop to execute one more time, `nei` must be the next value in `graph[node]`.

State: **`nei` is the next value from `graph[node]`, and `graph[node]` remains unchanged.**
