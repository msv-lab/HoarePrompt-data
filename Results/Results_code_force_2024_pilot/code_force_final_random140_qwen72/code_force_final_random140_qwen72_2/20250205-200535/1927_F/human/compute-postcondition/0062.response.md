Postcondition: **`node` is a key in `graph` with at least one neighbor, `nei` is the first neighbor in `graph[node]`. If `node` is equal to `start` and `nei` is equal to `end`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program proceeds as usual. Additionally, `nei` is not in the `prev` set.**
