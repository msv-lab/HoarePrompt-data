Postcondition: ***`graph[node]` must contain at least one neighbor, and `nei` will take on the value of the next neighbor in `graph[node]` during the next iteration. If `node` is equal to `start` and `nei` is equal to `end`, the current iteration is skipped, and control moves to the next iteration of the loop.***
