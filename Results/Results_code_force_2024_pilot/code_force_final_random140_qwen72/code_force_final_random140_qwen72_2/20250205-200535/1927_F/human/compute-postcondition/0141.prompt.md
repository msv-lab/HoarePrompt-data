Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The loop has processed all nodes in the `que` until it either finds the `end` node or exhausts the queue. The `prev` dictionary contains all nodes that have been visited along with their respective predecessors, forming a path from the `start` node to the `end` node if such a path exists. The `que` is empty, indicating that all reachable nodes have been processed. The `node` variable holds the value of the last node that was processed from the front of `que`. If the `end` node was found, the loop terminated early when `node` became equal to `end`. If the `end` node was not found, the loop terminated because the `que` became empty. `path` is an empty list. `curr` is now equal to `end`.
Code of the loop:
while curr != -1:
    path.append(curr)
    curr = prev[curr]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The loop has processed all nodes in the `que` until it either finds the `end` node or exhausts the queue. The `prev` dictionary contains all nodes that have been visited along with their respective predecessors, forming a path from the `start` node to the `end` node if such a path exists. The `que` is empty, indicating that all reachable nodes have been processed. The `node` variable holds the value of the last node that was processed from the front of `que`. If the `end` node was found, the loop terminated early when `node` became equal to `end`. If the `end` node was not found, the loop terminated because the `que` became empty. `path` is a list containing the `end` node. `curr` is now equal to the predecessor of `end` as stored in the `prev` dictionary, and `end` must not be `-1`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: The loop has processed all nodes in the `que` until it either finds the `end` node or exhausts the queue. The `prev` dictionary contains all nodes that have been visited along with their respective predecessors, forming a path from the `start` node to the `end` node if such a path exists. The `que` is empty, indicating that all reachable nodes have been processed. The `node` variable holds the value of the last node that was processed from the front of `que`. If the `end` node was found, the loop terminated early when `node` became equal to `end`. If the `end` node was not found, the loop terminated because the `que` became empty. `path` is a list containing the `end` node and its predecessor (`curr`). `curr` is now equal to the predecessor of the predecessor of `end` as stored in the `prev` dictionary, and `end` must not be `-1`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: The loop has processed all nodes in the `que` until it either finds the `end` node or exhausts the queue. The `prev` dictionary contains all nodes that have been visited along with their respective predecessors, forming a path from the `start` node to the `end` node if such a path exists. The `que` is empty, indicating that all reachable nodes have been processed. The `node` variable holds the value of the last node that was processed from the front of `que`. If the `end` node was found, the loop terminated early when `node` became equal to `end`. If the `end` node was not found, the loop terminated because the `que` became empty. `path` is a list containing the `end` node, its predecessor (`curr`), and the predecessor of the predecessor of `end`. `curr` is now equal to the predecessor of the predecessor of the `end` node as stored in the `prev` dictionary, and `end` must not be `-1`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
