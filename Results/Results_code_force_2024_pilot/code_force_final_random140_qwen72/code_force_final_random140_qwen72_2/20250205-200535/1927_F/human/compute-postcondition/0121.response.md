Postcondition: ***`graph[node]` must contain at least one neighbor, and `nei` will take on the value of the next neighbor in `graph[node]` during the next iteration. If `node` is equal to `start` and `nei` is equal to `end`, the current iteration is skipped. If `nei` is not in `prev`, `prev[nei]` is set to `node`, and `nei` is appended to `que`.***
