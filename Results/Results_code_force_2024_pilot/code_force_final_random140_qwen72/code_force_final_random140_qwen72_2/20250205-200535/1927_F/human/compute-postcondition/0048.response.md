Output State: **`parent_v` is now the parent of `v` as determined by the `find` method of `dsu`; `parent_u` is now the parent of `u` as determined by the `find` method of `dsu`; `n` and `m` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`; `edges` is a list containing at least one tuple of the form `(w, u, v)` sorted in descending order based on the first element `w`; `graph` is a defaultdict of type list where each key `u` has a list of all `v` values that were appended during the loop, and each key `v` has a list of all `u` values that were appended during the loop; `m` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations; `i` is `m-1`; `dsu` is a new instance of the `DSU` class with the size `n + 1`; `w`, `u`, and `v` are set to the values of the third tuple in `edges`. If `parent_u` was equal to `parent_v`, `_min_edge` is set to `w`, `start` is set to `u`, and `end` is set to `v`. Otherwise, `_min_edge` remains set to infinity (`float('inf')`), `start` remains set to -1, and `end` remains set to -1. In both cases, `u` and `v` are now in the same connected component according to the `dsu` structure.**

Explanation:
- The `dsu.union(u, v)` operation merges the sets containing `u` and `v` into a single set.
- This means that `u` and `v` are now in the same connected component according to the `dsu` structure.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
