The only object in the loop head is the variable `test_cases`. For the loop to execute one more time, `test_cases` must still be greater than 0. Since the loop does not explicitly modify `test_cases` in the loop head, the implicit assumption is that the loop counter (represented by `_`) is incremented, but this is not directly visible in the state. However, for the loop to continue, `test_cases` must remain greater than 0.

At the end of the last iteration, `test_cases` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `test_cases` must still be greater than 0.

State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0**
