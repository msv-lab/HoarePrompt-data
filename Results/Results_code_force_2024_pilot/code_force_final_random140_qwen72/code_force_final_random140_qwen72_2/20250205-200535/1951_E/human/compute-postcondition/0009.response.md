Output State: **`ch` is a string of lowercase Latin characters, its length is at least 1, and its length is odd. `b` is equal to the integer division of the length of `ch` by 2. The function `func_1` applied to the substring `ch[:b]` returns `True`. `a` is 1.** 

Explanation: The code snippet assigns the value 1 to the variable `a`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the initial conditions along with the new value of `a`.
