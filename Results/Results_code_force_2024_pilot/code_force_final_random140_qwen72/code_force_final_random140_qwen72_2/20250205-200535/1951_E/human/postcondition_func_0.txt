The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `ch`, which is a string of lowercase Latin characters. It checks whether the first half of the string (or the first half plus the middle character if the length is odd) is a mirror image of the second half of the string. If the string is a palindrome in this sense, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. After the function concludes, the original string `ch` remains unchanged, and the function has no side effects on other parts of the program.
