You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not fully address the problem description. Specifically:

1. **Palindrome Check (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` checks if a string is a palindrome by comparing the first half of the string with the reversed second half. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not handle the middle character correctly for odd-length strings. For example, for the string "abcba", `func_1` would incorrectly return `False`.

2. **Partitioning Logic (`func_2`)**:
   - The function `func_2` attempts to determine the number of parts needed to partition the string such that no part is a palindrome. However, it does not actually partition the string or provide the required output format (i.e., "YES" or "NO" followed by the partition details).
   - The logic in `func_2` is also flawed. It returns a fixed number based on the length and whether the first half of the string is a palindrome, which does not guarantee that the resulting parts will not be palindromes.

### Example Case:
- **Input**: "aba"
- **Expected Output**:
  ```
  NO
  ```
- **Actual Output**:
  - The program does not produce the correct output format and does not handle the palindrome check correctly.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, making it incorrect.
