You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `ch`, which is a string of lowercase Latin characters. It checks whether the first half of the string (or the first half plus the middle character if the length is odd) is a mirror image of the second half of the string. If the string is a palindrome in this sense, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. After the function concludes, the original string `ch` remains unchanged, and the function has no side effects on other parts of the program.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: ch is a string of lowercase Latin characters, and its length is at least 1.
def func_2(ch):
    b = len(ch) // 2

        else :
            a = 2
        #State: *`ch` is a string of lowercase Latin characters, and its length is at least 1 and odd. `b` is equal to the integer division of the length of `ch` by 2. If `func_1(ch[:b])` returns `True`, then `a` is 1. Otherwise, `a` is 2.
    #State: *`ch` is a string of lowercase Latin characters, and its length is at least 1. `b` is equal to the integer division of the length of `ch` by 2. If the length of `ch` is even and `func_1(ch[:b])` returns `True`, `a` is set to 3. If the length of `ch` is even and `func_1(ch[:b])` returns `False`, `a` is set to 4. If the length of `ch` is odd and `func_1(ch[:b])` returns `True`, `a` is set to 1. If the length of `ch` is odd and `func_1(ch[:b])` returns `False`, `a` is set to 2.
    return a
    #The program returns 1, 2, 3, or 4 depending on the conditions: if the length of `ch` is even and `func_1(ch[:b])` returns `True`, it returns 3; if the length of `ch` is even and `func_1(ch[:b])` returns `False`, it returns 4; if the length of `ch` is odd and `func_1(ch[:b])` returns `True`, it returns 1; if the length of `ch` is odd and `func_1(ch[:b])` returns `False`, it returns 2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` takes a string `ch` consisting of lowercase Latin characters and returns an integer (1, 2, 3, or 4) based on the length of `ch` and the result of `func_1(ch[:b])`, where `b` is half the length of `ch`. If the length of `ch` is even and `func_1(ch[:b])` returns `True`, it returns 3; if the length is even and `func_1(ch[:b])` returns `False`, it returns 4; if the length is odd and `func_1(ch[:b])` returns `True`, it returns 1; if the length is odd and `func_1(ch[:b])` returns `False`, it returns 2. The function does not modify the input string `ch`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to partition a string `s` into substrings such that none of the substrings are palindromes.
   - If such a partition exists, we should output "YES" followed by the number of parts and the parts themselves.
   - If no such partition exists, we should output "NO".

2. **Analyzing the Functions:**

   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - This function checks if a given string `ch` is a palindrome.
     - It splits the string into two halves and compares the first half with the reversed second half.
     - If they are equal, the string is a palindrome; otherwise, it is not.
     - This function is correct for checking palindromes.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - This function determines the minimum length of a substring that can be added to a given string `ch` to ensure that the resulting substring is not a palindrome.
     - It uses `func_1` to check if the first half of the string is a palindrome.
     - Depending on the length of the string and whether the first half is a palindrome, it returns a value indicating how many characters to add to make the substring non-palindromic.
     - However, this function is not directly used in the main logic for partitioning the string.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The main logic is missing from the provided code. We need to implement the main function that reads the input, processes each test case, and outputs the results.
   - The main logic should:
     - Read the number of test cases.
     - For each test case, read the string `s`.
     - Check if the string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.
     - If possible, output "YES" followed by the number of parts and the parts themselves.
     - If not possible, output "NO".

4. **Missing Main Logic:**
   - The provided functions (`func_1` and `func_2`) are not sufficient to solve the problem as they do not handle the partitioning logic.
   - The main logic should use these functions to determine the partitioning and output the results.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The provided functions are correct for their intended purposes (checking palindromes and determining the minimum length to make a substring non-palindromic).
   - However, the main logic for partitioning the string and handling the test cases is missing, making the overall program incomplete and incorrect.
