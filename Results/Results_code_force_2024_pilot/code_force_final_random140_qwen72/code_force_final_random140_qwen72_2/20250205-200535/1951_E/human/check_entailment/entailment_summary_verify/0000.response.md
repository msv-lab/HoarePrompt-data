### Reasoning:

1. **Palindrome Check (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` checks if a string is a palindrome by comparing the first half of the string with the reversed second half. This approach is indeed incorrect for odd-length strings. For example, for the string "abcba", `func_1` would incorrectly return `False` because it does not handle the middle character correctly.
   - A correct implementation should compare the first half of the string with the reversed second half, including the middle character if the length is odd. For example, for "abcba", the correct comparison would be "ab" == "ba" (ignoring the middle 'c').

2. **Partitioning Logic (`func_2`)**:
   - The function `func_2` attempts to determine the number of parts needed to partition the string such that no part is a palindrome. However, it does not actually partition the string or provide the required output format (i.e., "YES" or "NO" followed by the partition details).
   - The logic in `func_2` is flawed. It returns a fixed number based on the length and whether the first half of the string is a palindrome, which does not guarantee that the resulting parts will not be palindromes.
   - For example, if the input string is "aba", `func_2` might return 1 or 2, but it does not provide the actual partition. The correct output for "aba" should be "NO" because it is impossible to partition "aba" into non-palindromic substrings.

### Example Case:
- **Input**: "aba"
- **Expected Output**:
  ```
  NO
  ```
- **Actual Output**:
  - The program does not produce the correct output format and does not handle the palindrome check correctly.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem as described. The palindrome check in `func_1` is flawed, and `func_2` does not provide the required output format or ensure that the partitions are non-palindromic.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
