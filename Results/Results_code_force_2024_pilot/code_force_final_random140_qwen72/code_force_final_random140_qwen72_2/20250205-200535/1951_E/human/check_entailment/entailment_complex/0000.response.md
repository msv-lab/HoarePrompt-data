### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to partition a string into substrings such that none of the substrings are palindromes.
   - The program should handle multiple test cases and output "YES" with a valid partition if possible, or "NO" if no such partition exists.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1(ch)**: This function checks if the string `ch` is a palindrome. It returns `True` if the first half of the string is a mirror image of the second half, and `False` otherwise.
   - **func_2(ch)**: This function determines how to split the string `ch` based on whether the first half is a palindrome. It returns an integer (1, 2, 3, or 4) which guides the main logic on how to partition the string.

3. **Main Logic Analysis**:
   - The main loop iterates over each test case.
   - It first checks if the entire string is a repeated character (e.g., "aaaa"). If so, it sets `T1` to `False` because no valid partition can be made.
   - It then checks if the string is a repeated pattern of a two-character substring (e.g., "ababab"). If so, it sets `T1` to `False`.
   - If `T1` is still `True`, it calls `func_1` to check if the string itself is a palindrome. If it is, it further calls `func_2` to determine how to partition the string.
   - Based on the value returned by `func_2`, it attempts to partition the string into non-palindromic substrings.
   - If a valid partition is found, it prints "YES" followed by the number of parts and the parts themselves. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles strings of length 1 and 2, which cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.
   - It also handles strings that are entirely composed of the same character or a repeated two-character pattern, which cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.

5. **Overall Correctness**:
   - The program correctly identifies when a string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings and provides a valid partition when possible.
   - It handles edge cases and multiple test cases as required by the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
