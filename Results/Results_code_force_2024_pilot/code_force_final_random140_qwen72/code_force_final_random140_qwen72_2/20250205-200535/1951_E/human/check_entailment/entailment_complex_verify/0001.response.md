### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The task is to partition a string `s` into substrings such that none of the substrings are palindromes.
   - If such a partition exists, output "YES" followed by the number of parts and the parts themselves.
   - If no such partition exists, output "NO".

2. **Analyzing the Functions:**

   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - This function checks if a given string `ch` is a palindrome.
     - It correctly splits the string into two halves and compares the first half with the reversed second half.
     - If they are equal, the string is a palindrome; otherwise, it is not.
     - This function is correct for checking palindromes.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - This function determines a value `a` based on the length of the string `ch` and whether the first half of the string is a palindrome.
     - It returns different values (1, 2, 3, or 4) depending on the conditions.
     - The purpose of this function is not entirely clear from the problem description, but it seems to be used to guide the partitioning logic.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The main logic in the provided code attempts to partition the string `s` into non-palindromic substrings.
   - It uses several conditions to check if the string can be partitioned:
     - If the string consists of the same character repeated, it cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.
     - If the string is a palindrome and its length is greater than 3, it uses `func_2` to determine how to partition the string.
     - It then attempts to partition the string based on the value of `a` returned by `func_2`.

4. **Evaluating the Main Logic:**
   - The main logic correctly handles the case where the string consists of the same character repeated.
   - It also correctly handles the case where the string is a palindrome and its length is greater than 3.
   - However, the logic for partitioning the string when `a` is 1, 2, 3, or 4 is complex and may not always produce a valid partition.
   - Specifically, the logic for `a == 2` and `a == 3` may not always ensure that the resulting substrings are non-palindromic.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The provided functions (`func_1` and `func_2`) are correct for their intended purposes.
   - The main logic is mostly correct but has some edge cases where it may not produce a valid partition.
   - The overall program is mostly correct but may fail in some edge cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is mostly correct but may fail in some edge cases where the partitioning logic does not ensure that all substrings are non-palindromic. Therefore, the original assessment that the program is incorrect is maintained.
