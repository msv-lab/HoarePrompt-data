Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not fully address the problem description. Specifically:

1. **Palindrome Check (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` checks if a string is a palindrome by comparing the first half of the string with the reversed second half. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not handle the middle character correctly for odd-length strings. For example, for the string "abcba", `func_1` would incorrectly return `False`.

2. **Partitioning Logic (`func_2`)**:
   - The function `func_2` attempts to determine the number of parts needed to partition the string such that no part is a palindrome. However, it does not actually partition the string or provide the required output format (i.e., "YES" or "NO" followed by the partition details).
   - The logic in `func_2` is also flawed. It returns a fixed number based on the length and whether the first half of the string is a palindrome, which does not guarantee that the resulting parts will not be palindromes.

### Example Case:
- **Input**: "aba"
- **Expected Output**:
  ```
  NO
  ```
- **Actual Output**:
  - The program does not produce the correct output format and does not handle the palindrome check correctly.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, making it incorrect.
