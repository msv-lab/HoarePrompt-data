Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `current_index` is 3, `data` is a list of strings, `results` is an empty list, `hashing` is an empty dictionary, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]` and must be greater than 1, `a` is a list containing the integer value of `data[2]` and the integer value of `data[3]`, `i` is 1.**

Explanation: The code appends the integer value of `data[current_index]` (which is `data[3]`) to the list `a`. The value of `current_index` is 3, so the integer value of `data[3]` is added to `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
