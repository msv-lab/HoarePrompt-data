Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `a` contains `n` elements which are the integer values of `data[current_index - n]` to `data[current_index - 1]` and is sorted in ascending order, `current_index` is increased by `n`, `t`, `data`, `results`, and `hashing` remain unchanged, `hashing[a[0]]` is 0, `hashing[a[1]]` is 1, `hashing[a[2]]` is incremented by 2, and `ans` is 2 if `a[i]` (which is `a[2]`) is equal to `a[i + 1]` (which is `a[3]`). Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.***
