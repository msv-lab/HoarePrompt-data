The function `func_1` does not explicitly define its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the given parameter constraints and relationships, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts a parameter `t` (an integer representing the number of test cases) and for each test case, it accepts another parameter `n` (an integer representing the size of the list) and a list of integers `a` (where each element `a_i` is an integer).

Given the constraints and the expected output, the function processes each test case and returns some result based on the input list `a` for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`. It processes each test case and returns a result based on the list `a` for each test case.**
