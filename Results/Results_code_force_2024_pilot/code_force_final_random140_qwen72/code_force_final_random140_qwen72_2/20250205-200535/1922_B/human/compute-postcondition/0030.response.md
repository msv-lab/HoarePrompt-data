Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `current_index` is `2 + n`, `data` is a list of strings, `results` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer values of `data[2]` through `data[2 + n - 1]`, `i` is 0, `ans` is 0, `hashing` is a dictionary with the key `a[0]` and value `0`. If `a[i]` (which is `a[0]`) is equal to `a[i + 1]` (which is `a[1]`), then the current value of `a[i]` is equal to the current value of `a[i + 1]`.***
