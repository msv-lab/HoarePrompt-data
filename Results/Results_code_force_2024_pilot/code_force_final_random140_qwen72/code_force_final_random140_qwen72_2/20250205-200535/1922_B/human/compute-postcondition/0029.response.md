The code `ans += hashing[a[i]]` updates the value of `ans` by adding the value associated with the key `a[i]` in the dictionary `hashing`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `current_index` is `2 + n`
- `data` is a list of strings
- `results` is an empty list
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `a` is a sorted list containing the integer values of `data[2]` through `data[2 + n - 1]`
- `i` is 0
- `ans` is 0
- `hashing` is a dictionary with the key `a[0]` and value `0`
- The current value of `a[i]` is equal to the current value of `a[i + 1]`

Since `i` is 0, `a[i]` is `a[0]`. The dictionary `hashing` has the key `a[0]` with a value of 0. Therefore, `ans` is updated by adding 0 to its current value (which is 0).

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `current_index` is `2 + n`, `data` is a list of strings, `results` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer values of `data[2]` through `data[2 + n - 1]`, `i` is 0, `ans` is 0, `hashing` is a dictionary with the key `a[0]` and value `0`, and the current value of `a[i]` is equal to the current value of `a[i + 1]`.**
