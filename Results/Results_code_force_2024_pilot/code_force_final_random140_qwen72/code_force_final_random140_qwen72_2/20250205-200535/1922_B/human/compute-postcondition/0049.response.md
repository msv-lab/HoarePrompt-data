Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `current_index` is `2 + n`, `data` is a list of strings, `results` is a list containing one element which is `ans`, `n` is the integer value of `data[2 + n]`, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer values of `data[2]` through `data[2 + n - 1]`, `i` is `n - 1`, `ans` is the sum of `hashing[a[i]]` for all `i` where `a[i] == a[i + 1]` within the range of the loop, `hashing` is an empty dictionary.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` is updated to the integer value of `data[current_index]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
