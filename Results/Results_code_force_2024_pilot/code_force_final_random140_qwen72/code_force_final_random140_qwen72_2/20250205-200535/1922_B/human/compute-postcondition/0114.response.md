The code `hashing[a[i]] += i` updates the value of `hashing[a[i]]` by adding `i` to its current value. Given the initial state:

- `i` is 1
- `n` is greater than 2
- `hashing[a[0]]` is 0
- If `a[1]` is not in `hashing`, then `hashing[a[1]]` is 0 and `ans` remains unchanged.
- If `a[1]` is in `hashing`, `ans` remains unchanged.

Since `i` is 1, the code will update `hashing[a[1]]` by adding 1 to its current value. 

If `a[1]` is not in `hashing`, `hashing[a[1]]` starts at 0 and becomes 1 after the update. If `a[1]` is already in `hashing`, its value is incremented by 1. In both cases, `ans` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `hashing[a[0]]` is 0, `hashing[a[1]]` is 1 (if `a[1]` was not in `hashing`) or `hashing[a[1]]` is incremented by 1 (if `a[1]` was in `hashing`), `ans` remains unchanged.**
