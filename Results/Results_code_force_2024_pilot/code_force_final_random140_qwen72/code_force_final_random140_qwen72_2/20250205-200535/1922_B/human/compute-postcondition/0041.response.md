Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `current_index` is `2 + n`, `data` is a list of strings, `results` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer values of `data[2]` through `data[2 + n - 1]`, `i` is 2, `ans` is the value of `hashing[a[1]]` if `a[1]` equals `a[2]`, otherwise `ans` remains 0, `hashing` is a dictionary with keys `a[0]`, `a[1]`, and possibly `a[2]`. If `a[2]` is not in `hashing`, `hashing[a[2]]` is set to 0, `hashing[a[2]]` is now `hashing[a[2]] + 2`.** 

Explanation: The code `hashing[a[i]] += i` updates the value of `hashing[a[2]]` (since `i` is 2) by adding 2 to its current value. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
