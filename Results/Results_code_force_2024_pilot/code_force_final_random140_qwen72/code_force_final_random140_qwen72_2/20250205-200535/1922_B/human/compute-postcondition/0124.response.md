Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is greater than 0, `hashing` contains the cumulative indices for each unique element in `a` up to `a[n-2]`, `ans` is the sum of the values in `hashing` for elements that are equal to their next element in `a`. The variables `data`, `results`, and `hashing` remain unchanged outside the loop, `results` now includes the value of `ans` appended to it, `hashing` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is 0.**

In natural language, this means:
- The loop has completed all its iterations, with `i` reaching the value `n - 2`.
- The variable `n` remains greater than 0.
- The dictionary `hashing` contains the cumulative indices for each unique element in the list `a` up to the second-to-last element (`a[n-2]`).
- The variable `ans` is the sum of the values in `hashing` for elements that are equal to their next element in `a`.
- The variables `data`, `results`, and `hashing` remain unchanged outside the loop.
- The list `results` now includes the final value of `ans` appended to it.
- The dictionary `hashing` is reset to an empty dictionary.
- The variable `ans` is reset to 0.
