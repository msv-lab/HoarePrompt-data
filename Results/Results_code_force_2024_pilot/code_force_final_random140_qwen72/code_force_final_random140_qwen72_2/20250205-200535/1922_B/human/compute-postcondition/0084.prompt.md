Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After all iterations of the loop, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` remains the same as its initial value, `a` contains `n` elements which are the integer values of `data[current_index - n]` to `data[current_index - 1]`, and `a` is now sorted in ascending order, `current_index` is increased by `n`. The values of `t`, `data`, `results`, and `hashing` remain unchanged. `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if a[i] not in hashing:
        hashing[a[i]] = 0
    hashing[a[i]] += i
    if a[i] == a[i + 1]:
        ans += hashing[a[i]]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` contains `n` elements which are the integer values of `data[current_index - n]` to `data[current_index - 1]` and is sorted in ascending order, `current_index` is increased by `n`, `t`, `data`, `results`, and `hashing` remain unchanged, `ans` is 0, `hashing[a[0]]` is 0. If the first two elements of `a` are equal (`a[0] == a[1]`), then this condition holds true.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `a` contains `n` elements which are the integer values of `data[current_index - n]` to `data[current_index - 1]` and is sorted in ascending order, `current_index` is increased by `n`, `t`, `data`, `results`, and `hashing` remain unchanged, `hashing[a[0]]` is 0, `hashing[a[1]]` is 1. If `a[i]` (which is `a[1]`) is equal to `a[i + 1]` (which is `a[2]`), then `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `a` contains `n` elements which are the integer values of `data[current_index - n]` to `data[current_index - 1]` and is sorted in ascending order, `current_index` is increased by `n`, `t`, `data`, `results`, and `hashing` remain unchanged, `hashing[a[0]]` is 0, `hashing[a[1]]` is 1, `hashing[a[2]]` is incremented by 2, and `ans` is 2 if `a[i]` (which is `a[2]`) is equal to `a[i + 1]` (which is `a[3]`). Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
