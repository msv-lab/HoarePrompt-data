The code snippet `hashing[a[i]] += i` updates the value of `hashing[a[i]]` by adding the current value of `i` to it. Given the initial state:

- `i` is 1
- `n` is greater than 1
- `a` contains `n` elements which are the integer values of `data[current_index - n]` to `data[current_index - 1]` and is sorted in ascending order
- `current_index` is increased by `n`
- `t`, `data`, `results`, and `hashing` remain unchanged
- `ans` is 0
- `hashing[a[0]]` is 0
- If `a[i]` (which is `a[1]`) is not in `hashing`, then `hashing[a[1]]` is 0

Step-by-step analysis:
1. `i` is 1.
2. `a[i]` is `a[1]`.
3. `hashing[a[1]]` is initially 0 (since `a[1]` is not in `hashing`).
4. The code `hashing[a[i]] += i` adds the value of `i` (which is 1) to `hashing[a[1]]`.

Therefore, `hashing[a[1]]` becomes 1.

The output state includes all the information from the initial state that remains valid, with the updated value of `hashing[a[1]]`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `a` contains `n` elements which are the integer values of `data[current_index - n]` to `data[current_index - 1]` and is sorted in ascending order, `current_index` is increased by `n`, `t`, `data`, `results`, and `hashing` remain unchanged, `ans` is 0, `hashing[a[0]]` is 0, `hashing[a[1]]` is 1.**
