The code snippet `hashing[a[i]] = 0` adds the element at index 0 of the list `a` to the dictionary `hashing` with the value 0. Since `i` is 0, `a[0]` is the element being added to the dictionary. The initial state specifies that the element at index 0 of the list `a` is not in the `hashing` set, so this operation does not overwrite an existing key.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, the element at index 0 of the list `a` is now in the `hashing` dictionary with the value 0.**
