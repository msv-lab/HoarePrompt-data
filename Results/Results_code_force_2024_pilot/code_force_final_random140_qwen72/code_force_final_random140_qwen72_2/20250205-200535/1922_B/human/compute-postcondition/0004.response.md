Output State: **`t` is the integer value of the first element in `data`, `current_index` is 1, `data` is a list of strings, each element being one of the inputs split by spaces, and the remaining preconditions (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n) are still valid.** 

The value of `current_index` has been incremented by 1, changing from 0 to 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
