Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `i` is `n - 2`, `n` remains the same as its initial value, `a` contains `n` elements which are the integer values of `data[current_index - n]` to `data[current_index - 1]` and is sorted in ascending order, `current_index` is increased by `n`, `t`, `data`, `results`, and `hashing` remain unchanged. `results` now includes the value of `ans` appended to it.**

Explanation:
- The code `results.append(ans)` appends the current value of `ans` to the list `results`.
- All other variables (`i`, `n`, `a`, `current_index`, `t`, `data`, and `hashing`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The value of `ans` is appended to `results`, so `results` now includes this new value.
