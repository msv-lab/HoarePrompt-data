Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` remains the same as its initial value, `a` contains `n` elements which are the integer values of `data[current_index - n]` to `data[current_index - 1]`, and `a` is now sorted in ascending order, `current_index` is increased by `n`. The values of `t`, `data`, `results`, and `hashing` remain unchanged.**
