The code snippet `ans += hashing[a[i]]` updates the value of `ans` by adding the value associated with the key `a[i]` in the dictionary `hashing`. Given the initial state:

- `t` is greater than 0
- `current_index` is `2 + n`
- `data` is a list of strings
- `results` is an empty list
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `a` is a sorted list containing the integer values of `data[2]` through `data[2 + n - 1]`
- `i` is 1
- `ans` is 0
- `hashing` is a dictionary. If `a[1]` is not in `hashing`, then `hashing` now contains keys `a[0]` and `a[1]`, with `hashing[a[0]]` being 0 and `hashing[a[1]]` being 1. If `a[1]` is already in `hashing`, then `hashing` remains unchanged with the key `a[0]` having the value 0 and `hashing[a[1]]` being incremented by 1.

Given that `i` is 1, the code `ans += hashing[a[i]]` will add the value of `hashing[a[1]]` to `ans`.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Check the value of `a[1]` in `hashing`:**
   - If `a[1]` is not in `hashing`, then `hashing[a[1]]` is 1.
   - If `a[1]` is already in `hashing`, then `hashing[a[1]]` is incremented by 1, and its value is used.

2. **Update `ans`:**
   - Since `ans` is initially 0, after the addition, `ans` will be equal to the value of `hashing[a[1]]`.

### Output State:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `current_index` is `2 + n`
- `data` is a list of strings
- `results` is an empty list
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `a` is a sorted list containing the integer values of `data[2]` through `data[2 + n - 1]`
- `i` is 1
- `ans` is the value of `hashing[a[1]]`
- `hashing` is a dictionary with keys `a[0]` and `a[1]`, where `hashing[a[0]]` is 0 and `hashing[a[1]]` is either 1 (if `a[1]` was not in `hashing` initially) or incremented by 1 (if `a[1]` was already in `hashing`).

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `current_index` is `2 + n`, `data` is a list of strings, `results` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer values of `data[2]` through `data[2 + n - 1]`, `i` is 1, `ans` is the value of `hashing[a[1]]`, `hashing` is a dictionary with keys `a[0]` and `a[1]`, where `hashing[a[0]]` is 0 and `hashing[a[1]]` is either 1 or incremented by 1.**
