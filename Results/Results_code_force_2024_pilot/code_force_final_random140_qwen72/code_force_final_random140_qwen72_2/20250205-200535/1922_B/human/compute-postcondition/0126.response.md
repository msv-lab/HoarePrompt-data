Output State: **After the loop has executed all `t` iterations, `current_index` is `1 + t * (1 + n)`, `results` is a list containing `t` elements, each of which is the `ans` calculated for each iteration, `t` is 0 (as the loop has completed all iterations), `n` is the last value of `n` processed, `a` is the last sorted list of integers processed, `i` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0 (reset after each iteration), and `hashing` is an empty dictionary (reset after each iteration). The `data` list remains unchanged.**

This means that after the loop completes, the `current_index` will point to the position right after the last element processed in the `data` list. The `results` list will contain the results of the computations for each of the `t` test cases. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `ans`, and `hashing` will be in their final states as described, with `t` being 0 since the loop has finished executing. The `data` list remains the same as it was initially.
