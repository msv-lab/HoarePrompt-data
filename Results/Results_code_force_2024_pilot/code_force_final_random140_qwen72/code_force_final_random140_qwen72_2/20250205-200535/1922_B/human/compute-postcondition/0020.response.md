Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `current_index` is `2 + n`, `data` is a list of strings, `results` is an empty list, `hashing` is an empty dictionary, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `a` is a list containing the integer values of `data[2]` through `data[2 + n - 1]`, `i` is `n - 1`.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains greater than 0 as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`current_index`**: After `n` iterations, `current_index` will be incremented by `n`, starting from its initial value of 2. Therefore, `current_index` will be `2 + n`.
- **`data`**: The list of strings remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`results`**: Remains an empty list as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`hashing`**: Remains an empty dictionary as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`n`**: The integer value of `data[1]` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`a`**: After `n` iterations, `a` will contain the integer values of `data[2]` through `data[2 + n - 1]`.
- **`i`**: The loop variable `i` will be `n - 1` after the last iteration, as the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`.
