Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list containing the integer values of `data[current_index]` and `data[current_index + n + 2]`, `current_index` is increased by `n + 3`, `t` is decreased by 1, `data`, `results`, and `hashing` remain unchanged, `results` now includes the value of `ans` appended to it, `hashing` is an empty dictionary.**

Explanation:
- The initial value of `current_index` was increased by `n + 2`.
- The code `current_index += 1` further increments `current_index` by 1.
- Therefore, `current_index` is now increased by `n + 3` in total.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
