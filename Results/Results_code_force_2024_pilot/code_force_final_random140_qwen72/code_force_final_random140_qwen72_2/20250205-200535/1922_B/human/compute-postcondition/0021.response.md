The code snippet `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. This operation modifies the list `a` but does not affect the other variables.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `current_index` is `2 + n`, `data` is a list of strings, `results` is an empty list, `hashing` is an empty dictionary, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer values of `data[2]` through `data[2 + n - 1]`, `i` is `n - 1`.**
