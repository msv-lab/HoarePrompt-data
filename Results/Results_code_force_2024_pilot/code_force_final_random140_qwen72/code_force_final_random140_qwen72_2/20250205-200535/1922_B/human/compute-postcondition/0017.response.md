The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still be greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `current_index` is 4, `data` is a list of strings, `results` is an empty list, `hashing` is an empty dictionary, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]` and must be greater than 2, `a` is a list containing the integer value of `data[2]` and the integer value of `data[3]`, `i` is 2**
