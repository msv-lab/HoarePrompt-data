Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `i` is `n - 2`, `n` remains the same as its initial value, `a` contains `n` elements which are the integer values of `data[current_index - n]` to `data[current_index - 1]` and is sorted in ascending order, `current_index` is increased by `n`, `t`, `data`, `results`, and `hashing` remain unchanged. For each element `a[j]` in `a` where `0 <= j < n - 1`, `hashing[a[j]]` is incremented by `j`. If any consecutive elements `a[j]` and `a[j + 1]` are equal, `ans` is incremented by `hashing[a[j]]`.**

Explanation:
- `i` ends up being `n - 2` because the loop runs from `0` to `n - 2` (inclusive).
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `a` is still a sorted list of `n` elements.
- `current_index` is increased by `n`.
- `t`, `data`, `results`, and `hashing` remain unchanged outside the loop.
- For each element `a[j]` in `a` where `0 <= j < n - 1`, `hashing[a[j]]` is incremented by `j`.
- `ans` is incremented by `hashing[a[j]]` whenever `a[j]` is equal to `a[j + 1]`.
