The code snippet `ans += hashing[a[i]]` updates the value of `ans` by adding the value of `hashing[a[i]]` to it. Given the initial state:

- `i` is 0
- `n` is greater than 1
- `a` contains `n` elements which are the integer values of `data[current_index - n]` to `data[current_index - 1]` and is sorted in ascending order
- `current_index` is increased by `n`
- `t`, `data`, `results`, and `hashing` remain unchanged
- `ans` is 0
- `hashing[a[0]]` is 0
- The first two elements of `a` are equal (`a[0] == a[1]`)

Since `i` is 0, `a[i]` is `a[0]`. According to the initial state, `hashing[a[0]]` is 0. Therefore, `ans` is updated to `ans + 0`, which means `ans` remains 0.

The output state is:
Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` contains `n` elements which are the integer values of `data[current_index - n]` to `data[current_index - 1]` and is sorted in ascending order, `current_index` is increased by `n`, `t`, `data`, `results`, and `hashing` remain unchanged, `ans` is 0, `hashing[a[0]]` is 0, and the first two elements of `a` are equal (`a[0] == a[1]`).**
