Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `current_index` is 2, `data` is a list of strings, `results` is an empty list, `hashing` is an empty dictionary, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]` and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list containing the integer value of `data[2]`, `i` is 0.**

Explanation: The code appends the integer value of `data[current_index]` (which is `data[2]`) to the list `a`. Since `a` was initially an empty list, it now contains one element, which is the integer value of `data[2]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
