Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` has three new elements which are the integer values of `data[current_index - 2]`, `data[current_index - 1]`, and `data[current_index]`, `current_index` is now `current_index + 2`.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `a` has two new elements: `int(data[current_index - 2])` and `int(data[current_index - 1])`.
- The code `a.append(int(data[current_index]))` adds a third element to `a`, which is `int(data[current_index])`.
- The value of `current_index` is incremented by 2, as specified in the initial state.
- The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
