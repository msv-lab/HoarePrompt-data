Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `a` contains `n` elements which are the integer values of `data[current_index - n]` to `data[current_index - 1]` and is sorted in ascending order, `current_index` is increased by `n`, `t`, `data`, `results`, and `hashing` remain unchanged, `ans` is 0, `hashing[a[0]]` is 0. If `a[i]` (which is `a[1]`) is not in `hashing`, then `hashing[a[1]]` is 0.***
