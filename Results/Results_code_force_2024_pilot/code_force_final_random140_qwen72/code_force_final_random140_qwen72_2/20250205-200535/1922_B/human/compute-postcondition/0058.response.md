The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. At the start of the next iteration, `i` is increased by 1, so `i` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` has a new element which is the integer value of `data[current_index - 2]` and another new element which is the integer value of `data[current_index - 1]`, `current_index` is now `current_index + 2`**
