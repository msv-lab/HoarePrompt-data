Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` remains greater than 0, `a` is a list containing the integer values of `data[current_index]` through `data[current_index + n - 1]`, `current_index` is increased by `n`, `t` is decreased by 1, `data`, `results`, and `hashing` remain unchanged, `results` now includes the value of `ans` appended to it, `hashing` is an empty dictionary.**

### Explanation:
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be `n - 1` because the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`.
- **`n`**: The value of `n` remains unchanged and must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
- **`a`**: The list `a` will contain the integer values from `data[current_index]` to `data[current_index + n - 1]`. This means `a` will have `n` elements.
- **`current_index`**: The `current_index` is incremented by `n` after the loop completes, as each iteration increments `current_index` by 1.
- **`t`**: The variable `t` is decreased by 1, as specified in the initial state.
- **`data`, `results`, and `hashing`**: These variables remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- **`results`**: The value of `ans` is appended to `results` as specified in the initial state.
- **`hashing`**: Remains an empty dictionary as specified in the initial state.
