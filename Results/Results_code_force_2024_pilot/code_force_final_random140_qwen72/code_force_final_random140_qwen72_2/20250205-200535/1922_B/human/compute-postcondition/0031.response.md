The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1, and `n` must still be greater than 1 to ensure that `i < n - 1`.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `current_index` is `2 + n`, `data` is a list of strings, `results` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer values of `data[2]` through `data[2 + n - 1]`, `i` is 1, `ans` is 0, `hashing` is a dictionary with the key `a[0]` and value `0`. If `a[i]` (which is `a[1]`) is equal to `a[i + 1]` (which is `a[2]`), then the current value of `a[i]` is equal to the current value of `a[i + 1]`.**
