Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is greater than 0, `hashing` contains the cumulative indices for each unique element in `a` up to `a[n-2]`, `ans` is the sum of the values in `hashing` for elements that are equal to their next element in `a`. `data` remains unchanged, `results` now includes the value of `ans` appended to it, `hashing` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `results.append(ans)` appends the current value of `ans` to the list `results`.
- The value of `ans` is the sum of the values in `hashing` for elements that are equal to their next element in `a`.
- The variables `i`, `n`, `data`, and the contents of `hashing` up to `a[n-2]` remain unchanged.
- After appending `ans` to `results`, the value of `ans` is reset to 0, and `hashing` is cleared to an empty dictionary.
