Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is updated to `int(data[current_index - 1])`, `a` is an empty list, `current_index` is increased by `n + 1`, `t` is decreased by 1, `data`, `results`, and `hashing` remain unchanged, `results` now includes the value of `ans` appended to it, `hashing` is an empty dictionary.** 

Explanation:
- The list `a` is reinitialized to an empty list.
- All other variables (`i`, `n`, `current_index`, `t`, `data`, `results`, `hashing`) retain their previously described states or updates.
- The value of `ans` is appended to `results`.
- The dictionary `hashing` remains empty.
