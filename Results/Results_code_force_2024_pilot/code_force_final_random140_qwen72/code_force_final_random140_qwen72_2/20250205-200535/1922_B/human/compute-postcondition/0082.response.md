Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `a` contains `n` elements which are the integer values of `data[current_index - n]` to `data[current_index - 1]` and is sorted in ascending order, `current_index` is increased by `n`, `t`, `data`, `results`, and `hashing` remain unchanged, `hashing[a[0]]` is 0, `hashing[a[1]]` is 1, `hashing[a[2]]` is incremented by 2, `ans` is 2.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans += hashing[a[i]]` increments the value of `ans` by the value of `hashing[a[i]]`.
- Given `i` is 2, `a[i]` refers to `a[2]`.
- From the initial state, `hashing[a[2]]` is incremented by 2, so `hashing[a[2]]` is 2.
- Therefore, `ans` is incremented by 2, making `ans` equal to 2.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
