Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `current_index` is `2 + n`, `data` is a list of strings, `results` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer values of `data[2]` through `data[2 + n - 1]`, `i` is 2, `hashing` is a dictionary with keys `a[0]`, `a[1]`, and `a[2]`. If `a[2]` is not initially in `hashing`, `hashing[a[2]]` is set to 0 and then incremented by 2. If `a[i]` (which is `a[2]`) equals `a[i + 1]` (which is `a[3]`), `ans` is 4 if `a[1]` equals `a[2]`, otherwise `ans` is 2. If `a[i]` does not equal `a[i + 1]`, `ans` remains 0.***
