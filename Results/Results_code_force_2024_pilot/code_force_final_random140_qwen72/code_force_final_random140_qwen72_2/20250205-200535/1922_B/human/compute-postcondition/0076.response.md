The code snippet `ans += hashing[a[i]]` updates the value of `ans` by adding the value of `hashing[a[i]]` to it. Given the initial state:

- `i` is 1
- `n` is greater than 1
- `a` contains `n` elements which are the integer values of `data[current_index - n]` to `data[current_index - 1]` and is sorted in ascending order
- `current_index` is increased by `n`
- `t`, `data`, `results`, and `hashing` remain unchanged
- `ans` is 0
- `hashing[a[0]]` is 0
- `hashing[a[1]]` is 1

Let's evaluate the impact of the code:

1. `i` is 1, so `a[i]` is `a[1]`.
2. According to the initial state, `hashing[a[1]]` is 1.
3. `ans` is initially 0, and it is updated by adding `hashing[a[1]]` to it, which is 1.
4. Therefore, `ans` becomes 1.

The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `a` contains `n` elements which are the integer values of `data[current_index - n]` to `data[current_index - 1]` and is sorted in ascending order, `current_index` is increased by `n`, `t`, `data`, `results`, and `hashing` remain unchanged, `ans` is 1, `hashing[a[0]]` is 0, `hashing[a[1]]` is 1.**
