Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is updated to `int(data[current_index - 1])`, `a` contains `n` elements which are the integer values of `data[current_index - n - 1]` to `data[current_index - 2]` and is sorted in ascending order, `current_index` is increased by `n + 1`, `t` is decreased by 1, `data`, `results`, and `hashing` remain unchanged, `results` now includes the value of `ans` appended to it, `hashing` is an empty dictionary.**

Explanation:
- `current_index` was initially increased by `n` and then further increased by 1, making the total increase `n + 1`.
- `n` was previously updated to `int(data[current_index])`, and since `current_index` has been incremented by 1, `n` is now `int(data[current_index - 1])`.
- The array `a` contains the integer values from `data[current_index - n - 1]` to `data[current_index - 2]` because `current_index` has been incremented by 1.
- All other conditions and variables remain unchanged as specified in the initial state.
