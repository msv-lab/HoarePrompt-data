The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `n - 1`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` is 1
- `n` is greater than 1
- The loop condition is `i < n - 1`

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2
- `n` must still be greater than 1, but since `i` is now 2, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to continue executing.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` contains `n` elements which are the integer values of `data[current_index - n]` to `data[current_index - 1]` and is sorted in ascending order, `current_index` is increased by `n`, `t`, `data`, `results`, and `hashing` remain unchanged, `hashing[a[0]]` is 0, `hashing[a[1]]` is 1. If `a[i]` (which is `a[2]`) is equal to `a[i + 1]` (which is `a[3]`), then `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.**
