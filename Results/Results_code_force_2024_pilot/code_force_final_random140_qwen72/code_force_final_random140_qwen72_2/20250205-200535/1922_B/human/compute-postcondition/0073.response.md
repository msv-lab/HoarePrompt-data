Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `a` contains `n` elements which are the integer values of `data[current_index - n]` to `data[current_index - 1]` and is sorted in ascending order, `current_index` is increased by `n`, `t`, `data`, `results`, and `hashing` remain unchanged, `ans` is 0, `hashing[a[0]]` is 0, `hashing[a[1]]` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `hashing[a[i]] = 0` sets the value of `hashing[a[1]]` to 0 because `i` is 1.
- All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged from the initial state.
