Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `current_index` is `3 + n`, `data` is a list of strings, `results` is a list containing one element which is `ans`, `n` is the integer value of `data[2 + n]`, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer values of `data[2]` through `data[2 + n - 1]`, `i` is `n - 1`, `ans` is the sum of `hashing[a[i]]` for all `i` where `a[i] == a[i + 1]` within the range of the loop, `hashing` is an empty dictionary.**

Explanation:
- The value of `current_index` is incremented by 1, changing from `2 + n` to `3 + n`.
- All other variables (`t`, `data`, `results`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `ans`, `hashing`) remain unchanged.
