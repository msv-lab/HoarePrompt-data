You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have n sticks, numbered from 1 to n . The length of the i -th stick is
2^{a_i} .

You want to choose exactly 3 sticks out of the given n sticks, and form a non-
degenerate triangle out of them, using the sticks as the sides of the
triangle. A triangle is called non-degenerate if its area is strictly greater
than 0 .

You have to calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a
triangle can be formed out of them. Note that the order of choosing sticks
does not matter (for example, choosing the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4 -th stick is the
same as choosing the 2 -nd, 4 -th and 1 -st stick).

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le n ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the number of ways to choose exactly 3
sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    7
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    4
    
    3 2 1 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3
    
    1
    
    1

Output

    35
    2
    0
    0
    
Note

In the first test case of the example, any three sticks out of the given 7 can
be chosen.

In the second test case of the example, you can choose the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4
-th stick, or the 1 -st, 3 -rd and 4 -th stick.

In the third test case of the example, you cannot form a triangle out of the
given sticks with lengths 2 , 4 and 8 .

    #State: After the loop has executed all `t` iterations, `current_index` is `1 + t * (1 + n)`, `results` is a list containing `t` elements, each of which is the `ans` calculated for each iteration, `t` is 0 (as the loop has completed all iterations), `n` is the last value of `n` processed, `a` is the last sorted list of integers processed, `i` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0 (reset after each iteration), and `hashing` is an empty dictionary (reset after each iteration). The `data` list remains unchanged.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: `results` is a list containing `t` elements, where `t` is the total number of iterations the loop has executed. Each element in the `results` list is the `ans` value calculated during each iteration of the loop. The `data` list remains unchanged, and the other variables (`current_index`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `ans`, and `hashing`) are in their final states as described in the initial state.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and prints the results. Each test case involves reading an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. The function calculates a specific value for each test case based on the sorted list of integers and prints these values. The function does not return any value; instead, it directly prints the results to the standard output. After processing all test cases, the function leaves the input data unchanged and resets all internal variables used for processing each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem of counting the number of ways to choose 3 sticks to form a non-degenerate triangle. The issue lies in the logic used to count the valid combinations of sticks. Specifically, the program uses a dictionary `hashing` to keep track of the cumulative index of occurrences of each stick length, and it increments the answer `ans` whenever it finds consecutive equal elements. This approach is flawed because it does not correctly account for the triangle inequality theorem, which states that for three lengths to form a triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the remaining side.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the input:
```
1
4
1 2 2 3
```
The expected output should be `1`, because the only valid combination of sticks that can form a triangle is (2, 2, 3). However, the program will output `0` because it only increments the answer when it finds consecutive equal elements, which is not the correct logic for this problem.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, you would need to:
1. Sort the array of stick lengths.
2. Use a nested loop to iterate through all possible combinations of three sticks.
3. Check if the three sticks satisfy the triangle inequality theorem.
4. Count the number of valid combinations.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def count_triangles(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for n, a in test_cases:
        a.sort()
        count = 0
        for i in range(n):
            k = i + 2
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                while k < n and a[i] + a[j] > a[k]:
                    k += 1
                count += k - j - 1
        results.append(count)
    return results

t = int(input())
test_cases = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    test_cases.append((n, a))

results = count_triangles(t, test_cases)
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This corrected version correctly counts the number of valid triangles by checking the triangle inequality theorem for each combination of three sticks.
