Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem as stated. The core issue is in how it attempts to count the number of valid triangles. The logic used in the loop:

```python
for i in range(n - 1):
    if a[i] not in hashing:
        hashing[a[i]] = 0
    hashing[a[i]] += i
    if a[i] == a[i + 1]:
        ans += hashing[a[i]]
```

This logic is flawed because it does not correctly account for the conditions required to form a non-degenerate triangle with the given stick lengths. Specifically, for three sticks with lengths \(2^{a_i}\), \(2^{a_j}\), and \(2^{a_k}\) (where \(i < j < k\)), they can form a triangle only if the sum of the lengths of any two sticks is greater than the length of the third stick. Given the exponential nature of the stick lengths, this condition simplifies to checking if the smallest two sticks' lengths are greater than the largest stick's length.

A correct approach would involve counting the occurrences of each stick length and then using combinatorial methods to count the valid combinations of three sticks that can form a triangle. The current implementation does not do this and instead uses an incorrect hashing mechanism that does not reflect the triangle inequality conditions.

Therefore, the provided program is incorrect for the given problem.
