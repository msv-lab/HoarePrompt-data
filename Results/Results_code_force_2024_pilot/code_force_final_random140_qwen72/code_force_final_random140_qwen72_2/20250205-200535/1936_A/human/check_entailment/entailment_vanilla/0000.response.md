### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized.
   - We can make at most \(3n\) queries to compare bitwise OR results of pairs of elements.
   - The goal is to use these queries efficiently to identify the desired indices.

2. **Initial Setup**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of \(n\).

3. **Finding the First Maximum**:
   - The program initializes `ans1` to 0 and iterates through the indices from 1 to \(n-1\).
   - For each index \(i\), it compares \(p_{ans1} \mid p_{ans1}\) with \(p_i \mid p_i\).
   - If \(p_i \mid p_i\) is greater, it updates `ans1` to \(i\).
   - This step ensures that `ans1` points to an index where \(p_{ans1}\) is one of the largest values in the permutation.

4. **Finding the Second Maximum**:
   - The program initializes `mx` to 0 and creates a list `v` containing the initial index 0.
   - It iterates through the indices from 1 to \(n-1\) again, comparing \(p_{mx} \mid p_{ans1}\) with \(p_i \mid p_{ans1}\).
   - If \(p_i \mid p_{ans1}\) is greater, it updates `mx` to \(i\) and resets `v` to contain only \(i\).
   - If \(p_i \mid p_{ans1}\) is equal, it appends \(i\) to `v`.
   - This step ensures that `v` contains indices where \(p_i \mid p_{ans1}\) is maximized.

5. **Final Comparison**:
   - The program initializes `ans` to the first element in `v`.
   - It iterates through the elements in `v`, comparing \(p_{ans} \mid p_{ans}\) with \(p_{v[i]} \mid p_{v[i]}\).
   - If \(p_{v[i]} \mid p_{v[i]}\) is greater, it updates `ans` to \(v[i]\).
   - This step ensures that `ans` points to an index where \(p_{ans} \oplus p_{ans1}\) is maximized.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the final indices `ans` and `ans1`.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly identifies the indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized.
- It uses the allowed number of queries efficiently.
- The logic and steps are sound and align with the problem requirements.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: True**
