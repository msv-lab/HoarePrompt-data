### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and First Loop:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n`.
   - It initializes `ans1` to 0, which will store the index of the element with the highest value after the first loop.
   - The first loop iterates through all indices from 1 to `n-1`. For each index `i`, it compares the bitwise OR of `(p_ans1 | p_ans1)` with `(p_i | p_i)` using the function `func_1`.
   - If the result is `<`, it updates `ans1` to `i`. This ensures that `ans1` holds the index of the element with the highest value in the permutation.

2. **Second Loop:**
   - After finding `ans1`, the program initializes `mx` to 0 and creates a list `v` containing the initial index 0.
   - The second loop iterates through all indices from 1 to `n-1`. For each index `i`, it compares the bitwise OR of `(p_mx | p_ans1)` with `(p_i | p_ans1)` using the function `func_1`.
   - If the result is `<`, it updates `mx` to `i` and resets the list `v` to contain only `i`.
   - If the result is `=`, it appends `i` to the list `v`. This ensures that `v` contains all indices `i` such that `(p_i | p_ans1)` is equal to the maximum value found so far.

3. **Finding the Maximum XOR:**
   - The program then initializes `mx` to the first element in `v` and sets `ans` to the same value.
   - It iterates through the list `v` and compares the bitwise OR of `(p_ans | p_ans)` with `(p_v[i] | p_v[i])` using the function `func_1`.
   - If the result is `>`, it updates `ans` to `v[i]`. This ensures that `ans` holds the index of the element that, when XORed with `ans1`, gives the maximum value.

4. **Output:**
   - Finally, the program prints the indices `ans` and `ans1` as the answer.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly identifies the indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i âŠ• p_j` is maximized.
- The logic used to find the maximum XOR value is sound and follows the problem's constraints.
- The number of queries made is within the limit of 3n, as required by the problem.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
