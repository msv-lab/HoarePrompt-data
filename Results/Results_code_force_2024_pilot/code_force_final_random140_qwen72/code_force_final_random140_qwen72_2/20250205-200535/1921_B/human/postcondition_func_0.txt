The function reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it takes the number of boxes `n`, and two strings `s` and `t` of length `n` representing the initial and final positions of cats in the boxes. It calculates the maximum number of positions where the characters in `s` are greater than those in `t` or vice versa, and prints this value for each test case. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results. After processing all test cases, the function terminates.
