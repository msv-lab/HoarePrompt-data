You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In order to test the hypothesis about the cats, the scientists must arrange
the cats in the boxes in a specific way. Of course, they would like to test
the hypothesis and publish a sensational article as quickly as possible,
because they are too engrossed in the next hypothesis about the phone's
battery charge.

Scientists have n boxes in which cats may or may not sit. Let the current
state of the boxes be denoted by the sequence b_1, \dots, b_n : b_i = 1 if
there is a cat in box number i , and b_i = 0 otherwise.

Fortunately, the unlimited production of cats has already been established, so
in one day, the scientists can perform one of the following operations:

  * Take a new cat and place it in a box (for some i such that b_i = 0 , assign b_i = 1 ). 
  * Remove a cat from a box and send it into retirement (for some i such that b_i = 1 , assign b_i = 0 ). 
  * Move a cat from one box to another (for some i, j such that b_i = 1, b_j = 0 , assign b_i = 0, b_j = 1 ). 

It has also been found that some boxes were immediately filled with cats.
Therefore, the scientists know the initial position of the cats in the boxes
s_1, \dots, s_n and the desired position f_1, \dots, f_n .

Due to the large amount of paperwork, the scientists do not have time to solve
this problem. Help them for the sake of science and indicate the minimum
number of days required to test the hypothesis.

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^5
) — the number of boxes.

The second line of each test case contains a string s of n characters, where
the i -th character is '1' if there is a cat in the i -th box and '0'
otherwise.

The third line of each test case contains a string f of n characters, where
the i -th character is '1' if there should be a cat in the i -th box and '0'
otherwise.

It is guaranteed that in a test the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the minimum
number of operations required to obtain the desired position from the initial
position. It can be shown that a solution always exists.

Note

In the first test case, you can first move the cat from the first box to the
fifth, and then remove the cat from the fourth box.

In the second test case, there is nothing to do — the only cat is already
sitting in the correct box.

In the third test case of input data, it takes three days to place a cat in
each box.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, representing the number of boxes. s and f are strings of length n, consisting of '0's and '1's, representing the initial and final positions of the cats in the boxes, respectively. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `_` is equal to `t` (the total number of test cases), `n` is the last input integer for the number of boxes in the final test case, `s` is the last input string representing the initial positions of the cats in the final test case, `t` is the last input string representing the final positions of the cats in the final test case, `a` is the count of indices where `s[i]` is greater than `t[i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, n-1]` for the final test case, `b` is the count of indices where `s[i]` is less than `t[i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, n-1]` for the final test case, and `i` is `n-1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it takes the number of boxes `n`, and two strings `s` and `t` of length `n` representing the initial and final positions of cats in the boxes. It calculates the maximum number of positions where the characters in `s` are greater than those in `t` or vice versa, and prints this value for each test case. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results. After processing all test cases, the function terminates.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The program appears to correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state `s` into the desired state `t`. Here's a breakdown of why the program works correctly:

1. **Initialization**: The variables `a` and `b` are initialized to 0. These variables will keep track of the number of positions where `s[i]` is greater than `t[i]` and where `s[i]` is less than `t[i]`, respectively.

2. **Counting Operations**:
   - For each position `i` from 0 to `n-1`, the program increments `a` if `s[i]` is greater than `t[i]` (i.e., `s[i] == '1'` and `t[i] == '0'`).
   - Similarly, it increments `b` if `s[i]` is less than `t[i]` (i.e., `s[i] == '0'` and `t[i] == '1'`).

3. **Output**: The program prints the maximum of `a` and `b`. This is the correct approach because:
   - `a` represents the number of cats that need to be removed.
   - `b` represents the number of cats that need to be added.
   - The minimum number of operations required is the maximum of these two values because you can either add or remove cats, but not both simultaneously in a single operation.

The program handles all edge cases and potential inputs correctly, including:
- When the initial and desired states are identical (no operations needed).
- When the initial state has more cats than the desired state.
- When the initial state has fewer cats than the desired state.
- When the initial and desired states have different distributions of cats.

Since the program correctly calculates the minimum number of operations for all potential cases, it is correct.
