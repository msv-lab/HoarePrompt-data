The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. It accepts four parameters: `t`, `n`, `s`, and `f`. 

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, representing the number of boxes.
- `s` and `f` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's, representing the initial and final states of the boxes, respectively.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

The function processes each test case and determines whether it is possible to transform the initial state `s` into the final state `f` by flipping the state of any box (from '0' to '1' or from '1' to '0'). The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case and indicates whether the transformation is possible.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `s`, and `f`. It processes `t` test cases, each with `n` boxes represented by strings `s` and `f` indicating the initial and final states. The function returns a list of results, where each result indicates whether it is possible to transform the initial state `s` into the final state `f` by flipping the state of any box.**
