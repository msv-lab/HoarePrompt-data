The value of `b` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` (which is `s[0]` since `i` is 0) is less than `t[i]` (which is `t[0]` since `i` is 0). Otherwise, `b` remains 0. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is an input string, `a` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `s[0]` is greater than `t[0]`, `b` is 1 if `s[0]` is less than `t[0]` otherwise `b` is 0, `i` is 0.**
