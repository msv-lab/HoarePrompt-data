Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, representing the number of boxes. s and f are strings of length n, consisting of '0's and '1's, representing the initial and final positions of the cats in the boxes, respectively. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    t = input()
    a = b = 0
    for i in range(n):
        a += s[i] > t[i]
        b += s[i] < t[i]
    print(max(a, b))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `a` is the count of indices where `s[i]` is greater than `t[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `b` is the count of indices where `s[i]` is less than `t[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a new input string, `_` is 0, `n` is a new input integer greater than 1, `s` is a new input string, `a` is the count of indices where `s[i]` is greater than `t[i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, n-1]`, `b` is the count of indices where `s[i]` is less than `t[i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, n-1]`, `i` is `n-1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` remains unchanged, `i` is `n-1`, `a` is the count of indices where `s[i] > t[i]` for all `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`, `b` is the count of indices where `s[i] < t[i]` for all `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
