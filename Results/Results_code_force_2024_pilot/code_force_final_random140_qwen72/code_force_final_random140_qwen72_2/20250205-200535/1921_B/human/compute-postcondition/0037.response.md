To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0, and `i` will start from 0 as it is the default behavior of `range(n)`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a new input string (irrelevant to the loop head)
- `_` is 1 (irrelevant to the loop head)
- `n` is a new input integer greater than 1 (relevant to the loop head)
- `s` is a new input string (irrelevant to the loop head)
- `a` is 0 (irrelevant to the loop head)
- `b` is 0 (irrelevant to the loop head)
- `i` is `n-1` (irrelevant to the loop head, as `i` will be set by the loop)

For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. Since `n` is already stated to be greater than 1, this condition is satisfied. The variable `i` will be set by the loop itself starting from 0 up to `n-1`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
