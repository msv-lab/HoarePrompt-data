The value of `b` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is less than `t[i]`. Since `i` is 1, the comparison is between `s[1]` and `t[1]`. If `s[1]` is less than `t[1]`, `b` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `b` remains unchanged. The values of `n` and `i` remain the same, and `a` remains unchanged unless `s[1] > t[1]`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is incremented by 1 if `s[1] > t[1]`, otherwise `a` remains unchanged, `b` is incremented by 1 if `s[1] < t[1]`, otherwise `b` remains unchanged.**
