The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is a new input integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 (so `i` becomes 2), and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`t` is a new input string, `_` is 0, `n` is a new input integer greater than 1, `s` is a new input string, `a` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `s[0]` is greater than `t[0]` plus 1 if `s[1]` is greater than `t[1]`, `b` is incremented by 1 if `s[1]` is less than `t[1]`, otherwise `b` remains 0, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2**
