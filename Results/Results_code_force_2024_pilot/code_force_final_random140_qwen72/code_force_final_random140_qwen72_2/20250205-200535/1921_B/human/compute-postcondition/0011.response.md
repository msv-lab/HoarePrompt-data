The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 2, and `n` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is an input integer, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `s` is an input string, `a` is 0 or 1 plus 1 if `s[1]` is greater than `t[1]`, `b` is 1 if `s[0]` is less than `t[0]` otherwise `b` is 0, `i` is 2, `b` is now 1 if `s[1]` is less than `t[1]` or 0 if `s[1]` is not less than `t[1]`**
