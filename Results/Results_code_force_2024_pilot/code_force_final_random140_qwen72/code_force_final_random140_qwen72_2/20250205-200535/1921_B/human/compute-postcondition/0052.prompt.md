Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `_` is 2, `t` is greater than 2, `n` is the new input integer, `s1` is the new input string, `s2` is the new input string from the user, `res` is the absolute difference between the count of '1's in `s1` and the count of '1's in the new `s2`, `i` is `n-1`, `hd` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if s1[i] != s2[i]:
        hd += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `_` is 2, `t` is greater than 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `s1` is the new input string, `s2` is the new input string from the user, `res` is the absolute difference between the count of '1's in `s1` and the count of '1's in the new `s2`, `i` is 0, and `hd` is 1 if the characters at index 0 of `s1` and `s2` are different; otherwise, `hd` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `_` is 2, `t` is greater than 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `s1` is the new input string, `s2` is the new input string from the user, `res` is the absolute difference between the count of '1's in `s1` and the count of '1's in the new `s2`, `i` is 1, and `hd` is 1 if the characters at index 0 of `s1` and `s2` are different; otherwise, `hd` is 1 if the characters at index 1 of `s1` and `s2` are different, or 2 if both index 0 and index 1 characters are different.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `_` is 2, `t` is greater than 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `s1` is the new input string, `s2` is the new input string from the user, `res` is the absolute difference between the count of '1's in `s1` and the count of '1's in the new `s2`, `i` is 2, and `hd` is 2 if the characters at index 0 or index 1 of `s1` and `s2` are different, or 3 if both index 0 and index 1 characters are different, or 1 if the characters at index 0 and index 1 are the same but the characters at index 2 are different.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
