The value of `a` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` (which is `s[1]` since `i` is 1) is greater than `t[i]` (which is `t[1]` since `i` is 1). The value of `a` was initially 0 or 1 depending on whether `s[0]` is greater than `t[0]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `a` is 0 or 1 plus 1 if `s[1]` is greater than `t[1]`, `b` is 1 if `s[0]` is less than `t[0]` otherwise `b` is 0, `i` is 1**.
