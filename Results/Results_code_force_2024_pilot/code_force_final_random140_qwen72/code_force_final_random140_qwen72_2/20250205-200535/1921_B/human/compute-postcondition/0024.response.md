The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is a new input integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1, and `n` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

State: **`t` is a new input string, `_` is 0, `n` is a new input integer greater than 1, `s` is a new input string, `a` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `s[0]` is greater than `t[0]`, `b` is incremented by 1 if `s[0]` is less than `t[0]`, otherwise `b` remains 0, `i` is 1**
