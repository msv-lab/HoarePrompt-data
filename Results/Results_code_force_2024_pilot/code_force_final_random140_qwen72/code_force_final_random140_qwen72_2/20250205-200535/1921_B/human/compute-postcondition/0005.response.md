The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `i` should start at 0 for the loop to begin its first iteration.

State: **`t` is an input integer, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is an input string, `a` is 0, `b` is 0, `i` is 0**
