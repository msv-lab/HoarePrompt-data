Functionality: ** The function reads multiple test cases, each involving two strings `s1` and `s2` representing the initial and final states of a sequence of boxes. It calculates and prints the minimum number of operations required to transform `s1` into `s2` by flipping the state of any box. Each operation can flip one box from '0' to '1' or from '1' to '0'. The function does not return any value; instead, it directly outputs the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes, leaving the input variables `t`, `n`, `s1`, and `s2` in their final states corresponding to the last test case processed. **
