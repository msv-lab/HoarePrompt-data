Output State: **`n` remains unchanged, `i` is `n-1`, `a` is the count of indices where `s[i] > t[i]` for all `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`, `b` is the count of indices where `s[i] < t[i]` for all `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The value of `n` remains the same as it was initially.
- The value of `i` is `n-1`, which is the last index the loop iterates over.
- The variable `a` contains the total number of positions where the character in string `s` is greater than the corresponding character in string `t`.
- The variable `b` contains the total number of positions where the character in string `s` is less than the corresponding character in string `t`.
