The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is the iterator for the loop. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`.

For the loop to execute, the input must be a positive integer. This means that the value of `t` (the number of test cases) should be at least 1. Since `t` is already defined as an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, this condition is already met.

However, the state of `_` needs to be considered. Before the loop starts, `_` is not initialized, but it will be set to 0 (the starting index) when the loop begins. The loop will iterate `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `t` is at least 1, and `_` is set to 0 for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0**
