Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer input by the user, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, representing the number of boxes. s and f are strings of length n consisting of '0's and '1's, representing the initial and final states of the boxes, respectively. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s1 = input()
    s2 = input()
    hd = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if s1[i] != s2[i]:
            hd += 1
    res = abs(s1.count('1') - s2.count('1'))
    print(res + abs(hd - res) // 2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is the input integer, `s1` and `s2` are the input strings, `hd` is the number of positions where the characters in `s1` and `s2` differ, `res` is the absolute difference between the count of '1's in `s1` and the count of '1's in `s2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `_` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, `n` is the new input integer, `s1` and `s2` are the new input strings, `res` is the absolute difference between the count of '1's in `s1` and the count of '1's in `s2`, `i` is `n-1`, `hd` is the number of positions where the characters in `s1` and `s2` differ.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: _ is 2, t is greater than 2, n is the new input integer, s1 is the new input string, s2 is the new input string from the user, res is the absolute difference between the count of '1's in s1 and the count of '1's in s2, i is n-1, and hd is the total number of positions where the characters in s1 and s2 differ.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
