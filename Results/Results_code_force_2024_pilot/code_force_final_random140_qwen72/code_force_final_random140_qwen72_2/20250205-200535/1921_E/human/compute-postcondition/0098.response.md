The code snippet `answers.append('Alice')` adds the string 'Alice' to the list `answers`. This operation modifies the `answers` list by appending 'Alice' to its end. The other variables (`i`, `test_cases`, and `clues`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`answers` is a list containing the original elements plus 'Alice', `i` is 2, `test_cases` is greater than 2, `clues` is a list of integers provided by the user.**
