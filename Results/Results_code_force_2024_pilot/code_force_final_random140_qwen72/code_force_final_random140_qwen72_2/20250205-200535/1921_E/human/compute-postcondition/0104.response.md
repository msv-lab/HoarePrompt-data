Postcondition: ***`answers` is a list, `i` is 2, `test_cases` is greater than 2, and `clues` is a list of integers provided by the user. If `clues[3] < clues[5]` and `clues[1] - clues[3] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`, `answers` contains one additional element `'Draw'` at the end. Otherwise, if `clues[3] < clues[5]`, `answers` contains the original elements plus `'Alice'`. If `clues[3] >= clues[5]` and `clues[3] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`, then 'Draw' is appended to `answers`. Otherwise, 'Alice' is appended to `answers`.***
