To determine what will be printed by the `print('draw')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Variables and Conditions:**
   - `t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`.
   - `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing six integers.
   - `r` is a list of integers read from the input.
   - `n` is equal to `r[0]`.
   - `m` is equal to `r[1]`.
   - If `abs(y1 - 1) >= abs(y1 - m)`, then:
     - `x1` is updated to `x1 + (y1 - 1)` if `y2 >= y1` or `x1 + (r[1] - r[3])` if `y2 < y1`.
     - `y1` is now equal to `m`.
     - `x2` is now equal to `r[4] - a`.
     - `y2` is updated to `r[5] + (y1 - 1)` if `y2 >= y1` or `r[5] + (r[1] - r[3])` if `y2 < y1`.
     - `a` is equal to `y1 - 1` if `y2 >= y1` or `r[1] - r[3]` if `y2 < y1`.
   - `b` is equal to `x2 - x1`.
   - `x2 > x1`.
   - `x1 >= 1`.
   - `x2 <= n`.
   - `c` is equal to `m - y2`.
   - Additionally, one of the following conditions must be true:
     - `b // 2 <= a`
     - `abs(x2 - c) < x1 + c`
     - `y1 < 1` or `y1 > m`
     - `x1 < 1` or `x1 > n`

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print('draw')`.

Given the initial state and the conditions, the print statement `print('draw')` will always print the string `'draw'` regardless of the values of the variables and the conditions. This is because the print statement is a simple string literal and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **draw**
