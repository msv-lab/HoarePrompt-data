The value of `x1` is incremented by `a`. The value of `a` depends on the relationship between `y1` and `y2`:

- If `y2` is greater than or equal to `y1`, then `a` is equal to `y1 - 1`.
- If `y2` is less than `y1`, then `a` is equal to `r[1] - r[3]`.

Therefore, the new value of `x1` is:

- If `y2` is greater than or equal to `y1`, then `x1` is updated to `x1 + (y1 - 1)`.
- If `y2` is less than `y1`, then `x1` is updated to `x1 + (r[1] - r[3])`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing six integers, `r` is a list of integers read from the input, `n` is equal to `r[0]`, `m` is equal to `r[1]`, `x1` is equal to `x1 + (y1 - 1)` if `y2 >= y1` or `x1 + (r[1] - r[3])` if `y2 < y1`, `y1` is equal to `r[3]`, `x2` is equal to `r[4]`, `y2` is equal to `r[5]`, `x2` is greater than `x1`, the difference `(x2 - x1)` is even, `y1` is not equal to `y2`, `a` is equal to `y1 - 1` if `y2 >= y1` or `r[1] - r[3]` if `y2 < y1`, `b` is equal to `x2 - x1`.**
