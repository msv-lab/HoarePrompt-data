To determine what will be printed by the `print('draw')` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Variables and Conditions:**
   - `t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`.
   - `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing six integers.
   - `r` is a list of integers read from the input.
   - `n` is equal to `r[0]`.
   - `m` is equal to `r[1]`.
   - `x1` is updated to `r[2] + 1 + a`.
   - `x2` is now equal to `r[4] - a`.
   - `y2` is equal to `r[5]`.
   - `x2` is greater than `x1`.
   - The difference between `x2` and `x1` is an odd number.
   - `y1` is not equal to `y2`.
   - If `y1` is greater than or equal to `y2`, then `y1` is equal to `r[3] - 1`.
   - If `y1` is less than `y2`, then `y1` is equal to `r[3] + 1`.
   - `b` is equal to `x2 - x1`.
   - Additionally, either `x2` is less than or equal to `x1`, or `x1` is less than 1, or `x2` is greater than `n`.

2. **Analysis:**
   - The condition `x2` is greater than `x1` is explicitly stated.
   - The difference between `x2` and `x1` is an odd number.
   - `y1` is not equal to `y2`.
   - The additional condition states that either `x2` is less than or equal to `x1`, or `x1` is less than 1, or `x2` is greater than `n`.

Given these conditions, let's check the additional condition:
- Since `x2` is greater than `x1`, the condition `x2 <= x1` is false.
- Therefore, one of the other two conditions must be true: `x1 < 1` or `x2 > n`.

Since the additional condition is met, the `print('draw')` statement will execute.

Output: **draw**
