Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `answers` is an empty list, `test_cases` is the number of test cases input by the user.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(test_cases):
    clues = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    if clues[2] > clues[4] or clues[0] == 1:
        answers.append('Draw')
    elif clues[2] % 2 == 0 and clues[4] % 2 == 0 or clues[2
        ] % 2 != 0 and clues[4] % 2 != 0:
        if clues[3] == clues[5]:
            answers.append('Bob')
        elif clues[3] < clues[5]:
            if clues[5] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2):
                answers.append('Draw')
            else:
                answers.append('Bob')
        elif clues[3] > clues[5]:
            if clues[1] - clues[5] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2):
                answers.append('Draw')
            else:
                answers.append('Bob')
    elif clues[3] == clues[5]:
        answers.append('Alice')
    elif abs(clues[3] - clues[5]) == 1:
        answers.append('Alice')
    elif clues[3] < clues[5]:
        if clues[1] - clues[3] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2):
            answers.append('Draw')
        else:
            answers.append('Alice')
    elif clues[3] > clues[5]:
        if clues[3] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2):
            answers.append('Draw')
        else:
            answers.append('Alice')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`answers` is a list, `i` is 0, `test_cases` must be greater than 0, and `clues` is a list of integers provided by the user. If `clues[2]` is greater than `clues[4]` or `clues[0]` is equal to 1, `answers` contains one element 'Draw'. Otherwise, if `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` are both even or both odd:
- If `clues[3]` is equal to `clues[5]`, `answers` contains 'Bob'.
- If `clues[3]` is not equal to `clues[5]`, `answers` contains 'Draw' if `clues[3]` is less than `clues[5]` and `clues[5] - 1` is greater than the absolute value of the integer division of `clues[2] - clues[4]` by 2, or if `clues[3]` is greater than `clues[5]` and `clues[1] - clues[5]` is greater than the absolute value of the integer division of `clues[2] - clues[4]` by 2. Otherwise, `answers` contains 'Bob'.
If `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` are of different parities:
- If `clues[3]` is equal to `clues[5]`, `answers` contains 'Alice'.
- If the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is 1, `answers` contains 'Alice'.
- If `clues[3]` is less than `clues[5]` and `clues[1] - clues[3]` is greater than the absolute value of the integer division of `clues[2] - clues[4]` by 2, `answers` contains 'Draw'.
- If `clues[3]` is greater than or equal to `clues[5]` and `clues[3] - 1` is greater than the absolute value of the integer division of the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` by 2, `answers` contains 'Draw'.
In all other cases, `answers` contains 'Alice'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`answers` is a list, `i` is 1, `test_cases` is greater than 1, and `clues` is a list of integers provided by the user. If `clues[2] > clues[4]` or `clues[0] == 1`, then `'Draw'` is appended to `answers`. Otherwise, if `clues[2] % 2 == 0` and `clues[4] % 2 == 0` or (`clues[2] % 2 != 0` and `clues[4] % 2 != 0`), then: if `clues[3] == clues[5]`, `'Bob'` is appended to `answers`. If `clues[3] < clues[5]` and `clues[5] - 1` is greater than the absolute value of the integer division of `clues[2] - clues[4]` by 2, then `'Draw'` is appended to `answers`. If `clues[3] < clues[5]` but `clues[5] - 1` is not greater than the absolute value of the integer division of `clues[2] - clues[4]` by 2, then `'Bob'` is appended to `answers`. If `clues[3] >= clues[5]` and `clues[1] - clues[5]` is greater than the absolute value of the integer division of `clues[2] - clues[4]` by 2, then `'Draw'` is appended to `answers`. If `clues[3] >= clues[5]` but `clues[1] - clues[5]` is not greater than the absolute value of the integer division of `clues[2] - clues[4]` by 2, then `'Bob'` is appended to `answers`. If the condition `clues[2] % 2 == 0` and `clues[4] % 2 == 0` or (`clues[2] % 2 != 0` and `clues[4] % 2 != 0`) is not met, then: if `clues[3] == clues[5]`, 'Alice' is appended to `answers`. If `abs(clues[3] - clues[5]) == 1`, 'Alice' is appended to `answers`. If `clues[3] < clues[5]` and `clues[1] - clues[3] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`, 'Draw' is appended to `answers`. If `clues[3] < clues[5]` but `clues[1] - clues[3] <= abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`, 'Alice' is appended to `answers`. If `clues[3] >= clues[5]` and `clues[3] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`, 'Draw' is appended to `answers`. If `clues[3] >= clues[5]` but `clues[3] - 1 <= abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`, 'Alice' is appended to `answers`. If none of these conditions are met, `answers` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`answers` is a list, `i` is 2, `test_cases` is greater than 2, and `clues` is a list of integers provided by the user. If `clues[2] > clues[4]` or `clues[0] == 1`, 'Draw' is appended to `answers`. Otherwise, if `clues[2] % 2 == 0 and clues[4] % 2 == 0` or `(clues[2] % 2 != 0 and clues[4] % 2 != 0)`, and if `clues[3] == clues[5]`, 'Bob' is appended to `answers`. If `clues[3] < clues[5]` and `clues[5] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`, 'Draw' is appended to `answers`. If `clues[3] < clues[5]` and `clues[5] - 1 <= abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`, 'Bob' is appended to `answers`. If `clues[3] >= clues[5]` and `clues[1] - clues[5] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`, 'Draw' is appended to `answers`. If `clues[3] >= clues[5]` and `clues[1] - clues[5] <= abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`, 'Bob' is appended to `answers`. If the condition `clues[2] % 2 == 0 and clues[4] % 2 == 0` or `(clues[2] % 2 != 0 and clues[4] % 2 != 0)` is not met, and if `clues[3] == clues[5]`, 'Alice' is appended to `answers`. If `abs(clues[3] - clues[5]) == 1`, 'Alice' is appended to `answers`. If `clues[3] < clues[5]` and `clues[1] - clues[3] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`, 'Draw' is appended to `answers`. If `clues[3] < clues[5]`, 'Alice' is appended to `answers`. If `clues[3] >= clues[5]` and `clues[3] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`, 'Draw' is appended to `answers`. Otherwise, 'Alice' is appended to `answers`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
