The code snippet `x2 -= a` modifies the value of `x2` by subtracting the value of `a` from it. Let's break down the impact:

- `x2` is initially equal to `r[4]`.
- `a` is equal to `y1 - 1` if `y2 >= y1` or `r[1] - r[3]` if `y2 < y1`.

After executing `x2 -= a`, the new value of `x2` is `r[4] - a`.

Let's summarize the output state:

- `t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing six integers
- `r` is a list of integers read from the input
- `n` is equal to `r[0]`
- `m` is equal to `r[1]`
- `x1` is equal to `x1 + (y1 - 1)` if `y2 >= y1` or `x1 + (r[1] - r[3])` if `y2 < y1`
- `y1` is equal to `r[3]`
- `x2` is now equal to `r[4] - a`
- `y2` is equal to `r[5]`
- `x2` is greater than `x1`
- The difference `(x2 - x1)` is even
- `y1` is not equal to `y2`
- `a` is equal to `y1 - 1` if `y2 >= y1` or `r[1] - r[3]` if `y2 < y1`
- `b` is equal to `x2 - x1`
