Postcondition: **The function `game_outcome` is defined with parameters `t` and `test_cases`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases. `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing six integers. `r` is a list of integers read from the input. `n` is equal to `r[0]`, `m` is equal to `r[1]`, `x1` is equal to `r[2]`, `y1` is equal to `r[3]`, `x2` is equal to `r[4]`, and `y2` is equal to `r[5]`. Additionally, `x2` is greater than `x1`. The difference between `x2` and `x1` is an odd number.**
