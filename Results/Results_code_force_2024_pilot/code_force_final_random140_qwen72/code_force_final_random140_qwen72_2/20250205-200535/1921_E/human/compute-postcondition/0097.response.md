The code `answers.append('Draw')` adds the string `'Draw'` to the end of the list `answers`. This operation modifies the `answers` list but does not affect the other variables.

Output State: **`answers` is a list containing one additional element `'Draw'` at the end, `i` is 2, `test_cases` is greater than 2, `clues` is a list of integers provided by the user.**
