Functionality: **The function `game_outcome` accepts two parameters: `t`, an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases`, a list of tuples. Each tuple contains six integers (h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b), representing the dimensions of the board (h, w) and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips (x_a, y_a) and (x_b, y_b). The function does not return any value.**
