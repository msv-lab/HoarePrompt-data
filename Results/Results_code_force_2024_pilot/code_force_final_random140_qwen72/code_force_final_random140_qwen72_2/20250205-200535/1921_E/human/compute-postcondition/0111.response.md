Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `answers` is a list containing the results ('Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice') for each iteration.
- `answers` must have at least 1 element.
- `j` is the first element of `answers`.
- `i` is `test_cases - 1`.
- `test_cases` must be greater than 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(j)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **List `answers`**: This list contains at least one element, and each element is one of the strings 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice'.
2. **Variable `j`**: According to the initial state, `j` is the first element of the list `answers`. Since `answers` must have at least one element, `j` will always be one of the strings 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice'.
3. **Variable `i`**: This variable is defined as `test_cases - 1`, but it is not used in the `print` statement, so it does not affect the output.
4. **Variable `test_cases`**: This variable must be greater than 0, ensuring that `answers` has at least one element.

### Conclusion:
The `print(j)` statement will print the first element of the list `answers`.

### Final Output:
Output: **j (where j is the first element of the answers list, and j is one of 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice')**
