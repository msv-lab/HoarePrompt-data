Based on the initial state:

- `answers` is a list containing the results ('Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice') for each iteration.
- `answers` must have at least 2 elements.
- `j` is the second element of `answers`.
- `i` is `test_cases - 1`, and `test_cases` must be greater than 0.

Given this information, the `print(j)` statement will print the second element of the `answers` list. Since `answers` contains results from iterations, and it must have at least 2 elements, the second element (`j`) will be one of the following: 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice'.

Output: **j (where j is the second element of the answers list, and can be 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice')**
