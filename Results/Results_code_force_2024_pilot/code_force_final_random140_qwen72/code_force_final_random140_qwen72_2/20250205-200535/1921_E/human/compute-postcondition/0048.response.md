Based on the initial state and the conditions provided:

- `t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`.
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing six integers.
- `r` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `n` is equal to `r[0]`.
- `m` is equal to `r[1]`.
- `x1` is updated to `r[2] + 1 + a`.
- `x2` is now equal to `r[4] - a`.
- `y2` is either `1` or `m`.
- `x2` is greater than `x1`.
- The difference between `x2` and `x1` is an odd number.
- `y1` is not equal to `y2`.
- If `y1` was greater than or equal to `y2`, then `y1` is now `r[3] - 1 - a` (if `y2` is `1`) or `r[3] - 1` (if `y2` is `m`).
- If `y1` was less than `y2`, then `y1` is now `r[3] + 1 - a` (if `y2` is `1`) or `r[3] + 1` (if `y2` is `m`).
- `b` is equal to `x2 - x1`.
- `x2 > x1`.
- `x1 >= 1`.
- `x2 <= n`.
- `c` is equal to `y1 - 1` (if `y2` is `1`) or `m - y1` (if `y2` is `m`).
- At least one of the following is true: `b // 2 <= a`, `abs(x2 - c) < x1 + c`, `y1 < 1` or `y1 > m`, or `x1 < 1` or `x1 > n`.

Given these conditions, the `print` statement is:

```python
print('draw')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'draw'`.

Output: **draw**
