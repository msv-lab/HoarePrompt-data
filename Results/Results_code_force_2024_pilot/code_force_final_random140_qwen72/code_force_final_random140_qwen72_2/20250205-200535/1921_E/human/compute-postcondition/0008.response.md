Based on the initial state provided:

- The function `game_outcome` is defined with parameters `t` and `test_cases`.
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases.
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing six integers.
- `r` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `n` is equal to `r[0]`, `m` is equal to `r[1]`, `x1` is equal to `r[2]`, `y1` is equal to `r[3]`, `x2` is equal to `r[4]`, and `y2` is equal to `r[5]`.
- `x2` is greater than `x1`.
- The difference between `x2` and `x1` is an odd number.
- The current value of `y1` is equal to the current value of `y2`.

Given these conditions, the `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print('Alice')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'Alice'`.

Output: **Alice**
