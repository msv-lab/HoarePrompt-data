Output State: **`t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing six integers, `r` is a list of integers read from the input, `n` is equal to `r[0]`, `m` is equal to `r[1]`, `x1` is equal to `x1 + (y1 - 1)` if `y2 >= y1` or `x1 + (r[1] - r[3])` if `y2 < y1`, `y1` is now equal to `m`, `x2` is now equal to `r[4] - a`, `y2` is equal to `r[5]`, `x2` is greater than `x1`, the difference `(x2 - x1)` is even, `y1` is not equal to `y2`, `a` is equal to `y1 - 1` if `y2 >= y1` or `r[1] - r[3]` if `y2 < y1`, `b` is equal to `x2 - x1`, `x2 > x1`, `x1 >= 1`, `x2 <= n`, and `abs(y1 - 1) >= abs(y1 - m)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `y1` is updated to be equal to `m`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
