Output State: **`t` is the absolute difference between `m` and `y1 + a`, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing six integers, `r` is a list of integers read from the input, `n` is equal to `r[0]`, `m` is equal to `r[1]`, `x1` is updated to `r[2] + 1 + a`, `x2` is now equal to `r[4] - a`, `y2` is equal to `m`, `x2` is greater than `x1`, the difference between `x2` and `x1` is an odd number, `y1` is now `y1 + a`, `b` is equal to `x2 - x1`, `x2 > x1`, `x1 >= 1`, `x2 <= n`, `c` is equal to `m - y1`.**
