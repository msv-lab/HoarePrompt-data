### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `tt` and iterates through each test case by calling `func_1()`.

2. **Function `func_1()`:**
   - The function reads six integers from the input: `n`, `m`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, which represent the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips.

3. **Initial Conditions:**
   - If `x2 <= x1`, it means Bob is already at or above Alice, so the game is a draw because neither can win. This is correctly handled by printing "draw".
   - If `(x2 - x1) % 2 != 0`, it means the vertical distance between Alice and Bob is odd, which affects the possible outcomes.

4. **Odd Vertical Distance:**
   - If `y1 == y2`, Alice can win by moving directly to Bob's position. This is correctly handled by printing "Alice".
   - If `y2 > y1`, Alice moves diagonally down-right; otherwise, she moves diagonally down-left. This is correctly handled by updating `y1` and `x1`.
   - After these moves, if `y1 == y2`, Alice wins. This is correctly handled by printing "Alice".
   - Otherwise, the program calculates the remaining vertical and horizontal distances and checks if Alice can force a win. This involves several conditions and updates to `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, and `y2`.

5. **Even Vertical Distance:**
   - If `y1 == y2`, Bob can win by moving directly to Alice's position. This is correctly handled by printing "Bob".
   - Similar to the odd case, the program calculates the remaining distances and checks if Bob can force a win. This involves several conditions and updates to `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, and `y2`.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program checks if the new positions of the chips are within the board boundaries. If any condition for a win is met, the program prints the winner; otherwise, it prints "draw".

### Evaluation of Annotations:
- The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at various points, including the initial conditions, the updates to the positions, and the final checks.
- The annotations confirm that the program handles the edge cases and boundary conditions correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to handle all the specified conditions and edge cases correctly. It follows the logic described in the problem statement and should produce the correct output for the given test cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
