Correctness: **False**

The program provided has several issues that affect its correctness:

1. **Incorrect Placement of `func_1()` Call**: The call to `func_1()` should be inside the loop that processes each test case. In the provided code, `func_1()` is called outside the loop, which means it will only be called once, regardless of the number of test cases.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Even and Odd Differences**: The logic for determining the winner based on whether the difference in the x-coordinates is even or odd is flawed. Specifically, the conditions and calculations for moving the chips and checking the final positions are overly complex and contain logical errors.

3. **Incorrect Conditions for Drawing the Game**: The conditions for drawing the game are not correctly implemented. The program incorrectly checks for conditions that should lead to a draw but does not handle all edge cases properly.

4. **Incorrect Logic for Moving Chips**: The logic for moving the chips and checking if they can meet is not consistent with the rules of the game. The program attempts to move the chips in a way that does not align with the allowed moves (down, down-right, down-left for Alice; up, up-right, up-left for Bob).

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
tt = int(input())
for _ in range(tt):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    r = list(map(int, input().split()))
    (n, m, x1, y1, x2, y2) = (r[0], r[1], r[2], r[3], r[4], r[5])
    
    # If Bob is already in the first row or Alice is in the last row, it's a draw
    if x1 == n or x2 == 1:
        print('Draw')
        return
    
    # Calculate the difference in x-coordinates
    dx = x2 - x1
    
    # If the difference is odd, Bob wins because Alice cannot reach Bob
    if dx % 2 != 0:
        print('Bob')
        return
    
    # If the difference is even, check if Alice can win
    if (y1 == y2) or (abs(y1 - y2) <= dx):
        print('Alice')
        return
    
    # If none of the above conditions are met, it's a draw
    print('Draw')
```

This corrected version simplifies the logic and correctly handles the conditions for winning and drawing the game.
