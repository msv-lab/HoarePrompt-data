The function `game_outcome` takes two parameters: `t`, an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases`, a list of tuples. Each tuple contains six integers (h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b), representing the dimensions of the board (h, w) and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips (x_a, y_a) and (x_b, y_b). The function reads input from the user, processes the game logic based on the positions of Alice's and Bob's chips, and prints the outcome of the game as 'Alice', 'Bob', or 'draw'. The function does not return any value.
