Precondition: **The function should actually be defined with parameters to match the problem description. A correct function definition would be: `def game_outcome(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing six integers (h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b) representing the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips. Each tuple satisfies the conditions 1 ≤ x_a, x_b ≤ h ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ y_a, y_b ≤ w ≤ 10^9, and either x_a ≠ x_b or y_a ≠ y_b.**
