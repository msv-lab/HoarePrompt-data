#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should actually be defined with parameters to match the problem description. A correct function definition would be: `def game_outcome(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing six integers (h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b) representing the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips. Each tuple satisfies the conditions 1 ≤ x_a, x_b ≤ h ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ y_a, y_b ≤ w ≤ 10^9, and either x_a ≠ x_b or y_a ≠ y_b.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `game_outcome` takes two parameters: `t`, an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases`, a list of tuples. Each tuple contains six integers (h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b), representing the dimensions of the board (h, w) and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips (x_a, y_a) and (x_b, y_b). The function reads input from the user, processes the game logic based on the positions of Alice's and Bob's chips, and prints the outcome of the game as 'Alice', 'Bob', or 'draw'. The function does not return any value.
