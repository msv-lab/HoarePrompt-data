Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with any number of elements, `hcf` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all the elements in the list `numbers`.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `hcf` will hold the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all the elements in the list `numbers`. The list `numbers` can have any number of elements, but the final value of `hcf` will be the GCD of all these elements.
