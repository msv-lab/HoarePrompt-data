The value of `hcf` is updated to the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the current `hcf` and `num`. Since `num` is the fourth element of the list `numbers`, and `hcf` was initially the GCD of the first three elements, the new `hcf` is now the GCD of the first four elements of the list `numbers`.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `num` is the fourth element of the list, `hcf` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the first four elements of the list `numbers`.**
