The only objects in the loop head are the list `numbers` and the variable `num`. The loop iterates over the elements of `numbers` starting from the second element. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more element in the list after the current `num`.

At the end of the last iteration, `numbers` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `num` is the third element of the list, and `hcf` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the first, second, and third elements of the list `numbers`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the list `numbers` must have at least 4 elements, and `num` will be the fourth element of the list.

State: **`numbers` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `num` is the fourth element of the list, `hcf` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the first, second, and third elements of the list `numbers`**
