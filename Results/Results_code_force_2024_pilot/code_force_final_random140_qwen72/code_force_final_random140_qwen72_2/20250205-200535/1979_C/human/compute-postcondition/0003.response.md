The only objects in the loop head are the variable `num` and the list `numbers`. The loop iterates over the slice of the list `numbers` starting from the second element. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more element in the list after the current `num`.

At the end of the last iteration, `numbers` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `num` is the second element of the list, and `hcf` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the first and second elements of the list `numbers`. For the loop to execute one more time, the list `numbers` must have at least 3 elements, and `num` will be the third element of the list.

State: **`numbers` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `num` is the third element of the list, `hcf` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the first and second elements of the list `numbers`**
