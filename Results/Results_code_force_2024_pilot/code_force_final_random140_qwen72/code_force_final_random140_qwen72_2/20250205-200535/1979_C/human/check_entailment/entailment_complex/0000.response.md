Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to find a set of bets \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \) such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. This means for each \( i \), \( \sum_{j=1}^n x_j < k_i \cdot x_i \).

2. **Program Logic**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes \( n \) and the multipliers \( k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_n \).
   - It calculates the product of all multipliers \( m \).
   - It then calculates the bets \( c_i \) as \( \frac{m}{k_i} \) for each outcome.
   - It finds the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the bets using `func_1`.
   - It normalizes the bets by dividing each by the GCD.
   - It checks if the sum of the normalized bets is less than \( m \). If so, it prints the bets; otherwise, it prints -1.

3. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - **Product Calculation**: The product \( m \) of all multipliers ensures that the bets \( c_i = \frac{m}{k_i} \) are integers.
   - **GCD Normalization**: Dividing each \( c_i \) by the GCD ensures that the bets are minimized while maintaining the same ratio.
   - **Sum Check**: The condition \( \sum_{i=1}^n c_i < m \) ensures that the total bet is less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.

4. **Potential Issues**:
   - **Overflow**: The product \( m \) can become very large, potentially causing overflow issues. However, since the maximum value of \( k_i \) is 20 and \( n \leq 50 \), the product \( m \) should still fit within the limits of typical integer types in Python.
   - **Edge Cases**: The program correctly handles edge cases where no solution exists (e.g., when all \( k_i \) are the same).

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
