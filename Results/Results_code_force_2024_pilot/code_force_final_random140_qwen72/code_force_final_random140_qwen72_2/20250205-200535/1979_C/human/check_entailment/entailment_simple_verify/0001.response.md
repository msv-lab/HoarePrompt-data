Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires finding a set of bets \(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\) such that the total sum of bets is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome. Mathematically, we need:
   \[
   \sum_{i=1}^n x_i < \min_{i=1}^n (k_i \cdot x_i)
   \]
   This implies:
   \[
   \sum_{i=1}^n x_i < k_j \cdot x_j \quad \text{for all } j
   \]

2. **Approach in the Program**:
   - The program calculates the product of all multipliers \(k_i\) and assigns it to \(m\).
   - It then computes the bets \(c_i\) as \(m / k_i\).
   - The greatest common divisor (GCD) of the bets \(c_i\) is calculated using `func_1`.
   - Each bet \(c_i\) is divided by the GCD to reduce the bets to their smallest form.
   - Finally, it checks if the sum of the reduced bets is less than \(m\). If so, it prints the bets; otherwise, it prints \(-1\).

3. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - **Product Calculation**: The product \(m\) of all \(k_i\) ensures that each \(c_i = m / k_i\) is an integer.
   - **GCD Reduction**: Dividing each \(c_i\) by the GCD ensures that the bets are minimized while maintaining the same relative proportions.
   - **Sum Check**: The condition \(\sum_{i=1}^n c_i < m\) ensures that the total bet is less than the minimum return for any winning outcome.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If all \(k_i\) are the same, the sum of bets will be equal to \(m\), which fails the condition. The program correctly handles this by printing \(-1\).
   - For other cases, the program should find a valid set of bets if one exists.

5. **Annotated Code Verification**:
   - The annotated code confirms that the GCD calculation and the reduction of bets are performed correctly.
   - The sum check ensures that the total bet is less than the product \(m\), which is necessary for the solution to be valid.

Given the above reasoning and the verification of the annotated code, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Final: **True**
