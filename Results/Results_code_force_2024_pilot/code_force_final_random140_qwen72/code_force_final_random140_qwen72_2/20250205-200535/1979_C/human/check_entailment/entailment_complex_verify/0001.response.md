Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to find a set of bets \(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\) such that the total sum of bets is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome. Mathematically, we need:
   \[
   \sum_{i=1}^n x_i < \min_{i=1}^n (k_i \cdot x_i)
   \]
   This implies:
   \[
   \sum_{i=1}^n x_i < k_j \cdot x_j \quad \text{for all } j
   \]

2. **Approach in the Program**:
   - The program calculates the product of all multipliers \(k_i\) and assigns it to \(m\).
   - It then computes the bets \(c_i\) as \(m / k_i\).
   - The greatest common divisor (GCD) of the bets \(c_i\) is calculated using `func_1`.
   - Each bet \(c_i\) is divided by the GCD to reduce the bets to their smallest form.
   - Finally, it checks if the sum of the reduced bets is less than \(m\). If so, it prints the bets; otherwise, it prints \(-1\).

3. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - **Product Calculation**: The product \(m\) of all \(k_i\) ensures that each \(c_i = m / k_i\) is an integer.
   - **GCD Reduction**: Dividing each \(c_i\) by the GCD ensures that the bets are minimized while maintaining the same relative proportions.
   - **Sum Check**: The condition \(\sum_{i=1}^n c_i < m\) ensures that the total bet is less than the minimum return for any winning outcome.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If all \(k_i\) are the same, the sum of bets will be equal to \(m\), which fails the condition. The program correctly handles this by printing \(-1\).
   - For other cases, the program should find a valid set of bets if one exists.

However, there is a subtle issue in the program that needs to be addressed:
   - **Overflow Issue**: The product \(m\) of all \(k_i\) can become very large, potentially leading to overflow issues. This can cause the program to fail for large inputs where the product exceeds the maximum representable integer in Python.
   - **Efficiency**: Calculating the product of all \(k_i\) and then dividing by each \(k_i\) to get \(c_i\) is computationally expensive and unnecessary. A more efficient approach would be to use the least common multiple (LCM) of the \(k_i\) values instead of their product.

Despite these potential issues, the program's logic is fundamentally sound for the given constraints (where \(n \leq 50\) and \(k_i \leq 20\)). The product \(m\) will not exceed the maximum representable integer in Python for these constraints, and the program will work correctly.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described within the given constraints.

Final: **True**
