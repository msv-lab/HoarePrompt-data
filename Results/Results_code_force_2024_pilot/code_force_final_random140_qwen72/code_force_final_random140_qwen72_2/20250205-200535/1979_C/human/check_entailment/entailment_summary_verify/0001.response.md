### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The goal is to find a set of bets \(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\) such that the total sum of bets is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome. Mathematically, we need:
     \[
     \sum_{i=1}^n x_i < \min_{i=1}^n (k_i \cdot x_i)
     \]
   - This implies:
     \[
     \sum_{i=1}^n x_i < k_j \cdot x_j \quad \text{for all } j
     \]

2. **Approach in the Program**:
   - The program calculates the product of all multipliers \(k_i\) and assigns it to \(m\).
   - It then computes the bets \(c_i\) as \(m / k_i\).
   - The greatest common divisor (GCD) of the bets \(c_i\) is calculated using `func_1`.
   - Each bet \(c_i\) is divided by the GCD to reduce the bets to their smallest form.
   - Finally, it checks if the sum of the reduced bets is less than \(m\). If so, it prints the bets; otherwise, it prints \(-1\).

3. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - **Product Calculation**: The product \(m\) of all \(k_i\) ensures that each \(c_i = m / k_i\) is an integer.
   - **GCD Reduction**: Dividing each \(c_i\) by the GCD ensures that the bets are minimized while maintaining the same relative proportions.
   - **Sum Check**: The condition \(\sum_{i=1}^n c_i < m\) ensures that the total bet is less than the minimum return for any winning outcome.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If all \(k_i\) are the same, the sum of bets will be equal to \(m\), which fails the condition. The program correctly handles this by printing \(-1\).
   - For other cases, the program should find a valid set of bets if one exists.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Product Calculation**:
  - The product \(m\) of all \(k_i\) is calculated correctly. This ensures that each \(c_i = m / k_i\) is an integer.
  - Example: For \(k = [3, 2, 7]\), \(m = 3 \times 2 \times 7 = 42\). Thus, \(c = [14, 21, 6]\).

- **GCD Reduction**:
  - The GCD of the bets \(c_i\) is calculated using `func_1`. This function correctly computes the GCD of the list.
  - Example: For \(c = [14, 21, 6]\), the GCD is 1. Thus, the bets remain \([14, 21, 6]\).

- **Sum Check**:
  - The sum of the reduced bets is checked against \(m\).
  - Example: For \(c = [14, 21, 6]\), the sum is \(14 + 21 + 6 = 41\), which is less than \(42\). Therefore, the bets are valid.

- **Edge Case Handling**:
  - If all \(k_i\) are the same, the sum of bets will be equal to \(m\), and the program correctly prints \(-1\).
  - Example: For \(k = [5, 5, 5, 5, 5]\), \(m = 5^5 = 3125\). The bets are \([625, 625, 625, 625, 625]\), and the sum is \(3125\), which is not less than \(3125\). Therefore, the program prints \(-1\).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find a valid set of bets or determine that no such set exists. The original assessment is accurate.
