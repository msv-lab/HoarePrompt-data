#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of integers.
def func_1(numbers):
    hcf = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        hcf = gcd(hcf, num)
        
    #State: `numbers` is a list of integers with any number of elements, `hcf` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all the elements in the list `numbers`.
    return hcf
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all the elements in the list `numbers`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `numbers` and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all the elements in the list. After the function concludes, the list `numbers` remains unchanged, and the returned value is the GCD of the integers in `numbers`.
