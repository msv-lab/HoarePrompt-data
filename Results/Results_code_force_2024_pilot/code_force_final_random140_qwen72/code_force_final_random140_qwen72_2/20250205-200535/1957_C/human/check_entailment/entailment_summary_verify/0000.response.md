### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in stating that the provided functions do not implement the logic required to solve the given problem. Let's break down the issues and validate the assessment step-by-step:

1. **Problem Requirements**:
   - The problem requires calculating the number of possible final configurations of rooks on an \( n \times n \) chessboard, considering the specific rules for placing rooks and the mirroring behavior of the computer.
   - The rooks cannot attack each other, meaning no two rooks can share the same row or column.
   - The computer mirrors the player's moves, except when the player places a rook on the diagonal (i.e., \( r = c \)).

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(x)`**: This function initializes a dictionary `dp` but immediately calls `helper(x)` without using `dp` in any meaningful way. This suggests that `func_1` is incomplete or incorrectly designed.
   - **`helper(len)`**: This function implements a dynamic programming approach to compute a value based on a recurrence relation:
     - If `len` is less than or equal to 0, it returns 1.
     - If `len` is in the `dp` dictionary, it returns the cached value.
     - Otherwise, it calculates `x1 = helper(len - 1)` and `x2 = 2 * (len - 1) * helper(len - 2)`, and returns their sum `y`.

3. **Recurrence Relation**:
   - The recurrence relation `x2 = 2 * (len - 1) * helper(len - 2)` does not reflect the constraints of the chessboard problem. Specifically:
     - It does not account for the placement of rooks on the chessboard.
     - It does not consider the mirroring behavior of the computer.
     - It does not handle the special case where the player places a rook on the diagonal.

4. **Example Case**:
   - Consider a 4x4 chessboard with 1 initial move at (1, 2). The program should calculate the number of possible final configurations, but the current implementation does not handle the chessboard and rook placement logic at all. Therefore, it will produce incorrect results.

### Conclusion:
The provided functions do not correctly implement the logic required to solve the given problem. The recurrence relation used in `helper` does not align with the problem's requirements, and the function `func_1` is incomplete. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
