Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves placing rooks on an \( n \times n \) chessboard such that no two rooks attack each other. The player places a white rook, and the computer mirrors the move by placing a black rook at the transposed position. The goal is to count the number of different final configurations after all possible moves are made, modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The provided solution uses dynamic programming to solve the problem. The function `func_1` initializes a dictionary `dp` for memoization and calls the helper function `helper` to compute the number of configurations.

3. **Helper Function Analysis**:
   - **Base Case**: If `len` is less than or equal to 0, the function returns 1. This is because there is exactly one way to arrange zero rooks.
   - **Memoization Check**: If the value for `len` is already computed and stored in `dp`, it returns the stored value to avoid redundant calculations.
   - **Recursive Calculation**:
     - `x1` represents the number of ways to place rooks if we do not place a rook in the current row.
     - `x2` represents the number of ways to place rooks if we place a rook in the current row and another rook in the transposed position. This is multiplied by 2 because there are two choices for the transposed position.
     - The total number of configurations `y` is the sum of `x1` and `x2`.
     - The result is stored in `dp` and returned.

4. **Correctness of the Logic**:
   - The base case and memoization are correctly implemented.
   - The recursive calculation considers both scenarios: placing a rook and not placing a rook, which aligns with the problem's requirements.
   - The use of dynamic programming ensures that the solution is efficient and avoids redundant calculations.

5. **Modulo Operation**: The problem requires the result to be modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \). The provided code does not include this modulo operation. This is a critical oversight, as the result can be very large and needs to be reduced to fit within the specified range.

6. **Input Handling and State Updates**:
   - The main loop reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the board size `n` and the number of initial moves `k`.
   - It then processes the initial moves, updating `n` based on whether the move is mirrored or not.
   - Finally, it calls `func_1(n)` to get the number of configurations and prints the result.

Given the above analysis, the provided program is almost correct but lacks the necessary modulo operation to ensure the result fits within the required range. This is a significant issue that affects the correctness of the solution.

Final: **False**
