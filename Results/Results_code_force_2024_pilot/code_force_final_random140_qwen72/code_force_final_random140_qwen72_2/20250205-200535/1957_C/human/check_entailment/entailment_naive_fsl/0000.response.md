Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided functions `func_1` and `helper` do not correctly implement the logic required to solve the given problem. The problem requires calculating the number of possible final configurations of rooks on an \( n \times n \) chessboard, considering the specific rules for placing rooks and the mirroring behavior of the computer. However, the provided functions seem to be implementing a different dynamic programming approach that does not align with the problem's requirements.

Specifically, the `helper` function calculates values based on a recurrence relation that does not reflect the constraints of the chessboard problem. For example, the recurrence relation `x2 = 2 * (len - 1) * helper(len - 2)` does not account for the placement of rooks on the chessboard or the mirroring behavior of the computer.

To illustrate a specific case where the program fails:
- Consider a 4x4 chessboard with 1 initial move at (1, 2). The program should calculate the number of possible final configurations, but the current implementation does not handle the chessboard and rook placement logic at all. Therefore, it will produce incorrect results.

Thus, the program is incorrect.
