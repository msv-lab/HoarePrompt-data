You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an n \times n chessboard where you and the computer take turns
alternatingly to place white rooks & black rooks on the board respectively.
While placing rooks, you have to ensure that no two rooks attack each other.
Two rooks attack each other if they share the same row or column regardless of
color.

A valid move is placing a rook on a position (r , c ) such that it doesn't
attack any other rook.

You start first, and when you make a valid move in your turn, placing a white
rook at position (r , c ), the computer will mirror you and place a black rook
at position (c , r ) in its turn. If r = c , then the computer can't mirror
your move, and skips its turn.

You have already played k moves with the computer (the computer tries to
mirror these moves too), and you must continue playing the game until there
are no valid moves remaining. How many different final configurations are
possible when you continue the game after the k moves? It is guaranteed that
the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid. Since the answer may be
large, print it modulo 10^9+7 .

Two configurations are considered different if there exists a coordinate (r ,
c ) which has a rook in one configuration, but not in the other or the color
of the rook on the coordinate is different.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq
3 \cdot 10^5 , 0 \leq k \leq n ) — the size of the chessboard and the number
of moves you have already played respectively.

Each of the next k lines of the test case contains two integers r_i and c_i ,
denoting the i -th move you made.

It is guaranteed that the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the total number
of possible final configurations modulo 10^9+7 .

Note

In the first test case, we have a 4 \times 4 grid and you've already played 1
move. After you and the computer play a turn, we have a white rook at (1 , 2
), and a black rook at (2 , 1 ). There are three possible configurations from
this state —

  1. You place a white rook at (3 , 4 ) and the computer places a black rook at (4 , 3 ) as a response. 
  2. You place a white rook at (4 , 3 ) and the computer places a black rook at (3 , 4 ) as a response. 
  3. You place a white rook at (3 , 3 ) and then at (4 , 4 ), or the other way around. They both result in the same configuration.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(x):
    dp = {}

    return helper(x)

#Function 2:
def helper(len):
    if len <= 0:
        return 1
    if len in dp:
        return dp[len]
    x1 = helper(len - 1)
    x2 = 2 * (len - 1) * helper(len - 2)
    y = x1 + x2
    dp[len] = y
    return y



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The `helper` function takes a non-negative integer `len` as input and returns an integer value. If `len` is less than or equal to 0, it returns 1. If `len` is a key in the dictionary `dp`, it returns the value associated with that key. Otherwise, it calculates a new value `y` as the sum of `helper(len - 1)` and `2 * (len - 1) * helper(len - 2)`, stores this value in `dp` with the key `len`, and returns `y`. The function effectively computes a value based on a recursive formula, caching results in `dp` to avoid redundant calculations.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves placing rooks on an \( n \times n \) chessboard such that no two rooks attack each other. The player places a white rook, and the computer mirrors the move by placing a black rook at the transposed position. The goal is to count the number of different final configurations after all possible moves are made, modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The provided solution uses dynamic programming to solve the problem. The function `func_1` initializes a dictionary `dp` for memoization and calls the helper function `helper` to compute the number of configurations.

3. **Helper Function Analysis**:
   - **Base Case**: If `len` is less than or equal to 0, the function returns 1. This is because there is exactly one way to arrange zero rooks.
   - **Memoization Check**: If the value for `len` is already computed and stored in `dp`, it returns the stored value to avoid redundant calculations.
   - **Recursive Calculation**:
     - `x1` represents the number of ways to place rooks if we do not place a rook in the current row.
     - `x2` represents the number of ways to place rooks if we place a rook in the current row and another rook in the transposed position. This is multiplied by 2 because there are two choices for the transposed position.
     - The total number of configurations `y` is the sum of `x1` and `x2`.
     - The result is stored in `dp` and returned.

4. **Correctness of the Logic**:
   - The base case and memoization are correctly implemented.
   - The recursive calculation considers both scenarios: placing a rook and not placing a rook, which aligns with the problem's requirements.
   - The use of dynamic programming ensures that the solution is efficient and avoids redundant calculations.

5. **Modulo Operation**: The problem requires the result to be modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \). However, the provided code does not include this modulo operation. This is a critical oversight, as the result can be very large and needs to be reduced to fit within the specified range.

Given the above analysis, the provided program is almost correct but lacks the necessary modulo operation to ensure the result fits within the required range.

Correctness: **False**
