### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying that the provided functions `func_1` and `helper` do not correctly implement the logic required to solve the given problem. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Problem Requirements**:
   - The problem requires calculating the number of possible final configurations of rooks on an \( n \times n \) chessboard, considering the specific rules for placing rooks and the mirroring behavior of the computer.
   - The computer mirrors the player's move unless the move is on the diagonal (i.e., \( r = c \)), in which case the computer skips its turn.

2. **Provided Functions**:
   - **`func_1(x)`**: This function initializes an empty dictionary `dp` and calls `helper(x)`.
   - **`helper(len)`**: This function uses a dynamic programming approach to compute a value based on a recurrence relation:
     - If `len <= 0`, it returns 1.
     - If `len` is in `dp`, it returns the cached value.
     - Otherwise, it calculates `x1 = helper(len - 1)` and `x2 = 2 * (len - 1) * helper(len - 2)`, sums them to get `y`, caches `y` in `dp`, and returns `y`.

3. **Analysis of the Recurrence Relation**:
   - The recurrence relation `x2 = 2 * (len - 1) * helper(len - 2)` does not directly relate to the placement of rooks on the chessboard or the mirroring behavior of the computer.
   - The function `helper` is designed to solve a different problem, likely related to counting permutations or combinations, but not the specific rook placement problem described.

4. **Example Case**:
   - Consider a 4x4 chessboard with 1 initial move at (1, 2). The program should calculate the number of possible final configurations, but the current implementation does not handle the chessboard and rook placement logic at all. Therefore, it will produce incorrect results.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided functions do not correctly implement the logic required to solve the given problem. The dynamic programming approach used in `helper` does not align with the constraints and requirements of the chessboard problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
