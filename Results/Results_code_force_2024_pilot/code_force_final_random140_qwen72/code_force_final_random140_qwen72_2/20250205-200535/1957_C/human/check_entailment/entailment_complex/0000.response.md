### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Initial Setup:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of initial moves `k`.
   - It then reads the `k` moves and updates the size of the remaining available positions `n` based on whether the move was mirrored or not.

2. **Move Processing:**
   - If the move is not on the diagonal (i.e., `a != b`), both the player's move and the computer's mirrored move occupy two positions, so `n` is reduced by 2.
   - If the move is on the diagonal (i.e., `a == b`), only one position is occupied, so `n` is reduced by 1.

3. **Final Configuration Calculation:**
   - The program calls `func_1(n)` to compute the number of possible final configurations.
   - `func_1` initializes an empty dictionary `dp` and calls the `helper` function with the updated `n`.

4. **Helper Function (`helper`):**
   - The `helper` function uses dynamic programming to compute the number of ways to place rooks on the remaining positions.
   - It uses a recursive approach with memoization to avoid redundant calculations.
   - The base case is when `len` is 0 or negative, in which case it returns 1.
   - For other values of `len`, it calculates the number of configurations by considering two cases:
     - Placing a rook in the first row and column, reducing the problem to `len - 1`.
     - Placing a rook in the first row and a different column, and another rook in the first column and a different row, reducing the problem to `len - 2`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result of `func_1(n)` for each test case, which is the number of possible final configurations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to handle the given problem. It processes the initial moves, updates the available positions, and uses dynamic programming to compute the number of possible final configurations. The use of memoization ensures efficient computation even for large values of `n`.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
