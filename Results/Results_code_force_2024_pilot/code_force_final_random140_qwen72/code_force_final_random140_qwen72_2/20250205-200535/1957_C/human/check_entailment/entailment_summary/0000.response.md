### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem involves placing rooks on an \( n \times n \) chessboard such that no two rooks attack each other.
   - You place a white rook, and the computer mirrors your move by placing a black rook at the transposed position, unless the move is on the diagonal (i.e., \( r = c \)), in which case the computer skips its turn.
   - The goal is to determine the number of different final configurations possible after all valid moves are made, modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The main loop reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the board \( n \) and the number of initial moves \( k \).
   - It then reads the initial moves and updates the board size \( n \) based on whether the move is on the diagonal or not.
   - Finally, it calls `func_1(n)` to compute the number of possible final configurations.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - `func_1` initializes an empty dictionary `dp` and calls the `helper` function with the updated board size \( n \).

4. **Function `helper`**:
   - `helper` is a recursive function that uses dynamic programming (memoization) to compute the number of ways to place rooks on a reduced board.
   - The base case is when the length is less than or equal to 0, in which case it returns 1.
   - If the length is already in the `dp` dictionary, it returns the cached value.
   - Otherwise, it computes the value using the recursive formula:
     \[
     \text{helper}(len) = \text{helper}(len - 1) + 2 \times (len - 1) \times \text{helper}(len - 2)
     \]
   - This formula accounts for the two possible scenarios:
     - Placing a rook in the current row and column, reducing the problem to a smaller board of size \( len - 1 \).
     - Placing a rook in the current row and column, and then placing another rook in the remaining board, reducing the problem to a smaller board of size \( len - 2 \).

5. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly processes the initial moves and updates the board size.
   - The `helper` function correctly implements the recursive formula for counting the number of valid configurations.
   - The use of memoization ensures that the function runs efficiently even for large values of \( n \).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
