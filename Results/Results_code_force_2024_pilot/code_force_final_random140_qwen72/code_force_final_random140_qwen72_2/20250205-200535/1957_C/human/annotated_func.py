#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(x):
    dp = {}
    return helper(x)
    #The program returns the result of the function `helper(x)`, where `x` is a non-negative integer and `dp` is an empty dictionary. Since the function `helper` is not defined in the given code snippet, the exact output cannot be determined without the definition of `helper`. However, the return value will be whatever `helper(x)` computes based on the input `x` and potentially using the dictionary `dp` for memoization or other purposes.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `x` and returns the result of calling another function `helper(x)`. The function initializes an empty dictionary `dp` which is intended to be used by `helper` for memoization or other purposes. The exact output of `func_1` depends on the implementation of `helper`, but it will be the value computed by `helper(x)`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: len is a non-negative integer representing the length of a sequence or a dimension in the context of the problem.
def helper(len):
    if (len <= 0) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1.
    #State: *len is a non-negative integer representing the length of a sequence or a dimension in the context of the problem, and len is greater than 0
    if (len in dp) :
        return dp[len]
        #The program returns the value associated with the key `len` in the dictionary `dp`.
    #State: *`len` is a non-negative integer representing the length of a sequence or a dimension in the context of the problem, and `len` is greater than 0, and `len` is not in `dp`
    x1 = helper(len - 1)
    x2 = 2 * (len - 1) * helper(len - 2)
    y = x1 + x2
    dp[len] = y
    return y
    #The program returns the value of `y`, which is the sum of `x1` and `x2`. Here, `x1` is the value returned by `helper(len - 1)`, and `x2` is 2 times `(len - 1)` times the value returned by `helper(len - 2)`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The `helper` function takes a non-negative integer `len` as input and returns an integer value. If `len` is less than or equal to 0, it returns 1. If `len` is a key in the dictionary `dp`, it returns the value associated with that key. Otherwise, it calculates a new value `y` as the sum of `helper(len - 1)` and `2 * (len - 1) * helper(len - 2)`, stores this value in `dp` with the key `len`, and returns `y`. The function effectively computes a value based on a recursive formula, caching results in `dp` to avoid redundant calculations.
