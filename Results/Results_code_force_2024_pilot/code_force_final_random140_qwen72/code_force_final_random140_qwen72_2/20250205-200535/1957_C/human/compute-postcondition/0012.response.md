Functionality: ** The `helper` function takes a non-negative integer `len` as input and returns an integer value. If `len` is less than or equal to 0, it returns 1. If `len` is a key in the dictionary `dp`, it returns the value associated with that key. Otherwise, it calculates a new value `y` as the sum of `helper(len - 1)` and `2 * (len - 1) * helper(len - 2)`, stores this value in `dp` with the key `len`, and returns `y`. The function effectively computes a value based on a recursive formula, caching results in `dp` to avoid redundant calculations. **
