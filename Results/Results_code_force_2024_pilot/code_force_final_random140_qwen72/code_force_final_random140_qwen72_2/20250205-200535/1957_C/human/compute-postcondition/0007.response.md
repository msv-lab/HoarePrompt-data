Output State: **`len` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `len` is not in `dp`, `x1` is the value returned by `helper(len - 1)`, `x2` is 2 * (len - 1) * the value returned by `helper(len - 2)`**. 

This means that the value of `x2` is calculated as twice the product of `(len - 1)` and the value returned by the function `helper` when called with the argument `(len - 2)`. All other conditions from the initial state remain unchanged.
