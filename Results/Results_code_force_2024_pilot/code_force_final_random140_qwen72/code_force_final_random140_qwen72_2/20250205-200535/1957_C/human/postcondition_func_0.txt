The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `x` and returns the result of calling another function `helper(x)`. The function initializes an empty dictionary `dp` which is intended to be used by `helper` for memoization or other purposes. The exact output of `func_1` depends on the implementation of `helper`, but it will be the value computed by `helper(x)`.
