The value of `b2` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `b2` was `m - 1`, so the new value of `b2` is `m - 2`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a1` is 1, `a2` is `n - 1`, `ans` is `abs(a[0] - b[m - 1])`, `b1` is 0, `b2` is `m - 2`, `t` is `t - 2`, `a` is now a sorted list of integers from the new input, `b` is now a sorted list of integers from the new input, `n` is updated with a new input value, `m` is updated with a new input value, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `t` must be greater than 0, `dif1` is `abs(a[0] - b[0])`, `dif2` is `abs(a[0] - b[m - 1])`, `dif3` is `abs(a[n - 1] - b[0])`, `dif4` is `abs(a[n - 1] - b[m - 1])`, `dif1` is less than or equal to `dif2`, and `dif3` is less than or equal to `dif2`.**
