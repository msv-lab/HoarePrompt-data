Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a1` is 0, `a2` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, `b1` is 0, `b2` is `m - 1`, `t` is `t - 2`, `a` is now a sorted list of integers from the new input, `b` is now a sorted list of integers from the new input, `n` is updated with a new input value, `m` is updated with a new input value, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `t` must be greater than 0.
Code of the loop:
while a1 <= a2:
    dif1 = abs(a[a1] - b[b1])
    dif2 = abs(a[a1] - b[b2])
    dif3 = abs(a[a2] - b[b1])
    dif4 = abs(a[a2] - b[b2])
    if dif1 > dif2:
        if dif3 > dif4:
            if dif3 > dif1:
                ans += dif3
                a2 -= 1
                b1 += 1
            else:
                ans += dif1
                a1 += 1
                b1 += 1
        elif dif4 > dif1:
            ans += dif4
            a2 -= 1
            b2 -= 1
        else:
            ans += dif1
            a1 += 1
            b1 += 1
    elif dif3 > dif4:
        if dif3 > dif2:
            ans += dif3
            a2 -= 1
            b1 += 1
        else:
            ans += dif2
            a1 += 1
            b2 -= 1
    elif dif4 > dif2:
        ans += dif4
        a2 -= 1
        b2 -= 1
    else:
        ans += dif2
        a1 += 1
        b2 -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, `b2`, `ans`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `n`, `m`, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` are as follows: `a` and `b` are sorted lists of integers from the new input, `n` and `m` are updated with new input values (both must be greater than or equal to 1), `t` is `t - 2`, `dif1` is `abs(a[0] - b[0])`, `dif2` is `abs(a[0] - b[m - 1])`, `dif3` is `abs(a[n - 1] - b[0])`, and `dif4` is `abs(a[n - 1] - b[m - 1])`. If `dif1 > dif2` and `dif3 > dif4`, then `a1` is 0, `a2` is `n - 2`, `ans` is `dif3`, `b1` is 1, and `b2` is `m - 1`. If `dif1 > dif2` and `dif3 <= dif4`, then `a1` is 0, `a2` is `n - 2`, `ans` is `dif4`, `b1` is 0, and `b2` is `m - 2`. If `dif1 <= dif2` and `dif3 > dif4`, then `a1` is 0, `a2` is `n - 2`, `ans` is incremented by `abs(a[n - 1] - b[0])`, `b1` is 1, and `b2` is `m - 1`. If `dif1 <= dif2` and `dif4 > dif2`, then `a1` is 0, `a2` is `n - 2`, and `ans` is incremented by `abs(a[n - 1] - b[m - 1])`. If `dif1 <= dif2` and `dif3 <= dif4` and `dif4 <= dif2`, then `a1` is 1, `a2` is `n - 1`, `ans` is incremented by `abs(a[0] - b[m - 1])`, `b1` is 0, and `b2` is `m - 2`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`a1`, `a2`, `b1`, `b2`, `ans`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `n`, `m`, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` remain as described, with `a1` and `a2` ensuring `a1 <= a2`. If `dif1 > dif2`: If `dif3 > dif4`, then: if `dif3 > dif1`, `a2` is decreased by 1, `b1` is increased by 1, and `ans` is increased by `dif3`; otherwise, `a1` is increased by 1, `ans` is increased by `dif1`, and `b1` is increased by 1. If `dif3 <= dif4`, then: if `dif4 > dif1`, `a1` and `a2` are decreased by 1, `b1` and `b2` are decreased by 1, and `ans` is increased by `dif4`; otherwise, `a1` is increased by 1, `ans` is increased by `dif1`, and `b1` is increased by 1. If `dif1 <= dif2`: If `dif3 > dif4`, then: if `dif3 > dif2`, `a1` and `a2` are decreased by 1, `b1` is increased by 1, and `ans` is increased by `dif3`. Otherwise, `a1` is increased by 1, `ans` is increased by `dif2`, and `b2` is decreased by 1. If `dif3 <= dif4`, then: if `dif4 > dif2`, `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, and `b2` are each decreased by 1, and `ans` is increased by the value of `dif4`. Otherwise, `a1` is increased by 1, `a2`, `b1`, and `b2` are each decreased by 1, and `ans` is increased by `dif2`. In all cases, `dif4` is now equal to the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`a1`, `a2`, `b1`, `b2`, `ans`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `n`, `m`, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` remain as described, with `a1` and `a2` ensuring `a1 <= a2`. If `dif1 > dif2`:
- If `dif3 > dif4`:
  - If `dif3 > dif1`, `a1` and `a2` are both decreased by 1, `b1` is increased by 1.
  - Otherwise, `a1` is increased by 1, `ans` is increased by `dif1`, `b1` is increased by 1.
- If `dif3 <= dif4`:
  - If `dif4 > dif1`, `a1` and `a2` are updated to `a2 - 1`, `b1` and `b2` are updated to `b2 - 1`, and `ans` is incremented by `dif4`.
  - Otherwise, `a1` is incremented by 1, `b1` is incremented by 1, and `ans` is incremented by `dif1`.
If `dif1 <= dif2`:
- If `dif3 > dif4`:
  - If `dif3 > dif2`, `a2` is decreased by 1, `b1` is increased by 1, and `ans` is increased by `dif3`.
  - Otherwise, `a1` is increased by 1, `b2` is decreased by 1, and `ans` is increased by `dif2`.
- If `dif3 <= dif4`:
  - If `dif4 > dif2`, `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, and `b2` are each decreased by 1, `ans` is increased by `abs(a[a2+1] - b[b2])`, and `dif4` is updated to `abs(a[a2+1] - b[b2])`.
  - Otherwise, `a1` is increased by 1, `a2` ensures `a1 <= a2`, `b1` and `b2` are each decreased by 1, and `ans` is increased by `dif2`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
