The only variable in the loop head is `a1` and `a2`, so we can only adjust these two. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `a1 <= a2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `a1` must be less than or equal to `a2`.

At the end of the last iteration, the values of `a1` and `a2` are not explicitly given, but we know that they were such that `a1 <= a2` was true. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to maintain this condition.

Since the exact values of `a1` and `a2` are not specified, we cannot change their values directly. However, to ensure the loop condition remains true, we can state that `a1` should remain less than or equal to `a2`.

State: **`t` is an input integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 99, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 * 10^5, the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from user input, `dif1` is `abs(a[0] - b[0])`, `dif2` is `abs(a[0] - b[m - 1])`, `dif3` is `abs(a[n - 1] - b[0])`, `dif4` is `abs(a[n - 1] - b[m - 1])`, `a1` is less than or equal to `a2`, `b1` and `b2` are as set in the if-else block, and `ans` is as set in the if-else block**.
