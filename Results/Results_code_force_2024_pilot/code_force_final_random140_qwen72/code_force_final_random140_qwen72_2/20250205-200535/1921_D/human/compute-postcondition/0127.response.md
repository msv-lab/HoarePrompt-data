The code snippet `ans += dif2` increments the value of `ans` by the value of `dif2`. Since `dif2` is defined as `abs(a[a1] - b[b2])`, the value of `ans` will be updated to include this difference.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 99
- `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 * 10^5, and the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5
- `a` is a sorted list of integers
- `b` is a sorted list of integers read from user input
- `dif1` is `abs(a[a1] - b[b1])`
- `dif2` is `abs(a[a1] - b[b2])`
- `dif3` is `abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`
- `dif4` is `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`
- `a1` is less than or equal to `a2`

After executing the code snippet, the value of `ans` is incremented by `dif2`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 99, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 * 10^5, the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from user input, `dif1` is `abs(a[a1] - b[b1])`, `dif2` is `abs(a[a1] - b[b2])`, `dif3` is `abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`, `dif4` is `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`, `a1` is less than or equal to `a2`, `ans` is incremented by `abs(a[a1] - b[b2])`.**
