Output State: **`a1` is 0, `a2` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, `b1` is 0, `b2` is `m - 1`, `t` is `t - 2`, `a` is now a sorted list of integers from the new input, `b` is now a sorted list of integers from the new input, `n` is updated with a new input value, `m` is updated with a new input value, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `t` must be greater than 0, `dif1` is `abs(a[0] - b[0])`, `dif2` is `abs(a[0] - b[m - 1])`, `dif3` is `abs(a[n - 1] - b[0])`.**

Explanation:
- `dif3` is calculated as the absolute difference between the last element of list `a` (which is `a[a2]` or `a[n - 1]`) and the first element of list `b` (which is `b[b1]` or `b[0]`).
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
