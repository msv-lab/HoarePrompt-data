To determine what will be printed when the `print(ans)` statement executes, let's break down the initial state and the context provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `a1` is equal to `a2 + 1`.
   - `ans` is the sum of the minimum differences calculated during each iteration of the loop.
   - `b1` is equal to `b2 + 1`.
   - `t` is `t - 1`.
   - `n` and `m` are updated with the new input values.
   - `a` is now a sorted list of integers from the input.
   - `b` is now a sorted list of integers from the new input.
   - `a2` is `n - 1` or less.
   - `b2` is `m - 1` or less.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `a1` and `b1` are derived from `a2` and `b2` respectively, where `a1 = a2 + 1` and `b1 = b2 + 1`.
   - `a2` and `b2` are indices that are less than or equal to `n - 1` and `m - 1` respectively.
   - `a` and `b` are sorted lists of integers.
   - `ans` is the sum of the minimum differences calculated during each iteration of the loop.

3. **What is `ans`?**
   - `ans` is the result of a computation that involves finding the minimum differences between elements of the sorted lists `a` and `b` during each iteration of the loop.
   - The exact value of `ans` depends on the specific elements in the lists `a` and `b` and the logic used to calculate the minimum differences.

4. **Output Determination:**
   - Since the exact values of the lists `a` and `b` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans`.
   - However, based on the structure of the problem, the `print(ans)` statement will output the sum of the minimum differences calculated during each iteration of the loop.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of the minimum differences calculated during each iteration of the loop)**
