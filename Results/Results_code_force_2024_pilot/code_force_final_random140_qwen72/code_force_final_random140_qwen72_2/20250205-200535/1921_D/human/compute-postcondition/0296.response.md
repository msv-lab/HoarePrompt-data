Output State: **`a1` is 0, `a2` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, `b1` is 0, `b2` is `m - 1`, `t` is `t - 2`, `a` is now a sorted list of integers from the new input, `b` is now a sorted list of integers from the new input, `n` is updated with a new input value, `m` is updated with a new input value, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `t` must be greater than 0, `dif1` is `abs(a[0] - b[0])`, `dif2` is `abs(a[0] - b[m - 1])`.**

Explanation:
- `dif2` is calculated as the absolute difference between the first element of list `a` (which is `a[0]`) and the last element of list `b` (which is `b[m - 1]`).
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
