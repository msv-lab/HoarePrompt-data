The code snippet `ans += dif3` increments the value of `ans` by the value of `dif3`. Given that `ans` was initially 0, after executing this line, `ans` will be equal to `dif3`.

The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Specifically, `dif3` is still `abs(a[n - 1] - b[0])`, and it is still true that `dif1` is greater than `dif2`, `dif3` is greater than `dif4`, and `dif3` is greater than `dif1`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is an input integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 99, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 * 10^5, the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from user input, `a1` is 0, `a2` is `n - 1`, `b1` is 0, `b2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is `abs(a[n - 1] - b[0])`, `dif1` is `abs(a[0] - b[0])`, `dif2` is `abs(a[0] - b[m - 1])`, `dif3` is `abs(a[n - 1] - b[0])`, `dif4` is `abs(a[n - 1] - b[m - 1])`, `dif1` is greater than `dif2`, `dif3` is greater than `dif4`, and `dif3` is greater than `dif1`.**
