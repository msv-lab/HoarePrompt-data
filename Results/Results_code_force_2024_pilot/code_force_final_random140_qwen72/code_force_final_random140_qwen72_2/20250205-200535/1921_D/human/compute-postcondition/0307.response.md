The value of `ans` is incremented by the value of `dif1`. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `dif1` is defined as `abs(a[0] - b[0])`, and `ans` was initially 0, the new value of `ans` is `abs(a[0] - b[0])`.

Output State: **`a1` is 0, `a2` is `n - 1`, `ans` is `abs(a[0] - b[0])`, `b1` is 0, `b2` is `m - 1`, `t` is `t - 2`, `a` is now a sorted list of integers from the new input, `b` is now a sorted list of integers from the new input, `n` is updated with a new input value, `m` is updated with a new input value, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `t` must be greater than 0, `dif1` is `abs(a[0] - b[0])`, `dif2` is `abs(a[0] - b[m - 1])`, `dif3` is `abs(a[n - 1] - b[0])`, `dif4` is `abs(a[n - 1] - b[m - 1])`, `dif1` is greater than `dif2`, and `dif3` is less than or equal to `dif1`.**
