The code snippet `ans += dif1` increments the value of `ans` by the value of `dif1`. Given the initial state, `ans` starts at 0, and `dif1` is the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the first element of `b`.

Let's summarize the impact:
- `ans` is updated to `0 + dif1`, which simplifies to `ans = dif1`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`a1` is 0, `a1` is no longer greater than `a2`, `ans` is `dif1`, `b1` is 0, `b2` is `m - 1`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` and `m` are updated with the new input values, `a` is now a sorted list of integers from the input, `b` is now a sorted list of integers from the new input, `a2` is `n - 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `dif1` is the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the first element of `b`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the last element of `b`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between the last element of `a` and the first element of `b`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between the last element of `a` and the last element of `b`, and `dif3` is less than or equal to `dif1`.**
