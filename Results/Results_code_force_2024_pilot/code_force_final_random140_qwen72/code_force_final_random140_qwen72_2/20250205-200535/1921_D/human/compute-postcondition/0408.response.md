Output State: **`a1` is increased by 1, `a2` ensures `a1 <= a2`, `ans` is increased by `dif2`, `b1`, `b2` is decreased by 1, `t`, `a`, `b`, `n`, `m`, `dif1`, `dif3`, and `dif4` remain unchanged.** 

The value of `b2` is decreased by 1, while the other variables retain their previous states. The conditions and relationships between `a1`, `a2`, and `ans` remain as specified in the initial state.
