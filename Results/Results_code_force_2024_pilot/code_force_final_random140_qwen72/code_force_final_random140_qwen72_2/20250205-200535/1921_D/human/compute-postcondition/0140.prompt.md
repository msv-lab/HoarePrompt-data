Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 99, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 * 10^5, the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from user input, `a1` is 0, `a2` is `n - 1`, `b1` is 0, `b2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while a1 <= a2:
    dif1 = abs(a[a1] - b[b1])
    dif2 = abs(a[a1] - b[b2])
    dif3 = abs(a[a2] - b[b1])
    dif4 = abs(a[a2] - b[b2])
    if dif1 > dif2:
        if dif3 > dif4:
            if dif3 > dif1:
                ans += dif3
                a2 -= 1
                b1 += 1
            else:
                ans += dif1
                a1 += 1
                b1 += 1
        elif dif4 > dif1:
            ans += dif4
            a2 -= 1
            b2 -= 1
        else:
            ans += dif1
            a1 += 1
            b1 += 1
    elif dif3 > dif4:
        if dif3 > dif2:
            ans += dif3
            a2 -= 1
            b1 += 1
        else:
            ans += dif2
            a1 += 1
            b2 -= 1
    elif dif4 > dif2:
        ans += dif4
        a2 -= 1
        b2 -= 1
    else:
        ans += dif2
        a1 += 1
        b2 -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *Given `t` is an input integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 99, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 * 10^5, the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from user input, `dif1` is `abs(a[0] - b[0])`, `dif2` is `abs(a[0] - b[m - 1])`, `dif3` is `abs(a[n - 1] - b[0])`, `dif4` is `abs(a[n - 1] - b[m - 1])`. After the if-else block executes: If `dif1` > `dif2` and `dif3` > `dif4`, then: if `dif3` > `dif1`, `a1` is 0, `a2` is `n - 2`, `b1` is 1, `b2` is `m - 1`, and `ans` is `dif3`; otherwise, `a1` is 1, `a2` is `n - 1`, `b1` is 1, `b2` is `m - 1`, and `ans` is `dif1`. If `dif1` > `dif2` and `dif3` ≤ `dif4`, then: if `dif4` > `dif1`, `a1` is 0, `a2` is `n - 2`, `b1` is 0, `b2` is `m - 2`, and `ans` is `dif4`; otherwise, `a1` is 1, `a2` is `n - 1`, `b1` is 1, `b2` is `m - 1`, and `ans` is `dif1`. If `dif1` ≤ `dif2` and `dif3` > `dif4`, then `a1` is 0, `a2` is `n - 2`, `b1` is 1, `b2` is `m - 1`, and `ans` is `dif3`. If `dif1` ≤ `dif2` and `dif3` ≤ `dif4`, then `a1` is 0, `a2` is `n - 2`, `b1` is 0, `b2` is `m - 2`, and `ans` is `dif4`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an input integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 99, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 * 10^5, the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from user input, `dif1` is `abs(a[a1] - b[b1])`, `dif2` is `abs(a[a1] - b[b2])`, `dif3` is `abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`, `dif4` is `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`, `a1` is less than or equal to `a2`. If `dif1 > dif2`, then if `dif3 > dif4`, `ans` is incremented by `abs(a[a2 - 1] - b[b2])`, and `b2` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is incremented by `dif1`, `b1` is incremented by 1, and `a1` is incremented by 1. If `dif3 <= dif4`, then if `dif3 > dif1`, `b1` is incremented by 1, `a2` is decremented by 1, and `ans` is incremented by `abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`. Otherwise, `a1` is incremented by 1, `b1` is incremented by 1, and `ans` is incremented by `abs(a[a1] - b[b1])`. If `dif1 <= dif2`, then if `dif3 > dif4`, `b1` is incremented by 1, `ans` is updated to `ans + abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`, and `a2` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, if `dif4 > dif2`, `ans` is incremented by `dif4`, `a2` is decremented by 1, and `b2` is decremented by 1. If neither of these conditions hold, `ans` is incremented by `abs(a[a1+1] - b[b2-1])`, and `a1` is incremented by 1 while `b2` is decremented by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Given `t` is an input integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 99, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 * 10^5, the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from user input, `dif1` is `abs(a[a1] - b[b1])`, `dif2` is `abs(a[a1] - b[b2])`, `dif3` is `abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`, `dif4` is `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`, and `a1` is less than or equal to `a2`. After the if-else block executes, if `dif1 > dif2`, then: if `dif3 > dif4`, `ans` is increased by the absolute difference between `a[a2 - 1]` and `b[b2 - 1]`, `b2` is decreased by 1, and `a1` remains less than or equal to `a2 - 1`. If `dif3 ≤ dif4`, `ans` is increased by the absolute difference between `a[a1 - 1]` and `b[b2]`, `b2` is decreased by 1, and `a1` is increased by 1. If `dif1 ≤ dif2`, then: if `dif3 > dif4`, and if `dif3 > dif2`, `ans` is incremented by the absolute difference between `a[a2 - 1]` and `b[b1 - 1]`, `b1` is incremented by 1, and `a1` remains less than or equal to `a2 - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` is incremented by the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `a1` is incremented by 1, and `b2` is decremented by 1. If `dif3 ≤ dif4`, and if `dif4 > dif2`, `ans` is increased by the absolute difference between `a[a2 - 1]` and `b[b2 - 1]`, `b2` is decreased by 1, and `a1` remains less than or equal to `a2 - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` is increased by the absolute difference between `a[a1 - 1]` and `b[b2]`, `b2` is decreased by 1, and `a1` is increased by 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
