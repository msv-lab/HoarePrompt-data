Output State: **`a1`, `a2` is decreased by 1, `b1`, `b2`, `ans` is increased by `abs(a[a2+1] - b[b2])`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `n`, `m`, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` is `abs(a[a2+1] - b[b2])`.**

Explanation: The value of `a2` is decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged except for the value of `a2` which is now one less than its initial value. The value of `ans` was previously increased by `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`, and since `a2` has been decremented, the expression `abs(a[a2+1] - b[b2])` now represents the value that was used to increase `ans`. Similarly, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` also retain their relationship to `abs(a[a2+1] - b[b2])`.
