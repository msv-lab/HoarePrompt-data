Postcondition: ***`a1`, `a2`, `b1`, `b2`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `n`, `m`, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` remain as described, with `a1` and `a2` ensuring `a1 <= a2`. If `dif4 > dif1`, `a1` and `a2` are decreased by 1, `b1` and `b2` are decreased by 1, and `ans` is increased by `dif4`. Otherwise, `a1` is increased by 1, `ans` is increased by `dif1`, and `b1` is increased by 1.***
