The code snippet `ans += dif4` increments the value of `ans` by the value of `dif4`. Given the initial state, `dif4` is defined as `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`.

Let's summarize the impact of the code:

- `ans` is updated to its current value plus `dif4`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, `b2`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 99, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 * 10^5, the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from user input, `dif1` is `abs(a[a1] - b[b1])`, `dif2` is `abs(a[a1] - b[b2])`, `dif3` is `abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`, `dif4` is `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`, `a1` is less than or equal to `a2`, `b1` and `b2` are as set in the if-else block, `ans` is now `ans + abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`.**
