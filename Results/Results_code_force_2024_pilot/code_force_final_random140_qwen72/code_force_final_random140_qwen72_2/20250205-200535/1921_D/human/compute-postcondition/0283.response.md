Output State: **`a1` is equal to `a2 + 1`, `ans` is the sum of the minimum differences calculated during each iteration of the loop, `b1` is equal to `b2 + 1`, `t` is `t - 2`, `n` and `m` are updated with the new input values, `a` is now a sorted list of integers from the input, `b` is now a sorted list of integers from the new input, `a2` is `n - 1` or less, `b2` is `m - 1` or less, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `t` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is decremented by 1, changing its value from `t - 1` to `t - 2`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
