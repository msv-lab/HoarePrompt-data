Output State: **`a1`, `a2` (decreased by 1), `b1`, `b2`, `ans` is increased by `dif3`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `n`, `m`, `dif1`, `dif2`, and `dif4` remain as described, with `a1` and `a2` ensuring `a1 <= a2`.** 

Explanation: The value of `a2` is decreased by 1, while all other variables and conditions remain unchanged. The condition `a1 <= a2` is still valid after the decrement of `a2`.
