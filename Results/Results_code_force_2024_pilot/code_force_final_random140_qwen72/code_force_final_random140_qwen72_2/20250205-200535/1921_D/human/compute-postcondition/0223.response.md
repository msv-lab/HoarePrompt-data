Output State: **`a1` is 1 or 2, `a1` is no longer greater than `a2`, `ans` is the minimum of `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` plus `dif1`, `b1` is 0 or 1, `b2` is `m - 1` or `m - 2`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` and `m` are updated with the new input values, `a` is now a sorted list of integers from the input, `b` is now a sorted list of integers from the new input, `a2` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `dif1` is the absolute difference between the element `a[a1]` and the element `b[b1]`, `dif2` is the absolute difference between the element `a[a1]` and the element `b[b2]`, `dif3` is the absolute difference between the element `a[a2]` and the element `b[b1]`, `dif4` is the absolute difference between the element `a[a2]` and the element `b[b2]`. If `dif1` > `dif2`, then `ans` is the minimum of `dif1`, `dif3`, and `dif4` plus `dif1`. If `dif1` <= `dif2`, then `ans` is the minimum of `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` plus `dif1`.**
