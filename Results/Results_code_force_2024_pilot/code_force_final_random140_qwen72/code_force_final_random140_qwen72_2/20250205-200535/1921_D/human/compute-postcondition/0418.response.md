Postcondition: ***`a1`, `a2`, `b1`, `b2`, `ans`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `n`, `m`, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` remain as described, with `a1` and `a2` ensuring `a1 <= a2`. If `dif1 > dif2`:
- If `dif3 > dif4`:
  - If `dif3 > dif1`, `a1` and `a2` are both decreased by 1, `b1` is increased by 1.
  - Otherwise, `a1` is increased by 1, `ans` is increased by `dif1`, `b1` is increased by 1.
- If `dif3 <= dif4`:
  - If `dif4 > dif1`, `a1` and `a2` are updated to `a2 - 1`, `b1` and `b2` are updated to `b2 - 1`, and `ans` is incremented by `dif4`.
  - Otherwise, `a1` is incremented by 1, `b1` is incremented by 1, and `ans` is incremented by `dif1`.
If `dif1 <= dif2`:
- If `dif3 > dif4`:
  - If `dif3 > dif2`, `a2` is decreased by 1, `b1` is increased by 1, and `ans` is increased by `dif3`.
  - Otherwise, `a1` is increased by 1, `b2` is decreased by 1, and `ans` is increased by `dif2`.
- If `dif3 <= dif4`:
  - If `dif4 > dif2`, `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, and `b2` are each decreased by 1, `ans` is increased by `abs(a[a2+1] - b[b2])`, and `dif4` is updated to `abs(a[a2+1] - b[b2])`.
  - Otherwise, `a1` is increased by 1, `a2` ensures `a1 <= a2`, `b1` and `b2` are each decreased by 1, and `ans` is increased by `dif2`.***
