Output State: **After the loop has executed all its iterations, the final state will be as follows: `a1` will be greater than `a2`, indicating the loop condition `a1 <= a2` is no longer satisfied. The variable `ans` will contain the sum of the maximum differences selected during each iteration of the loop. The indices `b1` and `b2` will reflect the changes made during the loop's execution, typically moving towards the center of the `b` list. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `n`, and `m` will remain unchanged from their initial values, as they are not modified within the loop.**

This means that the loop will continue to execute until `a1` exceeds `a2`. During each iteration, the loop selects the maximum difference between elements of `a` and `b` based on the current indices and updates the indices and `ans` accordingly. Once the loop exits, `ans` will hold the cumulative sum of these maximum differences, and the indices `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, and `b2` will reflect the final positions after all iterations.
