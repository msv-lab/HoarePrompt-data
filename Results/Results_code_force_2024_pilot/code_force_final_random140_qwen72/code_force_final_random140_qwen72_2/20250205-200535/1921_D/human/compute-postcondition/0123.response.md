Postcondition: ***Given `t` is an input integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 99, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 * 10^5, the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from user input, `dif1` is `abs(a[a1] - b[b1])`, `dif2` is `abs(a[a1] - b[b2])`, `dif3` is `abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`, `dif4` is `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`, and `a1` is less than or equal to `a2`. If `dif3 > dif4`, then: if `dif3 > dif1`, `ans` is increased by `abs(a[a2 - 1] - b[b1 - 1])`, `b1` is increased by 1, and `a1` is less than or equal to `a2 - 1`; otherwise, `ans` is increased by `abs(a[a1] - b[b1])`, `a1` is increased by 1, and `b1` is increased by 1. If `dif3 ≤ dif4`, then: if `dif4 > dif1`, `a2` is decreased by 1, `ans` is increased by `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`, and `b2` is decreased by 1; otherwise, `ans` is increased by `abs(a[a1] - b[b1])`, `a1` is incremented by 1, and `b1` is incremented by 1.***
