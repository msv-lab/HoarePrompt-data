The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` was greater than 0, but since the loop has completed all its iterations, `t` must now be 0 or less to indicate the loop has finished. To allow the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`a1` will be greater than `a2`, `ans` will contain the accumulated sum of the maximum absolute differences, `b1` and `b2` will reflect the positions in the list `b` used in the calculations, `t` must be greater than 0, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged**
