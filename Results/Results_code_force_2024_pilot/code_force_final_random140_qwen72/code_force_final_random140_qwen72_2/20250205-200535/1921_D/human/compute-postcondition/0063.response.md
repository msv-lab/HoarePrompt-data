The value of `b2` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `b2` was `m - 1`, so the new value of `b2` is `m - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 99, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 * 10^5, the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from user input, `a1` is 1, `a2` is `n - 1`, `b1` is 0, `b2` is `m - 2`, `ans` is `dif2`, `dif1` is `abs(a[0] - b[0])`, `dif2` is `abs(a[0] - b[m - 1])`, `dif3` is `abs(a[n - 1] - b[0])`, `dif4` is `abs(a[n - 1] - b[m - 1])`, `dif1` is less than or equal to `dif2`, `dif3` is less than or equal to `dif4`, and `dif4` is less than or equal to `dif2`.**
