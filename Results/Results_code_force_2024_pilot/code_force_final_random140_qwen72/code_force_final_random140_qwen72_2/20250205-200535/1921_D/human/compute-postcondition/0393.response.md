Output State: **`a1` is increased by 1, `a2` ensures `a1 <= a2`, `ans` is increased by `dif1`, `b1` is increased by 1, `b2`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `n`, `m`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code snippet `b1 += 1` increments the value of `b1` by 1. All other variables (`a1`, `a2`, `ans`, `b2`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `n`, `m`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4`) remain unchanged from their initial state. The conditions `a1` is increased by 1, `a2` ensures `a1 <= a2`, and `ans` is increased by `dif1` are still valid.
