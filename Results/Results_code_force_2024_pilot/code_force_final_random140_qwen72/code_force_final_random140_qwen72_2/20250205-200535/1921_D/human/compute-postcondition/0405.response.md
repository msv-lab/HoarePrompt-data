Output State: **`a1`, `a2` (decreased by 1), `b1` (increased by 1), `b2`, `ans` is increased by `dif3`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `n`, `m`, `dif1`, `dif2`, and `dif4` remain as described, with `a1` and `a2` ensuring `a1 <= a2`.**

The value of `b1` is incremented by 1, while the values of `a1`, `a2`, `b2`, `ans`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `n`, `m`, `dif1`, `dif2`, and `dif4` remain unchanged. The condition `a1 <= a2` is still maintained.
