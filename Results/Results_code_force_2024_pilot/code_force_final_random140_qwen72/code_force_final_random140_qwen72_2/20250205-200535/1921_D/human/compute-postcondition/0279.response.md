Postcondition: ***`a1` is 0 or 1, `a1` is no longer greater than `a2`, `ans` is the minimum of `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` plus either `dif3` or `dif4` depending on the condition `dif3 > dif4`. If `dif1 > dif2`, `ans` is further incremented by `dif1` if `dif1 > dif3` and `dif1 > dif4`, or by `dif3` if `dif3 > dif4` and `dif3 > dif1`, or by `dif4` if `dif4 > dif1` and `dif4 > dif3`. If `dif1 <= dif2`, `ans` is further incremented by `dif2` if `dif2 > dif3` and `dif2 > dif4`, or by `dif3` if `dif3 > dif4` and `dif3 > dif2`, or by `dif4` if `dif4 > dif2` and `dif4 > dif3`. In all cases, `b1` is 0 or 1, `b2` is `m - 1` or `m - 2` (or `m - 2` or `m - 3` if `dif3 > dif4`), `t` is `t - 1`, `n` and `m` are updated with the new input values, `a` is now a sorted list of integers from the input, `b` is now a sorted list of integers from the new input, `a2` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` (or `n - 2` or `n - 3` if `dif3 > dif4`), and `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.***
