Output State: **`a1` is equal to `a2 + 1`, `ans` is the sum of the minimum differences calculated during each iteration of the loop, `b1` is equal to `b2 + 1`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` and `m` are updated with the new input values, `a` is now a sorted list of integers from the input, `b` is now a sorted list of integers from the new input, `a2` is `n - 1` or less, `b2` is `m - 1` or less, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.**

Explanation:
- The loop continues to execute as long as `a1` is less than or equal to `a2`. After all iterations, `a1` will be one more than `a2`, indicating that the loop has completed its execution.
- `ans` accumulates the minimum differences (`dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, `dif4`) calculated during each iteration of the loop.
- `b1` and `b2` are adjusted based on the conditions within the loop, and after all iterations, `b1` will be one more than `b2`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- `a2` and `b2` are decremented during the loop, so they will be less than or equal to their initial values (`n - 1` and `m - 1`, respectively).
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 to ensure the loop can execute at least once.
