The code snippet `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. This operation modifies the list `a` but does not affect any other variables. The initial state specifies that `a` is a list of integers, and after sorting, `a` remains a list of integers but now in sorted order.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 99, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 * 10^5, the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from user input, `a1` is 0, `a2` is `n - 1`, `b1` is 0, `b2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0.**
