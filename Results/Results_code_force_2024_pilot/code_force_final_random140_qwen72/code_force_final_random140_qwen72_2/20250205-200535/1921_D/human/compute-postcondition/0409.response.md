Postcondition: ***`a1`, `a2`, `b1`, `b2`, `ans`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `n`, `m`, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` remain as described, with `a1` and `a2` ensuring `a1 <= a2`. If `dif3 > dif2`, then `a2` is decreased by 1, `b1` is increased by 1, and `ans` is increased by `dif3`. Otherwise, `a1` is increased by 1, `b2` is decreased by 1, and `ans` is increased by `dif2`.***
