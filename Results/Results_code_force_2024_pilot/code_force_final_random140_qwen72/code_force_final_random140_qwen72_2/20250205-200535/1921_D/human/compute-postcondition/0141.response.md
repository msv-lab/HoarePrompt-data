To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the context provided:

### Initial State:
- `a1` will be greater than `a2`, indicating that all elements in the list `a` have been processed.
- `ans` contains the accumulated sum of the maximum absolute differences calculated during each iteration of the loop.
- `b1` and `b2` reflect the positions in the list `b` that were used in the calculations, but they may not cover all elements of `b`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.

### Explanation:
- The variable `ans` is the key here. It accumulates the sum of the maximum absolute differences between elements of the lists `a` and `b` during the loop.
- Since `a1` is greater than `a2` after the loop, it means that the loop has completed all its iterations, and `ans` contains the final result of the accumulated sum.

### Output:
The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is the accumulated sum of the maximum absolute differences calculated during the loop.

Output: **ans (where ans is the accumulated sum of the maximum absolute differences calculated during the loop)**
