Postcondition: ***`a1`, `a2`, `b1`, `b2`, `ans`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `n`, `m`, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` retain their initial properties as described in the precondition. If `dif3 > dif4`, then `a1` is 0, `a2` is `n - 2`, `ans` is incremented by `abs(a[n - 1] - b[0])`, `b1` is 1, and `b2` is `m - 1`. If `dif4 > dif2`, then `a1` is 0, `a2` is `n - 2`, and `ans` is incremented by `abs(a[n - 1] - b[m - 1])`. Otherwise, if `dif3 <= dif4` and `dif4 <= dif2`, then `a1` is 1, `a2` is `n - 1`, `ans` is incremented by `abs(a[0] - b[m - 1])`, `b1` is 0, and `b2` is `m - 2`. In all cases, `t` is decremented by 2, and the relationships between `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` remain unchanged.***
