Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 99, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 * 10^5, the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from user input, `a1` is 0, `a2` is `n - 1`, `b1` is 0, `b2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `dif1` is `abs(a[0] - b[0])`, `dif2` is `abs(a[0] - b[m - 1])`, `dif3` is `abs(a[n - 1] - b[0])`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `dif3 = abs(a[a2] - b[b1])` calculates the absolute difference between the last element of list `a` (which is `a[n - 1]` since `a2` is `n - 1`) and the first element of list `b` (which is `b[0]` since `b1` is 0).
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
