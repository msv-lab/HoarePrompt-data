Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 99, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 * 10^5, the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from user input, `dif1` is `abs(a[a1] - b[b1])`, `dif2` is `abs(a[a1] - b[b2])`, `dif3` is `abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`, `dif4` is `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`, `a1` is less than or equal to `a2`.**

Explanation: The code snippet updates the value of `dif1` to be the absolute difference between the elements `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged. The new value of `dif1` is specifically calculated as `abs(a[a1] - b[b1])`.
