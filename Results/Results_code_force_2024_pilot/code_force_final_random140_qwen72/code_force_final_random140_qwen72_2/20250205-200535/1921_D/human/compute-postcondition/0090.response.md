The code snippet `ans += dif2` updates the value of `ans` by adding the value of `dif2` to it. Here’s the detailed impact:

- `ans` is updated to `ans + dif2`.
- `dif2` is defined as `abs(a[a1] - b[b2])`.

All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `dif1`, `dif3`, `dif4`, `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, `b2`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is an input integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 99, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 * 10^5, the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from user input, `dif1` is `abs(a[a1] - b[b1])`, `dif2` is `abs(a[a1] - b[b2])`, `dif3` is `abs(a[a2] - b[b1])`, `dif4` is `abs(a[a2] - b[b2])`, `a1` is less than or equal to `a2`, `b1` and `b2` are as set in the if-else block, `ans` is now `ans + abs(a[a1] - b[b2])`.**
