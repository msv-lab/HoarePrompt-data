Output State: **`a1` is 0, `a2` is `n - 1`, `ans` is the sum of the minimum differences calculated during each iteration of the loop, `b1` is 0, `b2` is `m - 1` or less, `t` is `t - 2`, `a` is now a sorted list of integers from the new input, `b` is now a list of integers from the new input, `n` is updated with a new input value, `m` is updated with a new input value, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `t` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation:
- The variable `b1` is set to 0.
- All other variables (`a1`, `a2`, `ans`, `b2`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `n`, `m`) retain their initial values or conditions.
