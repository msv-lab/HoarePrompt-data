Reasoning:

The program aims to maximize the total difference \( D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i| \) where \( c_i \) is a subset of \( b_i \) arranged in a specific order. The approach taken by the program involves sorting both arrays \( a \) and \( b \) and then selecting the elements from \( b \) that maximize the absolute difference with the corresponding elements in \( a \).

Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases \( t \) and then processing each test case individually.
2. **Sorting**: Both arrays \( a \) and \( b \) are sorted. Sorting helps in efficiently finding the maximum possible difference between elements of \( a \) and \( b \).
3. **Difference Calculation**: The program uses four variables to keep track of the current indices in the sorted arrays \( a \) and \( b \) (`a1`, `a2`, `b1`, `b2`). It calculates the absolute differences between the current elements of \( a \) and the smallest and largest elements of \( b \) (`dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, `dif4`).
4. **Maximizing Differences**: The program compares these differences and selects the maximum one to add to the total difference `ans`. It updates the indices accordingly to ensure that the next comparison is made with the next elements in the sorted arrays.
5. **Output**: After processing all elements in \( a \), the program prints the total difference `ans`.

The logic is sound and follows the correct approach to maximize the total difference. The program ensures that the selected elements from \( b \) are used optimally to achieve the highest possible difference with the elements in \( a \).

Given the problem constraints and the execution summary, the program appears to handle all edge cases and provides the correct output for the given examples.
