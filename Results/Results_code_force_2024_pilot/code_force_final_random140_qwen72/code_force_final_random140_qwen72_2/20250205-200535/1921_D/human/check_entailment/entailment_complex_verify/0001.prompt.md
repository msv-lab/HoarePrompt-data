You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Petya has an array a_i of n integers. His brother Vasya became envious and
decided to make his own array of n integers.

To do this, he found m integers b_i (m\ge n ), and now he wants to choose some
n integers of them and arrange them in a certain order to obtain an array c_i
of length n .

To avoid being similar to his brother, Vasya wants to make his array as
different as possible from Petya's array. Specifically, he wants the total
difference D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i| to be as large as possible.

Help Vasya find the maximum difference D he can obtain.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by a
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n\le m\le
2 \cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_i (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ).
The third line of each test case contains m integers b_i (1\le b_i\le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that in a test, the sum of m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum total difference D
that can be obtained.

Note

In the first example, Vasya can, for example, create the array (1, 5, 7, 2) .
Then the total difference will be D = |6-1|+|1-5|+|2-7|+|4-2| = 5+4+5+2 = 16 .

In the second example, all the integers available to Vasya are equal to 1, so
he can only create the array (1, 1, 1) , for which the difference D = 0 .

In the third example, Vasya can, for example, create the array (5, 4, 3, 2, 1)
. Then the total difference will be D = |1-5|+|2-4|+|3-3|+|4-2|+|5-1| =
4+2+0+2+4 = 12 .

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases. It takes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 * 10^5), followed by two lists of integers `a` and `b` (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9). The function calculates the maximum absolute difference between elements of `a` and `b` in a way that maximizes the sum of these differences. After processing all test cases, it prints the accumulated sum of these maximum differences for each test case. The original values of `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` for each test case remain unchanged.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`, followed by the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Sorting Arrays**: Both arrays `a` and `b` are sorted. Sorting is a crucial step because it allows us to consider the largest and smallest elements in both arrays to maximize the absolute differences.

3. **Two-Pointer Approach**: The program uses a two-pointer approach to iterate through the sorted arrays `a` and `b`. The pointers `a1` and `a2` are used to traverse array `a` from both ends, while `b1` and `b2` are used to traverse array `b` from both ends.

4. **Maximizing Differences**: For each element in array `a`, the program calculates four possible differences:
   - `dif1`: Difference between the current element in `a` (from the start) and the smallest element in `b`.
   - `dif2`: Difference between the current element in `a` (from the start) and the largest element in `b`.
   - `dif3`: Difference between the current element in `a` (from the end) and the smallest element in `b`.
   - `dif4`: Difference between the current element in `a` (from the end) and the largest element in `b`.

5. **Choosing the Maximum Difference**: The program then selects the maximum of these four differences and adds it to the total difference `ans`. It updates the pointers accordingly to ensure that the next comparison is made with the next elements in the arrays.

6. **Output**: After processing all elements in array `a`, the program prints the total difference `ans`.

### Correctness:
The program follows a logical and efficient approach to solve the problem. It correctly handles the input, sorts the arrays, and uses a two-pointer technique to maximize the total difference. The logic for choosing the maximum difference and updating the pointers is sound.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
