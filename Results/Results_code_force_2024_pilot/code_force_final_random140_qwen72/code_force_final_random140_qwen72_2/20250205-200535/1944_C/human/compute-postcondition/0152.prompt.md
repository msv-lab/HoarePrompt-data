Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 0 ≤ a_i < n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    counter = {}
    for i in arr:
        counter[i] = counter.get(i, 0) + 1
    ans = 0
    once = False
    for i in range(n):
        if counter.get(i, 0) == 0:
            ans = i
            break
        elif counter.get(i, 0) == 1 and not once:
            once = True
            ans = i + 1
        elif counter.get(i, 0) == 1:
            ans = i
            break
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `counter` contains each unique element from `arr` with its count representing the number of times it appears in `arr`, `ans` is the smallest index `i` such that `counter.get(i, 0) == 0` or the smallest index `i` such that `counter.get(i, 0) == 1` and `once` is True, or the smallest index `i` such that `counter.get(i, 0) == 1` and `once` is False, `once` is True if there was at least one unique element in `arr` that appeared exactly once.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is the input integer, `arr` is a list of integers from the new input, `counter` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `arr` and the value is the count of how many times that element appears in `arr`, `ans` is the index of the first unique element in `arr` (or the index of the second unique element if the first one was already found), and `once` is True if a unique element has been encountered at least once. If no unique elements are found, `ans` remains 0 and `once` remains False.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After all iterations, `t` is greater than 0 but will be decremented by 1, `n` is the new input integer, `arr` is a list of integers from the new input, `counter` now contains the count of each element in `arr`, `i` is `n-1`. If the loop did not break early, `ans` will be the smallest index `i` such that `counter.get(i, 0) == 0` or the smallest index `i` such that `counter.get(i, 0) == 1` and `once` was initially False. If no such index exists, `ans` remains 0 and `once` remains False.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
