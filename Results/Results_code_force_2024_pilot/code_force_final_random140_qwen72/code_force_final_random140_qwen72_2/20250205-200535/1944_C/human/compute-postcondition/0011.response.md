Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `counter` now contains each unique element from `arr` with its count representing the number of times it appears in `arr`.**

This means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the `counter` dictionary will have keys corresponding to each unique integer in the `arr` list, and the value associated with each key will be the number of times that integer appears in the `arr` list. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `arr`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
