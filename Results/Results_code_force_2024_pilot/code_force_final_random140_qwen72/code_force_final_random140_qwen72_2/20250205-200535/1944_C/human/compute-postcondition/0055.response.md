To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for i in arr:
```

The only object in the loop head is `arr`, and the loop will execute if `arr` is not empty. The variable `i` will take on each value in `arr` during each iteration of the loop.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `n` is an input integer
- `arr` is a list of integers from the new input
- `counter` is an empty dictionary
- `ans` is the smallest index `i` such that `counter.get(i, 0) == 0` or the smallest index `i` such that `counter.get(i, 0) == 1` and `once` is True, or the smallest index `i` such that `counter.get(i, 0) == 1` and `once` is False
- `once` is True if there was at least one unique element in the old `arr` that appeared exactly once

To ensure the loop executes, `arr` must contain at least one element. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `arr` is not empty.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers from the new input and must have at least one element, `counter` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is the smallest index `i` such that `counter.get(i, 0) == 0` or the smallest index `i` such that `counter.get(i, 0) == 1` and `once` is True, or the smallest index `i` such that `counter.get(i, 0) == 1` and `once` is False, `once` is True if there was at least one unique element in the old `arr` that appeared exactly once**
