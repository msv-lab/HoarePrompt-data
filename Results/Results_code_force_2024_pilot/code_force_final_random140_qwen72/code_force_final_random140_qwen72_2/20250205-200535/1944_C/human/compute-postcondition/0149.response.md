Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0 but will be decremented by 1, `n` must be greater than 2, `arr` is a list of integers from the new input, `counter` now contains the count of each element in `arr`, `i` is 2. If `counter.get(i, 0) == 0`, then `ans` is 1 and `once` remains False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `counter.get(i, 0) == 1` and `once` is False, then `ans` is 2 and `once` is set to True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `counter.get(i, 0) == 1` and `once` is already True, then `ans` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `once` remains False.***
