Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `counter` contains each unique element from `arr` with its count representing the number of times it appears in `arr`, `i` is 1, `once` is True, `ans` is 2.**

The value of `ans` is now 2, which is the result of adding 1 to the value of `i` (which was 1). All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
