Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `counter` contains each unique element from `arr` with its count representing the number of times it appears in `arr`, `i` is 1, `ans` is 1.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `i` (which is 1) to the variable `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions plus the new value of `ans`.
