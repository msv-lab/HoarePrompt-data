Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 but will be decremented by 1, `n` is the new input integer, `arr` is a list of integers from the new input, `counter` now contains the count of each element in `arr`, `ans` is 0, `once` is False.**

Explanation: The variable `once` is set to False, overriding its previous value. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `arr`, `counter`, `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
