Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0 but will be decremented by 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `arr` is a list of integers from the new input, `counter` now contains the count of each element in `arr`, `i` is 1. If `counter.get(i, 0) == 1` and `once` is False, then `ans` is 2 and `once` is True. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `once` is False. If `counter.get(i, 0) == 1`, then `ans` is set to 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
