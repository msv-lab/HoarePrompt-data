To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0 but will be decremented by 1.
   - `n` is a new input integer.
   - `arr` is a list of integers from the new input.
   - `counter` contains the count of each element in `arr`.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - If the loop did not break early, `ans` will be the smallest index `i` such that `counter.get(i, 0) == 0` or the smallest index `i` such that `counter.get(i, 0) == 1` and `once` was initially False.
   - If no such index exists, `ans` remains 0 and `once` remains False.

2. **Understanding the Conditions:**
   - The key variable here is `ans`, which is determined based on the counts in the `counter` dictionary.
   - `ans` will be set to the smallest index `i` where the count of `i` in `arr` is either 0 or 1 (and `once` was initially False).
   - If no such index exists, `ans` remains 0.

3. **Possible Scenarios:**
   - If there is an index `i` in `arr` where `counter.get(i, 0) == 0` or `counter.get(i, 0) == 1` and `once` was initially False, `ans` will be set to that index.
   - If no such index exists, `ans` will remain 0.

Given these conditions, the `print(ans)` statement will output the value of `ans` based on the above logic.

Output: **ans (where ans is the smallest index i such that counter.get(i, 0) == 0 or counter.get(i, 0) == 1 and once was initially False, or 0 if no such index exists)**
