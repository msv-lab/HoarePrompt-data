The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is an input integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `counter` contains each unique element from `arr` with its count representing the number of times it appears in `arr`, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
