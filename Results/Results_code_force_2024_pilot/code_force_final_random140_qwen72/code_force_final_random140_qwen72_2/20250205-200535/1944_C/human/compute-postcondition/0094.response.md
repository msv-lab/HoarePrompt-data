Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `arr` is a list of integers from the new input, `counter` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `arr` and the value is the count of how many times that element appears in `arr`, `i` is 2, `once` is True, `ans` is 3.** 

The value of `ans` is calculated as `i + 1`, which is `2 + 1`, resulting in `ans` being 3. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
