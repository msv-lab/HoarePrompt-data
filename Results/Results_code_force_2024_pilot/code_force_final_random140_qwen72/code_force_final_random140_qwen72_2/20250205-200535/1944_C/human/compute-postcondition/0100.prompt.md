Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers from the new input, `counter` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `arr` and the value is the count of how many times that element appears in `arr`, `ans` is 0, `once` is False.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if counter.get(i, 0) == 0:
        ans = i
        break
    elif counter.get(i, 0) == 1 and not once:
        once = True
        ans = i + 1
    elif counter.get(i, 0) == 1:
        ans = i
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers from the new input, `counter` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `arr` and the value is the count of how many times that element appears in `arr`, `i` is 0. If `counter.get(i, 0)` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `counter.get(i, 0)` is 1 and `once` is False, then `ans` is set to 1, `once` is set to True, and `counter.get(i, 0)` is 1. If `counter.get(i, 0)` is 1 and `once` is already True, `ans` is set to `i`, `once` remains True, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `counter.get(i, 0)` is not equal to 1, `ans` remains 0, `once` remains False, and the conditions remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `arr` is a list of integers from the new input, `counter` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `arr` and the value is the count of how many times that element appears in `arr`, `i` is 1, and the conditions remain unchanged. If `counter.get(i, 0) == 0`, then `ans` is set to 1 and `once` remains False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `counter.get(i, 0) == 1` and `once` is False, then `ans` is set to 2 and `once` is set to True. If `counter.get(i, 0) == 1` and `once` is already True, then `ans` is set to 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `counter.get(i, 0) > 1`, then `ans` remains 0 and `once` remains False.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `arr` is a list of integers from the new input, `counter` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `arr` and the value is the count of how many times that element appears in `arr`, `i` is 2, and the conditions remain unchanged. If `counter.get(i, 0) == 0`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `counter.get(i, 0) == 1` and `once` is False, then `once` is set to True and `ans` is set to 3. If `counter.get(i, 0) == 1` and `once` is already True, then `ans` is set to 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
