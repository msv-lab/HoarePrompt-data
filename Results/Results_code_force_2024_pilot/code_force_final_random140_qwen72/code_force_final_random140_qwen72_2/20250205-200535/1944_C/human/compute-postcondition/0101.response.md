To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic leading up to the print statement:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `arr` is a list of integers from the new input.
   - `counter` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `arr` and the value is the count of how many times that element appears in `arr`.
   - `ans` is the index of the first unique element in `arr` (or the index of the second unique element if the first one was already found).
   - `once` is True if a unique element has been encountered at least once. If no unique elements are found, `ans` remains 0 and `once` remains False.

2. **Logic:**
   - The `counter` dictionary is used to count the occurrences of each element in `arr`.
   - The `ans` variable is set to the index of the first unique element in `arr`. If the first unique element is found, `once` is set to True.
   - If the first unique element is found, the code continues to look for the second unique element. If a second unique element is found, `ans` is updated to the index of this second unique element.
   - If no unique elements are found, `ans` remains 0 and `once` remains False.

3. **Output Determination:**
   - The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`.
   - `ans` will be the index of the first unique element in `arr` if one exists.
   - If the first unique element is found and there is a second unique element, `ans` will be the index of the second unique element.
   - If no unique elements are found, `ans` will remain 0.

Given the initial state and the logic described, the output will be:

Output: **ans (where ans is the index of the first unique element in arr, or the index of the second unique element if the first one was already found, or 0 if no unique elements are found)**
