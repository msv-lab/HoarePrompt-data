Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `counter` contains each unique element from `arr` with its count representing the number of times it appears in `arr`, `ans` is the smallest index `i` such that `counter.get(i, 0) == 0` or the smallest index `i` such that `counter.get(i, 0) == 1` and `once` is True, or the smallest index `i` such that `counter.get(i, 0) == 1` and `once` is False, `once` is True if there was at least one unique element in `arr` that appeared exactly once.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the range from 0 to `n-1`.
- For each iteration, the loop checks the value of `counter.get(i, 0)`.
  - If `counter.get(i, 0) == 0`, it sets `ans` to `i` and breaks out of the loop.
  - If `counter.get(i, 0) == 1` and `once` is False, it sets `ans` to `i + 1`, sets `once` to True, and continues.
  - If `counter.get(i, 0) == 1` and `once` is already True, it sets `ans` to `i` and breaks out of the loop.
  - If `counter.get(i, 0) > 1`, it does nothing and continues to the next iteration.
- After all iterations, `ans` will be the smallest index `i` that meets one of the conditions above, and `once` will be True if there was at least one unique element in `arr` that appeared exactly once.
