Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `counter` contains each unique element from `arr` with its count representing the number of times it appears in `arr`, `i` is 1. If `counter.get(i, 0) == 1`, then `ans` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
