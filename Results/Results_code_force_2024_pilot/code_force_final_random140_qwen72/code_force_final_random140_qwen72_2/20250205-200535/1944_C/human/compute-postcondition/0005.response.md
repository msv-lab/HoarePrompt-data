To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `arr`. The loop will execute if `arr` contains at least one element. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `counter`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given that `arr` is a list of integers from the input, for the loop to execute, `arr` must contain at least one integer. The variable `i` will take the value of the first element in `arr` at the start of the first iteration.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted as follows:

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least one element, `counter` is an empty dictionary, `i` is the first element in `arr`**
