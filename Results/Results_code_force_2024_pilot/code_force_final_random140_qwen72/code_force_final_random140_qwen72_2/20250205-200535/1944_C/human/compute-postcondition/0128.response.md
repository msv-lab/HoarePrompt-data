Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0 but will be decremented by 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers from the new input, `counter` now contains the count of each element in `arr`, `i` is 0, and the count of `i` in `counter` is greater than 0. If `counter.get(i, 0)` is exactly 1 and `once` is False, then `ans` is set to `i + 1`, `once` becomes True, and the state of other variables remains unchanged. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0, `once` remains False, and if `counter.get(i, 0)` is exactly 1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
