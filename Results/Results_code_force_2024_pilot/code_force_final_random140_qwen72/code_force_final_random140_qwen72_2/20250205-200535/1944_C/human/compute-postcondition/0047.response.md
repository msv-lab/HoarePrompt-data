Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `counter` contains each unique element from `arr` with its count representing the number of times it appears in `arr`, `i` is 2. If `counter.get(i, 0) == 1` and `once` is initially False, then `once` becomes True and `ans` is set to 2. If `counter.get(i, 0) == 1` and `once` is already True, then `ans` is set to 1, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If `counter.get(i, 0) != 1`, the state remains unchanged.***
