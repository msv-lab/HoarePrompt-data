To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `arr` is a list of integers from the input.
   - `counter` is a dictionary where each key is a unique element from `arr` and the value is the count of how many times it appears in `arr`.
   - `ans` is determined based on the following conditions:
     - The smallest index `i` such that `counter.get(i, 0) == 0`.
     - If no such index exists, then the smallest index `i` such that `counter.get(i, 0) == 1` and `once` is True.
     - If no such index exists, then the smallest index `i` such that `counter.get(i, 0) == 1` and `once` is False.
   - `once` is True if there was at least one unique element in `arr` that appeared exactly once.

2. **Determine `ans`:**
   - First, check if there is any index `i` in `counter` where `counter.get(i, 0) == 0`. This means the element `i` does not appear in `arr`.
   - If no such index exists, check if there is any index `i` in `counter` where `counter.get(i, 0) == 1` and `once` is True. This means the element `i` appears exactly once in `arr` and there is at least one unique element in `arr` that appears exactly once.
   - If no such index exists, check if there is any index `i` in `counter` where `counter.get(i, 0) == 1` and `once` is False. This means the element `i` appears exactly once in `arr` but there is no unique element in `arr` that appears exactly once.

3. **Output:**
   - The value of `ans` will be the smallest index `i` that satisfies one of the above conditions.

Given the initial state and the logic, the output will be the smallest index `i` that meets the criteria described. Since the exact values of `arr` and `counter` are not provided, we can only describe the output in general terms.

Output: **ans (where ans is the smallest index i such that counter.get(i, 0) == 0, or the smallest index i such that counter.get(i, 0) == 1 and once is True, or the smallest index i such that counter.get(i, 0) == 1 and once is False)**
