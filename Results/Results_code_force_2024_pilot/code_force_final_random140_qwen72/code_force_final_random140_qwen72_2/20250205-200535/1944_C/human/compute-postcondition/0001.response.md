To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `_` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder used to indicate that the loop variable is not used within the loop body, and it starts from 0 by default.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4.

For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1. The placeholder `_` does not need to be explicitly set as it is handled by the `range` function.

Therefore, the adjusted state should ensure that `t` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
