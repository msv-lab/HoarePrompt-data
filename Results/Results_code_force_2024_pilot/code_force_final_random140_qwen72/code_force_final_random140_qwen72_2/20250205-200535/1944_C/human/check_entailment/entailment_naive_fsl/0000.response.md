Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. Specifically, the program fails to consider the optimal moves for both players in all scenarios. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the issue:

1. **Optimal Strategy Consideration**: The program does not explicitly simulate the turns of Alice and Bob. Instead, it tries to determine the MEX value directly by checking the counts of elements. This approach might work in some cases but fails to capture the dynamic nature of the game where each player's move affects the outcome.

2. **Edge Case Failure**: Consider the following test case:
   ```
   Input:
   1
   5
   0 1 2 2 3
   ```
   The optimal play would be:
   - Alice picks 2 (c = [2], a = [0, 1, 2, 3])
   - Bob picks 0 (c = [2], a = [1, 2, 3])
   - Alice picks 1 (c = [2, 1], a = [2, 3])
   - Bob picks 2 (c = [2, 1], a = [3])
   - Alice picks 3 (c = [2, 1, 3], a = [])
   
   The final array `c` is `[2, 1, 3]`, and its MEX is `0`.

   However, the program will output `4` because it incorrectly assumes that the MEX can be determined without simulating the game.

3. **Algorithmic Flaw**: The program uses a dictionary to count occurrences of elements and then tries to determine the MEX based on these counts. This approach does not account for the strategic choices of Alice and Bob. For example, Alice might choose an element that forces Bob into a suboptimal position, which the current program does not simulate.

To correctly solve this problem, a more sophisticated approach is needed, such as simulating the game or using a more advanced algorithm to determine the optimal moves for both players. The current program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
