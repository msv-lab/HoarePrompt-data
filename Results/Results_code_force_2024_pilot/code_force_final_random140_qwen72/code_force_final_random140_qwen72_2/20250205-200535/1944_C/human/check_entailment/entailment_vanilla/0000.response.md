Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns removing elements from an array `a` and appending them to another array `c`. The goal is to determine the MEX (Minimum EXcludant) of the array `c` after all elements have been removed from `a`, assuming both players play optimally. Alice aims to maximize the MEX, while Bob aims to minimize it.

2. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice will always try to append the smallest missing number to `c` to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob will try to prevent Alice from achieving this by removing the smallest available number that Alice might need.

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr`.
   - It creates a counter dictionary to count the occurrences of each element in `arr`.
   - It initializes `ans` to 0 and a boolean `once` to track if a number has appeared exactly once.
   - It iterates through the numbers from 0 to `n-1`:
     - If a number `i` is not present in the array (`counter.get(i, 0) == 0`), it sets `ans` to `i` and breaks the loop.
     - If a number `i` appears exactly once and `once` is `False`, it sets `once` to `True` and updates `ans` to `i + 1`.
     - If a number `i` appears exactly once and `once` is `True`, it sets `ans` to `i` and breaks the loop.
   - Finally, it prints the value of `ans`.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly identifies the smallest missing number in the array `arr` and handles the case where a number appears exactly once.
   - The logic ensures that Alice and Bob play optimally by considering the smallest missing number and the presence of unique numbers.
   - The program efficiently handles multiple test cases and large input sizes within the constraints.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
