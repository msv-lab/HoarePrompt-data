Reasoning:  
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for determining the MEX value of the array `c` after both players, Alice and Bob, have played optimally. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles multiple test cases, reading the number of test cases `t` and then iterating over each test case.

2. **Counting Elements**: For each test case, the program counts the occurrences of each element in the input array `arr` using a dictionary `counter`.

3. **Determining the MEX**:
   - The program iterates through the numbers from 0 to `n-1` to find the MEX.
   - If a number `i` is not present in the array (`counter.get(i, 0) == 0`), it sets `ans` to `i` and breaks out of the loop, as this is the smallest non-negative integer not in the array.
   - If a number `i` is present exactly once and `once` is `False`, it sets `once` to `True` and continues. This ensures that the first unique number is considered for the MEX.
   - If a number `i` is present exactly once and `once` is already `True`, it sets `ans` to `i` and breaks out of the loop, as this is the next smallest non-negative integer that can be considered for the MEX.

4. **Output**: The program prints the determined MEX value for each test case.

The logic correctly accounts for the optimal strategies of both players:
- Alice will try to maximize the MEX by choosing elements that help in forming a higher MEX.
- Bob will try to minimize the MEX by choosing elements that prevent Alice from forming a higher MEX.

Given the constraints and the problem description, the program correctly implements the required logic and produces the expected output.

Correctness: **True**
