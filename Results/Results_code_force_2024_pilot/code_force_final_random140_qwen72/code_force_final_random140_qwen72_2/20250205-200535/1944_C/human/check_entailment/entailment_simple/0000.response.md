Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually by reading the integer `n` and the list `arr`.

2. **Counting Elements**: It uses a dictionary `counter` to count the occurrences of each element in the array `arr`. This is necessary to determine the MEX value and to implement the optimal strategy for both players.

3. **Optimal Strategy Implementation**:
   - The program iterates through the numbers from `0` to `n-1` to find the MEX.
   - If a number `i` is not present in the array (`counter.get(i, 0) == 0`), it sets `ans` to `i` and breaks out of the loop. This is correct because the MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not in the array.
   - If a number `i` appears exactly once and `once` is `False`, it sets `once` to `True` and continues. This is part of the strategy to ensure that Alice can pick the smallest possible number that appears only once, maximizing the MEX.
   - If a number `i` appears exactly once and `once` is already `True`, it sets `ans` to `i` and breaks out of the loop. This ensures that Bob can minimize the MEX by picking the next smallest number that appears only once.

4. **Output**: The program prints the final score `ans` for each test case, which is the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where all elements in the array are unique or all elements are the same.
   - It also handles the case where the array is empty (though the problem guarantees at least one element).

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly implement the optimal strategy for both players and computes the MEX of the resulting array `c`.

Correctness: **True**
