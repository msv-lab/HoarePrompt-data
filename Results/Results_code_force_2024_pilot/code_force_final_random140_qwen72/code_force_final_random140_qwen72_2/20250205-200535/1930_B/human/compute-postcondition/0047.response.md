Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `a` must be greater than 1, `i` remains as it was initially (either `a + 1` if `a` is even or `a` if `a` is odd), `p` is a list containing all even numbers from 2 up to and including `a` if `a` is even, or up to `a - 1` if `a` is odd, and now includes the value of `i` at the end.**
