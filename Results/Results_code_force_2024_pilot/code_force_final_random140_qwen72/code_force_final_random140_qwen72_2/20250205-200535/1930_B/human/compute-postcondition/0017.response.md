To determine what will be printed by the `print(*p)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the construction of the list `p`.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `a` is equal to `t`.
- `i` is the last odd number less than or equal to `t`.
- `p` is a list containing:
  - All even numbers from 2 up to and including the last even number less than or equal to `t`.
  - Followed by all odd numbers from 1 up to and including the last odd number less than or equal to `t`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the last odd number `i`**:
   - If `t` is odd, then `i = t`.
   - If `t` is even, then `i = t - 1`.

2. **Construct the list `p`**:
   - **Even numbers**: Start from 2 and go up to the largest even number less than or equal to `t`.
   - **Odd numbers**: Start from 1 and go up to the largest odd number less than or equal to `t`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's consider a specific value for `t` to illustrate the process. Suppose `t = 10`:
- The last odd number `i` is 9.
- The even numbers from 2 to 10 are: `[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]`.
- The odd numbers from 1 to 9 are: `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`.

Thus, the list `p` would be:
\[ p = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9] \]

### General Case:
For any given `t`:
- The even numbers in `p` will be: `[2, 4, 6, ..., t]` if `t` is even, or `[2, 4, 6, ..., t-1]` if `t` is odd.
- The odd numbers in `p` will be: `[1, 3, 5, ..., t]` if `t` is odd, or `[1, 3, 5, ..., t-1]` if `t` is even.

### Final Output:
The `print(*p)` statement will print all the elements of the list `p` separated by spaces. Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **2 4 6 ... (last even number) 1 3 5 ... (last odd number)**

Where:
- The "last even number" is the largest even number less than or equal to `t`.
- The "last odd number" is the largest odd number less than or equal to `t`.

This output will vary depending on the specific value of `t`, but it will always follow the pattern described above.
