To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3.
- `a` is the first integer from the input.
- `i` is `a + 1` if `a` is even or `a` if `a` is odd.
- `p` is an empty list.
- The input value to the `range` function must be greater than `i`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(2, a + 1, 2):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The variables in the loop head are `i`, `a`, and the parameters of the `range` function (`start`, `stop`, `step`).
2. **Range Function Parameters**:
   - `start` is 2.
   - `stop` is `a + 1`.
   - `step` is 2.

3. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will execute if `start < stop`.
   - Therefore, `2 < a + 1` must be true, which simplifies to `a > 1`.

4. **Initial State of `i`**:
   - `i` is `a + 1` if `a` is even.
   - `i` is `a` if `a` is odd.
   - However, the loop variable `i` is redefined within the loop, so the initial value of `i` outside the loop does not affect the loop's execution.

5. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - To ensure the loop executes, `a` must be greater than 1.
   - The initial value of `i` outside the loop is irrelevant to the loop's execution, so it does not need to be adjusted.

### Final State:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3.
- `a` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is `a + 1` if `a` is even or `a` if `a` is odd (but this is not relevant to the loop's execution).
- `p` is an empty list.

### Adjusted State:
State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `a` must be greater than 1, `i` is `a + 1` if `a` is even or `a` if `a` is odd, `p` is an empty list**
