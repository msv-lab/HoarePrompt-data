To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop:

```python
for i in range(2, a + 1, 2):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head involves the variables `i` and `a`.
   - The loop will iterate over the range starting from 2, up to (but not including) `a + 1`, with a step of 2.

2. **Determine the Conditions for the Loop to Execute:**
   - For the loop to execute at least once, the range must contain at least one value.
   - This means that the starting value (2) must be less than the ending value (`a + 1`).

3. **Adjust the States:**
   - The variable `i` is initialized to 0, but it will be set to 2 when the loop starts.
   - The variable `a` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute (since the loop starts at 2 and goes up to `a + 1`).

### Conclusion:
- The state of `i` should be adjusted to 2.
- The state of `a` should be adjusted to ensure it is at least 2.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `i` is 2, `a` is equal to `t` and must be at least 2, `p` is an empty list.**
