Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, representing the length of the permutation p.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    a = [int(i) for i in input().split()][0]
    p = []
    for i in range(2, a + 1, 2):
        p += [i]
    for i in range(1, a + 1, 2):
        p += [i]
    print(*p)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `a` is equal to `t`, `i` is the last odd number less than or equal to `t`, and `p` is a list containing all even numbers from 2 up to and including the last even number less than or equal to `t`, followed by all odd numbers from 1 up to and including the last odd number less than or equal to `t`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `a` must be at least 2, `i` is `a` if `a` is even or `a - 1` if `a` is odd, `p` is a list of all even numbers from 2 up to and including `a` if `a` is even, or up to `a - 1` if `a` is odd, followed by all odd numbers from 1 up to and including `a` if `a` is odd, or up to `a - 1` if `a` is even.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `a` must be greater than 1, `i` is the final value of `i` after the loop completes, which is `a` if `a` is odd or `a + 1` if `a` is even, `p` is a list containing all even numbers from 2 up to and including `a` if `a` is even, or up to `a - 1` if `a` is odd, followed by all odd numbers from 1 up to and including `a` if `a` is odd, or up to `a - 1` if `a` is even.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
