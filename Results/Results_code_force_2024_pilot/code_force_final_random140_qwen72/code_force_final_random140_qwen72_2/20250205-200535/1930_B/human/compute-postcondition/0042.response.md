The code snippet `p += [i]` appends the value of `i` to the list `p`. Given the initial state, `p` initially contains `[i]`, and after executing the code, `p` will contain `[i, i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `a` must be greater than 1, `i` is `a + 2` if `a` is odd, `p` is a list containing `[i, i]`**.
