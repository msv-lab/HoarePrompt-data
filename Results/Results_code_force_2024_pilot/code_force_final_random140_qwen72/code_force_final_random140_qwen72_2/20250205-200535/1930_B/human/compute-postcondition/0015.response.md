The code snippet `p += [i]` appends the current value of `i` to the list `p`. Since `i` is the next odd number after the current `i` (i.e., `i + 2`), and `p` initially contains the value of `i`, after appending, `p` will contain two elements: the original value of `i` and the new value of `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `a` is equal to `t` and must be at least 1, `i` is the next odd number after the current `i` (i.e., `i + 2`), `p` is a list containing the original value of `i` and the new value of `i` (i.e., `[i, i + 2]`).**
