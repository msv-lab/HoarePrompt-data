Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
1. **`t`**: An integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\). This variable is not directly used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for now.
2. **`a`**: Must be at least 2.
3. **`i`**: 
   - If `a` is even, `i` is `a`.
   - If `a` is odd, `i` is `a - 1`.
4. **`p`**: A list constructed as follows:
   - If `a` is even, `p` contains all even numbers from 2 up to and including `a`, followed by all odd numbers from 1 up to and including `a - 1`.
   - If `a` is odd, `p` contains all even numbers from 2 up to and including `a - 1`, followed by all odd numbers from 1 up to and including `a`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(*p)
```
This statement will print the elements of the list `p` separated by spaces.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Determine `i`**:
   - If `a` is even, `i = a`.
   - If `a` is odd, `i = a - 1`.

2. **Construct the list `p`**:
   - **If `a` is even**:
     - Even numbers: 2, 4, 6, ..., `a`.
     - Odd numbers: 1, 3, 5, ..., `a - 1`.
   - **If `a` is odd**:
     - Even numbers: 2, 4, 6, ..., `a - 1`.
     - Odd numbers: 1, 3, 5, ..., `a`.

### Example Calculations:
- **If `a = 4`** (even):
  - Even numbers: 2, 4.
  - Odd numbers: 1, 3.
  - `p = [2, 4, 1, 3]`.
  - Output: **2 4 1 3**.

- **If `a = 5`** (odd):
  - Even numbers: 2, 4.
  - Odd numbers: 1, 3, 5.
  - `p = [2, 4, 1, 3, 5]`.
  - Output: **2 4 1 3 5**.

### General Case:
- **If `a` is even**:
  - `p` will contain even numbers from 2 to `a` followed by odd numbers from 1 to `a - 1`.
- **If `a` is odd**:
  - `p` will contain even numbers from 2 to `a - 1` followed by odd numbers from 1 to `a`.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output the elements of the list `p` separated by spaces. The exact elements depend on whether `a` is even or odd, but the pattern is clear.

Output: **[even numbers from 2 to a (if a is even) or a-1 (if a is odd)] [odd numbers from 1 to a-1 (if a is even) or a (if a is odd)]**. 

For example, if `a = 4`, the output will be **2 4 1 3**. If `a = 5`, the output will be **2 4 1 3 5**.
