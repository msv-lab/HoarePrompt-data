The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the context, it seems to process multiple test cases, each involving a permutation of integers. The parameter constraints indicate that the function should handle an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of the permutation `p`.

However, since the function signature does not include these parameters, and the output is not specified, I will assume that the function implicitly processes these inputs and returns results for each test case.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of a permutation. It returns results for each test case, though the specific nature of the results is not detailed in the provided information.**
