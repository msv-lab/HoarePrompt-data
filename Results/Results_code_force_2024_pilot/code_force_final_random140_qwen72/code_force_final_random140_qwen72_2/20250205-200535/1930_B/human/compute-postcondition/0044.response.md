Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `a` must be greater than 1, `i` is `a + 4`, `p` is a list containing `[i, i, i]`**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^3, `a` is greater than 1, `i` is `a + 4`, and `p` is a list containing `[i, i]`.
- The code `p += [i]` appends the value of `i` to the list `p`.
- After executing the code, `p` now contains `[i, i, i]`.
- The values of `t`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged.
