The code snippet `p += [i]` appends the value of `i` to the list `p`. Given the initial conditions, let's analyze the impact:

- `t` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the operation.
- `a` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code.
- `i` is either `a + 1` if `a` is even or `a` if `a` is odd, and this value does not change.
- `p` is initially a list containing all even numbers from 2 up to and including `a` if `a` is even, or up to `a - 1` if `a` is odd. After the code executes, `i` is appended to this list.

Therefore, the updated state of the variables is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `a` must be greater than 1, `i` is either `a + 1` if `a` is even or `a` if `a` is odd, `p` is a list containing all even numbers from 2 up to and including `a` if `a` is even, or up to `a - 1` if `a` is odd, and now includes the value of `i` at the end.**
