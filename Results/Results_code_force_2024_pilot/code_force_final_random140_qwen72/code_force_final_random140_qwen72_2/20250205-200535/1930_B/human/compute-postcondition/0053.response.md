To determine what will be printed by the `print(*p)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the construction of the list `p`:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
   - `a` must be greater than 1.
   - `i` is the final value of `i` after the loop completes, which is `a` if `a` is odd or `a + 1` if `a` is even.
   - `p` is a list containing all even numbers from 2 up to and including `a` if `a` is even, or up to `a - 1` if `a` is odd, followed by all odd numbers from 1 up to and including `a` if `a` is odd, or up to `a - 1` if `a` is even.

2. **Construction of List `p`:**
   - If `a` is even:
     - `p` contains all even numbers from 2 to `a`.
     - Followed by all odd numbers from 1 to `a - 1`.
   - If `a` is odd:
     - `p` contains all even numbers from 2 to `a - 1`.
     - Followed by all odd numbers from 1 to `a`.

3. **Final Value of `i`:**
   - If `a` is odd, `i = a`.
   - If `a` is even, `i = a + 1`.

4. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print(*p)` statement will print the elements of the list `p` separated by spaces.

### Example Scenarios:
- **If `a` is even (e.g., `a = 6`):**
  - Even numbers from 2 to 6: `[2, 4, 6]`.
  - Odd numbers from 1 to 5: `[1, 3, 5]`.
  - `p = [2, 4, 6, 1, 3, 5]`.
  - Output: **2 4 6 1 3 5**.

- **If `a` is odd (e.g., `a = 7`):**
  - Even numbers from 2 to 6: `[2, 4, 6]`.
  - Odd numbers from 1 to 7: `[1, 3, 5, 7]`.
  - `p = [2, 4, 6, 1, 3, 5, 7]`.
  - Output: **2 4 6 1 3 5 7**.

### General Case:
- If `a` is even, the output will be all even numbers from 2 to `a` followed by all odd numbers from 1 to `a - 1`.
- If `a` is odd, the output will be all even numbers from 2 to `a - 1` followed by all odd numbers from 1 to `a`.

### Final Output:
Output: **all even numbers from 2 to a (if a is even) or a-1 (if a is odd), followed by all odd numbers from 1 to a-1 (if a is even) or a (if a is odd)**.
