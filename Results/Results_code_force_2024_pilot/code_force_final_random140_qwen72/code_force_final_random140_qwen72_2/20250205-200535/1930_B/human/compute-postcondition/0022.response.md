The value of `i` is 2, and the code appends this value to the list `p`. Since `p` was initially an empty list, after appending `i`, `p` now contains the single element 2. The other variables (`t` and `a`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `a` must be at least 1, `i` is 2, `p` is [2]**
