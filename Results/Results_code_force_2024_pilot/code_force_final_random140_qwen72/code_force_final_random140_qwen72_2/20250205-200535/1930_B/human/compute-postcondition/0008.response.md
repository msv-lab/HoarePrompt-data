The code snippet `p += [i]` appends the value of `i` to the list `p`. Given the initial state, `i` is 6, and `p` is `[2, 4]`. After appending `i` to `p`, the new value of `p` is `[2, 4, 6]`.

The other variables (`t`, `i`, and `a`) remain unchanged. The value of `t` is still an integer between 1 and 10^3, `i` is still 6, and `a` is still equal to `t` and must be at least 6.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `i` is 6, `a` is equal to `t` and must be at least 6, `p` is `[2, 4, 6]`.**
