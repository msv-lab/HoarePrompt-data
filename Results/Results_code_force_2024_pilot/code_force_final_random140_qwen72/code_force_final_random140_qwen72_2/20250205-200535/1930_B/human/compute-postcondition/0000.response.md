The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and the loop's execution depends on the input value from `input()`. The loop will execute if the input value is greater than 0. Since the state before the loop mentions `t` as the number of test cases, it implies that the input value should be `t` for the loop to iterate through all test cases.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, the input value must be equal to `t`, and `i` should start at 0 (which is the default behavior of `range()`).

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `i` is 0, and the input value must be equal to `t`**
