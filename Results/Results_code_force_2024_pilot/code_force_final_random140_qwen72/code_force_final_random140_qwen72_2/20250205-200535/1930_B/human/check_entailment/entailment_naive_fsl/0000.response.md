Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `n` is odd correctly. Specifically, the program always starts with even numbers and then appends odd numbers, which can lead to invalid permutations for certain values of `n`.

For example, consider the input `n = 5`. The program will generate the permutation `[2, 4, 1, 3, 5]`. However, this permutation is invalid because `p_1 = 2` divides `p_3 = 1` and `p_2 = 4` divides `p_4 = 3`, violating the condition that there should not exist two distinct indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}`.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the generated permutation meets the required conditions for all possible values of `n`.
