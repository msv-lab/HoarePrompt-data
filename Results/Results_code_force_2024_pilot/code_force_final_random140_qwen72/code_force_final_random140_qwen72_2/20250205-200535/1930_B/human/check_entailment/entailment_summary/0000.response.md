Reasoning:  
The program generates a permutation for each test case where the permutation starts with all even numbers followed by all odd numbers. This approach ensures that no two elements \( p_i \) and \( p_j \) (where \( 1 \leq i, j < n \) and \( i \neq j \)) satisfy both \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).

Here's why this works:
1. **Even Numbers First**: By placing all even numbers first, we ensure that the sequence of even numbers does not have any pair \( (p_i, p_{i+1}) \) where \( p_i \) divides \( p_{i+1} \) because the next even number is always larger and not a multiple of the previous one.
2. **Odd Numbers Second**: Similarly, placing all odd numbers after the even numbers ensures that the sequence of odd numbers does not have any pair \( (p_i, p_{i+1}) \) where \( p_i \) divides \( p_{i+1} \) because the next odd number is always larger and not a multiple of the previous one.
3. **No Cross-Divisibility**: Since even numbers are followed by odd numbers, there is no possibility of an even number dividing an odd number or vice versa.

Given these points, the generated permutation meets the problem's requirements. The program correctly handles the input and output format, and the logic for generating the permutation is sound.

Correctness: **True**
