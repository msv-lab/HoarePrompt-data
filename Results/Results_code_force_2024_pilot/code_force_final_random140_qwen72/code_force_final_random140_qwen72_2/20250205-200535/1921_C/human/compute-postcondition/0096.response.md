Output State: **`possible` is True, `arr` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers provided by the user input, `n` is an integer provided by the user input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `f` is `f - min(a * (arr[2] - arr[1]), b)`, `a` is an integer provided by the user input, `b` is an integer provided by the user input, `i` is 3, `time_diff` is `arr[3] - arr[2]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[3] - arr[2])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[2] - arr[1]), b)`**

Explanation:
- The code `energy_turn_off_on = b` assigns the value of `b` to `energy_turn_off_on`.
- Since `b` was already defined as an integer provided by the user input, `energy_turn_off_on` now holds the same value as `b`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
