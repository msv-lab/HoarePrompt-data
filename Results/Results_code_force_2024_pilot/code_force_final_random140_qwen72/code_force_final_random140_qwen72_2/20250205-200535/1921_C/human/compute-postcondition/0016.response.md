Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `f`, `a`, and `b` are integers provided by the user input, `arr` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers provided by the user input, `i` is 2, `time_diff` is `arr[2] - arr[1]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[1] - arr[0])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is the minimum of `a * (arr[1] - arr[0])` and `b`, `f` is `f - energy_cost`, `possible` is True if `f` was greater than `energy_cost` before the subtraction, otherwise `possible` is False and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
