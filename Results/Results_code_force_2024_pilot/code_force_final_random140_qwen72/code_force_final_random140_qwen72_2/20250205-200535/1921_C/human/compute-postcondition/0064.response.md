The code snippet sets `possible` to `False`. This impacts the variable `possible` and changes its value from its initial state to `False`. The values of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `time_diff`, `energy_keep_on`, `energy_turn_off_on`, `energy_cost`, and `f`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user input and must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `time_diff` is `arr[3] - arr[2]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[3] - arr[2])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is the minimum of `a * (arr[3] - arr[2])` and `b`, `f` is unchanged, `possible` is `False`.**
