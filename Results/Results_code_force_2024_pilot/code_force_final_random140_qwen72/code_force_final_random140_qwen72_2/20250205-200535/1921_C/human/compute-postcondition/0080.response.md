Output State: **`possible` is False, `arr` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers provided by the user input, `n` is an integer provided by the user input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `f` is an integer provided by the user input, `a` is an integer provided by the user input, `b` is an integer provided by the user input, `i` is 1, `time_diff` is `arr[1] - arr[0]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[1] - arr[0])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[1] - arr[0]), b)`, and the current value of `f` is less than or equal to the `energy_cost`.** 

The variable `possible` is set to False, while all other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
