Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `f`, `a`, and `b` are integers provided by the user input, `arr` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers provided by the user input, `i` is 2, `time_diff` is `arr[2] - arr[1]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[2] - arr[1])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is the minimum of `a * (arr[2] - arr[1])` and `b`, `f` is `f - energy_cost`. If `f` is less than or equal to `energy_cost`, `possible` is False, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `possible` remains True.***
