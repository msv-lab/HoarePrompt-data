Output State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user input and must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `time_diff` is `arr[2] - arr[1]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[2] - arr[1])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is the minimum of `a * (arr[1] - arr[0])` and `b`, `f` is reduced by the value of `energy_cost`. If `f` is less than or equal to `energy_cost`, `possible` is set to `False`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `energy_turn_off_on = b` reassigns the value of `energy_turn_off_on` to `b`.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `time_diff`, `energy_keep_on`, `energy_cost`, `f`, and `possible`) remain unchanged.
- The condition checking if `f` is less than or equal to `energy_cost` and setting `possible` to `False` is not affected by this assignment, so the state of `possible` remains as it was before the code execution.
- Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions and the updated value of `energy_turn_off_on`.
