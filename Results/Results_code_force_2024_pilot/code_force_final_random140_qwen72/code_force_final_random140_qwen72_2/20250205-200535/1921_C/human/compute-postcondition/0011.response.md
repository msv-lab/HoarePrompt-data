Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `f`, `a`, and `b` are integers provided by the user input, `arr` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers provided by the user input, `possible` is False, `i` is 1, `time_diff` is `arr[1] - arr[0]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[1] - arr[0])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is the minimum of `a * (arr[1] - arr[0])` and `b`. Additionally, the current value of `f` is less than or equal to `energy_cost`.** 

The variable `possible` is set to False, while all other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
