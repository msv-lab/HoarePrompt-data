To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions described:

1. **`possible`**: This variable is True or False depending on whether the loop completed without breaking or not.
2. **`arr`**: Remains the same as it was initially.
3. **`n`**: Remains the same as it was initially.
4. **`f`**: Is reduced by the sum of the `energy_cost` values from each iteration where the loop did not break.
5. **`a`**: Remains the same as it was initially.
6. **`b`**: Remains the same as it was initially.
7. **`i`**: Is `n + 1` if the loop completes without breaking, otherwise it is the value at which `f` became less than or equal to `energy_cost` and the loop broke.
8. **`time_diff`**: Is the last calculated difference between consecutive elements in `arr`.
9. **`energy_keep_on`**: Is the last calculated cost of keeping the device on.
10. **`energy_turn_off_on`**: Is `b`.
11. **`energy_cost`**: Is the last calculated minimum cost.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('YES' if possible else 'NO')
```

This statement checks the value of `possible`:
- If `possible` is `True`, it prints `'YES'`.
- If `possible` is `False`, it prints `'NO'`.

Based on the initial state:
- `possible` is `True` if the loop completed without breaking.
- `possible` is `False` if the loop broke because `f` became less than or equal to `energy_cost`.

Therefore, the output depends on whether the loop completed without breaking or not.

Output: **'YES' if the loop completed without breaking, otherwise 'NO'**.
