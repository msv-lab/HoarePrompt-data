The value of `f` is decremented by `energy_cost`. The value of `energy_cost` is the minimum of `a * (arr[3] - arr[2])` and `b`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. If `f` is less than or equal to `energy_cost` after this operation, `possible` is set to False and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `possible` remains True.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `f` is `f - energy_cost`, `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user input, `arr` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers provided by the user input, `i` is 3, `time_diff` is `arr[3] - arr[2]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[3] - arr[2])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is the minimum of `a * (arr[3] - arr[2])` and `b`, if `f` is less than or equal to `energy_cost` then `possible` is False and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise `possible` remains True.**
