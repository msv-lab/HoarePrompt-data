Output State: **`possible` is True or False depending on whether the loop completed without breaking or not, `arr` remains the same as it was initially, `n` remains the same as it was initially, `f` is reduced by the sum of the `energy_cost` values from each iteration where the loop did not break, `a` remains the same as it was initially, `b` remains the same as it was initially, `i` is `n + 1` if the loop completes without breaking, otherwise `i` is the value at which `f` became less than or equal to `energy_cost` and the loop broke, `time_diff` is the last calculated difference between consecutive elements in `arr`, `energy_keep_on` is the last calculated cost of keeping the device on, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is the last calculated minimum cost.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is as follows:
- The variable `possible` will be `False` if the loop broke due to `f` becoming less than or equal to `energy_cost` at any point, otherwise, it will remain `True`.
- The list `arr` and the integers `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial values.
- The variable `f` is reduced by the total `energy_cost` accumulated over all iterations where the loop did not break.
- The variable `i` will be `n + 1` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking, otherwise, it will be the index at which the loop broke.
- The variables `time_diff`, `energy_keep_on`, `energy_turn_off_on`, and `energy_cost` will hold the values from the last iteration of the loop, either the final iteration if the loop completes or the iteration where the loop broke.
