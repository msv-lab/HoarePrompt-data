Output State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user input, `f` is an integer provided by the user input, `a` is an integer provided by the user input, `b` is an integer provided by the user input, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `f` is reduced by the total `energy_cost` accumulated over all iterations where the loop did not break, `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user input, `arr` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers provided by the user input, `i` is `n + 1` if the loop completes without breaking, otherwise `i` is the value at which `f` became less than or equal to `energy_cost` and the loop broke, `time_diff` is the last calculated difference between consecutive elements in `arr`, `energy_keep_on` is the last calculated cost of keeping the device on, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is the last calculated minimum cost, `possible` is True.**

Explanation:
- The variable `possible` was initially set to a value that could be either True or False depending on the conditions of the loop.
- The code snippet sets `possible` to True.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
