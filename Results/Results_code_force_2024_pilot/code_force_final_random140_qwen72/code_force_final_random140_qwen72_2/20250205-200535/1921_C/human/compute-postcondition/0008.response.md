Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `f`, `a`, and `b` are integers provided by the user input, `arr` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers provided by the user input, `possible` is True, `i` is 1, `time_diff` is `arr[1] - arr[0]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[1] - arr[0])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `b` to the variable `energy_turn_off_on`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
