The code assigns the value `b` to the variable `energy_turn_off_on`. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `time_diff`, and `energy_keep_on`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `time_diff` is `arr[1] - arr[0]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[1] - arr[0])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`.**
