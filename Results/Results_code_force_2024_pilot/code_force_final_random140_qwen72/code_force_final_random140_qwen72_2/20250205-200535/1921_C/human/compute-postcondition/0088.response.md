Output State: **`possible` is True, `arr` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers provided by the user input, `n` is an integer provided by the user input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `f` is `f - min(a * (arr[1] - arr[0]), b)`, `a` is an integer provided by the user input, `b` is an integer provided by the user input, `i` is 2, `time_diff` is `arr[2] - arr[1]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[2] - arr[1])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[2] - arr[1]), b)`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `energy_cost` to be the minimum of `energy_keep_on` and `energy_turn_off_on`. Since `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[2] - arr[1])` and `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, the new value of `energy_cost` is `min(a * (arr[2] - arr[1]), b)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
