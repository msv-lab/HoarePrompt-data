The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `i` being less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is an integer provided by the user input and must be greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3, and `n` must still be greater than or equal to 3.

State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user input and must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `time_diff` is `arr[2] - arr[1]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[2] - arr[1])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is the minimum of `a * (arr[2] - arr[1])` and `b`. If `f` was less than or equal to `energy_cost`, `f` is now 0 and `possible` is set to `False`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, `f` is reduced by the value of `energy_cost`.**
