To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `_` is 0.
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - `f` is reduced by the total `energy_cost` accumulated over all iterations where the loop did not break.
   - `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user input.
   - `arr` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers provided by the user input.
   - `i` is `n + 1` if the loop completes without breaking, otherwise `i` is the value at which `f` became less than or equal to `energy_cost` and the loop broke.
   - `time_diff` is the last calculated difference between consecutive elements in `arr`.
   - `energy_keep_on` is the last calculated cost of keeping the device on.
   - `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`.
   - `energy_cost` is the last calculated minimum cost.
   - `possible` is False if the loop broke due to `f` being less than or equal to `energy_cost`, otherwise `possible` remains True.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('YES' if possible else 'NO')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The value of `possible` is determined by whether the loop broke due to `f` becoming less than or equal to `energy_cost`.
   - If the loop completes without breaking, `possible` remains True.
   - If the loop breaks because `f` becomes less than or equal to `energy_cost`, `possible` is set to False.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - If the loop completes without breaking, the output will be 'YES'.
   - If the loop breaks due to `f` being less than or equal to `energy_cost`, the output will be 'NO'.

Given the initial state and the conditions, the final output will be determined by the value of `possible`.

Output: **'YES' if the loop completes without breaking, otherwise 'NO'**.
