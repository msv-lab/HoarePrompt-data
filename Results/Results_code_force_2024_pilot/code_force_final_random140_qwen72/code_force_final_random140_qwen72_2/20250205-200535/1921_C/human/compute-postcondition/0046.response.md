Output State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `time_diff` is `arr[1] - arr[0]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[1] - arr[0])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is the minimum of `a * (arr[1] - arr[0])` and `b`, `f` is less than or equal to `energy_cost`, `possible` is `False`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
