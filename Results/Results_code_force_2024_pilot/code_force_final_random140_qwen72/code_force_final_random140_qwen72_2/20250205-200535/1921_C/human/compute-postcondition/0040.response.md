Output State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `time_diff` is `arr[1] - arr[0]`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the difference between the second element (`arr[1]`) and the first element (`arr[0]`) of the array `arr`, and assigns this difference to the variable `time_diff`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.
