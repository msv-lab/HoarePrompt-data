Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `f`, `a`, and `b` are integers provided by the user input, `arr` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers provided by the user input, `possible` is True, `i` is 1, `time_diff` is `arr[1] - arr[0]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[1] - arr[0])`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `energy_keep_on` is calculated as `a * time_diff`.
- Since `time_diff` is defined as `arr[1] - arr[0]`, `energy_keep_on` becomes `a * (arr[1] - arr[0])`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
