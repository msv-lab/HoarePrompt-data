Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer provided by the user input, `f` is an integer provided by the user input, `a` is an integer provided by the user input, `b` is an integer provided by the user input, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `f` is reduced by the total `energy_cost` accumulated over all iterations where the loop did not break, `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user input, `arr` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers provided by the user input, `i` is `n + 1` if the loop completes without breaking, otherwise `i` is the value at which `f` became less than or equal to `energy_cost` and the loop broke, `time_diff` is the last calculated difference between consecutive elements in `arr`, `energy_keep_on` is the last calculated cost of keeping the device on, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is the last calculated minimum cost, `possible` is True.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    time_diff = arr[i] - arr[i - 1]
    energy_keep_on = a * time_diff
    energy_turn_off_on = b
    energy_cost = min(energy_keep_on, energy_turn_off_on)
    if f <= energy_cost:
        possible = False
        break
    f -= energy_cost


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer provided by the user input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `time_diff` is `arr[1] - arr[0]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[1] - arr[0])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is the minimum of `a * (arr[1] - arr[0])` and `b`, `f` is reduced by the value of `energy_cost`. If `f` is less than or equal to `energy_cost`, `possible` is set to `False`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer provided by the user input and must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `time_diff` is `arr[2] - arr[1]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[2] - arr[1])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is the minimum of `a * (arr[2] - arr[1])` and `b`. If `f` was less than or equal to `energy_cost`, `f` is now 0 and `possible` is set to `False`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, `f` is reduced by the value of `energy_cost`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer provided by the user input and must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `time_diff` is `arr[3] - arr[2]`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * (arr[3] - arr[2])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is the minimum of `a * (arr[3] - arr[2])` and `b`. If `f` was greater than `energy_cost`, `f` is now reduced by the value of `energy_cost`. If `f` was less than or equal to `energy_cost`, `f` remains unchanged, `possible` is set to `False`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
