### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - Each test case starts by reading the values of `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`, followed by the list of message times `arr`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes `possible` to `True`.
   - It adds a `0` to the beginning of the `arr` list to handle the initial state of the phone at time `0`. This is a good approach to simplify the calculation of the first time difference.

3. **Loop Through Messages**:
   - The program iterates through each message time from `1` to `n`:
     - It calculates the time difference between the current message time and the previous one (`time_diff`).
     - It computes the energy cost of keeping the phone on (`energy_keep_on`) and the energy cost of turning the phone off and on again (`energy_turn_off_on`).
     - It chooses the minimum of these two costs as the energy cost for the current interval (`energy_cost`).
     - If the remaining charge `f` is less than or equal to the chosen energy cost, it sets `possible` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
     - Otherwise, it subtracts the chosen energy cost from the remaining charge `f`.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing all messages for a test case, the program prints "YES" if `possible` is still `True`, otherwise it prints "NO".

### Analysis:
- **Correct Logic**:
  - The logic correctly handles the decision of whether to keep the phone on or turn it off and on again based on the energy costs.
  - The program ensures that the phone's charge is sufficient to send each message, considering both the cost of keeping the phone on and the cost of turning it off and on.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles edge cases such as the initial state of the phone and the final state after all messages are sent.
  - It correctly handles the scenario where the phone's charge drops to zero or below, ensuring that the program outputs "NO" in such cases.

- **Efficiency**:
  - The program efficiently processes each test case in O(n) time, which is suitable given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and should work as expected for the given problem description.

Correctness: **True**
