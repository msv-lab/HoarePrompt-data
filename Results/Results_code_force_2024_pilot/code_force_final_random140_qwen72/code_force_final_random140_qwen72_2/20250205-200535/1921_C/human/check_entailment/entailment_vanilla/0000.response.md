### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. Each test case starts by reading the values of `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`, followed by the list of message times `arr`.

2. **Initialization**: The program initializes `possible` to `True` and adds a `0` to the beginning of the `arr` list to handle the initial state of the phone at time `0`.

3. **Loop Through Messages**: The program iterates through each message time from `1` to `n`:
   - It calculates the time difference between the current message time and the previous one.
   - It computes the energy cost of keeping the phone on (`energy_keep_on`) and the energy cost of turning the phone off and on again (`energy_turn_off_on`).
   - It chooses the minimum of these two costs as the energy cost for the current interval.
   - If the remaining charge `f` is less than or equal to the chosen energy cost, it sets `possible` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
   - Otherwise, it subtracts the chosen energy cost from the remaining charge `f`.

4. **Output**: After processing all messages for a test case, the program prints "YES" if `possible` is still `True`, otherwise it prints "NO".

### Analysis:
- **Correct Logic**: The logic correctly handles the decision of whether to keep the phone on or turn it off and on again based on the energy costs.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as the initial state of the phone and the final state after all messages are sent.
- **Efficiency**: The program efficiently processes each test case in O(n) time, which is suitable given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and should work as expected for the given problem description.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
