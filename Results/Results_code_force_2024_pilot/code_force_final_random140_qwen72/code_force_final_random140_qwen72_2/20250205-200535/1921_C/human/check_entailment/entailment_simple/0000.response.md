### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`, and the list of message times `arr`.

2. **Initialization**: The program initializes `arr` with a leading zero to handle the initial state of the phone being turned on at moment 0. This is a good approach to simplify the logic.

3. **Loop Through Messages**: The program iterates through each message time, calculating the time difference (`time_diff`) between the current message and the previous one. It then calculates two potential energy costs:
   - `energy_keep_on`: The energy cost if the phone remains on during the time difference.
   - `energy_turn_off_on`: The energy cost if the phone is turned off and then turned back on.

4. **Energy Cost Calculation**: The program chooses the minimum of these two costs (`energy_cost`) and checks if the remaining charge (`f`) is sufficient to cover this cost. If not, it sets `possible` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.

5. **Output**: After processing all messages for a test case, the program prints "YES" if `possible` is `True` (i.e., all messages were sent successfully), and "NO" otherwise.

### Potential Issues:
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases well, including the initial state and the transition between messages.
- **Integer Overflow**: The problem statement mentions the possibility of integer overflow, but the program uses Python's built-in integer type, which can handle arbitrarily large numbers. Therefore, this is not a concern in this context.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles all the constraints and edge cases mentioned in the problem description.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
