### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`, and the list of moments `arr`.

2. **Initialization**: The function initializes `possible` to `True` and appends a `0` to the beginning of `arr` to handle the initial state at moment `0`.

3. **Loop Through Messages**: The function iterates through each message from `1` to `n`. For each message, it calculates:
   - `time_diff`: The difference in time between the current message and the previous one.
   - `energy_keep_on`: The energy cost if the phone remains on during this time.
   - `energy_turn_off_on`: The energy cost if the phone is turned off and then on again.

4. **Energy Cost Calculation**: The function selects the minimum of `energy_keep_on` and `energy_turn_off_on` as the energy cost for the current interval. This ensures that the phone uses the least amount of energy possible.

5. **Check Energy Level**: The function checks if the remaining energy `f` is less than or equal to the energy cost. If so, it sets `possible` to `False` and breaks out of the loop, indicating that it is not possible to send all messages.

6. **Output Result**: After processing all messages for the current test case, the function prints 'YES' if `possible` is still `True`, otherwise 'NO'.

### Correctness:
The function correctly implements the logic to determine if Stepan can send all messages based on the given constraints. It handles the energy consumption for both keeping the phone on and turning it off and on, ensuring the minimum energy usage. The function also correctly processes multiple test cases and outputs the results as required.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
