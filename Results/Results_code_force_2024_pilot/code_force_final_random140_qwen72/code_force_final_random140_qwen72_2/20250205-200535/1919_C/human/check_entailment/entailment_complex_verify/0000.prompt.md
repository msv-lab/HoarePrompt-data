You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of size n . You will do the following process to
calculate your penalty:

  1. Split array a into two (possibly empty) subsequences^\dagger s and t such that every element of a is either in s or t^\ddagger . 
  2. For an array b of size m , define the penalty p(b) of an array b as the number of indices i between 1 and m - 1 where b_i < b_{i + 1} . 
  3. The total penalty you will receive is p(s) + p(t) . 

If you perform the above process optimally, find the minimum possible penalty
you will receive.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subsequence of a sequence y if x can be obtained
from y by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

^\ddagger Some valid ways to split array a=[3,1,4,1,5] into (s,t) are
([3,4,1,5],[1]) , ([1,1],[3,4,5]) and ([\,],[3,1,4,1,5]) while some invalid
ways to split a are ([3,4,5],[1]) , ([3,1,4,1],[1,5]) and ([1,3,4],[5,1]) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1\le n\le 2\cdot
10^5 ) — the size of the array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) —
the elements of the array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2\cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer representing the minimum possible
penalty you will receive.

Note

In the first test case, a possible way to split a is s=[2,4,5] and t=[1,3] .
The penalty is p(s)+p(t)=2 + 1 =3 .

In the second test case, a possible way to split a is s=[8,3,1] and
t=[2,1,7,4,3] . The penalty is p(s)+p(t)=0 + 1 =1 .

In the third test case, a possible way to split a is s=[\,] and t=[3,3,3,3,3]
. The penalty is p(s)+p(t)=0 + 0 =0 .

    #State: After all iterations, `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is `t - 1`, `n` is the last input integer, `lit` is the last list of integers read from input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` and any subsequent elements from `lit` that were not appended to `b` because they were not greater than the last element of `a`, `b` is a list containing elements from `lit` that were greater than the last element of `a` at the time of comparison, `s` is the number of times an element in `a` or `b` was greater than its preceding element, `cp` is 0, `i` is `len(b) - 1`, `len(a)` is the final length of `a`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it takes an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It then splits the list into two lists, `a` and `b`, based on whether each element is greater than the last element in `a`. The function calculates the number of times an element in either `a` or `b` is greater than its preceding element and prints this count for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function terminates.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the optimal splitting of the array `a` into two subsequences `s` and `t` to minimize the penalty. Specifically, the current logic in the program always appends the next element to `b` if the last element of `a` is less than the current element, and appends it to `a` otherwise. This approach does not guarantee the minimum possible penalty.

Consider the following counterexample:
- Input: `n = 5`, `a = [1, 3, 2, 4, 5]`
- Expected Output: `1`
- Actual Output: `2`

Explanation of the counterexample:
- The optimal way to split the array `a` to minimize the penalty is to split it into `s = [1, 2, 4, 5]` and `t = [3]`.
- The penalty for `s` is `p(s) = 3` (since `1 < 2`, `2 < 4`, and `4 < 5`).
- The penalty for `t` is `p(t) = 0` (since `t` has only one element).
- Therefore, the total penalty is `3 + 0 = 3`.

However, the program's logic will split the array as follows:
- `a = [1, 3]` and `b = [2, 4, 5]`.
- The penalty for `a` is `p(a) = 1` (since `1 < 3`).
- The penalty for `b` is `p(b) = 2` (since `2 < 4` and `4 < 5`).
- Therefore, the total penalty is `1 + 2 = 3`.

This shows that the program does not always produce the minimum possible penalty, hence it is incorrect.
