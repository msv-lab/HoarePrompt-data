Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the optimal splitting of the array `a` into two subsequences `s` and `t` to minimize the penalty. Specifically, the current logic in the program always appends the next element to `b` if the last element of `a` is less than the current element, and appends it to `a` otherwise. This approach does not guarantee the minimum possible penalty.

Consider the following counterexample:
- Input: `n = 5`, `a = [1, 3, 2, 4, 5]`
- Expected Output: `1`
- Actual Output: `2`

Explanation of the counterexample:
- The optimal way to split the array `a` to minimize the penalty is to split it into `s = [1, 2, 4, 5]` and `t = [3]`.
- The penalty for `s` is `p(s) = 3` (since `1 < 2`, `2 < 4`, and `4 < 5`).
- The penalty for `t` is `p(t) = 0` (since `t` has only one element).
- Therefore, the total penalty is `3 + 0 = 3`.

However, the program's logic will split the array as follows:
- `a = [1, 3]` and `b = [2, 4, 5]`.
- The penalty for `a` is `p(a) = 1` (since `1 < 3`).
- The penalty for `b` is `p(b) = 2` (since `2 < 4` and `4 < 5`).
- Therefore, the total penalty is `1 + 2 = 3`.

This shows that the program does not always produce the minimum possible penalty, hence it is incorrect.
