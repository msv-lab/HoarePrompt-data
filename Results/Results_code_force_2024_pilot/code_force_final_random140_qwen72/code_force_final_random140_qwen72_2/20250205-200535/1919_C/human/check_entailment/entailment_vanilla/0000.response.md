### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to split the array `a` into two subsequences `s` and `t` such that the total penalty \( p(s) + p(t) \) is minimized.
   - The penalty \( p(b) \) for an array \( b \) is defined as the number of indices \( i \) between 1 and \( m-1 \) where \( b_i < b_{i+1} \).

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The given program initializes two lists `a` and `b` with the first element of the input array.
   - It then iterates through the remaining elements of the input array and appends each element to either `a` or `b` based on whether the last element of `a` is less than the current element.
   - After the iteration, it calculates the penalty for both `a` and `b` by counting the number of increasing pairs in each list.
   - Finally, it prints the sum of these penalties.

3. **Correctness Check:**
   - **Initialization:** The program correctly initializes `a` with the first element of the input array and `b` as an empty list.
   - **Element Assignment:** The program assigns each subsequent element to either `a` or `b` based on the condition `a[-1] < lit[i]`. This ensures that elements are added to `a` only if they are greater than or equal to the last element of `a`, otherwise they are added to `b`.
   - **Penalty Calculation:** The program correctly calculates the penalty for both `a` and `b` by iterating through each list and counting the number of increasing pairs.
   - **Output:** The program prints the total penalty, which is the sum of the penalties of `a` and `b`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Single Element Array:** If the array has only one element, the penalty will be 0, as there are no pairs to compare.
   - **All Elements Equal:** If all elements in the array are equal, the penalty will also be 0, as there are no increasing pairs.
   - **Mixed Elements:** The program handles mixed elements correctly by ensuring that elements are added to `a` or `b` based on the condition, which helps in minimizing the penalty.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to minimize the penalty for the given problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
