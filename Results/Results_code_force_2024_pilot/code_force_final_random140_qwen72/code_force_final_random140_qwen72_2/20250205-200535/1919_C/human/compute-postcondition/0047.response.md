Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `lit` is a list of integers read from input, `a` is a list containing only the first element of `lit`, `b` is an empty list, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its preceding element plus the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its preceding element.**

Explanation:
- The code initializes `a` to a list containing only the first element of `lit`.
- The code initializes `b` to an empty list.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `lit`, `cp`, and `s` remain unchanged.
- The value of `i` is updated to `len(a) - 1`, which is 0 because `a` now contains only one element.
