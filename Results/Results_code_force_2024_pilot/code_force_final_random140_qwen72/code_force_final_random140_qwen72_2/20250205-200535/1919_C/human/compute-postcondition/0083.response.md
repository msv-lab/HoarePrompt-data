To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop head:

### Given Information:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
- `_` is 1.
- `n` is the same as the initial input integer.
- `lit` is the same list of integers read from input.
- `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` and any subsequent elements of `lit` that were not greater than their preceding element in `lit`.
- `b` is a list containing any elements of `lit` that were greater than their preceding element in `lit` and must have at least 2 elements.
- `cp` is 0.
- `i` is `len(a)`.
- `s` is the count of elements in `a` that are greater than their preceding element.
- If `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is incremented by 1.
- `len(b)` must be greater than `len(a)`.

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(1, len(b)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the indices of `b` starting from 1 up to `len(b) - 1`.
- The variable `i` is the loop counter and is incremented by 1 at each iteration.
- The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `len(b)`.

### Current State:
- `i` is `len(a)`.
- `len(b)` must be greater than `len(a)`.

### Adjusting the State:
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
- The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than `len(b)`.

### New State:
- `i` is `len(a) + 1`.
- `len(b)` must still be greater than `len(a)`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 1, `n` is the same as the initial input integer, `lit` is the same list of integers read from input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` and any subsequent elements of `lit` that were not greater than their preceding element in `lit`, `b` is a list containing any elements of `lit` that were greater than their preceding element in `lit` and must have at least 2 elements, `cp` is 0, `i` is `len(a) + 1`, and `s` is the count of elements in `a` that are greater than their preceding element. `len(b)` must be greater than `len(a)`.**
