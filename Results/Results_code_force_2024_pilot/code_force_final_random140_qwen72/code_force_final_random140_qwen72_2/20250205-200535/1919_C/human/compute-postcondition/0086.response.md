Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 1, `n` is the same as the initial input integer, `lit` is the same list of integers read from input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` and any subsequent elements of `lit` that were not greater than their preceding element in `lit`, `b` is a list containing any elements of `lit` that were greater than their preceding element in `lit`, `cp` is 0, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, and `s` is the count of elements in `b` that are greater than their preceding element.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`, `_`, `n`, `lit`, `a`, `b`, `cp`:** These variables remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop.
- **`i`:** The variable `i` is initialized to `len(a) - 1` before the loop starts, but it is not used or modified within the loop. Therefore, it remains `len(a) - 1`.
- **`s`:** The variable `s` is incremented each time the condition `b[i] > b[i - 1]` is true. After all iterations of the loop, `s` will be the count of elements in `b` that are greater than their preceding element. This means `s` will reflect the number of times the condition was met during the loop's execution.
