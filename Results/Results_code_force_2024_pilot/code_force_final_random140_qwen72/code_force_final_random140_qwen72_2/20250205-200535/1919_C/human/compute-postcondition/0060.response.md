Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 1, `n` must be greater than 3, `lit` is a list of integers read from input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit`, `b` is a list containing the second and third elements of `lit` if `a[-1] < lit[2]`, otherwise `a` is a list containing the first and third elements of `lit` and `b` is a list containing the second element of `lit` if the last element of `a` is less than `lit[2]`, or an empty list if the last element of `a` is greater than or equal to `lit[2]`, `i` is 3, `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its preceding element plus the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its preceding element, and `b` now contains one additional element which is `lit[3]`.**
