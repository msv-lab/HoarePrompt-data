The function `func` does not explicitly show its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it can be inferred that the function accepts a series of test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. The function processes each test case and returns a result for each.

- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5).
  - A list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n).

The function processes each test case and returns a result for each test case. However, the specific output for each test case is not detailed in the provided information, so the general functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts a series of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It processes each test case and returns a result for each test case.**
