Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `lit` is a list of integers read from input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` and any subsequent elements from `lit` that were not appended to `b` because they were not greater than the last element of `a`, `b` is a list containing elements from `lit` that were greater than the last element of `a` at the time of comparison, `s` is the number of times an element in `b` was greater than its preceding element, `cp` is 0, `i` is `len(b) - 1`, `len(a)` is the final length of `a`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the elements of `b` starting from index 1 to `len(b) - 1`.
- For each iteration, if the current element `b[i]` is greater than the previous element `b[i - 1]`, the variable `s` is incremented by 1.
- After all iterations, `i` will be equal to `len(b) - 1`, which is the last index of the list `b`.
- The value of `s` will be the total count of elements in `b` that are greater than their preceding elements.
- The other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `lit`, `a`, `cp`, and `len(a)`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
