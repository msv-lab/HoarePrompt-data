Output State: **After all iterations, `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is `t - 1`, `n` is the last input integer, `lit` is the last list of integers read from input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` and any subsequent elements from `lit` that were not appended to `b` because they were not greater than the last element of `a`, `b` is a list containing elements from `lit` that were greater than the last element of `a` at the time of comparison, `s` is the number of times an element in `a` or `b` was greater than its preceding element, `cp` is 0, `i` is `len(b) - 1`, `len(a)` is the final length of `a`.**

### Explanation:
- `_` will be `t - 1` because the loop runs `t` times, and the loop variable `_` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration.
- `n` will be the value of the last input integer read during the last iteration.
- `lit` will be the list of integers read from input during the last iteration.
- `a` will contain the first element of `lit` and any subsequent elements from `lit` that were not appended to `b` because they were not greater than the last element of `a`.
- `b` will contain elements from `lit` that were greater than the last element of `a` at the time of comparison.
- `s` will be the total count of elements in `a` and `b` that were greater than their preceding elements.
- `cp` remains 0 throughout the loop.
- `i` will be `len(b) - 1` after the inner loop completes.
- `len(a)` will be the final length of the list `a` after processing the last input list `lit`.
