You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        lit = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a, b = [lit[0]], []
        
        cp = 0
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            if a[-1] < lit[i]:
                b.append(lit[i])
            else:
                a.append(lit[i])
        
        s = 0
        
        for i in range(1, len(a)):
            if a[i] > a[i - 1]:
                s += 1
        
        for i in range(1, len(b)):
            if b[i] > b[i - 1]:
                s += 1
        
        print(s)
        
    #State: After all iterations, `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is `t - 1`, `n` is the last input integer, `lit` is the last list of integers read from input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` and any subsequent elements from `lit` that were not appended to `b` because they were not greater than the last element of `a`, `b` is a list containing elements from `lit` that were greater than the last element of `a` at the time of comparison, `s` is the number of times an element in `a` or `b` was greater than its preceding element, `cp` is 0, `i` is `len(b) - 1`, `len(a)` is the final length of `a`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a series of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It processes each test case and returns a result for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
