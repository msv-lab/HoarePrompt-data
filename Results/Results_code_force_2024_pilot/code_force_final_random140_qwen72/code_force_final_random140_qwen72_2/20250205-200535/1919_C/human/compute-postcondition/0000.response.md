To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the state of the object in the loop head, which is the variable `_`. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), representing the number of test cases.

The loop will execute `t` times if `int(input())` returns a value equal to `t`. For the loop to execute at least once, `int(input())` must return a value greater than 0.

Since the initial state already specifies that `t` is a positive integer, we can assume that `int(input())` will return a value that is at least 1, ensuring the loop will execute.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `int(input())` must return a value greater than 0, which is consistent with the given range for `t`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 0, and `int(input())` must return a value greater than 0**
