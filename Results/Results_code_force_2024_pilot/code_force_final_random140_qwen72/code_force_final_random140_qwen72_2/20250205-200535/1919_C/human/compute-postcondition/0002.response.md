The code `lit = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into parts based on spaces, converts each part to an integer, and stores the resulting list of integers in the variable `lit`.

- The initial state includes `t` being a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` being 0, and `n` being a positive integer greater than 0.
- After executing the code, the variable `lit` is now a list of integers, which are the result of converting the input string split by spaces into integers.
- The values of `t`, `_`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers read from input.**
