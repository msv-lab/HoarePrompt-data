Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `lit` is a list of integers read from input, `a` is a list containing only the first element of `lit`, `b` is an empty list, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its preceding element plus the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its preceding element.**

The code snippet `cp = 0` does not change any of the existing variables except for setting `cp` to 0, which was already its initial value. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
