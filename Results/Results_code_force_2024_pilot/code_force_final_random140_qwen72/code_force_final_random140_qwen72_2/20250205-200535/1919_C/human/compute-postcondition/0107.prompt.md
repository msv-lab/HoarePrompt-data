Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `lit` is a list of integers read from input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit`, `b` is an empty list, `cp` is 0, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, and `s` is the count of elements in `b` that are greater than their preceding element.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if a[-1] < lit[i]:
        b.append(lit[i])
    else:
        a.append(lit[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers read from input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit`. If the last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i` in `lit`, then `b` is a list containing the element at index `i` of `lit`, and `s` is the count of elements in `b` that are greater than their preceding element. Otherwise, `a` includes the element at index `i` of `lit`, `b` remains an empty list, `cp` is 0, `i` is `len(a) - 1` which is now 1, and `s` is the count of elements in `b` that are greater than their preceding element.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers read from input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit`. If `a[-1] < lit[i]`, then `b` now contains the element at index `i` of `lit`, and `s` is the count of elements in `b` that are greater than their preceding element. Otherwise, `a` includes the element at index `i` of `lit`, `b` remains an empty list, `cp` is 0, and `i` is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 2, `n` is greater than 3, `lit` is a list of integers read from input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` and possibly the fourth element of `lit` depending on the condition, `b` is a list (possibly containing elements from `lit`), `s` is the count of elements in `b` that are greater than their preceding element, `cp` is 0, and `i` is 3. If `a[-1] < lit[i]`, then `a` contains the first and fourth elements of `lit`, and `b` contains the first and fourth elements of `lit`. Otherwise, `a` contains the first and fourth elements of `lit`, and `b` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
