Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers read from input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` and all elements from `lit` that are not greater than the last element of `a`, `b` is a list containing all elements from `lit` that are greater than the last element of `a` before they were added to `b`, `cp` is 0, `i` is `n`, `a` must have at least `n + 1` elements. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[i - 1]`, then `s` is 1. Otherwise, `s` remains 0.***
