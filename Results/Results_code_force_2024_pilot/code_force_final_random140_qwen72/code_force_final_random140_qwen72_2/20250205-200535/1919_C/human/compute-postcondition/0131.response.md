To determine what will be printed by the `print(s)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic involved:

### Initial State:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
- `_` is 2.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `lit` is a list of integers read from input.
- `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` and any subsequent elements from `lit` that were not appended to `b` because they were not greater than the last element of `a`.
- `b` is a list containing elements from `lit` that were greater than the last element of `a` at the time of comparison.
- `s` is the number of times an element in `b` was greater than its preceding element.
- `cp` is 0.
- `i` is `len(b) - 1`.
- `len(a)` is the final length of `a`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `a` starts with the first element of `lit`.
   - `b` starts empty.
   - `s` is initialized to 0.

2. **Processing `lit`**:
   - For each element in `lit` starting from the second element:
     - If the element is greater than the last element of `a`, it is appended to `b`.
     - Otherwise, it is appended to `a`.

3. **Counting Increases in `b`**:
   - After constructing `b`, `s` is incremented each time an element in `b` is greater than its preceding element.

4. **Final Values**:
   - `s` is the count of how many times an element in `b` was greater than its preceding element.

### What is Printed:
The `print(s)` statement will print the value of `s`, which is the number of times an element in `b` was greater than its preceding element.

### Example Explanation:
- Suppose `lit = [1, 3, 2, 4, 5]`.
  - `a` will be `[1, 2]` because 3 and 4 are greater than the last element of `a` at the time of comparison and are appended to `b`.
  - `b` will be `[3, 4, 5]`.
  - `s` will be 2 because 4 > 3 and 5 > 4.

### Final Output:
Output: **s (where s is the number of times an element in b was greater than its preceding element)**
