Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `lit` is a list of integers read from input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit`, `b` is an empty list, `cp` is 0, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, and `s` is the count of elements in `b` that are greater than their preceding element.**

Explanation:
- The code `cp = 0` sets the variable `cp` to 0.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `lit` is a list of integers read from input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit`, `b` is an empty list, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, and `s` is the count of elements in `b` that are greater than their preceding element. These conditions remain valid after the code execution.
