The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is used as a counter for the number of iterations specified by the input value. The loop will execute based on the value provided by `int(input())`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 1, indicating that one iteration has already been completed. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be incremented by 1.

Since the loop condition is based on the range provided by the input, and assuming the input remains constant across iterations, the loop will continue to execute until `_` reaches the value of the input.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the increment of `_` to 2, while all other variables remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head and thus not directly affected by the loop's iteration mechanism.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 2, `n` is the same as the initial input integer, `lit` is the same list of integers read from input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` and any subsequent elements of `lit` that were not greater than their preceding element in `lit`, `b` is a list containing any elements of `lit` that were greater than their preceding element in `lit`, `cp` is 0, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, and `s` is the count of elements in `b` that are greater than their preceding element.**
