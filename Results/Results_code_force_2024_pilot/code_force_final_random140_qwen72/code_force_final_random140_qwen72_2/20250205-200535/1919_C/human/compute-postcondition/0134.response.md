Functionality: ** The function reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it takes an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It then splits the list into two lists, `a` and `b`, based on whether each element is greater than the last element in `a`. The function calculates the number of times an element in either `a` or `b` is greater than its preceding element and prints this count for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function terminates. **
