To determine the state adjustments necessary for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)
- `_` is 1
- `n` is greater than 2
- `lit` is a list of integers read from input
- `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit`
- If `a[-1] < lit[i]`, then:
  - `b` is a list containing the second and third elements of `lit`
  - `i` is 2
  - `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its preceding element plus the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its preceding element
- Otherwise:
  - `a` is a list containing the first and third elements of `lit`
  - `b` is either a list containing the second element of `lit` if the last element of `a` (which is now the third element of `lit`) is less than the `i`-th element of `lit`, or an empty list if the last element of `a` is greater than or equal to the `i`-th element of `lit`
  - `i` is 2
  - `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its preceding element plus the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its preceding element

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.
3. **Current State**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` is greater than 2

### Adjustments for the Next Iteration:
- **Increment `i`**: Since `i` is currently 2, it will be incremented by 1 to become 3.
- **Check `n`**: For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 3.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 1, `n` must be greater than 3, `lit` is a list of integers read from input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit`, `b` is a list containing the second and third elements of `lit` if `a[-1] < lit[2]`, otherwise `a` is a list containing the first and third elements of `lit` and `b` is a list containing the second element of `lit` if the last element of `a` is less than `lit[2]`, or an empty list if the last element of `a` is greater than or equal to `lit[2]`, `i` is 3, and `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its preceding element plus the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its preceding element.**
