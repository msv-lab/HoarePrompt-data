Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers read from input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` and all elements from `lit` that are not greater than the last element of `a`, `b` is a list containing all elements from `lit` that are greater than the last element of `a` before they were added to `b`, `cp` is 0, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its preceding element.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the list `a` starting from the second element (index 1) to the last element (index `len(a) - 1`).
- For each iteration, the loop checks if the current element `a[i]` is greater than the previous element `a[i - 1]`.
- If the condition is true, the variable `s` is incremented by 1.
- After the loop completes, `i` will be equal to `len(a) - 1`, which is the index of the last element in `a`.
- The variable `s` will contain the count of how many times an element in `a` was greater than its preceding element.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `lit`, `a`, `b`, `cp`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
