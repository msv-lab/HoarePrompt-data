Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers read from input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` and the element at index `i` of `lit`, `b` is an empty list, `cp` is 0, `i` is `len(a) - 1` which is now 1, `s` is the count of elements in `b` that are greater than their preceding element, and the last element of `a` is greater than or equal to the element at index `i` in `lit`.**
