Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4), `_` is 1, `n` is the same as the initial input integer, `lit` is the same list of integers read from input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` and any subsequent elements of `lit` that were not greater than their preceding element in `lit`, `b` is a list containing any elements of `lit` that were greater than their preceding element in `lit` and must have at least 2 elements, `cp` is 0, `i` is `len(a) + 1`, and `s` is the count of elements in `a` that are greater than their preceding element. If `b[i] > b[i - 1]`, then `s` is incremented by 1. `len(b)` must be greater than `len(a)`.***
