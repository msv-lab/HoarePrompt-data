Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `lit` is a list of integers read from input, `a` is a list containing only the first element of `lit`, `b` is an empty list, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its preceding element plus the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its preceding element.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if a[-1] < lit[i]:
        b.append(lit[i])
    else:
        a.append(lit[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers read from input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit`, `b` is either a list containing the second element of `lit` if the last element of `a` is less than the `i`-th element of `lit`, or an empty list if the last element of `a` is greater than or equal to the `i`-th element of `lit`, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, and `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its preceding element plus the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its preceding element.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers read from input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit`. If `a[-1] < lit[i]`, then `b` is a list containing the second and third elements of `lit`, `i` is 2, and `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its preceding element plus the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its preceding element. Otherwise, `a` is a list containing the first and third elements of `lit`, `b` is either a list containing the second element of `lit` if the last element of `a` (which is now the third element of `lit`) is less than the `i`-th element of `lit`, or an empty list if the last element of `a` is greater than or equal to the `i`-th element of `lit`, `i` is 2, and `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its preceding element plus the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its preceding element.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 3, `lit` is a list of integers read from input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` and possibly the fourth element of `lit` if the last element of `a` is not less than `lit[3]`, `b` is a list containing the second and third elements of `lit` if `a[-1] < lit[2]`, or the second element of `lit` if the last element of `a` is less than `lit[2]` and `a[-1] >= lit[2]`, or an empty list if the last element of `a` is greater than or equal to `lit[2]`, and `b` may contain an additional element `lit[3]` if `a[-1] < lit[3]`. `i` is 3, and `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its preceding element plus the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its preceding element.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
