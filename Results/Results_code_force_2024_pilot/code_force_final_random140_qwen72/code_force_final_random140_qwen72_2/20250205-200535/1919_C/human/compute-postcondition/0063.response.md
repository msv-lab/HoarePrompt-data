Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 1, `n` is the same as the initial input integer, `lit` is the same list of integers read from input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` and any subsequent elements of `lit` that were not greater than their preceding element in `lit`, `b` is a list containing any elements of `lit` that were greater than their preceding element in `lit`, `cp` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, and `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its preceding element plus the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its preceding element.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`_`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`n`**: Remains the same as the initial input integer because it is not modified within the loop.
- **`lit`**: Remains the same list of integers read from input because it is not modified within the loop.
- **`a`**: Starts with the first element of `lit` and appends any subsequent elements of `lit` that are not greater than their preceding element in `lit`.
- **`b`**: Starts empty and appends any elements of `lit` that are greater than their preceding element in `lit`.
- **`cp`**: Remains 0 as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be `n-1` because the loop runs from `1` to `n-1` (inclusive).
- **`s`**: This is the sum of the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its preceding element and the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its preceding element. This value is calculated based on the final contents of `a` and `b`.
