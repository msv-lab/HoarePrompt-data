Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `lit` is a list of integers read from input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` and any subsequent elements from `lit` that were not appended to `b` because they were not greater than the last element of `a`, `b` is a list containing elements from `lit` that were greater than the last element of `a` at the time of comparison, `s` is the number of times an element in `a` was greater than its preceding element, `cp` is 0, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, and `len(a)` is the final length of `a`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` remains a positive integer within the specified range.
- The variable `_` remains 2.
- The variable `n` remains the input integer.
- The list `lit` remains the list of integers read from input.
- The list `a` contains the first element of `lit` and any subsequent elements from `lit` that were not appended to `b` because they were not greater than the last element of `a`.
- The list `b` contains elements from `lit` that were greater than the last element of `a` at the time of comparison.
- The variable `s` is now the count of how many times an element in `a` was greater than the element immediately before it.
- The variable `cp` remains 0.
- The variable `i` is now `len(a) - 1`, indicating the index of the last element in `a`.
- The length of `a` (`len(a)`) is the final length of the list `a` after all elements have been processed.
