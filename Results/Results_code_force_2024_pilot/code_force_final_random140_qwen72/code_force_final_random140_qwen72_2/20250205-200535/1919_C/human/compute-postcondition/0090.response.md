Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `lit` is a list of integers read from input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` and any subsequent elements of `lit` that were not greater than their preceding element in `lit`, `b` is a list containing any elements of `lit` that were greater than their preceding element in `lit`, `cp` is 0, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, and `s` is the count of elements in `b` that are greater than their preceding element.**

Explanation:
- The line `lit = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a space-separated list of integers from the input and assigns it to the variable `lit`.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `cp`, `i`, and `s` remain unchanged except for `lit` which now holds the list of integers read from the input.
