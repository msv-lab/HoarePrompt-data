To determine what will be printed by the `print(s)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
   - `_` is 0.
   - `n` is a positive integer greater than 0.
   - `lit` is a list of integers read from input.
   - `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` and all elements from `lit` that are not greater than the last element of `a`.
   - `b` is a list containing all elements from `lit` that are greater than the last element of `a` before they were added to `b`.
   - `cp` is 0.
   - `i` is `len(a) - 1`.
   - `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its preceding element plus the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its preceding element.

2. **Understanding the Lists `a` and `b`:**
   - The list `a` starts with the first element of `lit` and includes any subsequent elements from `lit` that are not greater than the last element of `a`.
   - The list `b` includes all elements from `lit` that are greater than the last element of `a` before they were added to `b`.

3. **Calculating `s`:**
   - `s` is the sum of two counts:
     - The number of times an element in `a` is greater than its preceding element.
     - The number of times an element in `b` is greater than its preceding element.

4. **Step-by-Step Calculation:**
   - Initialize `s` to 0.
   - Iterate through the list `a` and count the number of times an element is greater than its preceding element.
   - Iterate through the list `b` and count the number of times an element is greater than its preceding element.
   - Sum these two counts to get the final value of `s`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The `print(s)` statement will print the value of `s`, which is the total count of increasing elements in both lists `a` and `b`.

Given the initial state and the logic described, the output will be the value of `s` as calculated above.

Output: **s (where s is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its preceding element plus the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its preceding element)**
