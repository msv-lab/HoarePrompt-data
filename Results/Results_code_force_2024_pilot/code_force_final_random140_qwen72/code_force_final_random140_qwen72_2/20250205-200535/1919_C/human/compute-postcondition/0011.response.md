The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is a positive integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to become 2, and `n` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `lit` is a list of integers read from input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit`, `b` is either a list containing the second element of `lit` or remains empty, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2. If the last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i` in `lit`, then `b` contains the second element of `lit`. Otherwise, `a` contains both the first and the second elements of `lit`, and `b` remains empty.**
