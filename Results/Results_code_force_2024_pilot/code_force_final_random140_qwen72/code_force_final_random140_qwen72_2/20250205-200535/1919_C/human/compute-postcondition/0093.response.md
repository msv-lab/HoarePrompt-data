To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1, because the range function will generate numbers from 1 up to but not including `n`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)
- `_` is 2
- `n` is an input integer
- `lit` is a list of integers read from input
- `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit`
- `b` is an empty list
- `cp` is 0
- `i` is `len(a) - 1`
- `s` is the count of elements in `b` that are greater than their preceding element

We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute. The variable `i` in the loop head is different from the `i` mentioned in the initial state, so we don't need to adjust the initial `i` value.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers read from input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit`, `b` is an empty list, `cp` is 0, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `s` is the count of elements in `b` that are greater than their preceding element**
