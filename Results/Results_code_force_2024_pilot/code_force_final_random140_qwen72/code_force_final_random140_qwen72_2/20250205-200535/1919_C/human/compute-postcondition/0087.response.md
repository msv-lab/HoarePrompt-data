To determine what will be printed by the `print(s)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
   - `_` is 1.
   - `n` is the same as the initial input integer.
   - `lit` is a list of integers read from input.
   - `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` and any subsequent elements of `lit` that were not greater than their preceding element in `lit`.
   - `b` is a list containing any elements of `lit` that were greater than their preceding element in `lit`.
   - `cp` is 0.
   - `i` is `len(a) - 1`.
   - `s` is the count of elements in `b` that are greater than their preceding element.

2. **Understanding the Lists `a` and `b`:**
   - `a` contains elements from `lit` that are not greater than their preceding element.
   - `b` contains elements from `lit` that are greater than their preceding element.

3. **Counting `s`:**
   - `s` is the count of elements in `b` that are greater than their preceding element in `b`.

4. **Final Calculation:**
   - Since `b` already contains elements that are greater than their preceding element in `lit`, the count `s` will be the number of elements in `b` minus one (because the first element in `b` does not have a preceding element to compare with).

Given this understanding, the value of `s` will be the length of `b` minus one.

**Output:**
Output: **len(b) - 1 (where len(b) is the number of elements in the list b)**
