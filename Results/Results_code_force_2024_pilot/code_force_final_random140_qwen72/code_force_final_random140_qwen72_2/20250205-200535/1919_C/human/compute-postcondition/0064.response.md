Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 1, `n` is the same as the initial input integer, `lit` is the same list of integers read from input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` and any subsequent elements of `lit` that were not greater than their preceding element in `lit`, `b` is a list containing any elements of `lit` that were greater than their preceding element in `lit`, `cp` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, and `s` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The variable `s` is set to 0, overriding its previous value.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `lit`, `a`, `b`, `cp`, `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
