Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `lit` is a list of integers read from input, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` and all elements from `lit` that are not greater than the last element of `a`, `b` is a list containing all elements from `lit` that are greater than the last element of `a` before they were added to `b`, `cp` is 0, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its preceding element plus the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its preceding element.**

Explanation:
- The code `lit = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input and splits it into a list of integers.
- The initial state variables `t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `cp`, `i`, and `s` remain unchanged except for `lit`, which now contains the list of integers read from the input.
- The lists `a` and `b` are defined based on the elements of `lit`, but their definitions do not change in this code snippet.
- The variables `cp`, `i`, and `s` retain their initial values as they are not modified by the given code.
