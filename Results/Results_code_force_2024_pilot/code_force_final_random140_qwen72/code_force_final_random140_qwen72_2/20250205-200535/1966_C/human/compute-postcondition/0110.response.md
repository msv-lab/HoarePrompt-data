The value of `ans` is toggled between 0 and 1. If `ans` was 1, it becomes 0. If `ans` was 0, it becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 4, `i` is 3, `s` is a list containing 0 followed by all unique elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]`, `ans` is toggled (if it was 1, it is now 0; if it was 0, it is now 1).**
