Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `i` is `n-1`, `s` is a list containing all elements from `arr` from index 0 to `n-1` with a 0 prepended. If the difference between the `i`-th element of `s` and the `(i-1)`-th element of `s` is greater than 1, `ans` is 1 and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is 0.***
