The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder to iterate over the range generated by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the value passed to `range` must be a positive integer. This value is derived from the input, which should be the number of test cases `t`.

Given the state before the loop starts, we know that `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. To ensure the loop executes, the input must be a positive integer, which is consistent with the given range for `t`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the input is a positive integer, which is already guaranteed by the constraints on `t`.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder variable, and the input must be a positive integer within the range of `t`**
