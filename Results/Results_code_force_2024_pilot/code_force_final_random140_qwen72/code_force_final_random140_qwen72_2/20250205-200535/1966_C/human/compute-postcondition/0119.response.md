Output State: **After all iterations, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` is the length of `s`, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `s` is a list containing 0 followed by the unique elements from `arr`, `i` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 1 if the number of iterations is odd or if the loop breaks due to a difference greater than 1, and 0 if the number of iterations is even. For each test case, if `n` is 2, `ans` is 1, and the output is 'Alice'. If `n` is greater than 2, the output is 'Alice' if `ans` is 1, otherwise 'Bob'.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: This remains an integer within the specified range, representing the number of test cases.
- **`_`**: This is a placeholder variable used in the loop to iterate over the range of `t`.
- **`n`**: This is the length of the list `s`, which contains 0 followed by the unique elements from the input list `arr`.
- **`arr`**: This is the list of integers read from the input for each test case.
- **`s`**: This is a list that starts with 0 and then contains the unique elements from `arr`.
- **`i`**: This is the index variable used in the inner loop, which will be `n - 1` after the loop completes.
- **`ans`**: This variable is used to determine the winner of the game. It starts at 1 and toggles between 0 and 1 for each iteration of the inner loop. If the loop breaks due to a difference greater than 1, `ans` retains its last value before the break. If `n` is 2, `ans` remains 1. If `n` is greater than 2, `ans` will be 1 if the number of iterations is odd, and 0 if the number of iterations is even.
- **Output**: For each test case, the output is 'Alice' if `ans` is 1, and 'Bob' if `ans` is 0. If `n` is 2, the output is always 'Alice'.
