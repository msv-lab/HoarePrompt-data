Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is `n-1`, `s` contains all elements from `arr` from index 0 to `n-1`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `n` must be at least as large as the number of iterations that occurred. The variable `i` will be equal to `n-1`, indicating the final index that was processed. The set `s` will contain all the elements from the list `arr` from the first element (index 0) to the last element (index `n-1`).
