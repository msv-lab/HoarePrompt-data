Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is `n-1`, `s` is a list containing all elements from `arr` from index 0 to `n-1` with a 0 prepended. The loop will break as soon as it finds any two consecutive elements in `s` where the difference is greater than 1. If no such pair is found, the number of iterations is odd, and `ans` is 1.**
