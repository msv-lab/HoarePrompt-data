To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `n` is the length of `s`.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `s` is a list containing all elements from `arr` from index 0 to `n-1` with a 0 prepended.
- `ans` is 1.
- `n` is not equal to 2.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, n - 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.
2. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will execute if the range `range(1, n - 1)` contains at least one value. This means that `n - 1` must be greater than 1, or equivalently, `n` must be greater than 2.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`n`**: For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 2.
- **`i`**: The initial value of `i` is `n-1`, but this is not relevant to the loop head condition. The loop will set `i` to values starting from 1 up to `n-2`.

### Final State:
- `n` must be greater than 2.
- `i` is not relevant to the loop head condition, so it remains as `n-1`.

### State:
**`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is `n-1`, `s` is a list containing all elements from `arr` from index 0 to `n-1` with a 0 prepended, `ans` is 1**
