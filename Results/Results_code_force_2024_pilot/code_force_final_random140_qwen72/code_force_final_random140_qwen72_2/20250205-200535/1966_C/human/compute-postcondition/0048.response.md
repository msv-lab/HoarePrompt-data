Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `s` contains `arr[0]`, `arr[1]`, and `arr[2]`**. 

Explanation: The code adds the element at index `i` (which is 2) of the array `arr` to the set `s`. Since `s` initially contained `arr[0]` and `arr[1]`, after executing the code, `s` now contains `arr[0]`, `arr[1]`, and `arr[2]`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.
