The value of `ans` is updated to `1 - ans`. Given the initial state, `ans` was either 0 or 1 depending on the condition checked before this line of code. If the difference between the second element of `s` and the first element of `s` (which is 0) was greater than 1, `ans` remained 1. Otherwise, `ans` was set to 0.

If `ans` was 1, it becomes 0. If `ans` was 0, it becomes 1. The other variables (`arr`, `n`, `i`, and `s`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `s` is a list containing 0 followed by all unique elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]`, `ans` is now 1 - its previous value.**
