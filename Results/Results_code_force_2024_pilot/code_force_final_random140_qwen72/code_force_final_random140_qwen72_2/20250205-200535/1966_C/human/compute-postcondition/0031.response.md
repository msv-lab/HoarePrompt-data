Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `s` is now a list containing 0 followed by the first `n` elements of `arr`, `i` is `n-1`. If `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is set to 1 - `ans`.***
