The code snippet `ans = 1 - ans` changes the value of `ans`. Initially, `ans` is 1. After executing the code, `ans` becomes `1 - 1`, which is 0. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `i` is 1, `s` is a list containing 0 followed by all unique elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]`, `ans` is 0, and the difference between `s[i]` and `s[i - 1]` is less than or equal to 1.**
