The code snippet assigns the value `1` to the variable `ans`. This assignment does not affect the other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the updated state reflects this change while keeping the rest of the initial state unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `s` is a list containing all unique elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]`, and `ans` is 1.**
