Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `i` is 1, `s` is a list containing 0 followed by all unique elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]`, `ans` is 1, and the difference between the second element of `s` and the first element of `s` (which is 0) is greater than 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
