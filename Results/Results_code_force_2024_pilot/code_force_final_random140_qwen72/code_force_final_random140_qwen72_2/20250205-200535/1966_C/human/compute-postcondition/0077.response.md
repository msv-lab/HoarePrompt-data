Postcondition: ***`n` is the length of `s`, `i` is `n-1`, `s` is a list containing all elements from `arr` from index 0 to `n-1` with a 0 prepended. If `n` is 2, `ans` remains 1. If `n` is greater than 2, the loop will break as soon as it finds any two consecutive elements in `s` where the difference is greater than 1. If no such pair is found, `ans` will be 1 if the number of iterations is odd, and 0 if the number of iterations is even.***
