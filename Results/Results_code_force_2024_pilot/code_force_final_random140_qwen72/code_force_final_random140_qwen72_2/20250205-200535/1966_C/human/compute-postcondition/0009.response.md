Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` must be greater than 2, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `s` is a set containing the first three elements of `arr`, `i` is 2.**

Explanation: The code adds the third element of the list `arr` to the set `s`, which initially contained the first two elements of `arr`. The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged. The set `s` now contains the first three elements of `arr`.
