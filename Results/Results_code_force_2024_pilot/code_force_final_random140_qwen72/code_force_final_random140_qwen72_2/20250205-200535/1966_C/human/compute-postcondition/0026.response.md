Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `s` is now a list containing 0 followed by the first `n` elements of `arr`, `i` is `n-2`, `ans` is 1**. 

Explanation: The value of `ans` was initially 0. After executing the line `ans = 1 - ans`, the value of `ans` is updated to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
