Based on the initial state and the provided Python code snippet:

- `t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `_` is a placeholder variable, typically used in loops where the variable is not needed.
- `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2.
- `arr` is a list of integers from the input.
- `s` is a list that starts with 0 followed by the first `n` elements of `arr`.
- `i` is set to `n-1`.
- `ans` is a variable that toggles between 0 and 1 based on the differences between consecutive elements in `s` from index 1 to `n-2`. If any difference `s[i] - s[i-1]` is greater than 1, the loop breaks, and `ans` retains its last value before the break. If no such difference is found, `ans` will end up being either 0 or 1 depending on the number of iterations and the initial value of `ans`.
- Additionally, `ans` is currently true (non-zero).

Given the `print` statement:
```python
print('Alice')
```

This statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'Alice'`.

Output: **Alice**
