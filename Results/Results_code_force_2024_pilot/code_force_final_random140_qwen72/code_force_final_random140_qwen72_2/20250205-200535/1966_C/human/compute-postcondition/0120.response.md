The function `func` accepts no parameters directly within its definition but is expected to process multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) indicating the number of test cases, and for each test case, it takes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of piles, followed by a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the initial number of stones in each pile. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.

The function processes each test case and returns a result for each test case. However, the specific output for each test case is not provided in the given information.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers representing the number of stones in each pile. It returns a result for each test case, though the specific nature of the result is not specified in the given information.**
