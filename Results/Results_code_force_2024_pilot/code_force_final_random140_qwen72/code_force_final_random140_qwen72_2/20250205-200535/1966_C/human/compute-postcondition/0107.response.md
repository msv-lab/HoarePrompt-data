Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `s` is a list containing 0 followed by all unique elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]`. If the difference between `s[i]` and `s[i - 1]` is greater than 1, `ans` remains 1 and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is set to 0 if it was initially 1, and `ans` remains 1 if it was initially 0.***
