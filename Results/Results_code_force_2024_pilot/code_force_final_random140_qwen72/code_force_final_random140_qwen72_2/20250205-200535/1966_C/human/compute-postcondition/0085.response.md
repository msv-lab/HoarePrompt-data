The code `s.add(arr[i])` adds the element at index `i` of the list `arr` to the set `s`. Given that `i` is equal to `n`, and `s` initially contains `arr[n-1]`, after executing the code, `s` will contain both `arr[n-1]` and `arr[n]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `s` is a set containing `arr[n-1]` and `arr[n]`, and `ans` is 1 if `n` is 2 or determined based on the conditions described.**
