Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution has a logical flaw in how it determines the winner of the game. The approach taken in the code is to check if the differences between consecutive unique elements in the array are all 1, which is not a correct strategy for this problem.

The correct approach to determine the winner in this game is to use the concept of Nim Game, specifically focusing on the XOR operation of the pile sizes. The key insight is that if the XOR of all pile sizes is non-zero, the first player (Alice) has a winning strategy; otherwise, the second player (Bob) has a winning strategy.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        xor_sum = 0
        for stone in arr:
            xor_sum ^= stone
        if xor_sum != 0:
            print('Alice')
        else:
            print('Bob')
```

This version correctly uses the XOR operation to determine the winner based on the game theory principles of the Nim Game.
