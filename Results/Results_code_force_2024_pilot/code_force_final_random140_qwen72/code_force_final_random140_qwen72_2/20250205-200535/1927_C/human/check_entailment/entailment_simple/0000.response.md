### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. It reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` for each test case, and then reads the elements of arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Data Structures**: The program uses `frozenset` for arrays `a` and `b`. This is efficient for checking membership, which is done multiple times in the program. Using sets ensures that each element is unique and allows for quick lookups.

3. **Initialization**: The variables `leftOnes`, `aOnes`, and `bOnes` are initialized to zero. These variables are used to count the number of elements from 1 to `k` that are present in both arrays, only in array `a`, and only in array `b`, respectively.

4. **First Loop**: The first loop iterates from 1 to `k` and checks the presence of each integer in `a` and `b`. It updates `leftOnes`, `aOnes`, and `bOnes` accordingly. If an integer from 1 to `k` is not found in either array, the loop breaks, indicating that it is impossible to form the required set of elements.

5. **Second Loop**: The second loop redistributes the elements counted in `leftOnes` between `aOnes` and `bOnes` to balance them. This ensures that the number of elements chosen from each array is as close to `k // 2` as possible.

6. **Final Check**: After the loops, the program checks if `aOnes` and `bOnes` are both equal to `k // 2`. If they are, it prints 'yes'; otherwise, it prints 'no'.

### Issues:
- **Redistribution Logic**: The redistribution logic in the second loop is correct but could be simplified. However, it does ensure that the counts are balanced.
- **Output Case Sensitivity**: The output should be case-insensitive according to the problem statement. The program outputs 'yes' and 'no' in lowercase, which is acceptable.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It handles all edge cases and constraints appropriately.

### Correctness:
**True**
