You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given an array a of n integers, an array b of m integers, and an even number k
.

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to choose exactly \frac{k}{2}
elements from both arrays in such a way that among the chosen elements, every
integer from 1 to k is included.

For example:

  * If a=[2, 3, 8, 5, 6, 5] , b=[1, 3, 4, 10, 5] , k=6 , then it is possible to choose elements with values 2, 3, 6 from array a and elements with values 1, 4, 5 from array b . In this case, all numbers from 1 to k=6 will be included among the chosen elements.
  * If a=[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 5] , b=[1, 3, 8, 10, 3] , k=6 , then it is not possible to choose elements in the required way. 

Note that you are not required to find a way to choose the elements — your
program should only check whether it is possible to choose the elements in the
required way.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
n, m \le 2\cdot10^5 , 2 \le k \le 2 \cdot \min(n, m) , k is even) — the length
of array a , the length of array b , and the number of elements to be chosen,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_j \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n and m over all test cases in a test
does not exceed 4 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to choose \frac{k}{2} numbers from
each array in such a way that among the chosen elements, every integer from 1
to k is included. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the first test case of the example, it is possible to choose elements equal
to 2 , 3 , and 6 from array a and elements equal to 1 , 4 , and 5 from array b
. Thus, all numbers from 1 to k=6 are included among the chosen elements.

In the second test case of the example, it can be shown that it is not
possible to choose exactly three elements from each array in the required way.

In the third test case of the example, it is possible to choose elements equal
to 1 and 3 from array a and elements equal to 2 and 4 from array b . Thus, all
numbers from 1 to k=4 are included among the chosen elements.

    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` is 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are the last set of integers provided by the user for the final test case, `a` and `b` are the last sets of integers provided by the user for the final test case, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is `leftOnes`, and `leftOnes` is the total number of integers from 1 to `k` that are in both `a` and `b`. The values of `aOnes` and `bOnes` will be such that their difference is minimized, with `aOnes` being incremented if it was initially less than `bOnes`, and `bOnes` being incremented otherwise. The final values of `aOnes` and `bOnes` will be as close to each other as possible, given the number of iterations (`leftOnes`). If `aOnes` and `bOnes` are both equal to `newk`, the output will be 'yes'. Otherwise, the output will be 'no'.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the lengths of arrays `a` and `b`, and the value of `k`.
   - It then reads the elements of arrays `a` and `b` and converts them into frozensets for efficient membership checking.

2. **Initialization**:
   - Initializes counters `leftOnes`, `aOnes`, and `bOnes` to zero.
   - Calculates `newk` as `k // 2`, which represents the number of elements to be chosen from each array.

3. **Checking Elements**:
   - Iterates through the integers from 1 to `k` and checks their presence in sets `a` and `b`.
   - If an integer `i` is present in both sets, it increments `leftOnes`.
   - If `i` is present only in `a`, it increments `aOnes`.
   - If `i` is present only in `b`, it increments `bOnes`.
   - If `i` is not present in either set, it breaks out of the loop, indicating that it is impossible to form the required set.

4. **Balancing the Counts**:
   - After the initial check, it attempts to balance the counts of `aOnes` and `bOnes` using the `leftOnes` count.
   - It iterates through the `leftOnes` and increments the smaller of `aOnes` and `bOnes` until they are balanced.

5. **Final Check**:
   - After balancing, it checks if both `aOnes` and `bOnes` are equal to `newk`.
   - If they are, it prints 'yes'; otherwise, it prints 'no'.

### Analysis:
- The logic correctly handles the problem requirements by ensuring that the chosen elements from both arrays cover all integers from 1 to `k`.
- The use of frozensets for membership checking is efficient.
- The balancing step ensures that the counts of chosen elements from both arrays are equal to `newk`.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for solving the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
