### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the lengths of arrays `a` and `b`, and the value of `k`.
   - It then reads the elements of arrays `a` and `b` and converts them into frozensets for efficient membership checking.

2. **Initialization**:
   - Initializes counters `leftOnes`, `aOnes`, and `bOnes` to zero.
   - Calculates `newk` as `k // 2`, which represents the number of elements to be chosen from each array.

3. **Checking Elements**:
   - Iterates through the integers from 1 to `k` and checks their presence in sets `a` and `b`.
   - If an integer `i` is present in both sets, it increments `leftOnes`.
   - If `i` is present only in `a`, it increments `aOnes`.
   - If `i` is present only in `b`, it increments `bOnes`.
   - If `i` is not present in either set, it breaks out of the loop, indicating that it is impossible to form the required set.

4. **Balancing the Counts**:
   - After the initial check, it attempts to balance the counts of `aOnes` and `bOnes` using the `leftOnes` count.
   - It iterates through the `leftOnes` and increments the smaller of `aOnes` and `bOnes` until they are balanced.

5. **Final Check**:
   - After balancing, it checks if both `aOnes` and `bOnes` are equal to `newk`.
   - If they are, it prints 'yes'; otherwise, it prints 'no'.

### Analysis:
- The logic correctly handles the problem requirements by ensuring that the chosen elements from both arrays cover all integers from 1 to `k`.
- The use of frozensets for membership checking is efficient.
- The balancing step ensures that the counts of chosen elements from both arrays are equal to `newk`.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for solving the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
