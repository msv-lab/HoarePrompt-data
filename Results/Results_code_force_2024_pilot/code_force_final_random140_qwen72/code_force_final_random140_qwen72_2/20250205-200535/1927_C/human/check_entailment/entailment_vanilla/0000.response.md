### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It then reads the elements of arrays `a` and `b` and converts them into frozensets for efficient membership checking.

2. **Initialization of Counters:**
   - `leftOnes` is initialized to count elements that are present in both `a` and `b`.
   - `aOnes` and `bOnes` are initialized to count elements that are present only in `a` and only in `b`, respectively.
   - `newk` is set to `k // 2` to represent the number of elements to be chosen from each array.

3. **Counting Elements:**
   - A loop iterates from 1 to `k` to check the presence of each integer in the sets `a` and `b`.
   - If an integer `i` is present in both `a` and `b`, `leftOnes` is incremented.
   - If `i` is present only in `a`, `aOnes` is incremented.
   - If `i` is present only in `b`, `bOnes` is incremented.
   - If `i` is not present in either set, the loop breaks early.

4. **Distributing Common Elements:**
   - Another loop runs `leftOnes` times to distribute the common elements between `aOnes` and `bOnes`.
   - The distribution is done to balance the counts of `aOnes` and `bOnes`.

5. **Final Check:**
   - After distributing the common elements, the function checks if `aOnes` and `bOnes` are both equal to `newk`.
   - If they are, it prints 'yes'; otherwise, it prints 'no'.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of Logic:**
  - The logic correctly identifies the presence of elements in both arrays and distributes them to ensure that each array contributes exactly `k // 2` unique elements.
  - The early break in the counting loop ensures that the function stops as soon as it finds a missing element, which is efficient.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The function handles edge cases where some elements are missing or where the arrays have fewer elements than required.
  - The use of frozensets ensures efficient membership checking, which is crucial for large inputs.

- **Output:**
  - The function correctly outputs 'yes' or 'no' based on the conditions specified in the problem statement.

The provided program is logically sound and handles the problem requirements correctly. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:
