#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·10^5 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 2·min(n, m), and k is even. Arrays a and b contain n and m integers respectively, where 1 ≤ a_i, b_j ≤ 10^6.
def func():
    for t in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = frozenset(map(int, input().split()))
        
        b = frozenset(map(int, input().split()))
        
        leftOnes = 0
        
        aOnes = 0
        
        bOnes = 0
        
        newk = k // 2
        
        i = 1
        
        while i <= k:
            if i in a and i in b:
                leftOnes += 1
            elif i in a:
                aOnes += 1
            elif i in b:
                bOnes += 1
            else:
                break
            i += 1
        
        i = 0
        
        while i < leftOnes:
            if aOnes < bOnes:
                aOnes += 1
            else:
                bOnes += 1
            i += 1
        
        if aOnes == newk and bOnes == newk:

    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` is 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are the last set of integers provided by the user for the final test case, `a` and `b` are the last sets of integers provided by the user for the final test case, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is `leftOnes`, and `leftOnes` is the total number of integers from 1 to `k` that are in both `a` and `b`. The values of `aOnes` and `bOnes` will be such that their difference is minimized, with `aOnes` being incremented if it was initially less than `bOnes`, and `bOnes` being incremented otherwise. The final values of `aOnes` and `bOnes` will be as close to each other as possible, given the number of iterations (`leftOnes`). If `aOnes` and `bOnes` are both equal to `newk`, the output will be 'yes'. Otherwise, the output will be 'no'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and two arrays `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m` respectively. It checks if it's possible to distribute the first `k` integers (where `k` is even) between the sets `a` and `b` such that each set contains exactly `k/2` of these integers. If this condition is met, the function prints 'yes' for that test case; otherwise, it prints 'no'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value.
