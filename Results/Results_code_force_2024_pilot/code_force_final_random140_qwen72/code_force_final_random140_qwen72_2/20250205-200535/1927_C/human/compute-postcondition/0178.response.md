To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the loop condition:

```python
while i < leftOnes:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

The loop will execute if `i` is less than `leftOnes`. Given the state right before the loop:

- `a` and `b` remain frozensets of integers provided by the user.
- `t` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `newk` is `k // 2`.
- `i` is 0.
- `leftOnes` is the total number of integers from 1 to `k` that are in both `a` and `b`.
- `aOnes` is the total number of integers from 1 to `k` that are in `a` but not in `b`.
- `bOnes` is the total number of integers from 1 to `k` that are in `b` but not in `a`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Condition**: The variables in the loop condition are `i` and `leftOnes`.
2. **Initial Values**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `leftOnes` is the total number of integers from 1 to `k` that are in both `a` and `b`.

3. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will execute if `i < leftOnes`.
   - Since `i` is 0, the loop will execute if `leftOnes` is greater than 0.

4. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - To ensure the loop executes at least once, `leftOnes` must be greater than 0.

### Conclusion:
The only adjustment needed is to ensure that `leftOnes` is greater than 0. All other states remain unchanged.

State: **`a` and `b` remain frozensets of integers provided by the user, `t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 0, `leftOnes` must be greater than 0, `aOnes` is the total number of integers from 1 to `k` that are in `a` but not in `b`, and `bOnes` is the total number of integers from 1 to `k` that are in `b` but not in `a`.**
