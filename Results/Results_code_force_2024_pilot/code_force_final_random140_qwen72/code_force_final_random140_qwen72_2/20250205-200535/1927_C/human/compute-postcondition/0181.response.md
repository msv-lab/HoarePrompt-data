Postcondition: **`a` and `b` remain frozensets of integers provided by the user, `t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 0, `leftOnes` must be greater than 0, `aOnes` is the total number of integers from 1 to `k` that are in `a` but not in `b`, and `bOnes` is the total number of integers from 1 to `k` that are in `b` but not in `a`. Additionally, `aOnes` is greater than or equal to `bOnes`.**
