To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `t` and the result of `int(input())`.

1. The variable `t` is already defined as an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, which means `t` is guaranteed to be a positive integer and thus the loop can potentially execute.
2. The loop iterates over the range produced by `int(input())`, which means the input must be a positive integer for the loop to execute at least once.

Given these points, the state needs to ensure that the input provided to the loop is a positive integer, and `t` should be set to 1 or more to align with its defined constraints.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `int(input())` must be a positive integer (at least 1)**
