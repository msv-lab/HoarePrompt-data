Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers provided by the user, `a` is a frozenset of integers provided by the user, `b` is a frozenset of integers provided by the user, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 0, `leftOnes` must be greater than 0, `aOnes` is the number of integers from 1 to `k` that are in `a` but not in `b`, and `bOnes` is the number of integers from 1 to `k` that are in `b` but not in `a`. Additionally, `aOnes` is greater than or equal to `bOnes`.***
