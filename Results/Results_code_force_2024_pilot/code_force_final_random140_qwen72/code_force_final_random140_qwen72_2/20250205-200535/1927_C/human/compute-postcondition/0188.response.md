Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` remain frozensets of integers provided by the user, `t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 1, `leftOnes` must be greater than 1. If `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is incremented by 1 and remains less than or equal to `bOnes`. Otherwise, `bOnes` is incremented by 1 and `aOnes` remains greater than or equal to `bOnes`.***
