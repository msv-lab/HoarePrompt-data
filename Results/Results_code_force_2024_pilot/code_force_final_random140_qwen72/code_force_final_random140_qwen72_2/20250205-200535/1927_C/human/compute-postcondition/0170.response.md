Output State: **`a` is a frozenset of integers provided by the user, `b` is a new frozenset of integers provided by the user, `t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 2, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 3, `leftOnes` is incremented by 1 if `i` (now 2) was in both `a` and `b`, `aOnes` is incremented by 1 if `i` (now 2) was in `a` but not in `b`, `bOnes` is incremented by 1 if `i` (now 2) was in `b` but not in `a`, `bOnes` is incremented by 1.** 

In natural language, the output state is: `a` remains a frozenset of integers provided by the user, `b` remains a new frozenset of integers provided by the user, `t` is still 0, `n` is still an input integer, `m` is still an input integer, `k` is still greater than or equal to 2, `newk` is still `k // 2`, `i` is still 3, `leftOnes` is still incremented by 1 if `i` (now 2) was in both `a` and `b`, `aOnes` is still incremented by 1 if `i` (now 2) was in `a` but not in `b`, `bOnes` is now incremented by 1 more than its previous value, indicating that `i` (now 2) was in `b` but not in `a`.
