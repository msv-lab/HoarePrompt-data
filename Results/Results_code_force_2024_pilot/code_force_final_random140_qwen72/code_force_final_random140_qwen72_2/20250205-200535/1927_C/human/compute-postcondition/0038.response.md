Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers provided by the user, `a` is a frozenset of integers provided by the user, `b` is a frozenset of integers provided by the user, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 4, `leftOnes` is 1, `k` must be greater than or equal to 4. If `i` (which is 4) is in `b`, `bOnes` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.***
