Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `t` is 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are the last set of integers provided by the user for the final test case, `a` and `b` are the last sets of integers provided by the user for the final test case, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is `leftOnes`, and `leftOnes` is the total number of integers from 1 to `k` that are in both `a` and `b`. The values of `aOnes` and `bOnes` will be such that their difference is minimized, with `aOnes` being incremented if it was initially less than `bOnes`, and `bOnes` being incremented otherwise. The final values of `aOnes` and `bOnes` will be as close to each other as possible, given the number of iterations (`leftOnes`). If `aOnes` and `bOnes` are both equal to `newk`, the output will be 'yes'. Otherwise, the output will be 'no'.**
