Postcondition: **`a` and `b` are frozensets of integers provided by the user, `t` is `t + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 0, `leftOnes` is the number of integers from 1 to `k` that are in both `a` and `b` and `leftOnes` must be greater than 0, `aOnes` is the number of integers from 1 to `k` that are in `a` but not in `b`, `bOnes` is the number of integers from 1 to `k` that are in `b` but not in `a`. `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`.**
