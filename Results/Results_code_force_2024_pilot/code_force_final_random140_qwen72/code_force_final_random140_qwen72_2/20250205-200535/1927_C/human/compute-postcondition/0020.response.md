Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers provided by the user, `a` is a frozenset of integers provided by the user, `b` is a frozenset of integers provided by the user, `leftOnes` is 0, `aOnes` is 0, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 1, and `i` is not in `a`. If `i` is in `b`, then `bOnes` is 1. Otherwise, `bOnes` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
