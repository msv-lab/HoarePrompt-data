Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `a` and `b` are frozensets of integers provided by the user.
- `t` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `newk` is `k // 2`.
- `i` is `leftOnes`.
- `leftOnes` is the total number of integers from 1 to `k` that are in both `a` and `b`.
- After all iterations, `aOnes` and `bOnes` will be such that their difference is minimized, with `aOnes` being incremented if it was initially less than `bOnes`, and `bOnes` being incremented otherwise.
- The final values of `aOnes` and `bOnes` will be as close to each other as possible, given the number of iterations (`leftOnes`).
- Additionally, `aOnes` is equal to `newk` and `bOnes` is equal to `newk`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('yes')
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'yes'`.
- The initial state provides a detailed context about the variables and their values, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
- The `print` statement is independent of the initial state and will always print the string `'yes'`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'yes'`.

Output: **yes**
