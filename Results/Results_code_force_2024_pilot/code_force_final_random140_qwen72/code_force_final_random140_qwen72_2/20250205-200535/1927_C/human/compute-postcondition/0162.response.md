Output State: **`a` is a frozenset of integers provided by the user, `b` is a new frozenset of integers provided by the user, `t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than or equal to 2, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 2, and the values of `leftOnes`, `aOnes`, and `bOnes` depend on whether `i` (now 2) is in `a` and/or `b`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
