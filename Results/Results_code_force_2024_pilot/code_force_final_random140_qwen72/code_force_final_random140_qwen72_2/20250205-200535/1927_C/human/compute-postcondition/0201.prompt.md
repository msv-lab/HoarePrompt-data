Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·10^5 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 2·min(n, m), and k is even. Arrays a and b contain n and m integers respectively, where 1 ≤ a_i, b_j ≤ 10^6.
Code of the loop:
for t in range(int(input())):
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = frozenset(map(int, input().split()))
    b = frozenset(map(int, input().split()))
    leftOnes = 0
    aOnes = 0
    bOnes = 0
    newk = k // 2
    i = 1
    while i <= k:
        if i in a and i in b:
            leftOnes += 1
        elif i in a:
            aOnes += 1
        elif i in b:
            bOnes += 1
        else:
            break
        i += 1
    i = 0
    while i < leftOnes:
        if aOnes < bOnes:
            aOnes += 1
        else:
            bOnes += 1
        i += 1
    if aOnes == newk and bOnes == newk:
        print('yes')
    else:
        print('no')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *After all iterations of the loop, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers provided by the user, `a` is a frozenset of integers provided by the user, `b` is a frozenset of integers provided by the user, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is equal to `leftOnes`, and `leftOnes` is the number of integers from 1 to `k` that are in both `a` and `b`. The value of `aOnes` will be the initial `aOnes` plus the number of times `aOnes` was less than `bOnes` during the loop, and the value of `bOnes` will be the initial `bOnes` plus the number of times `bOnes` was less than or equal to `aOnes` during the loop. If `aOnes` is equal to `newk` and `bOnes` is equal to `newk`, then both `aOnes` and `bOnes` are equal to `newk`. Otherwise, either `aOnes` is not equal to `newk` or `bOnes` is not equal to `newk` (or both).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *After the loop executes all iterations, `a` and `b` are frozensets of integers provided by the user, `t` is `t + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is `leftOnes`, and `leftOnes` is the number of integers from 1 to `k` that are in both `a` and `b`. If `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` has been incremented by `leftOnes` and remains less than or equal to `bOnes`. Otherwise, `bOnes` has been incremented by `leftOnes` and remains greater than or equal to `aOnes`. After the loop, if `aOnes` is equal to `newk` and `bOnes` is equal to `newk`, then both `aOnes` and `bOnes` are equal to `newk`. Otherwise, either `aOnes` is not equal to `newk` or `bOnes` is not equal to `newk` (or both).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`a` and `b` remain frozensets of integers provided by the user, `t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is `leftOnes`, and `leftOnes` is the total number of integers from 1 to `k` that are in both `a` and `b`. After all iterations, `aOnes` and `bOnes` will be such that their difference is minimized, with `aOnes` being incremented if it was initially less than `bOnes`, and `bOnes` being incremented otherwise. The final values of `aOnes` and `bOnes` will be as close to each other as possible, given the number of iterations (`leftOnes`). If `aOnes` and `bOnes` are both equal to `newk`, they will remain so. Otherwise, at least one of `aOnes` or `bOnes` will not be equal to `newk`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
