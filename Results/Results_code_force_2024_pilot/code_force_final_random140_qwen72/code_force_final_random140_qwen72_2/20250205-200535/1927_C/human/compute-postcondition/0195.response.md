Output State: **`a` and `b` remain frozensets of integers provided by the user, `t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is `leftOnes`, `leftOnes` is the total number of integers from 1 to `k` that are in both `a` and `b`. After all iterations, `aOnes` and `bOnes` will be such that their difference is minimized, with `aOnes` being incremented if it was initially less than `bOnes`, and `bOnes` being incremented otherwise. The final values of `aOnes` and `bOnes` will be as close to each other as possible, given the number of iterations (`leftOnes`).**
