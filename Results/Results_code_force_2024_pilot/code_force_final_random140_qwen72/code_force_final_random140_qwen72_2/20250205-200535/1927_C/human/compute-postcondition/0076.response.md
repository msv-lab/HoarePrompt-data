To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the loop condition:

```python
while i <= k:
```

The loop will execute if `i` is less than or equal to `k`.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `i` is 1
- `k` is an input integer

For the loop to execute at least once, `i` (which is 1) must be less than or equal to `k`. Therefore, `k` must be at least 1.

Since `i` is already 1, no adjustment is needed for `i`. The only adjustment needed is to ensure that `k` is at least 1.

Thus, the modified state is:
State: **`a` is a frozenset of integers provided by the user, `t` is `t + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than or equal to 1, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 1, `leftOnes` is 0, `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 0, `b` is a frozenset of integers provided by the user, and if `aOnes` is equal to `newk` and `bOnes` is equal to `newk`, then both `aOnes` and `bOnes` are equal to `newk`. Otherwise, either `aOnes` is not equal to `newk` or `bOnes` is not equal to `newk` (or both).**
