Output State: **`a` is a frozenset of integers provided by the user, `b` is a new frozenset of integers provided by the user, `t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is `leftOnes`, `leftOnes` is 0, if `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` has been incremented by `leftOnes` and remains less than or equal to `bOnes`. Otherwise, `bOnes` has been incremented by `leftOnes` and remains greater than or equal to `aOnes`. After the loop, if `aOnes` is equal to `newk` and `bOnes` is equal to `newk`, then both `aOnes` and `bOnes` are equal to `newk`. Otherwise, either `aOnes` is not equal to `newk` or `bOnes` is not equal to `newk` (or both). The input integer for the range must be greater than 0, `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 0.**
