Postcondition: ***`a` is a frozenset of integers provided by the user, `b` is a new frozenset of integers provided by the user, `t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 2, `newk` is `k // 2`, and `i` is 2. If `i` (now 2) is in both `a` and `b`, `leftOnes` is incremented by 1. If `i` is in `a` but not in `b`, `aOnes` is incremented by 1. If `i` is in `b` but not in `a`, `bOnes` is incremented by 1. If `i` is not in either `a` or `b`, the values of `leftOnes`, `aOnes`, and `bOnes` remain unchanged.***
