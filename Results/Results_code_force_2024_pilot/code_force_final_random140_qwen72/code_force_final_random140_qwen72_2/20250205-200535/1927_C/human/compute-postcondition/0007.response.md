Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers provided by the user, `a` is a frozenset of integers provided by the user, `b` is a frozenset of integers provided by the user, `leftOnes` is 0, `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 0, `newk` is `k // 2`.**

Explanation: The variable `newk` is assigned the value of `k` divided by 2 using integer division (which means the result is the floor of the division). All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
