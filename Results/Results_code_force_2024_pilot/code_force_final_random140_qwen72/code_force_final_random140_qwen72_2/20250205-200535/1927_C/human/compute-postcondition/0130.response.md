Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State Analysis:
1. **`a` and `b`**: These are frozensets of integers provided by the user.
2. **`t`**: This variable is incremented by 1 after the loop executes all iterations.
3. **`n`, `m`, `k`**: These are input integers.
4. **`newk`**: This is the result of `k // 2`.
5. **`i`**: This is set to `leftOnes`.
6. **`leftOnes`**: This is the number of integers from 1 to `k` that are in both `a` and `b`.
7. **`aOnes` and `bOnes`**: 
   - If `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is incremented by `leftOnes` and remains less than or equal to `bOnes`.
   - Otherwise, `bOnes` is incremented by `leftOnes` and remains greater than or equal to `aOnes`.
   - Both `aOnes` and `bOnes` are equal to `newk`.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print('yes')
```

### Explanation:
- The print statement simply prints the string `'yes'`.
- The initial state provides detailed information about the variables and their relationships, but it does not affect the output of the print statement directly because the print statement is printing a fixed string.

### Final Output:
Output: **yes**
