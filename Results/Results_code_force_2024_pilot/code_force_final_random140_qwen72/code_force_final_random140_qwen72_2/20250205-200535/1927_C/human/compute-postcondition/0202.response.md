The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the parameter constraints and relationships described, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts multiple parameters including `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. Here’s the breakdown:

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·10^5.
  - `k` is an integer where 2 ≤ k ≤ 2·min(n, m), and `k` is even.
  - `a` and `b` are arrays containing `n` and `m` integers respectively, where 1 ≤ a_i, b_j ≤ 10^6.

The function processes these parameters and returns a result based on the given constraints and relationships. However, the specific output is not detailed in the problem statement, so I will describe the general functionality based on the provided information.

Functionality: **The function accepts the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it accepts integers `n` and `m`, an even integer `k`, and two arrays `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m` respectively. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case based on the given constraints.**
