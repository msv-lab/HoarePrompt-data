Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers provided by the user, `a` is a frozenset of integers provided by the user, `b` is a frozenset of integers provided by the user, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 2, and `leftOnes` must be greater than 1. If `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, `aOnes` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `bOnes` is increased by 1.**
