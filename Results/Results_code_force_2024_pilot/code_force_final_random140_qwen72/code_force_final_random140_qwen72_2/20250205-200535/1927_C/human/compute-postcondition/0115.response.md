Output State: **`a` and `b` are frozensets of integers provided by the user, `t` is `t + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is 0, `leftOnes` is the number of integers from 1 to `k` that are in both `a` and `b` and `leftOnes` must be greater than 0, `aOnes` is the number of integers from 1 to `k` that are in `a` but not in `b`, `bOnes` is the number of integers from 1 to `k` that are in `b` but not in `a` plus 1. If `aOnes` is equal to `newk` and `bOnes` is equal to `newk`, then both `aOnes` and `bOnes` are equal to `newk`. Otherwise, either `aOnes` is not equal to `newk` or `bOnes` is not equal to `newk` (or both). Additionally, `aOnes` is greater than or equal to `bOnes`.**
