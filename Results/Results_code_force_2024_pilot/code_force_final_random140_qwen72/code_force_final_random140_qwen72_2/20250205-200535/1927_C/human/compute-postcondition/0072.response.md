Output State: **`a` is a frozenset of integers provided by the user, `t` is `t + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `newk` is `k // 2`, `i` is equal to `leftOnes`, `leftOnes` is 0, `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is the initial `bOnes` plus the number of times `bOnes` was less than or equal to `aOnes` during the loop, `b` is a frozenset of integers provided by the user, and if `aOnes` is equal to `newk` and `bOnes` is equal to `newk`, then both `aOnes` and `bOnes` are equal to `newk`. Otherwise, either `aOnes` is not equal to `newk` or `bOnes` is not equal to `newk` (or both).**
