Reasoning:  
The program aims to find the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that sums up to a given integer `n`. The logic of the program is based on the distribution of the total sum across three letters, ensuring the result is the smallest possible word lexicographically.

1. **Case Analysis**:
   - If `n` is less than or equal to 26, it means the sum can be represented by a combination of 'a', 'a', and a third letter. The program correctly sets `a` and `b` to 'a' and calculates the third letter `c` as `chr(96 + (n - 2))`.
   - If `n` is between 27 and 52, the program correctly identifies that the first letter should be 'a', and the remaining sum is distributed between the second and third letters, with the third letter being 'z'. The second letter is calculated as `chr(96 + (n - 27))`.
   - If `n` is greater than 52, the program correctly sets the first letter to the appropriate value and both the second and third letters to 'z'.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `n` is exactly 3 by setting all letters to 'a', which is correct.
   - It also handles the upper limit of 78 by distributing the sum appropriately across the three letters.

3. **Lexicographical Order**:
   - The program ensures that the resulting word is the smallest lexicographically by always trying to minimize the first letter, then the second, and finally the third.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The program prints the result in the correct format for each test case.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
