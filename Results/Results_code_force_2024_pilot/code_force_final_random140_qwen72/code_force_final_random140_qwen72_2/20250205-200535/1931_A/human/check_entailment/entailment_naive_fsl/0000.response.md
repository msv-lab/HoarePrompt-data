Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic used to determine the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` is flawed and does not cover all possible values of `n`. Here is a specific case where the program fails:

- **Test Case**: `n = 48`
- **Expected Output**: `auz`
- **Actual Output**: `azz`

In the provided program, the logic for determining the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` is based on fixed conditions that do not account for all possible values of `n`. For example, when `n = 48`, the program incorrectly sets `a` to `a`, `b` to `z`, and `c` to `z`, resulting in `azz`, which is not the lexicographically smallest word that sums to 48. The correct output should be `auz`.

To fix this, the program needs to more dynamically determine the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` to ensure that the lexicographically smallest word is always produced.
