Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly handle all possible values of `n` to find the lexicographically smallest word. Specifically, the logic for determining the characters `a`, `b`, and `c` is flawed and does not cover all cases. Here's a more detailed breakdown:

1. **Case Handling**:
   - The code divides the problem into three cases based on `n // 26`. However, this division is not comprehensive enough to cover all possible values of `n` (3 to 78).

2. **Incorrect Character Assignment**:
   - The character assignments for `a`, `b`, and `c` are not always correct. For example, when `n` is 55, the code assigns `a = 'c'`, `b = 'z'`, and `c = 'z'`, which is correct, but it fails for other values like `n = 48`.

3. **General Solution**:
   - A more general approach is needed to ensure that the lexicographically smallest word is found for any value of `n` within the range 3 to 78. This involves distributing the total sum among the three characters while ensuring the smallest possible values are used.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = 1
    b = 1
    c = n - 2  # Start with the largest possible value for c

    # Adjust b and c to ensure they are valid and minimize the lexicographical order
    if c > 26:
        b += (c - 26)
        c = 26
    if b > 26:
        a += (b - 26)
        b = 26

    # Convert indices to characters
    a_char = chr(a + 96)
    b_char = chr(b + 96)
    c_char = chr(c + 96)

    print(a_char + b_char + c_char)
```

This corrected version ensures that the lexicographically smallest word is found for any valid `n` by adjusting the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` appropriately.
