### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the original assessment step-by-step.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to find the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that sums to a given integer `n`.
- The letters are indexed from 1 to 26, with 'a' being 1 and 'z' being 26.
- The sum of the indices of the three letters should equal `n`.

#### Program Analysis:
The program uses a series of `if-elif` statements to determine the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` based on the value of `n` divided by 26. Let's break down each case:

1. **Case 1: `n // 26 == 0`**
   - This means `n` is between 3 and 25.
   - The program sets `a` and `b` to 'a' (index 1) and `c` to the character corresponding to `n - 2`.
   - Example: For `n = 24`, `a = 'a'`, `b = 'a'`, `c = 'v'` (since `24 - 2 = 22` and `chr(96 + 22) = 'v'`).

2. **Case 2: `n // 26 == 1`**
   - This means `n` is between 27 and 51.
   - The program sets `a` to 'a' (index 1), `b` to the character corresponding to `n - 27`, and `c` to 'z' (index 26).
   - Example: For `n = 48`, `a = 'a'`, `b = 'u'` (since `48 - 27 = 21` and `chr(96 + 21) = 'u'`), `c = 'z'`.

3. **Case 3: `n // 26 == 2`**
   - This means `n` is between 52 and 78.
   - The program sets `a` to the character corresponding to `n - 52`, and both `b` and `c` to 'z' (index 26).
   - Example: For `n = 70`, `a = 'r'` (since `70 - 52 = 18` and `chr(96 + 18) = 'r'`), `b = 'z'`, `c = 'z'`.

#### Original Assessment:
The original assessment states that the program is incorrect because it does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it mentions the test case `n = 48` where the expected output is `auz` but the actual output is `azz`.

#### Evaluation:
Let's verify the program with the test case `n = 48`:
- According to the program, for `n = 48`:
  - `n // 26 == 1` (which is true).
  - `a = 'a'`, `b = 'u'` (since `48 - 27 = 21` and `chr(96 + 21) = 'u'`), `c = 'z'`.
  - The output is `auz`.

This matches the expected output, so the program is correct for this test case.

However, let's consider another test case to ensure the program handles all cases correctly:
- For `n = 55`:
  - `n // 26 == 2` (which is true).
  - `a = 'c'` (since `55 - 52 = 3` and `chr(96 + 3) = 'c'`), `b = 'z'`, `c = 'z'`.
  - The output is `czz`.

This also matches the expected output.

Given these evaluations, the program appears to handle all cases correctly and produces the lexicographically smallest word for the given `n`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True** (The given program is correct.)
