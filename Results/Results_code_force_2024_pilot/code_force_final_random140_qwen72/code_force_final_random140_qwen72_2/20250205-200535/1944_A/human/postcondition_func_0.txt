The function `func_1` accepts two integers, `n` and `k`, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 100` and `0 ≤ k ≤ n * (n - 1) / 2`. It returns `1` if `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`. Otherwise, it returns the value of `n`. After the function concludes, the program will have either returned `1` or the integer `n` within the specified range.
