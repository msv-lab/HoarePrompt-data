The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the value `qs`. Since `_` is just a placeholder and does not affect the loop's execution, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `qs`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `qs` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute one more time. After each iteration, `qs` is implicitly decremented by 1.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `qs` must be greater than 0 before the next iteration starts.

State: **`t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n * (n - 1) / 2, `qs` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer, `k` is reduced by the sum of the first `m` terms of the sequence `n-1, n-2, ..., 1` where `m` is the number of iterations the loop runs, and `reachable_count` is equal to `n - m`.**
