The provided code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state specifies that `n` and `k` are already integers within certain ranges, but the new values of `n` and `k` will overwrite these initial values based on the input.

Output State: **`t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `qs` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `reachable_count` is equal to `n - m` where `m` is the number of iterations the loop runs.**
