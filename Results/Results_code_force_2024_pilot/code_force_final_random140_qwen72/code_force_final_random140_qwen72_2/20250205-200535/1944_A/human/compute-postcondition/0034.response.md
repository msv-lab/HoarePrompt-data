Output State: **`t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is an input integer, `k` is now greater than `(n * (n - 1) // 2) - (n - 1)` and the adjusted value of `k` must be greater than or equal to 1, `qs` must be greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder, `reachable_count` is equal to `n - 1`.** 

The value of `reachable_count` is decremented by 1, changing from `n` to `n - 1`. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
