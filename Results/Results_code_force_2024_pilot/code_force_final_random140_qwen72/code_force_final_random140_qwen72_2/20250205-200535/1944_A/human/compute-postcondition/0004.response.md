The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `k` is an integer where 0 ≤ k ≤ n * (n - 1) / 2. 

- Case_1: The program returns 1.
- Case_2: The program returns the integer `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers, `n` and `k`, and return either 1 or the value of `n` based on certain conditions.

Functionality: **The function accepts two integers, `n` and `k`, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n * (n - 1) / 2. It returns 1 in one case, and in another case, it returns the value of `n`.**
