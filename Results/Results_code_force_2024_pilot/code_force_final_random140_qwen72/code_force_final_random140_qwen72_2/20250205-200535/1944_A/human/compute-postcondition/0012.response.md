Output State: **`k` is now `k - (reachable_count - 2)` and must remain greater than or equal to `n - 3` and greater than 0, `reachable_count` is now `reachable_count - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `reachable_count` is decremented by 1.
- The condition for `k` remains the same, but since `reachable_count` has been updated, `k` is now `k - (reachable_count - 2)`.
- All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
