Output State: **`t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is an input integer, `k` is now `k - (n * (n - 1) // 2)`, `qs` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `reachable_count` is equal to 1.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`n`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`k`**: The value of `k` is reduced by the sum of the first `n-1` positive integers, which is `n * (n - 1) // 2`. This is because each iteration of the loop reduces `k` by `reachable_count - 1`, and `reachable_count` decreases by 1 each time.
- **`qs`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`_`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`reachable_count`**: After all iterations, `reachable_count` will be 1, as it is decremented by 1 in each iteration until the loop condition is no longer satisfied.
