To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute at least once, let's analyze the conditions in the `while` loop:

```python
while k >= reachable_count - 1 and k > 0:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition 1: `k >= reachable_count - 1`**
   - For the loop to execute, `k` must be greater than or equal to `reachable_count - 1`.
   - Given that `reachable_count` is equal to `n`, the condition becomes `k >= n - 1`.

2. **Condition 2: `k > 0`**
   - For the loop to execute, `k` must be greater than 0.

### Current State:
- `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3 (not relevant to the loop condition).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `qs` must be greater than 0 (not relevant to the loop condition).
- `_` is a placeholder (not relevant to the loop condition).
- `reachable_count` is equal to `n`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The loop will execute if both conditions are met:
  - `k >= n - 1`
  - `k > 0`

Given the current state, `k` must be greater than 0 and at least as large as `n - 1` for the loop to execute. Therefore, we need to ensure that `k` is at least `n - 1` and greater than 0.

### Final State:
State: **`t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than 0 and at least `n - 1`, `qs` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `reachable_count` is equal to `n`**
