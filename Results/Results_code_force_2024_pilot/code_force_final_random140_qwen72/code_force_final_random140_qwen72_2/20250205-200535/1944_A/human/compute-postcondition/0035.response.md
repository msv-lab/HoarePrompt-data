To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions in the loop head:

```python
while k >= reachable_count - 1 and k > 0:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition 1: `k >= reachable_count - 1`**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `k` is greater than \((n * (n - 1) // 2) - (n - 1)\).
   - `reachable_count` is equal to `n - 1`.
   - Therefore, the condition `k >= reachable_count - 1` translates to `k >= (n - 1) - 1`, which simplifies to `k >= n - 2`.

2. **Condition 2: `k > 0`**
   - This condition ensures that `k` is positive.

### Current State:
- `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is now greater than \((n * (n - 1) // 2) - (n - 1)\) and must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `qs` must be greater than 1.
- `_` is a placeholder.
- `reachable_count` is equal to `n - 1`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must satisfy both conditions:
  - `k >= n - 2`
  - `k > 0`

Since `k` is already greater than \((n * (n - 1) // 2) - (n - 1)\), which is a larger value than `n - 2` for any valid `n`, the first condition is already satisfied. The second condition `k > 0` is also satisfied because `k` is greater than or equal to 1.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state for the loop to execute one more time.

### Final State:
State: **`t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is an input integer, `k` is now greater than \((n * (n - 1) // 2) - (n - 1)\) and must be greater than or equal to 1, `qs` must be greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder, `reachable_count` is equal to `n - 1`**
