The value of `k` is updated by subtracting `reachable_count - 1` from its current value. Given that `reachable_count` is equal to `n - 1`, the expression `reachable_count - 1` simplifies to `(n - 1) - 1`, which is `n - 2`. Therefore, `k` is reduced by `n - 2`.

Output State: **`t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is an input integer, `k` is now `k - (n - 2)` and must be greater than or equal to `2n - 3` and greater than `n - 1`, `qs` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `reachable_count` is equal to `n - 1`**
