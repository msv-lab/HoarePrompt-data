To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions in the loop head:

```python
while k >= reachable_count - 1 and k > 0:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The variables in the loop head are `k` and `reachable_count`.

2. **Current State:**
   - `k` is now `k - (n - 1)`.
   - `reachable_count` is equal to `n - 1`.
   - `k` must be at least `n - 1` and greater than 0.

3. **Conditions for the Loop to Execute Again:**
   - The loop will execute again if both conditions are met:
     - `k >= reachable_count - 1`
     - `k > 0`

4. **Evaluate the Conditions:**
   - `reachable_count` is `n - 1`.
   - Therefore, `reachable_count - 1` is `(n - 1) - 1 = n - 2`.

5. **Check the Current Values:**
   - `k` is `k - (n - 1)`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `k` must be at least `n - 2` and greater than 0.

6. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - Since `k` is already `k - (n - 1)`, we need to ensure that `k` is still greater than or equal to `n - 2` and greater than 0.
   - This means `k` must be at least `n - 1` before the adjustment (since `k - (n - 1)` should be at least `n - 2`).

### Conclusion:
- The only variable that needs to be adjusted is `k` to ensure it meets the conditions for the loop to execute again.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n * (n - 1) / 2, `qs` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer, `k` is now `k - (n - 1)`, `reachable_count` is equal to `n - 1`, and `k` must be at least `n - 2` and greater than 0.**
