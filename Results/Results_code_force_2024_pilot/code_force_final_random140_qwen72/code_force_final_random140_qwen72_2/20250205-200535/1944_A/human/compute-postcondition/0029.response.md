The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `qs`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `qs`. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not affect the loop condition. At the end of the last iteration, `qs` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `qs` must be decremented by 1 but still remain greater than 0.

State: **`t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is an input integer, `k` is now `k - (n * (n - 1) // 2)`, `qs` must be greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder, `reachable_count` is equal to 1**
