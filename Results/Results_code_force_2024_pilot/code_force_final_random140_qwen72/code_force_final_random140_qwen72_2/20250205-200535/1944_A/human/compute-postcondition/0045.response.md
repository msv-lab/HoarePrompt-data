Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `qs` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input. It then calculates and prints a value `reachable_count` which represents the number of reachable nodes in a graph with `n` nodes and `k` edges, under certain conditions. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but it prints the `reachable_count` for each test case. The state of the program after the function concludes is that `qs` is 0, and the input has been fully processed. **
