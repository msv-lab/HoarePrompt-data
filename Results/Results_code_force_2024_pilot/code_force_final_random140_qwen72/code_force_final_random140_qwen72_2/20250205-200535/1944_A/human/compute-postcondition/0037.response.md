The value of `reachable_count` is decremented by 1. Since `reachable_count` was initially equal to `n - 1`, after the decrement, `reachable_count` is now equal to `n - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is an input integer, `k` is now greater than \((n * (n - 1) // 2) - (n - 1) - (n - 2)\) and must be greater than or equal to 1, `qs` must be greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder, `reachable_count` is equal to `n - 2`.**
