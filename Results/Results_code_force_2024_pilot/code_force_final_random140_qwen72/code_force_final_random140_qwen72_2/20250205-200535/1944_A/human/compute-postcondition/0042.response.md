Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is now greater than or equal to 0.
- `qs` must be greater than 1.
- `_` is a placeholder.
- `reachable_count` is equal to 1.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print(reachable_count)
```

Given that `reachable_count` is explicitly stated to be equal to 1, the `print` statement will output the value of `reachable_count`.

Output: **1**
