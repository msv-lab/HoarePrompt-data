Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit after Dominater destroys up to \( k \) bridges. The key insight is that if Dominater can destroy \( k \geq n - 1 \) bridges, then Everule can be isolated from all other islands, leaving only island 1 accessible. Otherwise, Everule can still visit all \( n \) islands because the remaining bridges will still form a connected graph.

Let's analyze the provided program:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \).

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - If \( k \geq n - 1 \), the function returns 1. This is correct because if Dominater can destroy \( n - 1 \) or more bridges, Everule can be isolated from all other islands.
   - Otherwise, the function returns \( n \). This is also correct because if fewer than \( n - 1 \) bridges are destroyed, Everule can still visit all \( n \) islands.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result of `func_1(n, k)` for each test case.

The logic in the function `func_1` correctly implements the required behavior based on the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
