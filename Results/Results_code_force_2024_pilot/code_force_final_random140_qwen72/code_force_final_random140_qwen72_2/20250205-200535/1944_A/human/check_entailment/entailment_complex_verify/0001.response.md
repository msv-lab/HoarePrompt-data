### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have `n` islands initially fully connected.
   - Dominater can destroy up to `k` bridges to minimize the number of islands Everule can visit.
   - We need to find the minimum number of islands Everule can visit after the optimal destruction of bridges.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - If `k >= n - 1`, Dominater can destroy enough bridges to isolate island 1 from all other islands. This means Everule can only visit island 1.
   - If `k < n - 1`, Dominater cannot isolate island 1 completely, so Everule can still visit all `n` islands.

3. **Function Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1(n, k)` checks if `k >= n - 1`.
     - If true, it returns 1, indicating that Everule can only visit island 1.
     - If false, it returns `n`, indicating that Everule can visit all `n` islands.

4. **Test Cases:**
   - For `n = 2` and `k = 0`, `k < n - 1` is false, so the function returns `n = 2`.
   - For `n = 2` and `k = 1`, `k >= n - 1` is true, so the function returns 1.
   - For `n = 4` and `k = 1`, `k < n - 1` is true, so the function returns `n = 4`.
   - For `n = 5` and `k = 10`, `k >= n - 1` is true, so the function returns 1.
   - For `n = 5` and `k = 3`, `k < n - 1` is true, so the function returns `n = 5`.
   - For `n = 4` and `k = 4`, `k >= n - 1` is true, so the function returns 1.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The function correctly handles all the test cases and follows the logic described in the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly determines the minimum number of islands Everule can visit based on the given constraints and logic.

Final: **True**
