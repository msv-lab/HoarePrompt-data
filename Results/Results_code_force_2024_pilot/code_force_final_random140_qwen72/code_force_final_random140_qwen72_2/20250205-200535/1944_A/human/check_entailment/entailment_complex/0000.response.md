Reasoning:

The problem requires us to find the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit after Dominater destroys up to \( k \) bridges. The key insight here is that if Dominater can destroy \( k \geq n - 1 \) bridges, they can isolate island 1 from all other islands, leaving Everule with only island 1 to visit. If \( k < n - 1 \), Dominater cannot isolate island 1 completely, and Everule can still visit all \( n \) islands because the remaining bridges will still form a connected graph.

Let's break down the logic of the provided function `func_1`:

1. **Condition Check**: The function checks if \( k \geq n - 1 \).
   - If true, it means Dominater can destroy enough bridges to isolate island 1, so the function returns 1.
   - If false, it means Dominater cannot isolate island 1, and Everule can still visit all \( n \) islands, so the function returns \( n \).

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - When \( k = 0 \), no bridges are destroyed, and Everule can visit all \( n \) islands.
   - When \( k \geq n - 1 \), Dominater can destroy enough bridges to isolate island 1, and Everule can only visit island 1.

3. **Output Verification**:
   - For \( k = 0 \), the function correctly returns \( n \).
   - For \( k \geq n - 1 \), the function correctly returns 1.
   - For \( 0 < k < n - 1 \), the function correctly returns \( n \).

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the function, the function `func_1` correctly handles all possible cases and produces the expected output.

Correctness: **True**
