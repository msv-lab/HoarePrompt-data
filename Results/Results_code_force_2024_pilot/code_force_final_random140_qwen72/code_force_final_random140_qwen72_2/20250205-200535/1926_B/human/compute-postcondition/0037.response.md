Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0, `s` is the new input string, if at least one input string contained exactly one '1' then `a` is 0 otherwise `a` is 0, `b` is an empty string.**

Explanation: The variable `s` is updated to the new input string provided by the user. All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `j`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
