Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is the new input integer, `j` is `n-1`, `s` is the last input string. If any input string contained exactly one '1', `a` is set to 'Triangle'. If any input string contained more than one '1', `b` is set to 'Square'. If no input string contained exactly one '1' or more than one '1', `a` remains 0 and `b` remains an empty string.**

Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `i` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `j` will be `n-1` after the loop completes because the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`.
- The variable `s` will be the last input string provided during the last iteration of the loop.
- The variable `a` will be set to 'Triangle' if any input string contained exactly one '1'.
- The variable `b` will be set to 'Square' if any input string contained more than one '1'.
- If no input string contained exactly one '1' or more than one '1', `a` remains 0 and `b` remains an empty string.
