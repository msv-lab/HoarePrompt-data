You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10, representing the size of the grid. Each grid is represented by n lines, each containing n characters ('0' or '1'). The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that includes all the '1's in the grid, and the shape cannot consist of exactly one '1'.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = 0
        
        b = ''
        
        for j in range(n):
            s = input()
            if s.count('1') == 1:
                a = 'Triangle'
            elif s.count('1') > 1:
                b = 'Square'
        
        if a != 0:
            print(a)
        else:
            print(b)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `i` is `t-1`, `n` is the last input integer, `j` is `n-1`, and `s` is the last input string. For each test case, if any input string contained exactly one '1', `a` is set to 'Triangle'. If any input string contained more than one '1', `b` is set to 'Square'. If no input string contained exactly one '1' or more than one '1', `a` remains 0 and `b` remains an empty string. If `a` is not 0, `b` remains an empty string if no input string contained more than one '1', otherwise, `b` is set to 'Square'. If `a` is 0, `a` remains 0.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a grid of '0's and '1's. It returns whether the grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all the '1's, ensuring the shape does not consist of exactly one '1'.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
