Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is the new input integer, `j` is `n-1`, `s` is the last input string. If any input string contained exactly one '1', `a` is set to 'Triangle'. If any input string contained more than one '1', `b` is set to 'Square'. If no input string contained exactly one '1' or more than one '1', `a` remains 0 and `b` remains an empty string. If `a` is not 0, `b` remains an empty string if no input string contained more than one '1', otherwise, `b` is set to 'Square'. If `a` is 0, `a` remains 0.***
