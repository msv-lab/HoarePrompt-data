To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. The variable `j` will start from 0 as per the `range(n)` function.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive)
- `i` is 0
- `n` is an input integer
- `a` is 0
- `b` is an empty string

We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute. The variable `j` will be initialized to 0 by the `range(n)` function when the loop starts.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is 0, `b` is an empty string, `j` is 0**
