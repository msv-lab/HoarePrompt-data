Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is the new input integer, `j` is `n-1`, `s` is the last input string, if at least one input string contained exactly one '1', `a` is 0, otherwise `a` is 0, `b` is an empty string.**

Explanation: The code snippet `b = ''` resets the value of `b` to an empty string, overriding any previous value it might have had. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects this update to `b` while keeping all other initial conditions intact.
