Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is the new input integer, `j` is `n-1`, `s` is the last input string, if at least one input string contained exactly one '1', `a` is 0, otherwise `a` is 0, if any input string contained more than one '1', `b` is 'Square', otherwise `b` remains an empty string.**

Explanation: The code snippet `a = 0` resets the value of `a` to 0, regardless of its previous value. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects this change while keeping all other initial conditions intact.
