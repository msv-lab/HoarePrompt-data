Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `j` is `n-1`, and `s` is the last input string. If any input string contained exactly one '1', `a` is 'Triangle'. If any input string contained more than one '1', `b` is 'Square'. If no input string contained exactly one '1', `a` remains 0. If no input string contained more than one '1', `b` remains an empty string.**

This means that after the loop has executed all `n` iterations:
- The variable `t` remains an integer between 1 and 100.
- The variable `i` remains 0.
- The variable `n` remains the input integer.
- The variable `j` is now `n-1`, indicating the loop has completed its final iteration.
- The variable `s` holds the last input string provided during the loop.
- The variable `a` will be 'Triangle' if any input string contained exactly one '1'.
- The variable `b` will be 'Square' if any input string contained more than one '1'.
- If no input string contained exactly one '1', `a` remains 0.
- If no input string contained more than one '1', `b` remains an empty string.
