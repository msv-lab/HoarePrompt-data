Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` is the new input integer, `j` is `n-1`, and `s` is the last input string. If at least one input string contained exactly one '1', `a` is 'Triangle'. Otherwise, `a` remains 0. If any input string contained more than one '1', `b` is 'Square'. If no input string contained more than one '1', `b` remains an empty string.***
