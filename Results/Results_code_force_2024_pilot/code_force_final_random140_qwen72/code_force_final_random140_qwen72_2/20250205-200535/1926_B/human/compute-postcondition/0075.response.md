Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is the new input string. If `s` contains exactly one '1', `a` is set to 'Triangle', and `b` remains an empty string. If `s` contains more than one '1', `b` is set to 'Square', and `a` remains 0. If `s` contains no '1', `a`, `b`, and `j` remain unchanged.***
