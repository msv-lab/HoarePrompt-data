Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `s` is the new input string, if at least one input string contained exactly one '1' then `a` is 0 otherwise `a` is 0, and the number of '1's in `s` is not exactly one. If the number of '1's in `s` is greater than 1, `b` is 'Square'. Otherwise, `b` remains an empty string.***
