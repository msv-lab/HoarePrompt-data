Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is the new input integer, `j` is `n-1`, `s` is the last input string, if at least one input string contained exactly one '1', `a` is 'Triangle', otherwise `a` remains 0, if any input string contained more than one '1', `b` is 'Square', otherwise `b` remains an empty string.** 

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` updates the value of `n` to the new input integer. All other variables (`t`, `i`, `j`, `s`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `j` is still `n-1`, but `n` now holds the new input integer.
