The code snippet `b = 'Square'` assigns the string `'Square'` to the variable `b`. This overrides the previous value of `b` based on the count of '1' in the string `s`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `j` is 2, `s` is a new input string, `a` depends on the count of '1' in `s` (if the count is exactly 1, `a` is 'Triangle'; if the count is 0, `a` is 0; if the count is greater than 1, `a` is 0), `b` is 'Square'.**
