The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` relative to `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, making it 1, and `n` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, and `s` is an input string. If `s` contains exactly one '1' character, `a` is set to 'Triangle' and `b` remains an empty string. If the count of '1' in `s` is greater than 1, `b` is set to 'Square' and `a` remains 0. If the count of '1' in `s` is 0, `a` remains 0 and `b` remains an empty string.**
