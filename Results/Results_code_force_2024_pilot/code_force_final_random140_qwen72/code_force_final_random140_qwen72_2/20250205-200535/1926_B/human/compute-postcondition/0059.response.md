Let's break down the initial state and the print statement:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive).
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is a new input integer.
   - `j` is `n - 1`.
   - `s` is the last input string.
   - At least one input string contained exactly one '1', so `a` is 'Triangle'.
   - If any input string contained more than one '1', `b` is 'Square'.
   - If no input string contained more than one '1', `b` remains an empty string.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(a)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - According to the initial state, `a` is set to 'Triangle' because at least one input string contained exactly one '1'.
   - The value of `a` is explicitly given as 'Triangle'.

Therefore, the print statement will output the value of `a`, which is 'Triangle'.

Output: **Triangle**
