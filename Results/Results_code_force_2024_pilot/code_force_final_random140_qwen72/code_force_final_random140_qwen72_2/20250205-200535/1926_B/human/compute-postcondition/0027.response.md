Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `j` is `n-1`, and `s` is the last input string. `a` is 'Triangle' because at least one input string contained exactly one '1'. `b` is either 'Square' if any input string contained more than one '1', or an empty string if no input string contained more than one '1'.**
