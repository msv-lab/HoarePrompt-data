Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `j` is 2, `s` is a new input string, and the values of `a` and `b` depend on the count of '1' in `s`. If the count of '1' in `s` is exactly 1, `a` is 'Triangle' and `b` is an empty string. If the count of '1' in `s` is 0, `a` is 0 and `b` is an empty string. If the count of '1' in `s` is greater than 1, `a` is 0 and `b` is 'Square'.**
