Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, and `s` is an input string. If `s` contains exactly one '1' character, `a` is set to 'Triangle' and `b` remains an empty string. If the count of '1' in `s` is greater than 1, `b` is set to 'Square' and `a` remains 0. If the count of '1' in `s` is 0, `a` remains 0 and `b` remains an empty string.***
