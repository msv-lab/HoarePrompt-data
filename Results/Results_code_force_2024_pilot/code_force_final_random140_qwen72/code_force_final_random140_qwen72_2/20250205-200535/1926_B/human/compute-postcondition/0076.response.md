The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 (since it's the first iteration), and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than `j`.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `s` is the new input string. If `s` contains exactly one '1', `a` is set to 'Triangle', and `b` remains an empty string. If `s` contains more than one '1', `b` is set to 'Square', and `a` remains 0. If `s` contains no '1', `a`, `b`, and `j` remain unchanged, `j` is 1**
