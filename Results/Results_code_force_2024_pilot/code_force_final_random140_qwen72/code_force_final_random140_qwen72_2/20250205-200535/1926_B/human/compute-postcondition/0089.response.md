Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is the new input integer, `j` is `n-1`, `s` is the last input string. `a` is set to 'Triangle' because at least one input string contained exactly one '1'. `b` remains an empty string if no input string contained more than one '1', otherwise, `b` is set to 'Square'.**
