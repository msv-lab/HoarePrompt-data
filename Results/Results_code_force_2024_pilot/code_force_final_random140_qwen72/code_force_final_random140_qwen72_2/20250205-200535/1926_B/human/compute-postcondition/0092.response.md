Let's break down the initial state and determine the value of `b`:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive).
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` is the new input integer.
   - `j` is `n-1`.
   - `s` is the last input string.
   - If any input string contained exactly one '1', `a` is set to 'Triangle'.
   - If any input string contained more than one '1', `b` is set to 'Square'.
   - If no input string contained exactly one '1' or more than one '1', `a` remains 0 and `b` remains an empty string.
   - Additionally, `a` is 0.

2. **Determine the value of `b`:**
   - The value of `b` depends on the content of the input strings.
   - If any input string contained more than one '1', `b` is set to 'Square'.
   - If no input string contained more than one '1', `b` remains an empty string.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - Since the initial state specifies that `a` is 0, it implies that no input string contained exactly one '1'.
   - Therefore, the only condition left to check is whether any input string contained more than one '1'.
   - If no input string contained more than one '1', `b` will remain an empty string.

Given the initial state, the value of `b` will be an empty string if no input string contained more than one '1'.

Output: **'' (an empty string)**
