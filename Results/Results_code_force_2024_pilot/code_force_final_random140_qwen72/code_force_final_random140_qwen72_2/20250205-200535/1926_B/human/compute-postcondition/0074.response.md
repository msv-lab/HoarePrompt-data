Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is the new input string which does not contain exactly one '1'. If `s` contains more than one '1', `b` is set to 'Square' and `a` remains 0, `j` remains 0. Otherwise, `a`, `b`, and `j` remain unchanged.***
