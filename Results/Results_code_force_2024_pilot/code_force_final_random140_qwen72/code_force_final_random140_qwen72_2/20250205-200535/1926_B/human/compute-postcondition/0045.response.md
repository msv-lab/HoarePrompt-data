The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making it 1, and `n` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, `s` is the new input string. If `s` contains exactly one '1', `a` is 'Triangle' and `b` is an empty string. If `s` contains more than one '1', `a` is 0 and `b` is 'Square'. If `s` contains no '1', `a` is 0 and `b` is an empty string.**
