Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by checking each row of the grid to determine if it contains exactly one '1' or more than one '1'. However, this approach is flawed because it does not correctly identify the shapes based on the problem's definition. Here are the specific issues:

1. **Incorrect Shape Identification**:
   - The program sets `a` to 'Triangle' if any row contains exactly one '1'. This is incorrect because a triangle can have rows with more than one '1' (e.g., the middle row of a triangle with `k=3`).
   - The program sets `b` to 'Square' if any row contains more than one '1'. This is also incorrect because a triangle can have rows with more than one '1'.

2. **Logical Flaws**:
   - The program does not check the overall structure of the shape. It only checks individual rows, which is insufficient to determine if the shape is a triangle or a square.
   - The program does not handle the case where the shape is an upside-down triangle, which is still considered a valid triangle.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle the case where the shape is a square but all rows have more than one '1'. In such a case, it will incorrectly print 'Square' even if the shape is a triangle.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly identify the shape based on the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **False**
