Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly identify the shapes as specified in the problem description. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Shape Identification Logic**: The program checks if a row contains exactly one '1' to label the shape as a triangle and more than one '1' to label it as a square. This logic is flawed because:
   - A triangle can have multiple '1's in a row, especially as it grows larger.
   - A square will always have the same number of '1's in each row, but this is not checked in the program.

2. **Handling of Multiple Rows**: The program only sets `a` or `b` based on the last row processed. If the last row has more than one '1', it will always print "Square", regardless of the actual shape.

3. **No Check for Consistency**: The program does not check if the entire grid forms a consistent shape (either a triangle or a square). For example, it does not verify that the number of '1's in each row of a square is the same or that the number of '1's in each row of a triangle follows the pattern \(2i - 1\).

To correctly solve this problem, the program should:
- Identify the pattern of '1's in the grid.
- Verify that the pattern matches either a triangle or a square.
- Ensure that the entire grid conforms to the identified shape.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def is_triangle(grid, n):
    # Check for both normal and upside-down triangles
    for direction in [1, -1]:
        start_row = 0 if direction == 1 else n - 1
        end_row = n if direction == 1 else -1
        step = 1 if direction == 1 else -1

        for k in range(1, n + 1):
            expected_ones = 2 * k - 1
            for i in range(start_row, end_row, step):
                if i < 0 or i >= n:
                    break
                row = grid[i]
                ones_count = row.count('1')
                if ones_count != expected_ones:
                    break
                start_row += step
                expected_ones -= 2 * direction
            else:
                return True
    return False

def is_square(grid, n):
    ones_in_first_row = grid[0].count('1')
    for row in grid:
        if row.count('1') != ones_in_first_row:
            return False
    return True

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        grid = [input() for _ in range(n)]
        
        if is_triangle(grid, n):
            print("TRIANGLE")
        elif is_square(grid, n):
            print("SQUARE")
        else:
            print("UNKNOWN")  # This should never happen due to problem constraints

func()
```

This corrected version includes functions to check if the grid forms a triangle or a square and uses these functions to determine the shape.
