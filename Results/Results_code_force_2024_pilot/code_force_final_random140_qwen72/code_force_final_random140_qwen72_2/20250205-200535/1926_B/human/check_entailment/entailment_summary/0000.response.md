Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly identify the shapes as described in the problem statement. The logic in the program is flawed because it only checks if a row contains exactly one '1' to determine if the shape is a triangle, and if a row contains more than one '1', it assumes the shape is a square. This approach fails to account for the specific patterns required for a triangle or a square as defined in the problem statement.

For example, a triangle can have rows with more than one '1' (as long as they follow the pattern of increasing or decreasing odd numbers of '1's centered around a column), and a square must have rows with a consistent number of '1's across all rows forming the square. The current implementation does not check these patterns but instead relies on a simple count of '1's in a row, which is insufficient.

Therefore, the program will incorrectly classify some shapes and fail to meet the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **False**
