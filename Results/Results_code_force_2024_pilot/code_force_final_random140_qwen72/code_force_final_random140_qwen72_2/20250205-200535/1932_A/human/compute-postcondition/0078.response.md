The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`. The loop iterates based on the value provided by `int(input())`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, indicating that this was the first iteration of the loop.

For the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that the value of `int(input())` must be greater than 1. Since the input is not changing between iterations, we assume the same input value persists.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **_ is 2, t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, len is an input integer, s is a list of characters from the input string, ret is the number of '@' characters encountered before the second consecutive '*' character (or the end of the list), thorn is 0 if the loop did not encounter two consecutive '*' characters, otherwise thorn is 2**
