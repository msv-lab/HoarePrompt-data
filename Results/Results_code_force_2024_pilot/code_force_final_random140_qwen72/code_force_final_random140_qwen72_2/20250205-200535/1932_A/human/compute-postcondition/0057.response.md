Postcondition: **`_` is 1, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character, `i` is the first character in the list `s`. If `i` is '@', `ret` is 1 and `thorn` is 0. If `i` is '*', `ret` is 0 and `thorn` is 1. Otherwise, `ret` is 0 and `thorn` is 0.**
