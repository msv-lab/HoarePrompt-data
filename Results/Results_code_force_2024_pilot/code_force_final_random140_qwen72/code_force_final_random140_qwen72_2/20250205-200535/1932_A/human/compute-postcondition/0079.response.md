Output State: **_ is 2, t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, len is an input integer, s is a list of characters from the input string, ret is the number of '@' characters encountered before the second consecutive '*' character (or the end of the list), thorn is 0 if the loop did not encounter two consecutive '*' characters, otherwise thorn is 2.**

Explanation:
- The code `len = int(input())` updates the value of `len` to an integer provided by the user.
- All other variables (`_`, `t`, `s`, `ret`, `thorn`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The new value of `len` is an input integer, which means it can be any integer value provided by the user.
- The initial conditions for `_`, `t`, `s`, `ret`, and `thorn` remain valid and unchanged.
