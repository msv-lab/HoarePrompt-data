Output State: **`_` is 0, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 3 characters, `i` is the third character in the list `s`, `thorn` is 0, `ret` is 1 if `i` is neither '@' nor '*', `ret` is 3 and `thorn` is 0 if `i` is '@', `thorn` is 1 if `i` is '*'**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `ret += 1` increments the value of `ret` by 1.
- If `i` is neither '@' nor '*', `ret` was initially 0, so now `ret` is 1.
- If `i` is '@', `ret` was initially 2, so now `ret` is 3.
- If `i` is '*', `ret` was initially 0, and `thorn` is 1, so now `ret` is 1.
- All other variables (`_`, `t`, `len`, `s`, `i`, `thorn`) remain unchanged.
