The value of `ret` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `ret` was either 0 or 1 depending on the value of `i` (the second character in the list `s`). If `i` is '@', `ret` was initially 1, so now it becomes 2. If `i` is '*', `ret` was initially 0, so now it becomes 1. In all other cases, `ret` was initially 0, so now it becomes 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is 1, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 2 characters, `i` is the second character in the list `s`. If `i` is '@', `ret` is 2 and `thorn` is 0. If `i` is '*', `ret` is 1 and `thorn` is 0. Otherwise, `ret` is 1 and `thorn` is 0.**
