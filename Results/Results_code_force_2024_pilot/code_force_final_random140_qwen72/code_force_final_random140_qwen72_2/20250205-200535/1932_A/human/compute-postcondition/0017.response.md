Postcondition: ***`_` is 0, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character, `ret` is 0, `i` is the first character in the list `s`, and `i` is not equal to '@'. If `i` is '*', then `thorn` is 1. If `thorn` is 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `thorn` remains 0.***
