Postcondition: ***`_` is 2, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 3 characters, `i` is the third character in the list `s`, and `thorn` is incremented by 1. If `thorn` was initially 2, `ret` depends on the value of the third character in `s`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
