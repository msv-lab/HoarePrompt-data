Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: _ is 2, t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, len is an input integer, s is a list of characters from the input string, ret is 0, thorn is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    if i == '@':
        thorn = 0
        ret += 1
    elif i == '*':
        thorn += 1
        if thorn == 2:
            break
    else:
        thorn = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: _ is 2, t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, len is an input integer, s is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character, and i is the first character in the list s. If i is '@', ret is set to 1 and thorn remains 0. If i is not '@' and i is '*', thorn is set to 1. If thorn is 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, ret remains 0 and thorn remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: _ is 2, t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, len is an input integer, s is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 2 characters, and i is the second character in the list s. If i is '@', thorn is 0 and ret is increased by 1. If i is '*', thorn is incremented by 1, and if thorn reaches 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If i is neither '@' nor '*', thorn is set to 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `_` is 2, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 3 characters, `i` is the third character in the list `s`. If `i` is '@', `thorn` is 0, and `ret` is `ret + 1`. If `i` is '*', `thorn` is incremented by 1. If `thorn` was initially 2, `ret` depends on the value of the third character in `s`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `i` is not '*' and not '@', `thorn` is set to 0, and `ret` depends on the value of the third character in `s`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
