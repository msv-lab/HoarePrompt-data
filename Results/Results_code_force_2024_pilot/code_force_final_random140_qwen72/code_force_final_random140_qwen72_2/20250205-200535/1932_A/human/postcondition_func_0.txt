The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string of length `n` representing a path. The path consists of characters '.', '@', and '*', denoting empty cells, coins, and thorns, respectively. The function counts the number of coins ('@') encountered in the path until it encounters two consecutive thorns ('*'). If two consecutive thorns are found, the counting stops. The function prints the count of coins for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the final state includes the printed results for each test case.
