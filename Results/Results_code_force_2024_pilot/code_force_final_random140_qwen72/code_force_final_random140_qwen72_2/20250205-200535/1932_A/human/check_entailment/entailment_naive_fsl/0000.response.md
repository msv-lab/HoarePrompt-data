Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program fails to account for the possibility of moving two cells at a time, which can lead to collecting more coins in certain scenarios.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
5
.@.*@
```
In this case, the optimal strategy would be to move two cells from the starting position to the cell containing a coin, and then move one cell to avoid the thorn and reach the last cell with another coin. This would allow collecting 2 coins. However, the provided program only collects 1 coin because it does not consider the possibility of jumping over the thorn by moving two cells at once.

Thus, the program is incorrect because it does not maximize the number of coins collected in all cases.
