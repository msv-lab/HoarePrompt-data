To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the conditions and variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
```

Here, the loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`. The loop will run as many times as the integer value provided by the user input.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The only variable in the loop head is the implicit `_` (a throwaway variable) and the result of `int(input())`.
2. **Condition for Execution**: The loop will execute if `int(input())` is greater than 0.
3. **Initial State**: The initial state provided is:
   - `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, representing the number of test cases.
   - Each test case consists of two integers `n` and `m` where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100, representing the number of moves and the desired number of cubes in the tower, respectively.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The loop will execute based on the value of `int(input())`, which should be equal to `t` (the number of test cases).
- To ensure the loop runs, `int(input())` must be greater than 0.

### Final State:
Since the loop will run based on the value of `int(input())`, and we know that `t` is the number of test cases, we need to ensure that `int(input())` is set to `t`.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `int(input())` must be equal to `t` and greater than 0**
