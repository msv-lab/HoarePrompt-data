The provided code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `m` respectively. This operation updates the values of `n` and `m` based on the new input.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `n` and `m` are integers provided by the input.
- If `n` < `m`, the current value of `n` is less than the current value of `m`.
- If `n` ≥ `m`, the current value of `n` is greater than or equal to the current value of `m`.
- If both `n` and `m` are odd, or both `n` and `m` are even, the condition is satisfied. Otherwise, the condition is not satisfied.
- The range defined by `int(input())` must have at least one more iteration left.

After executing the code snippet:
- `n` and `m` are updated to the new values provided by the input.
- The conditions regarding the relationship between `n` and `m` (whether `n` < `m`, `n` ≥ `m`, both being odd or even) will depend on the new values of `n` and `m`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` and `m` are updated to the new values provided by the input, and the conditions regarding the relationship between `n` and `m` (whether `n` < `m`, `n` ≥ `m`, both being odd or even) will depend on the new values of `n` and `m`. The range defined by `int(input())` must have at least one more iteration left.**
