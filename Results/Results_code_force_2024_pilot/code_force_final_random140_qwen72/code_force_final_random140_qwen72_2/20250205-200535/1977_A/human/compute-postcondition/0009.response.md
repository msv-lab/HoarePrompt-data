The loop head in this case is `_ in range(int(input()))`. The only object that can be adjusted here is the range defined by `int(input())`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `n` and `m` are integers provided by the input.
- If `n` < `m`, the current value of `n` is less than the current value of `m`.
- If `n` ≥ `m`, the current value of `n` is greater than or equal to the current value of `m`.
- Additionally, if both `n` and `m` are odd, or both `n` and `m` are even, the condition is satisfied. Otherwise, the condition is not satisfied.

For the loop to execute one more time, the range defined by `int(input())` must still allow for another iteration. Since the loop variable `_` is not used in the loop head, it does not affect the loop's execution directly. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are iterations left in the range defined by `int(input())`.

At the start of the next iteration, the only change is that the loop counter (which is not explicitly named but is managed internally by Python) is incremented by 1. However, since the loop variable `_` is not used, the only relevant state is the number of remaining iterations in the range.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration remains the same for `t`, `n`, and `m`, but the range defined by `int(input())` must still have at least one more iteration left.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the input. If `n` < `m`, the current value of `n` is less than the current value of `m`. If `n` ≥ `m`, the current value of `n` is greater than or equal to the current value of `m`. Additionally, if both `n` and `m` are odd, or both `n` and `m` are even, the condition is satisfied. Otherwise, the condition is not satisfied. The range defined by `int(input())` must have at least one more iteration left.**
