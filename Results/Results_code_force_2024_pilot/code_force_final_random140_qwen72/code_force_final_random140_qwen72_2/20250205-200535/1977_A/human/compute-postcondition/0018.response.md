Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `n` and `m` are updated to the new values provided by the input.
- The range defined by `int(input())` must have at least one more iteration left.

The code snippet is:
```python
print('YES')
```

This code simply prints the string `'YES'`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and the input range do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the `print` statement is not dependent on any of these variables or conditions.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **YES**
