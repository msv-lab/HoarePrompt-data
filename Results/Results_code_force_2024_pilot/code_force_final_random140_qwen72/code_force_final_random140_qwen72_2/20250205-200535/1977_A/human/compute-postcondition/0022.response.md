The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the problem statement, it is implied that the function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `m`. The integer `t` represents the number of test cases, and for each test case, `n` and `m` represent the number of moves and the desired number of cubes in the tower, respectively. The function should return the result for each test case.

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- For each test case, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100.

The function processes each test case and returns the result based on the values of `n` and `m`.

Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `m`. It returns the result for each test case, where `n` is the number of moves and `m` is the desired number of cubes in the tower.**
