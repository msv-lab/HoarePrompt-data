The only object in the loop head is the range defined by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute one more time, the range must still have at least one more iteration left.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `n` and `m` are updated to the new values provided by the input.
- The conditions regarding the relationship between `n` and `m` (whether `n` < `m`, `n` ≥ `m`, both being odd or even) will depend on the new values of `n` and `m`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the range defined by `int(input())` must have at least one more iteration left. Since the loop counter `_` is not explicitly tracked, the only way to ensure the loop continues is to ensure that the range defined by `int(input())` is not zero.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that the range defined by `int(input())` must still have at least one more iteration left.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` and `m` are updated to the new values provided by the input, the range defined by `int(input())` must have at least one more iteration left.**
