Based on the initial state:

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `n` and `m` are integers provided by the input.
- `n` is greater than or equal to `m`.
- Either both `n` and `m` are odd, or both `n` and `m` are even.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print('YES')
```

This statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **YES**
