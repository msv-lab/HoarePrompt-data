The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The initial state describes the values of `t`, `n`, and `m`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the content of the `print` statement is independent of the initial state.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive.
2. `n` and `m` are integers provided by the input.
3. The current value of `n` is less than the current value of `m`.

However, none of these variables (`t`, `n`, or `m`) are referenced in the `print` statement. The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **NO**
