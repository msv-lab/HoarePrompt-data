The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `n` and `m` are updated to new values provided by the input.
- The range defined by `int(input())` must have at least one more iteration left.

However, none of these conditions affect the output of the `print` statement, as it simply prints a hardcoded string.

Output: **NO**
