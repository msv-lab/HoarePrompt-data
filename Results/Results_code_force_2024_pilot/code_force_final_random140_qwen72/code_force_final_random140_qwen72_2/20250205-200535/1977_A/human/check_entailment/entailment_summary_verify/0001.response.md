### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Check**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.

2. **Reading Input**: For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`, where `n` is the number of moves and `m` is the desired number of cubes in the tower.

3. **First Condition (`n < m`)**:
   - If `n` is less than `m`, it is impossible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves because you cannot add more cubes than the number of moves you have. Therefore, the program correctly prints "NO" in this case.

4. **Second Condition (`n & 1 and m & 1 or (n % 2 == 0 and m % 2 == 0)`)**:
   - This condition checks if both `n` and `m` are either both odd or both even.
   - **Odd Case**: If `n` is odd and `m` is odd, it is possible to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves. This is because an odd number of moves can result in an odd number of cubes.
   - **Even Case**: If `n` is even and `m` is even, it is also possible to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves. This is because an even number of moves can result in an even number of cubes.
   - **Mixed Case**: If `n` is odd and `m` is even, or vice versa, it is impossible to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves. This is because an odd number of moves cannot result in an even number of cubes, and an even number of moves cannot result in an odd number of cubes.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints "YES" if the conditions are met, and "NO" otherwise.

### Verification Using Function Summary:
- The function summary confirms that the function processes each test case by reading `n` and `m`.
- It correctly prints "NO" if `n` is less than `m`.
- It prints "YES" if both `n` and `m` are either both odd or both even, which aligns with the logic described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the cases described in the problem statement. It ensures that the number of moves and the desired number of cubes are consistent with the rules of the game. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**

Final: **True**
