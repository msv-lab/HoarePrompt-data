Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly solves the problem based on the given constraints and logic. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually by reading `n` and `m`.

2. **Condition Checking**:
   - **First Condition (`if n < m`)**: If the number of moves `n` is less than the required number of cubes `m`, it is impossible to build a tower of height `m` because you can't add more cubes than the number of moves. Therefore, the program prints "NO".
   - **Second Condition (`elif n & 1 and m & 1 or (n % 2 == 0 and m % 2 == 0)`)**: This condition checks if the parity (odd or even nature) of `n` and `m` is the same. If both `n` and `m` are either odd or even, it is possible to build a tower of height `m` after `n` moves. This is because:
     - If `n` is odd and `m` is odd, you can achieve `m` by adding and removing cubes in such a way that the final count is odd.
     - If `n` is even and `m` is even, you can achieve `m` by adding and removing cubes in such a way that the final count is even.
   - If neither of these conditions is met, the program implicitly prints "NO" for the remaining cases, which is correct because the parity mismatch makes it impossible to achieve the desired height `m`.

3. **Output**: The program outputs "YES" or "NO" based on the conditions, which matches the expected output format.

Therefore, the program is correct and handles all the given test cases appropriately.
