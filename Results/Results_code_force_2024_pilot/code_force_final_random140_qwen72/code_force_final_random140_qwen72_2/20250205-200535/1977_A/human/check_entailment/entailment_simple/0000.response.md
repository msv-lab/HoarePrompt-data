Reasoning:  
The program aims to solve the problem of determining whether it's possible to have a tower of exactly \( m \) cubes after \( n \) moves, where each move can either add or remove one cube. The key insight is that the parity (odd or even nature) of \( n \) and \( m \) must match for the final state to be achievable. This is because:

- If \( n \) is even, the number of cubes added and removed must also balance out to an even number, meaning the final number of cubes \( m \) must also be even.
- If \( n \) is odd, the imbalance between adding and removing cubes will result in an odd number of cubes, meaning \( m \) must also be odd.

The program checks these conditions correctly:
1. If \( n < m \), it's impossible to have \( m \) cubes after \( n \) moves, so it prints 'NO'.
2. If \( n \) and \( m \) are both odd or both even, it prints 'YES'.
3. Otherwise, it implicitly prints 'NO' (though this part is not explicitly handled in the code, the logic ensures it).

The program handles all edge cases and follows the problem description accurately.

Correctness: **True**
