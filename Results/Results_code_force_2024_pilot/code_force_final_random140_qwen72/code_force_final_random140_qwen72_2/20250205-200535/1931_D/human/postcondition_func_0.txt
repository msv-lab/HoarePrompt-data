The function `func_1` takes two parameters: a positive integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, and a list `test_cases` where each test case is a dictionary containing a tuple of three integers (`n`, `x`, `y`) and a list of `n` integers. The function processes each test case to count the number of pairs of elements in the list such that the first element can be transformed into the second element by adding some integer multiple of `x` and the result is divisible by `y`. It returns a list `results` containing the count of such pairs for each test case. After the function completes, `t` remains unchanged, `test_cases` is fully processed, and `results` contains the final counts for each test case.
