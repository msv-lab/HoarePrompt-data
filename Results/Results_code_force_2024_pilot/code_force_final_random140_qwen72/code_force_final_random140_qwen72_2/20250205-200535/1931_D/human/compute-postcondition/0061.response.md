Postcondition: ***`required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`, and all other variables remain unchanged. If `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in `freq`, `beautiful_count` is increased by `freq[(x - mod_x) % x, mod_y]`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `beautiful_count`.***
