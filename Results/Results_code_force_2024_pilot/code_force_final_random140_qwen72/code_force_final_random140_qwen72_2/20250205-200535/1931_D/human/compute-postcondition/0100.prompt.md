You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), representing the number of test cases. Each test case in test_cases is a tuple containing three integers n, x, y (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        n, x, y = case['params']
        
        a = case['array']
        
        freq = defaultdict(int)
        
        beautiful_count = 0
        
        for num in a:
            mod_x = num % x
            mod_y = num % y
            required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x
            required_mod_y = mod_y
            if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq:
                beautiful_count += freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]
            freq[mod_x, mod_y] += 1
        
        results.append(beautiful_count)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `t` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of test cases that has been fully processed, `results` is a list containing the final value of `beautiful_count` for each test case, `case` is the last test case in `test_cases`, `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]` for the last test case, `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]` for the last test case, `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]` for the last test case, `a` is the list of integers from the last test case, `freq` is a `defaultdict(int)` where each key is a tuple `(mod_x, mod_y)` representing the frequency of pairs of remainders when elements of `a` are divided by `x` and `y`, respectively, and `beautiful_count` is the total count of pairs of elements in `a` such that the first element can be transformed into the second element by adding some integer multiple of `x` and the result is divisible by `y`.
    return results
    #The program returns a list `results` containing the final value of `beautiful_count` for each test case in `test_cases`. Each value in `results` represents the total count of pairs of elements in the corresponding test case's list `a` such that the first element can be transformed into the second element by adding some integer multiple of `x` and the result is divisible by `y`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a positive integer `t` and a list of test cases `test_cases`. Each test case is a tuple containing three integers `n`, `x`, `y` and a list of `n` integers. The function returns a list `results` where each element is the count of pairs of elements in the corresponding test case's list such that the first element can be transformed into the second element by adding some integer multiple of `x` and the result is divisible by `y`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list `results` containing the final value of `beautiful_count` for each test case in `test_cases`. Each value in `results` represents the total count of pairs of elements in the corresponding test case's list `a` such that the first element can be transformed into the second element by adding some integer multiple of `x` and the result is divisible by `y`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
