The code snippet initializes the variable `beautiful_count` to 0. This initialization does not affect any other variables or their values. The initial state remains unchanged except for the new value of `beautiful_count`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least three test cases, `case` is the third test case in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the final value of `beautiful_count` appended to it, `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]` for the third test case, `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]` for the third test case, `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]` for the third test case, `a` is now the list of elements from `case['array']` for the third test case, `freq` is a defaultdict(int) initialized to an empty dictionary, and `beautiful_count` is 0.**
