The code snippet `a = case['array']` updates the variable `a` to be the list of elements from the 'array' key of the `case` dictionary, which represents the second test case in `test_cases`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least two test cases, `case` is the second test case in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the value of `beautiful_count`, `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]` for the second test case, `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]` for the second test case, `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]` for the second test case, `a` is now the list of elements from `case['array']` for the second test case, `freq` is a defaultdict where each key `(mod_x, mod_y)` corresponds to the count of numbers in `a` for the second test case that have the same remainders when divided by `x` and `y`, `beautiful_count` is the total count of pairs `(i, j)` where `0 ≤ i < j < n` and `a[i] + x` is divisible by `x` and `a[j] + y` is divisible by `y` for the second test case.**
