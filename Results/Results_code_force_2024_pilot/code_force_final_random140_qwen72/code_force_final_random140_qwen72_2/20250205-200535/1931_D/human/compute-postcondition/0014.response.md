Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least one test case, `case` is the first test case in `test_cases`, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]`, `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]`, `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]`, `a` is a list that must have at least one element, `num` is the first element of `a`, `freq` is a defaultdict initialized to 0 for all keys, `mod_x` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`, `beautiful_count` remains 0, `freq[(mod_x, mod_y)]` is now 1.**

Explanation:
- The code updates the `freq` dictionary by incrementing the count of the key `(mod_x, mod_y)` by 1.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The value of `freq[(mod_x, mod_y)]` is now 1, indicating that the combination of remainders `(mod_x, mod_y)` has been encountered once.
