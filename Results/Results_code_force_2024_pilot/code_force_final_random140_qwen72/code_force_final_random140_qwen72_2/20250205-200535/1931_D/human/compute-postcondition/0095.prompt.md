Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least three test cases, `case` is the third test case in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the final value of `beautiful_count` appended to it, `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]` for the third test case, `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]` for the third test case, `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]` for the third test case, `a` is now the list of elements from `case['array']` for the third test case, `freq` is a defaultdict(int) initialized to an empty dictionary, and `beautiful_count` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for num in a:
    mod_x = num % x
    mod_y = num % y
    required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x
    required_mod_y = mod_y
    if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq:
        beautiful_count += freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]
    freq[mod_x, mod_y] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least three test cases, `case` is the third test case in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the final value of `beautiful_count` appended to it, `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]` for the third test case, `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]` for the third test case, `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]` for the third test case, `a` must have at least one element, `freq` is a defaultdict(int) initialized to an empty dictionary, `mod_x` is `n % x`, `mod_y` is `n % y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`, `beautiful_count` is 0, `freq[(mod_x, mod_y)]` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least three test cases, `case` is the third test case in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the final value of `beautiful_count` appended to it, `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]` for the third test case, `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]` for the third test case, `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]` for the third test case, `a` must have at least two elements, `freq` is a defaultdict(int) with `freq[(mod_x, mod_y)]` now equal to 2, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`, `num` is the second element of `a`. If `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in `freq`, then `beautiful_count` is 1 and `freq[(mod_x, mod_y)]` is 2. Otherwise, `beautiful_count` remains 0 and `freq[(mod_x, mod_y)]` is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least three test cases, `case` is the third test case in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the final value of `beautiful_count` appended to it, `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]` for the third test case, `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]` for the third test case, `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]` for the third test case, `a` must have at least three elements, `freq` is a `defaultdict(int)` with `freq[(mod_x, mod_y)]` now equal to 3, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `required_mod_y` is `num % y`, `num` is the third element of `a`, if `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in `freq`, then `beautiful_count` is 3 and `freq[(mod_x, mod_y)]` is 3. Otherwise, `beautiful_count` remains 0 and `freq[(mod_x, mod_y)]` is 3.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
