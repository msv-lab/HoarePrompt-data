The only objects in the loop head are `case` and `test_cases`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `test_cases` list. If there is another test case in the list, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `test_cases` had at least two test cases, and `case` was the second test case in `test_cases`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `test_cases` must have at least three test cases, and `case` will be the third test case in `test_cases`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least three test cases, `case` is the third test case in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the final value of `beautiful_count` appended to it, `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]` for the third test case, `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]` for the third test case, `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]` for the third test case, `a` is now the list of elements from `case['array']` for the third test case, `freq` is a defaultdict(int) where each key `(mod_x, mod_y)` is the frequency of pairs `(num % x, num % y)` found in `a`, and `beautiful_count` is the total count of pairs `(i, j)` such that `0 ≤ i < j < n` and `(a[i] + x) % x == (a[j] + x) % x` and `(a[i] + y) % y == (a[j] + y) % y`.**
