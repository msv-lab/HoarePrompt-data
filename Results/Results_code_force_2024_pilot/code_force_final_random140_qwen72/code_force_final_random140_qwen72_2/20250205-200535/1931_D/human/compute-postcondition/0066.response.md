The code snippet `n, x, y = case['params']` updates the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` based on the values stored in `case['params']`. Since `case` is the third test case in `test_cases`, and `n`, `x`, and `y` are already defined as the values of `case['params'][0]`, `case['params'][1]`, and `case['params'][2]` respectively, this assignment does not change their values.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with no changes to the values of `n`, `x`, and `y`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least three test cases, `case` is the third test case in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the final value of `beautiful_count` appended to it, `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]` for the third test case, `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]` for the third test case, `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]` for the third test case, `a` is now the list of elements from `case['array']` for the third test case, `freq` is a defaultdict(int) where each key `(mod_x, mod_y)` is the frequency of pairs `(num % x, num % y)` found in `a`, and `beautiful_count` is the total count of pairs `(i, j)` such that `0 ≤ i < j < n` and `(a[i] + x) % x == (a[j] + x) % x` and `(a[i] + y) % y == (a[j] + y) % y`.**
