Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `t` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of test cases that has been fully processed, `results` is a list containing the final value of `beautiful_count` for each test case, `case` is the last test case in `test_cases`, `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]` for the last test case, `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]` for the last test case, `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]` for the last test case, `a` is the list of integers from the last test case, `freq` is a `defaultdict(int)` where each key is a tuple `(mod_x, mod_y)` representing the frequency of pairs of remainders when elements of `a` are divided by `x` and `y`, respectively, and `beautiful_count` is the total count of pairs of elements in `a` such that the first element can be transformed into the second element by adding some integer multiple of `x` and the result is divisible by `y`.**
