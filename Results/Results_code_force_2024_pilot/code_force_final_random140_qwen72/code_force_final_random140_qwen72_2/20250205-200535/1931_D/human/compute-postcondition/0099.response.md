The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t` and `test_cases`. 

- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), representing the number of test cases.
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains:
  - Three integers `n`, `x`, `y` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9).
  - A list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).

The function returns a list `results` containing the final value of `beautiful_count` for each test case in `test_cases`. Each value in `results` represents the total count of pairs of elements in the corresponding test case's list `a` such that the first element can be transformed into the second element by adding some integer multiple of `x` and the result is divisible by `y`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `t` and a list of test cases `test_cases`. Each test case is a tuple containing three integers `n`, `x`, `y` and a list of `n` integers. The function returns a list `results` where each element is the count of pairs of elements in the corresponding test case's list such that the first element can be transformed into the second element by adding some integer multiple of `x` and the result is divisible by `y`.**
