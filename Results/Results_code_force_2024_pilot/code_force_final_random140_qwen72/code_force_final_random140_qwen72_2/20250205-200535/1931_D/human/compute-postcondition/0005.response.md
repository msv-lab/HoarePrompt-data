Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least one test case, `case` is the first test case in `test_cases`, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]`, `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]`, `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]`, `a` is the value of `case['array']`, `freq` is a defaultdict initialized to 0 for all keys, `beautiful_count` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The variable `beautiful_count` is initialized to 0.
- All other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `case`, `results`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `freq`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
