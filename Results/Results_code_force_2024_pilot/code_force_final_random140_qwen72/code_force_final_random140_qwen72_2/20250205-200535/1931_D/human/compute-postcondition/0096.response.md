The code appends the current value of `beautiful_count` to the list `results`. This operation updates the `results` list but does not change any other variables. The values of `t`, `test_cases`, `case`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `freq`, and `beautiful_count` remain the same.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least three test cases, `case` is the third test case in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the final value of `beautiful_count` appended to it, `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]` for the third test case, `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]` for the third test case, `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]` for the third test case, `a` is a list of integers, `freq` is a `defaultdict(int)` where each key is a tuple `(mod_x, mod_y)` representing the frequency of pairs of remainders when elements of `a` are divided by `x` and `y`, respectively, and `beautiful_count` is the total count of pairs of elements in `a` such that the first element can be transformed into the second element by adding some integer multiple of `x` and the result is divisible by `y`.**
