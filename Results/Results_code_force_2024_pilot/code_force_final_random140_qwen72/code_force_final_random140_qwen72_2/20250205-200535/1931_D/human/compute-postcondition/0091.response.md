The code snippet `required_mod_y = mod_y` assigns the value of `mod_y` to `required_mod_y`. Since `mod_y` is already defined as `num % y`, and `num` is the third element of `a`, `required_mod_y` will take the same value as `mod_y`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)
- `test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least three test cases
- `case` is the third test case in `test_cases`
- `results` is a list containing the final value of `beautiful_count` appended to it
- `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]` for the third test case
- `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]` for the third test case
- `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]` for the third test case
- `a` must have at least three elements
- `freq` is a `defaultdict(int)` with `freq[(mod_x, mod_y)]` now equal to 2
- `mod_x` is `num % x`
- `mod_y` is `num % y`
- `required_mod_y` is `num % y`
- `num` is the third element of `a`
- if `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in `freq`, then `beautiful_count` is 1 and `freq[(mod_x, mod_y)]` is 2. Otherwise, `beautiful_count` remains 0 and `freq[(mod_x, mod_y)]` is 2.
