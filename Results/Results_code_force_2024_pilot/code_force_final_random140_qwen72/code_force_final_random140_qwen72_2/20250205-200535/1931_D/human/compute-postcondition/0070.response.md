To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head, which in this case is `num` and `a`. The loop will execute if `a` contains at least one element. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the relevant objects**: The loop head involves `num` and `a`.
2. **Determine the condition for loop execution**: The loop will execute if `a` is not empty.
3. **Adjust the state**: Since `a` is the list of elements from `case['array']` for the third test case, and the state specifies that `test_cases` must have at least three test cases, we can assume `a` is not empty. However, to ensure the loop executes, we need to explicitly state that `a` must have at least one element.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)
- `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least three test cases
- `case` is the third test case in `test_cases`
- `results` is a list containing the final value of `beautiful_count` appended to it
- `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]` for the third test case
- `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]` for the third test case
- `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]` for the third test case
- `a` is now the list of elements from `case['array']` for the third test case
- `freq` is a defaultdict(int) initialized to an empty dictionary
- `beautiful_count` is 0

The adjusted state to ensure the loop executes:
State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least three test cases, `case` is the third test case in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the final value of `beautiful_count` appended to it, `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]` for the third test case, `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]` for the third test case, `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]` for the third test case, `a` must have at least one element, `freq` is a defaultdict(int) initialized to an empty dictionary, and `beautiful_count` is 0**
