Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least two test cases, `case` is the second test case in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the value of `beautiful_count`, `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]` for the second test case, `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]` for the second test case, `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]` for the second test case, `a` is now the list of elements from `case['array']` for the second test case, `freq` is an empty defaultdict(int), `beautiful_count` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `beautiful_count = 0` sets the variable `beautiful_count` to 0.
- All other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `case`, `results`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `freq`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The value of `beautiful_count` is now explicitly set to 0, which is reflected in the output state.
