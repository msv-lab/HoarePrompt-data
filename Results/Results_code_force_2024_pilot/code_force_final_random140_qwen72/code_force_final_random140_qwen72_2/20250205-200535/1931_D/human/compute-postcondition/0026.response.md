Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least one test case, `case` is the first test case in `test_cases`, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]`, `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]`, `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]`, `a` is a list that must have at least three elements, `num` is the third element of `a`, `freq` is a defaultdict initialized to 0 for all keys, `mod_x` is the remainder when the third element of `a` is divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder when the third element of `a` is divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`, `freq[(mod_x, mod_y)]` is now 2, `beautiful_count` is 1 if `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in `freq`, otherwise `beautiful_count` remains 0.**

Explanation:
- The code updates the value of `required_mod_x` to `(x - mod_x) % x`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
- The condition for `beautiful_count` being 1 or 0 depends on whether `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in `freq`. Since `freq[(mod_x, mod_y)]` is 2 and `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`, the key `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in `freq` if `required_mod_x` equals `mod_x`. If this condition is met, `beautiful_count` is set to 1; otherwise, it remains 0.
