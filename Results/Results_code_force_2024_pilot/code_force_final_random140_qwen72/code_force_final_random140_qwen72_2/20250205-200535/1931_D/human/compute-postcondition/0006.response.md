To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head:

- `num` is the variable that will take each element from the list `a`.
- `a` is the list over which the loop iterates.

For the loop to execute, the list `a` must contain at least one element. The other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `case`, `results`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `freq`, `beautiful_count`) are not directly involved in the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given this, the state that needs to be adjusted is the list `a` to ensure it has at least one element. The variable `num` will be set to the first element of `a` when the loop starts.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least one test case, `case` is the first test case in `test_cases`, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the value of `case['params'][0]`, `x` is the value of `case['params'][1]`, `y` is the value of `case['params'][2]`, `a` is a list that must have at least one element, `num` is the first element of `a`, `freq` is a defaultdict initialized to 0 for all keys, `beautiful_count` is 0**
