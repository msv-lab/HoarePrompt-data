Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading the values of `n`, `x`, and `y`, followed by the array `a`. This part is implemented correctly.

2. **Data Structure**: The program uses a dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of pairs `(mod_x, mod_y)` where `mod_x` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `x` and `mod_y` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`. This is a good approach to efficiently count the number of beautiful pairs.

3. **Beautiful Pair Calculation**:
   - For each number `num` in the array `a`, it calculates `mod_x` and `mod_y`.
   - It then calculates the required remainders `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y` such that:
     - `required_mod_x` is the remainder needed to make `a_i + a_j` divisible by `x`.
     - `required_mod_y` is the remainder needed to make `a_i - a_j` divisible by `y`.
   - If the pair `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` exists in the `freq` dictionary, it adds the frequency of this pair to `beautiful_count`.

4. **Frequency Update**: After checking for the required pair, it updates the frequency of the current pair `(mod_x, mod_y)` in the `freq` dictionary.

5. **Output**: The program correctly appends the `beautiful_count` to the `results` list and prints the results for each test case.

6. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases well, such as when there are no beautiful pairs in the array.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and should work as expected for the given problem description.

Correctness: **True**
