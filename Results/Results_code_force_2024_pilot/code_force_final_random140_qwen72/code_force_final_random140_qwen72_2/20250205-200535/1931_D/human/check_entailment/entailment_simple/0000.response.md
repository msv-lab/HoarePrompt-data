Reasoning:  
The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array for each test case. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading the values of `n`, `x`, and `y`, followed by the array `a`.

2. **Data Structure**: A `defaultdict` named `freq` is used to keep track of the frequency of pairs of remainders `(mod_x, mod_y)` for each element in the array `a`.

3. **Pair Counting**: For each element `num` in the array `a`:
   - It calculates `mod_x` and `mod_y` which are the remainders when `num` is divided by `x` and `y`, respectively.
   - It calculates the required remainders `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y` that would make a pair with the current element `num` a beautiful pair.
   - It checks if the required remainders exist in the `freq` dictionary. If they do, it adds the frequency of those remainders to `beautiful_count`.
   - It updates the `freq` dictionary with the current remainders.

4. **Result Collection**: After processing all elements in the array for a test case, the `beautiful_count` is appended to the `results` list.

5. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the results for each test case.

The logic correctly follows the problem statement and handles the constraints. The use of the `defaultdict` ensures efficient counting of pairs, and the conditions for checking beautiful pairs are implemented correctly.

Correctness: **True**
