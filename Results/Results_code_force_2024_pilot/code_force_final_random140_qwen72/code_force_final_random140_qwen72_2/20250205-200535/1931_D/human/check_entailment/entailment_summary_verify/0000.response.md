### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and the function summary to verify its correctness step-by-step.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y`, and the array `a`.
   - It stores these in a list of dictionaries `test_cases`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` processes each test case in `test_cases`.
   - For each test case, it initializes a frequency dictionary `freq` and a counter `beautiful_count`.
   - It iterates through each element `num` in the array `a`:
     - Calculates `mod_x = num % x` and `mod_y = num % y`.
     - Determines the required values `required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x` and `required_mod_y = mod_y` such that the sum and difference conditions are met.
     - Checks if the pair `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` exists in the frequency dictionary `freq` and adds the count of this pair to `beautiful_count`.
     - Updates the frequency dictionary with the current pair `(mod_x, mod_y)`.
   - Appends the count of beautiful pairs to the results list `results`.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results for each test case.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Frequency Dictionary**:
  - The use of a frequency dictionary `freq` is efficient for counting pairs. It keeps track of how many times each pair `(mod_x, mod_y)` has been seen so far.
  - This allows the program to quickly check if a required pair exists and update the count accordingly.

- **Beautiful Pair Calculation**:
  - The calculation of `mod_x` and `mod_y` ensures that we are working with the remainders when divided by `x` and `y`, respectively.
  - The required values `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y` are calculated to ensure that the sum and difference conditions are met.
  - The check `if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq` ensures that we only count pairs that satisfy both conditions.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles the constraints mentioned in the problem description, including the maximum values for `n`, `x`, and `y`.
  - It also handles the case where there are no beautiful pairs correctly by initializing `beautiful_count` to 0.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array `a` based on the given conditions. The use of a frequency dictionary and the correct calculation of required values ensure that the program efficiently and accurately counts the beautiful pairs for each test case.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
