The function `func` processes a series of test cases. It reads the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and for each test case, it reads an even integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of columns in a 2-row grid. Each cell in the grid contains an arrow ('<' or '>'). The function checks if there exists any pair of adjacent cells in the same row or in the opposite row where both arrows point left ('<'). If such a pair is found, the function prints 'NO' for that test case; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. After processing all test cases, the function completes its execution.
