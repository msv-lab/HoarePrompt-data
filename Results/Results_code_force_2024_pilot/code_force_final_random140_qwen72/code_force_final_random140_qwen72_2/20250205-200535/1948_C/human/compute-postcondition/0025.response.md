Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a new input string, `b` is a new input string, `i` starts at 1, and either (i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<') or (a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'). We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is currently in. The values of `j`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged. The conditions involving `i`, `a`, and `b` also remain valid as they were in the initial state.
