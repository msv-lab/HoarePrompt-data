To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head, which in this case are `i` and `n`.

### Given:
- `j` is 2 (not relevant to the loop head)
- `n` is an input integer greater than 2
- `a` is a new input string (not relevant to the loop head)
- `b` is a new input string (not relevant to the loop head)
- `i` is 1

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, n, 2):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over `i` starting from 1, up to but not including `n`, with a step of 2.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
- For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 2, so `i` will be 3.

### Conditions for the Next Iteration:
- The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < n`.
- Since `i` is 3 after the increment, `n` must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute again.

### Conclusion:
The only variables in the loop head that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`. The other variables (`j`, `a`, `b`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted.

### Final State:
State: **`j` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 3, `a` is a new input string, `b` is a new input string, `i` is 3**
