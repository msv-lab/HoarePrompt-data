Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, representing the number of columns in the grid. The grid consists of 2 rows, and each cell contains an arrow represented by a character '<' or '>', indicating the direction of the arrow. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    for i in range(1, n, 2):
        if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
            print('NO')
            break
    else:
        print('YES')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `j` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string. The loop iterates over odd indices from 1 to `n-1` (inclusive) with a step of 2. If at any iteration `i + 1 < n` and either `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`, the loop breaks and prints 'NO'. If the loop completes without breaking, it prints 'YES'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `j` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a new input string, `b` is a new input string, and the loop has completed all iterations without breaking. The final value of `i` is the largest odd number less than `n`. If the loop did not break, the program prints 'YES'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `j` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `a` is a new input string, `b` is a new input string, and `i` is the largest odd number less than `n`. The program prints 'YES'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
