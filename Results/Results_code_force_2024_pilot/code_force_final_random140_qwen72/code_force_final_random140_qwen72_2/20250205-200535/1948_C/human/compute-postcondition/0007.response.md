Output State: **`j` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, `i` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.** 

The values of the variables `j`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged, but the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
