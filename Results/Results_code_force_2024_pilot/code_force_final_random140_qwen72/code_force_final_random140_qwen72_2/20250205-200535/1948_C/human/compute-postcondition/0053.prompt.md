Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `j` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `a` is a new input string, `b` is a new input string, the loop has completed all iterations without breaking, the final value of `i` is the largest odd number less than `n`, and the program prints 'YES'.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n, 2):
    if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
        print('NO')
        break
else:
    print('YES')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`j` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `a` is a new input string, `b` is a new input string, `i` is 1. If `i + 1 < n` and either `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing the next statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`j` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 3, `a` is a new input string, `b` is a new input string, and `i` is 3. If `i + 1 < n` and either `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues as it was before the if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`j` is 2, `n` is greater than 5, `a` is a new input string, `b` is a new input string, and `i` is 5. If `i + 1 < n` and either `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues as normal.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
