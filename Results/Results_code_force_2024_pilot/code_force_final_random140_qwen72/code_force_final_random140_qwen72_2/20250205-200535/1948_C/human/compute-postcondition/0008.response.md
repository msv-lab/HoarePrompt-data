Postcondition: ***`j` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, `i` is 1. If `i + 1 < n` and either `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing the next statement.***
