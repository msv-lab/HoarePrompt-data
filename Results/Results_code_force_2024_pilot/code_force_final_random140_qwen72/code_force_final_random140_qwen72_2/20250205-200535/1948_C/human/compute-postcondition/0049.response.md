To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement step by step.

### Given Information:
- **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
  - `j` is 2
  - `n` is an input integer greater than 3
  - `a` is a new input string
  - `b` is a new input string
  - `i` is 3
- **Loop Statement:**
  ```python
  for i in range(1, n, 2):
      # the loop body is omit
  ```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `i` and the parameter `n`.

2. **Current State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3.
   - The loop increments `i` by 2 in each iteration (`range(1, n, 2)`).

3. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 2.
   - Therefore, `i` will be `3 + 2 = 5`.

4. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.
   - Since `n` is greater than 3, and `i` is now 5, the loop will continue if `n` is greater than 5.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is now 5.
- `n` must be greater than 5 for the loop to execute again.

### Final State:
State: **`j` is 2, `n` must be greater than 5, `a` is a new input string, `b` is a new input string, `i` is 5**
