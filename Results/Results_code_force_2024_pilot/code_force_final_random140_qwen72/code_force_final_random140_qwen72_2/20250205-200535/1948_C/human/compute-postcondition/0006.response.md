Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3.
- `a` is an input string.
- `b` is an input string.
- `i` is 1.
- The current value of `i` is 1.
- Either `a[1]` and `b[2]` are both `<`, or `a[1]` and `b[0]` are both `<`.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print('NO')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of the variables or the conditions described in the initial state.

Therefore, the output of the code snippet is:

Output: **NO**
