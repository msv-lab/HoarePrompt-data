Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The given solution does not correctly handle all scenarios as per the problem statement. Specifically, the logic used to determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) is flawed. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Condition for Movement**: The condition `if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` does not accurately capture the movement rules of the robot. The robot can move left, right, up, or down, and then follow the arrow in the new cell. This condition only checks specific positions and does not consider the full range of movements the robot can make.

2. **Missing Key Logic**: The solution does not account for the robot's ability to move between rows and columns in a more complex manner. For example, the robot might need to move right, then down, and then follow the arrow in the new cell. The current logic does not cover these scenarios comprehensively.

3. **Edge Cases**: The solution does not handle edge cases where the robot might get stuck in a loop or be unable to reach the target cell due to the configuration of arrows.

A correct solution would involve a more detailed simulation of the robot's movements or a more sophisticated algorithm to determine if the robot can reach the target cell. Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def can_reach_target(n, a, b):
    # Initialize the starting position
    row, col = 0, 0
    
    # Simulate the robot's movements
    while col < n:
        # Move according to the current cell's arrow
        if a[col] == '>':
            col += 1
        elif a[col] == '<':
            col -= 1
        else:
            # Move down to the second row
            row = 1
        
        if row == 1:
            if b[col] == '>':
                col += 1
            elif b[col] == '<':
                col -= 1
            else:
                # Move up to the first row
                row = 0
        
        # Check if the robot is out of bounds
        if col < 0 or col >= n:
            return False
    
    # Check if the robot has reached the target cell (2, n)
    return row == 1 and col == n - 1

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        if can_reach_target(n, a, b):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

This corrected solution simulates the robot's movements step by step and checks if it can reach the target cell (2, n). It handles the movement rules and edge cases more accurately.
