### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The robot starts at cell (1, 1).
   - It must move according to the rules: first, it moves left, right, up, or down, and then it follows the arrow in the current cell.
   - The goal is to determine if the robot can reach cell (2, n).

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the grid size `n` and the two strings representing the arrows in the first and second rows.
   - The program then iterates through the cells in the first row, checking specific conditions to determine if the robot can reach the target cell.

3. **Key Conditions:**
   - The program checks if the robot can get stuck in a loop or if it can be blocked from reaching the target cell.
   - Specifically, it checks if the robot can move from the first row to the second row and vice versa without getting stuck.

4. **Detailed Analysis:**
   - The loop `for i in range(1, n, 2)` iterates over every other cell starting from the second cell (index 1) in the first row.
   - The condition `if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` checks if the robot can get stuck:
     - `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` means the robot is in a cell in the first row where the arrow points left, and the next cell in the second row also points left. This would block the robot from moving further.
     - `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` means the robot is in a cell in the first row where the arrow points left, and the previous cell in the second row also points left. This would also block the robot.
   - If either condition is true, the program prints 'NO' and breaks out of the loop.
   - If the loop completes without finding any blocking conditions, the program prints 'YES'.

5. **Validation Using Annotations:**
   - The annotated code confirms that the program correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
   - The loop iterates over the correct range and checks the conditions as described.
   - The final state of the program ensures that if the loop completes without breaking, the robot can reach the target cell.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly identifies if the robot can reach the target cell (2, n) by checking for potential blocking conditions.
   - The logic is sound and aligns with the problem requirements.
