You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a string s of length n consisting of characters "+" and "-". s
represents an array a of length n defined by a_i=1 if s_i= "+" and a_i=-1 if
s_i= "-".

You will do the following process to calculate your penalty:

  1. Split a into non-empty arrays b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_k such that b_1+b_2+\ldots+b_k=a^\dagger , where + denotes array concatenation. 
  2. The penalty of a single array is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. In other words, for some array c of length m , its penalty is calculated as p(c)=|c_1+c_2+\ldots+c_m| \cdot m . 
  3. The total penalty that you will receive is p(b_1)+p(b_2)+\ldots+p(b_k) . 

If you perform the above process optimally, find the minimum possible penalty
you will receive.

^\dagger Some valid ways to split a=[3,1,4,1,5] into (b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_k) are
([3],[1],[4],[1],[5]) , ([3,1],[4,1,5]) and ([3,1,4,1,5]) while some invalid
ways to split a are ([3,1],[1,5]) , ([3],[\,],[1,4],[1,5]) and ([3,4],[5,1,1])
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 5000
) — the length of string s .

The second line of each test case contains string s (s_i \in \\{ \mathtt{+},
\mathtt{-} \\} , |s| = n ).

Note that there are no constraints on the sum of n over all test cases.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer representing the minimum possible
penalty you will receive.

Note

In the first test case, we have a=[1] . We can split array a into ([1]) .
Then, the sum of penalties of the subarrays is p([1]) = 1 .

In the second test case, we have a=[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1] . We can split array a
into ([-1],[-1],[-1],[-1],[-1]) . Then, the sum of penalties of the subarrays
is p([-1]) + p([-1]) + p([-1]) + p([-1]) + p([-1]) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5 .

In the third test case, we have a=[1,-1,1,-1,1,-1] . We can split array a into
([1,-1,1,-1],[1,-1]) . Then, the sum of penalties of the subarrays is
p([1,-1,1,-1]) + p([1,-1]) = 0 + 0 = 0 .

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        s = int(input())
        e = input()
        P = 0
        M = 0
        for q in e:
            if q == '+':
                P += 1
            else:
                M += 1
        print(abs(P - M))



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple inputs from the user. For each test case (up to `t` cases), it reads an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` containing only '+' and '-' characters. It calculates the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in `s` and prints this difference. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without modifying any external state.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given a string `s` consisting of '+' and '-'.
   - Each '+' corresponds to `1` and each '-' corresponds to `-1`.
   - We need to split the array `a` derived from `s` into subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized.
   - The penalty of a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

2. **Optimal Splitting Strategy:**
   - To minimize the penalty, we should try to balance the subarrays so that their sums are as close to zero as possible.
   - If the entire array `a` has a sum of zero, the optimal way to split it is to keep it as one subarray, resulting in a penalty of zero.
   - If the sum is not zero, the optimal way to split it is to ensure that each subarray has a sum of either 1 or -1, which minimizes the penalty.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `s` and the string itself.
   - It initializes two counters `P` and `M` to count the number of '+' and '-' respectively.
   - It iterates through the string and increments `P` for each '+' and `M` for each '-'.
   - Finally, it prints the absolute difference between `P` and `M`.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly counts the number of '+' and '-' in the string.
   - The final output is the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-', which is equivalent to the sum of the array `a`.
   - However, the program does not consider the optimal splitting strategy to minimize the penalty. It simply calculates the sum of the entire array and outputs the absolute value of this sum.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program does not correctly implement the optimal splitting strategy to minimize the penalty.
   - Therefore, the program is incorrect.
