### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not follow the optimal splitting strategy required by the problem. The program simply calculates the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters, which does not align with the problem's requirement to minimize the penalty by optimally splitting the array.

#### Key Points:
1. **Optimal Splitting Strategy**: The problem requires finding the minimum possible penalty by splitting the array into subarrays in such a way that the sum of penalties of these subarrays is minimized. The provided program does not implement this strategy.
2. **Counterexample Analysis**:
   - For the input `1 6 +-+-+`, the program correctly outputs `0` because the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-' is zero. However, this is a coincidence and does not reflect the correct algorithmic approach.
   - For the input `1 5 ++---`, the program outputs `1`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `13` as per the optimal splitting strategy.

#### Detailed Explanation:
- **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by reading the length of the string and the string itself.
- **Counting '+' and '-'**: The program correctly counts the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string.
- **Incorrect Calculation**: The program calculates the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters and prints this value. This approach does not consider the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not solve the problem as specified and fails to produce the correct output for many test cases due to the lack of an optimal splitting strategy.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
