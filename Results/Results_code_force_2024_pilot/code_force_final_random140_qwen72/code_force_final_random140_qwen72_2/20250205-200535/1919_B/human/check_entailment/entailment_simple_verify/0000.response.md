Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program indeed does not follow the problem description for every potential case. It simply calculates the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters, which does not account for the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty as required by the problem statement. The counterexamples provided in the original assessment clearly demonstrate that the program fails to produce the correct minimum penalty in certain cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
