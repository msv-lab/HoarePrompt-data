Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The program simply calculates the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters, which does not account for the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty as required by the problem statement.

### Key Points:
1. **Optimal Splitting Strategy**: The problem requires finding the optimal way to split the array to minimize the total penalty. The provided program does not implement any logic to determine the optimal splits.
2. **Counterexample Analysis**:
   - For the input `1\n6\n+-+-+-`, the program correctly outputs `0` because the number of '+' and '-' characters is equal, and the optimal split also results in a penalty of `0`.
   - For the input `1\n5\n++---`, the program outputs `1`, which is incorrect. The optimal split should result in a penalty of `13` (as explained in the original assessment).

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases, particularly those where the optimal splitting strategy is necessary to minimize the penalty.

Final: **False**
