Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The problem requires finding the minimum possible penalty by optimally splitting the array into subarrays and calculating the penalty based on the sum of elements in each subarray. However, the given solution simply counts the number of '+' and '-' characters and prints the absolute difference between these counts. This approach does not consider the optimal way to split the array into subarrays to minimize the penalty, which is a crucial part of the problem statement. Therefore, the solution is incorrect.
