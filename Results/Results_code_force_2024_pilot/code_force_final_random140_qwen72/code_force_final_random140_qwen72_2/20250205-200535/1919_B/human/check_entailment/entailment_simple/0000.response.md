Reasoning:  
The program aims to solve the problem by calculating the minimum possible penalty for splitting the array derived from the string `s`. However, the approach taken by the program does not align with the problem's requirements. The program simply counts the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string `s` and prints the absolute difference between these counts. This approach fails to consider the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty, which involves more than just counting the '+' and '-' characters.

The correct solution should involve finding a way to split the array such that the sum of penalties of the subarrays is minimized. The provided program does not attempt to split the array or calculate the penalties of the subarrays; it merely calculates the overall imbalance between '+' and '-' characters, which is not the same as the minimum possible penalty according to the problem's rules.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not follow the steps required to find the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
