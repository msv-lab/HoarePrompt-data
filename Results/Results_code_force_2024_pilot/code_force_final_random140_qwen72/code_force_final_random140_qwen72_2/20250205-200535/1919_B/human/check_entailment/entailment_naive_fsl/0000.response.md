Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the program calculates the difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters and prints the absolute value of this difference. However, this approach does not consider the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty as described in the problem statement.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
1
6
+-+-+-
```
According to the problem description, the optimal way to split the array `a = [1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1]` is to split it into `([1, -1, 1, -1], [1, -1])`. The penalty for each subarray is:
- `p([1, -1, 1, -1]) = |1 - 1 + 1 - 1| * 4 = 0 * 4 = 0`
- `p([1, -1]) = |1 - 1| * 2 = 0 * 2 = 0`

Thus, the total penalty is `0 + 0 = 0`.

However, the provided program calculates the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters:
- `P = 3` (count of '+')
- `M = 3` (count of '-')
- `abs(P - M) = abs(3 - 3) = 0`

While the output is correct in this specific case, the program does not follow the optimal splitting strategy required by the problem. For example, consider the input:
```
1
5
++---
```
The optimal way to split the array `a = [1, 1, -1, -1, -1]` is to split it into `([1, 1], [-1, -1, -1])`. The penalty for each subarray is:
- `p([1, 1]) = |1 + 1| * 2 = 2 * 2 = 4`
- `p([-1, -1, -1]) = |-1 - 1 - 1| * 3 = 3 * 3 = 9`

Thus, the total penalty is `4 + 9 = 13`.

However, the provided program calculates:
- `P = 2` (count of '+')
- `M = 3` (count of '-')
- `abs(P - M) = abs(2 - 3) = 1`

This output is incorrect according to the problem description, which requires the minimum possible penalty. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
