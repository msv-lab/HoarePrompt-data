The function reads multiple inputs from the user. For each test case (up to `t` cases), it reads an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` containing only '+' and '-' characters. It calculates the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in `s` and prints this difference. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without modifying any external state.
