The only objects in the loop head are the variable `q` and the string `e`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the remaining characters in `e`. At the end of the last iteration, `q` is the first character of `e`, and `e` must contain at least one character. For the loop to execute one more time, `e` must still have at least one character left, and `q` will be the next character in `e`.

State: **`s` is the new input integer, `e` is the new input string that must contain at least one character, `i` is incremented by 1 and must be less than the value provided by `int(input())`, `q` is the next character of `e`. If `q` is '+', then `P` is 1 and `M` is 0. Otherwise, `P` is 0 and `M` is 1.**
