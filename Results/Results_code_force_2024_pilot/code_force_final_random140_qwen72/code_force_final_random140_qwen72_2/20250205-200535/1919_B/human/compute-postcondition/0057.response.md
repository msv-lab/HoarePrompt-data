The only objects in the loop head are the variable `q` and the string `e`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `e`. If `e` has more characters, the loop will continue to iterate over each character.

At the end of the last iteration, `e` is a string with at least 2 characters, and `q` is the second character of `e`. For the loop to execute one more time, `e` must have at least 3 characters, and `q` will be the third character of `e`.

State: **`s` is the new input integer, `e` is the new input string with at least 3 characters, `i` is incremented by 1 and is less than the value provided by `int(input())`, `q` is the third character of `e`. If `q` is '+', `P` is 2 and `M` is 0. Otherwise, `P` is 0 and `M` is 2.**
