To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `s` is an input integer.
   - `e` is a non-empty input string.
   - `P` is the number of '+' characters in `e`.
   - `M` is the number of characters in `e` that are not '+'.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(abs(P - M))
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - `P` is the count of '+' characters in the string `e`.
   - `M` is the count of all other characters in the string `e` that are not '+'.
   - The expression `abs(P - M)` calculates the absolute difference between the number of '+' characters and the number of non-'+' characters in the string `e`.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - If `e` contains only '+' characters, then `P` will be the length of `e` and `M` will be 0. Therefore, `abs(P - M)` will be the length of `e`.
   - If `e` contains no '+' characters, then `P` will be 0 and `M` will be the length of `e`. Therefore, `abs(P - M)` will be the length of `e`.
   - If `e` contains both '+' and non-'+' characters, `abs(P - M)` will be the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and non-'+' characters.

Given this, the output will be the absolute difference between the number of '+' characters and the number of non-'+' characters in the string `e`.

Output: **abs(P - M) (where P is the number of '+' characters in e and M is the number of characters in e that are not '+')**
