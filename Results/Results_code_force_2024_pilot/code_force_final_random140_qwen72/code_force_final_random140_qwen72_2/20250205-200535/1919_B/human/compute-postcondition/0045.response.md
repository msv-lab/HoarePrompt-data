Output State: **`s` is the new input integer, `e` is the new input string, `P` is 0, `M` is the number of characters in the new input string `e` that are not '+', `i` is incremented by 1 and must be less than the value provided by `int(input())`.**

Explanation: The variable `P` is reset to 0, while the other variables (`s`, `e`, `M`, and `i`) retain their initial conditions. The condition that `i` is incremented by 1 and must be less than the value provided by `int(input())` remains unchanged.
