Output State: **`s` is the new input integer, `e` is a non-empty input string, `P` is the number of '+' characters in `e`, `M` is the number of characters in `e` that are not '+', `i` is incremented by 1 and must be less than the value provided by `int(input())`.** 

Explanation: The code snippet `s = int(input())` updates the value of `s` to a new integer provided by the user. All other variables (`e`, `P`, `M`, `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
