The function `func` accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `s`. `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of characters '+' and '-'.

The function returns a result based on the input parameters, but the specific output logic is not provided in the given information. However, based on the parameters, we can infer that the function likely processes the string `s` in some way, possibly counting occurrences of '+' and '-', or performing operations based on the values of `t` and `n`.

Since the exact output is not specified, we can only describe the parameters and the general idea that the function processes the string `s` with the given constraints.
