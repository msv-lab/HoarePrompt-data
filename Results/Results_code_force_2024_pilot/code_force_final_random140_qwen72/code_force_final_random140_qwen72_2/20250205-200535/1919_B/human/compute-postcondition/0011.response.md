The only objects in the loop head are the variable `q` and the string `e`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the string `e`. If there are more characters left in `e`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `q` was the first character in `e`, and `e` is a non-empty string. For the loop to execute one more time, `e` must have at least two characters, and `q` will be the second character in `e`.

State: **`s` is an input integer, `e` is a non-empty input string with at least 2 characters, `q` is the second character in `e`. If `q` is `+`, then `P` is 1 and `M` is 0. Otherwise, `P` is 0 and `M` is 1.**
