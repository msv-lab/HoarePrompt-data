Output State: **`s` is the new input integer, `e` is the new input string, `P` is the number of '+' characters in `e`, `M` is the number of characters in `e` that are not '+', `i` is incremented by 1 and must be less than the value provided by `int(input())`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `P` will hold the count of all '+' characters in the string `e`, and the variable `M` will hold the count of all other characters in the string `e`. The variable `s` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop, and `i` continues to increment but must still be less than the value provided by `int(input())`.
