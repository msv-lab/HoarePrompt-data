The value of `P` is incremented by 1. Initially, if `q` is `+`, then `P` is 1 and `M` is 0. After the increment, `P` becomes 2. If `q` is not `+`, then `P` is 0 and `M` is 1, and after the increment, `P` becomes 1. The values of `s`, `e`, and `M` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is an input integer, `e` is a non-empty input string with at least 2 characters, `q` is the second character in `e`. If `q` is `+`, then `P` is 2 and `M` is 0. Otherwise, `P` is 1 and `M` is 1.**
