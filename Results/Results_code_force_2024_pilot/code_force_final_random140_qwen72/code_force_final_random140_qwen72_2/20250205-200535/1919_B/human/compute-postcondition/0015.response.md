The only objects in the loop head are the variable `q` and the string `e`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the string `e`. If `e` has at least 3 characters, the loop can execute again for the third character.

At the end of the last iteration, `e` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters, and `q` is the second character in `e`. For the loop to execute one more time, `e` must have at least 3 characters, and `q` will be the third character in `e`.

State: **`s` is an input integer, `e` is a non-empty input string with at least 3 characters, and `q` is the third character in `e`. If `q` is `+`, then `P` is 2 and `M` is 0. Otherwise, `P` is 0 and `M` is 2.**
