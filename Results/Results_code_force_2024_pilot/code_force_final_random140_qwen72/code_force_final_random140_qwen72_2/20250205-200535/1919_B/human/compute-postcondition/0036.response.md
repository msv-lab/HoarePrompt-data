The only objects in the loop head are the variable `q` and the string `e`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the string `e`. If `e` has more characters left, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `e` must contain at least one character, and `q` is the next character of `e`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `e` must still contain at least one character, and `q` will be the next (second) character of `e`.

State: **`s` is the new input integer, `e` is the new input string that must contain at least two characters, `i` is incremented by 1 and must be less than the value provided by `int(input())`, `q` is the second character of `e`. If `q` is '+', then `P` is 2 and `M` is 0. Otherwise, `P` is 0 and `M` is 2.**
