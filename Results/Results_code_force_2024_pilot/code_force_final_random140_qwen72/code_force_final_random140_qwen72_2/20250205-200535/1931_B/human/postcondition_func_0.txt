The function `func_1` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and a list of `n` integers representing the initial amounts of water in the containers. It sorts the list and checks if the elements are in non-decreasing order. If they are, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the state of the program includes the printed results for each test case.
