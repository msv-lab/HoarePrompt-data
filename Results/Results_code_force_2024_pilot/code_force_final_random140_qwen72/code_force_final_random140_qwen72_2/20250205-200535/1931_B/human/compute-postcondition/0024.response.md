Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, the sum of a_i is divisible by n, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `_` is `t - 1`, and for each test case, `arr` is a sorted list of integers read from the input. For each test case, if all elements in `arr` are in non-decreasing order, the output is 'YES'. Otherwise, the output is 'NO'.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all `t` iterations, the variable `_` will have the value `t - 1`. For each test case, the list `arr` is sorted, and the loop checks if all elements in `arr` are in non-decreasing order. If they are, the output for that test case is 'YES'; otherwise, it is 'NO'. The initial conditions for `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
