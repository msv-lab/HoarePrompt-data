The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the range defined by `t`. The loop can execute again if `_` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1 and `t` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` will be incremented by 1 (so `_` will be 2), and `t` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, the sum of a_i is divisible by n, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `arr` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `_` is 2, and `t` must be greater than 2. If all elements in `arr` are in non-decreasing order, the condition is satisfied. Otherwise, the condition is not satisfied.**
