The code snippet `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `arr`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, the sum of a_i is divisible by n, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5
- `arr` is a sorted list of integers read from the input
- If all elements in `arr` are in non-decreasing order, then the elements of `arr` are in non-decreasing order. Otherwise, there exists at least one index `i` in the range [0, n-2] such that `arr[i] > arr[i + 1]`
- `_` is 1
- `t` must be greater than 1

After executing the code snippet:
- `arr` is updated to a new list of integers read from the input.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `_`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, the sum of a_i is divisible by n, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `_` is 1, and `t` must be greater than 1.**
