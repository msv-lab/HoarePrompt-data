You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the number of containers. a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the initial amounts of water in the containers. The sum of a_i is divisible by n, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        arr.sort()
        
        if all(arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(n - 1)):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, the sum of a_i is divisible by n, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `_` is `t - 1`, and for each test case, `arr` is a sorted list of integers read from the input. For each test case, if all elements in `arr` are in non-decreasing order, the output is 'YES'. Otherwise, the output is 'NO'.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts the number of test cases `t`, the number of containers `n` for each test case, and a list `a` of `n` integers representing the initial amounts of water in the containers. It processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case, ensuring that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n` and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
