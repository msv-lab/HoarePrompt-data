Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `t` must be greater than the current value of `_`, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers from user input, `total_water` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `target` is the integer division of `total_water` by `n`, `current_balance` is now `a[0] - target + a[1] - target`, `i` is 1, `possible` is False.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet sets `possible` to `False`.
- All other variables (`_`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `total_water`, `target`, `current_balance`, `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The condition that `t` must be greater than the current value of `_` is still valid.
- The condition that `n` is an input integer greater than 1 is still valid.
- The list `a` and its sum `total_water` remain as they were.
- The value of `target` as the integer division of `total_water` by `n` remains unchanged.
- The value of `current_balance` as `a[0] - target + a[1] - target` remains unchanged.
- The value of `i` remains 1.
- The variable `possible` is now explicitly set to `False`.
