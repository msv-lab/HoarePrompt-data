Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the number of containers. a_1, a_2, ..., a_n are integers where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the amounts of water in the containers. The sum of a_i is divisible by n, and the total sum of a_i across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^9.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    total_water = sum(a)
    target = total_water // n
    current_balance = 0
    possible = True
    for i in range(n):
        current_balance += a[i] - target
        if current_balance < 0:
            possible = False
            break
    if possible:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer input by the user, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the user input, split by spaces and converted to integers, `total_water` is the sum of the integers in the list `a`, `target` is `total_water // n`, `current_balance` is the sum of `(a[i] - target)` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`. If `current_balance` is less than 0 at any point during the loop, `possible` is set to False. Otherwise, `possible` remains True.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new user input, split by spaces and converted to integers, `total_water` is the sum of the integers in the list `a`, `target` is `total_water // n`, `current_balance` is the sum of the differences between each element in `a` and `target`, `i` is `n-1`, `_` is incremented by 1, and `possible` is either True or False depending on whether `current_balance` remained non-negative throughout the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *After all iterations of the loop, `_` is incremented by 1, `t` must be greater than the current value of `_`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers from user input, `total_water` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `target` is the integer division of `total_water` by `n`, `current_balance` is the sum of `(a[i] - target)` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, and `i` is `n-1`. If `current_balance` did not become less than 0 at any point during the loop, `possible` remains True. Otherwise, `possible` is set to False.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
