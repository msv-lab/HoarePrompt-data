The value of `n` is updated to the integer value provided by the input. The other variables remain unchanged. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an input integer within a certain range, `n` is also an input integer within its specified range, and `a` is a list of integers with specific conditions, these conditions continue to hold true. The specific value of `n` is now the new input.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, the sum of a_i is divisible by n, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `arr` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `_` is 2, and `t` must be greater than 2. If all elements in `arr` are in non-decreasing order, the condition is satisfied. Otherwise, the condition is not satisfied.**
