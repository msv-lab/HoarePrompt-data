Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and it must be greater than 2.
- `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and the sum of a_i is divisible by n.
- `arr` is a sorted list of integers.
- `_` is 2.
- The condition is that if all elements in `arr` are in non-decreasing order, the condition is satisfied. Otherwise, the condition is not satisfied.

Given the `print('NO')` statement, the output will always be 'NO' regardless of the values of the variables and the condition described. The print statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state; it simply prints the string 'NO'.

Output: **NO**
