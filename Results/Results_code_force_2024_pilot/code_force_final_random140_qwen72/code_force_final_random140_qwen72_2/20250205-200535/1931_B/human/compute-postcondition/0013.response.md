The code snippet `arr.sort()` sorts the list `arr` in ascending order. This operation modifies the list `arr` but does not affect the other variables.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, the sum of a_i is divisible by n, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `arr` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `_` is 1, and `t` must be greater than 1.**
