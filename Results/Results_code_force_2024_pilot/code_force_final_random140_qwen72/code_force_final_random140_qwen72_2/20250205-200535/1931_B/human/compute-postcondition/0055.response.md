Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is another input integer.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from a new user input, split by spaces, and converted to integers.
- `total_water` is the sum of the integers in the list `a`.
- `target` is calculated as `total_water // n`.
- `current_balance` is the sum of the differences between each element in `a` and `target`.
- `i` is set to `n-1`.
- `_` is incremented by 1.
- `possible` is set to `True`.

The code snippet to evaluate is:
```python
print('YES')
```

This `print` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`. The values of the variables and objects described in the initial state do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement.

Therefore, the output is:
Output: **YES**
