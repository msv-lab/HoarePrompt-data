Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new user input, split by spaces and converted to integers, `total_water` is the sum of the integers in the list `a`, `target` is `total_water // n`, `current_balance` is `a[0] + a[1] + a[2] - 3 * target`, `i` is 2, `_` is incremented by 1, `possible` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
