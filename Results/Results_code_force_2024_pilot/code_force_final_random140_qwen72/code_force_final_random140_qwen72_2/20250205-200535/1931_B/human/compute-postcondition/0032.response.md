The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into substrings based on spaces, converts each substring to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an input integer
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the user input, split by spaces and converted to integers
- `total_water` is the sum of the integers in the list `a`
- `target` is `total_water // n`
- `current_balance` is the sum of `(a[i] - target)` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`
- `i` is `n-1`
- `_` is incremented by 1
- `possible` remains True unless `current_balance` is less than 0 at any point during the loop

After executing the code snippet:
- The variable `a` is updated to the new list of integers read from the user input.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `total_water`, `target`, `current_balance`, `i`, `_`, `possible`) remain unchanged because they are not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new user input, split by spaces and converted to integers, `total_water` is the sum of the integers in the list `a`, `target` is `total_water // n`, `current_balance` is the sum of `(a[i] - target)` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `_` is incremented by 1, and `possible` remains True unless `current_balance` is less than 0 at any point during the loop.**
