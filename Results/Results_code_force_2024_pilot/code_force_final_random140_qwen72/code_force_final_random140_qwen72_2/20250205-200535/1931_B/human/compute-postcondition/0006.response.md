Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is within the range 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
- The sum of all elements in `a` is divisible by `n`.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
- `arr` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, and the elements of `arr` are in non-decreasing order.

The provided code snippet is:
```python
print('YES')
```

This code simply prints the string `'YES'` without any reference to the variables or objects described in the initial state. Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **YES**
