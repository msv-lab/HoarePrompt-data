You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the number of containers. a_1, a_2, ..., a_n are integers where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the amounts of water in the containers. The sum of a_i is divisible by n, and the total sum of a_i across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^9.
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        total_water = sum(a)
        
        target = total_water // n
        
        current_balance = 0
        
        possible = True
        
        for i in range(n):
            current_balance += a[i] - target
            if current_balance < 0:
                possible = False
                break
        
        if possible:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `_` is equal to `t`, `n` has been updated with the last input integer, `a` is the last list of integers from user input, `total_water` is the sum of the elements in the last `a`, `target` is the integer division of the last `total_water` by the last `n`, `current_balance` is the sum of `(a[i] - target)` for all `i` from 0 to the last `n-1`, and `i` is the last `n-1`. If `current_balance` did not become less than 0 at any point during the last loop, `possible` remains True. Otherwise, `possible` is set to False.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases, each containing the number of containers `n` and the amounts of water in the containers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. It processes the input data and returns a result for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
