The code snippet `total_water = sum(a)` calculates the sum of all elements in the list `a` and assigns this sum to the variable `total_water`. The other variables (`_`, `t`, `n`) and their conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `t` must be greater than the current value of `_`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers from user input, `total_water` is the sum of the elements in `a`.**
