Functionality: ** The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of containers and the amounts of water in these containers. For each test case, it checks if it is possible to balance the water such that each container has the same amount of water without any container ever having a negative amount of water. If balancing is possible, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function ends, leaving no lasting changes to external state beyond the printed output. **
