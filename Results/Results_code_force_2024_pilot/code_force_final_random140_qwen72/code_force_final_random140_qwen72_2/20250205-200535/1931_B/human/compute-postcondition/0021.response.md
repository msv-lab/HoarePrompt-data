Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and it must be greater than 2.
- `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and the sum of a_i is divisible by n.
- `arr` is a sorted list of integers.
- `_` is 2.
- The condition states that if all elements in `arr` are in non-decreasing order, the condition is satisfied. Otherwise, the condition is not satisfied.

Given that `arr` is described as a sorted list of integers, by definition, a sorted list is always in non-decreasing order. Therefore, the condition is always satisfied.

The code snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

This code will always print 'YES' because the condition specified in the initial state (that `arr` is in non-decreasing order) is always true for a sorted list.

Output: **YES**
