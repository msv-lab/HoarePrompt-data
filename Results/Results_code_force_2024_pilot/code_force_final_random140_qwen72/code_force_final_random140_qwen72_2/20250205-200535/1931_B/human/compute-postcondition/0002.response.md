The value of `n` is updated to the integer value provided by the user through the `input()` function. The constraints for `n` remain the same, i.e., 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. The other variables and conditions from the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, the sum of a_i is divisible by n, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
