Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new user input, split by spaces and converted to integers, `total_water` is the sum of the integers in the list `a`, `target` is `total_water // n`, `current_balance` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `_` is incremented by 1, and `possible` is True.**

Explanation: The code snippet sets the variable `possible` to `True`. This does not affect any of the other variables mentioned in the initial state, so their values remain unchanged. The output state reflects the updated value of `possible` while keeping all other variables and conditions the same as in the initial state.
