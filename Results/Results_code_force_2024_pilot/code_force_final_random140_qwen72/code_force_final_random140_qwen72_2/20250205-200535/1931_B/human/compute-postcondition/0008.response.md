Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
- The sum of a_i is divisible by n.
- The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
- `arr` is a sorted list of integers read from the input.
- There exists at least one index `i` in the range [0, n-2] such that `arr[i] > arr[i + 1]`.

Given these conditions, the `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print('NO')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'NO'`. The conditions provided do not affect the content of the `print` statement, as it is a static string.

Output: **NO**
