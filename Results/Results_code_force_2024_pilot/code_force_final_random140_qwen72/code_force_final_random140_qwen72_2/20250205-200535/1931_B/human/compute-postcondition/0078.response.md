The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 (so `i` is 2), and `n` must still be greater than `i` (so `n` must be greater than 2).

State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `t` must be greater than the current value of `_`, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers from user input, `total_water` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `target` is the integer division of `total_water` by `n`, `current_balance` is now `a[0] - target + a[1] - target`, `i` is 2, `possible` remains True**
