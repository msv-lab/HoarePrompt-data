Based on the initial state provided:

- `_` is incremented by 1 after all iterations of the loop.
- `t` must be greater than the current value of `_`.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of integers from user input.
- `total_water` is the sum of the elements in `a`.
- `target` is the integer division of `total_water` by `n`.
- `current_balance` is the sum of `(a[i] - target)` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `possible` is set to `False`.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('NO')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Since the value of `possible` is explicitly set to `False`, and the `print` statement does not depend on any other variables or conditions, the output will be:

Output: **NO**
