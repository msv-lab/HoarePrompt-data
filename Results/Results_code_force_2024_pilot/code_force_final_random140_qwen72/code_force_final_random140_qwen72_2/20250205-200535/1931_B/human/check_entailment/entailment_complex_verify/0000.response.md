Reasoning:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program indeed has a logical flaw that prevents it from correctly solving the problem. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Sorting the Array**: The program sorts the array of water levels. This step is unnecessary and incorrect because the problem specifies that water can only be poured from a container with a higher index to a container with a lower index. Sorting the array changes the original order, which is not allowed.

2. **Checking Sorted Order**: The program checks if the sorted array is in non-decreasing order. This check is irrelevant to the problem's requirements. The goal is to determine if it is possible to equalize the water levels in the containers, not to check if the array is sorted.

3. **Correct Approach**: The correct approach involves checking if the sum of the water levels is divisible by the number of containers (which is already given in the problem constraints). Additionally, we need to ensure that the maximum difference between any two containers can be reduced to zero by pouring water from higher to lower containers. This can be achieved by ensuring that the maximum water level minus the minimum water level is less than or equal to the number of containers minus one, multiplied by the average water level.

### Counterexample:
Consider the test case:
```
Input:
1
3
1 2 3
```
- The sum of the water levels is \(1 + 2 + 3 = 6\), which is divisible by 3.
- The average water level is \(6 / 3 = 2\).
- To equalize the water:
  - Pour 1 unit of water from the third container to the first container. Now the containers have [2, 2, 2].

The correct answer should be "YES" because it is possible to equalize the water levels. However, the provided program will output "NO" because it checks if the array is sorted, which it is not after sorting.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment correctly identifies the flaws in the program. The program's logic is incorrect and does not solve the problem as specified.

Final: **False**
