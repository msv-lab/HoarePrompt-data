Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies the flaws in the provided program. The program's logic of sorting the array and checking if it is in non-decreasing order is fundamentally incorrect for solving the problem. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Sorting the Array**: Sorting the array changes the original order of the containers, which is not allowed according to the problem statement. The problem requires us to pour water from one container to another while maintaining the original order of the containers.

2. **Checking Sorted Order**: Checking if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order does not guarantee that the water levels can be equalized. The correct approach involves verifying if the sum of the water in the containers is divisible by the number of containers and ensuring that the water can be redistributed to make all containers have the same amount of water.

### Correct Approach:
To determine if it is possible to equalize the water levels in the containers, we need to:
1. Calculate the target water level, which is the total water divided by the number of containers.
2. Check if it is possible to redistribute the water such that all containers have the target water level. This can be done by ensuring that the sum of the water in the containers is divisible by the number of containers and that the water can be poured from higher to lower containers without violating the condition \(i < j\).

### Counterexample:
Consider the test case:
```
Input:
1
3
1 2 3
```
- The sum of the water in the containers is \(1 + 2 + 3 = 6\), which is divisible by 3.
- The target water level is \(6 / 3 = 2\).
- We can pour 1 unit of water from the third container to the first container to achieve [2, 2, 2].

The correct answer should be "YES" because it is possible to equalize the water levels. However, the provided program will output "NO" because it checks if the array is sorted, which it is not after sorting.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate in identifying the flaws in the provided program. The program's logic is incorrect and does not solve the problem as described.

Final: **False**
