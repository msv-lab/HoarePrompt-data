Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The issue lies in the logic used to determine if it is possible to equalize the water levels in the containers. The program sorts the array and checks if it is already sorted in non-decreasing order. However, this approach is flawed because:

1. **Sorting the Array**: Sorting the array changes the original order of the containers, which is not allowed according to the problem statement. The problem requires us to pour water from one container to another without changing the order of the containers.

2. **Checking Sorted Order**: Checking if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order does not guarantee that the water levels can be equalized. The correct approach would be to check if the sum of the water in the containers is divisible by the number of containers and if the maximum difference between any two containers can be reduced to zero by pouring water from higher to lower containers.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
3
1 2 3
```
According to the problem, we need to determine if it is possible to make all containers have the same amount of water. The sum of the water in the containers is \(1 + 2 + 3 = 6\), which is divisible by 3. The average amount of water per container is \(6 / 3 = 2\).

To equalize the water:
- Pour 1 unit of water from the third container to the first container. Now the containers have [2, 2, 2].

The correct answer should be "YES" because it is possible to equalize the water levels. However, the provided program will output "NO" because it checks if the array is sorted, which it is not after sorting.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
