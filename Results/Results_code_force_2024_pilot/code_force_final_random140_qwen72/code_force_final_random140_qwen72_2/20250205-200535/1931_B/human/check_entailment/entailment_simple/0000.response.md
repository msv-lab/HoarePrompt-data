Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if it's possible to equalize the amount of water in all containers using the specified pouring operations. The key insight here is that if the total amount of water is evenly divisible by the number of containers, and we can only pour water from a container with more water to a container with less water (ensuring \(i < j\)), then the final state should have all containers holding the same amount of water, which is the average of the initial amounts.

However, the provided solution sorts the array and checks if it is in non-decreasing order. This check is not relevant to the problem's requirements. Sorting the array and checking for a non-decreasing order does not ensure that the water can be evenly distributed among the containers. Instead, the correct approach would be to check if the minimum value in the array is less than or equal to the average and the maximum value is greater than or equal to the average, which would imply that it's possible to redistribute the water to achieve equality.

Given the above, the provided solution does not correctly solve the problem as it relies on an irrelevant condition (sorted order) rather than the necessary condition (ability to redistribute water to achieve equality).

Correctness: **False**
