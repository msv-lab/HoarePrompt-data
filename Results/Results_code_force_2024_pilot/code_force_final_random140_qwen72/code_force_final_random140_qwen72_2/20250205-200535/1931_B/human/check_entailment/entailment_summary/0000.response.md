Reasoning:  
The logic implemented in the provided program is flawed. The problem requires determining if it's possible to equalize the water levels in all containers using the specified pouring operation. However, the program simply sorts the array and checks if it is in non-decreasing order, which is not the correct approach to solve this problem.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to check if the average amount of water (which is the total amount of water divided by the number of containers) can be achieved in all containers. Given that the sum of water is divisible by the number of containers, the key is to ensure that no container has more water than the average before the operations start, because water can only be poured from a container with more water to a container with less water, and the operation is restricted to pouring from a lower-indexed container to a higher-indexed one.

The correct approach would involve checking if the maximum amount of water in any container is greater than the average amount of water. If it is, then it is impossible to equalize the water levels because there would be no way to reduce the water in the container with the most water without violating the condition \(i < j\).

However, the provided program does not perform this check. Instead, it sorts the array and checks if it is in non-decreasing order, which is irrelevant to the problem's requirements.

Therefore, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
