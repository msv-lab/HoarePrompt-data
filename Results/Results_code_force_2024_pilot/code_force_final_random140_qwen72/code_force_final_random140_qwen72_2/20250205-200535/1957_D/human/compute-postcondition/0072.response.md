Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input and contains exactly `n` elements, `prefix` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` up to that point, `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing [32, 0], `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing [x, y] where `x` is the total count of bits in all `cur` values that are 0 and `y` is the total count of bits in all `cur` values that are 1 for each bit position from 0 to 31, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `cur` is `prefix[1]`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `n` down to 1, so after all iterations, `i` will be 0.
- For each iteration, `cur` is set to `prefix[i]`, and the loop updates the `suf` list based on the bits of `cur`.
- After all iterations, `suf` will contain the total counts of 0s and 1s for each bit position (from 0 to 31) across all `cur` values.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `arr`, `prefix`, `pre`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
