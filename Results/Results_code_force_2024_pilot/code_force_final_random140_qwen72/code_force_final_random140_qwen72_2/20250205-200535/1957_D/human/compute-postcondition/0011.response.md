Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input and contains exactly `n` elements, `prefix` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` up to that point, `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing two zeros, `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing two zeros.**

The code initializes a new list `suf` with 32 sublists, each containing two zeros. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `arr`, `prefix`, or `pre`. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged except for the addition of the `suf` list.
