Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input and contains exactly `n` elements, `prefix` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` up to that point, `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing [32, 0], `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing two zeros, `i` is 31.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates 32 times, once for each value of `i` from 0 to 31.
- In each iteration, `pre[i][0]` is incremented by 1.
- After 32 iterations, each sublist in `pre` will have its first element (index 0) incremented to 32, while the second element (index 1) remains 0.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `arr`, `prefix`, and `suf`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- The loop variable `i` will be 31 after the last iteration.
