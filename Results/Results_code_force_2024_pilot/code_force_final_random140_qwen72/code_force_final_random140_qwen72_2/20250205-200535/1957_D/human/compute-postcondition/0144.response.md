Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` remains a list of integers read from the input and contains exactly `n` elements, `prefix` remains a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` up to that point, `i` is 1, `cur` remains unchanged, `c` is now `prefix[1]`, `y` is now the first element of `arr`, `k` is the bit length of the first element of `arr` minus 1, `j` is 1, `ans` is now `ans + pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]`, `pre[j][0]` is incremented by 1.** 

Explanation: The code snippet `pre[j][0] += 1` increments the value of `pre[j][0]` by 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
