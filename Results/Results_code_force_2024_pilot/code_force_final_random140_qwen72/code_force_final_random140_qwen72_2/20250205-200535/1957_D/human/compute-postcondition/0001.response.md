The code snippet `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in a list called `arr`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
- `n` is now an input integer.

After executing the code snippet:
- `arr` is a list of integers read from the input.
- The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. `n` is now an input integer. `arr` is a list of integers read from the input.**
