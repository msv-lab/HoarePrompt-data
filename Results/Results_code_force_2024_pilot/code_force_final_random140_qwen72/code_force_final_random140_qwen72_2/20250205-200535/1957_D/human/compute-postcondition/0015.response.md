Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input and contains exactly `n` elements, `prefix` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` up to that point, `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing [1, 0] at index 0 and [0, 0] for the rest except for `pre[1][0]` which is now 2, `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing two zeros, `i` is 1.**
