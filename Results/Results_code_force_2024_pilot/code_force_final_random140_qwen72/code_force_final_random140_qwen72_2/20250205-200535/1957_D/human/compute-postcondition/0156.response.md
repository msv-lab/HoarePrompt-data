The function `func_1` does not explicitly define its parameters within the function signature. However, based on the provided parameter constraints and relationships, it can be inferred that the function likely processes multiple test cases, each containing a list of integers. Specifically, the function is expected to handle:

- `t`: An integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - `n`: An integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, representing the number of elements in the list.
  - `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`: A list of integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.

The function's output is not specified in the problem statement, but typically, such functions would return or print some result for each test case. Since the exact output is not provided, we can only describe the input parameters and the general context in which the function operates.

Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and a list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. It processes each test case according to the given constraints and returns or prints a result for each test case.**
