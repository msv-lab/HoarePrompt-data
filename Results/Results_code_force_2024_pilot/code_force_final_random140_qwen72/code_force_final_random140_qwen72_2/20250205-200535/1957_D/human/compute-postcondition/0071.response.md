Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input and contains exactly `n` elements, `prefix` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` up to that point, `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing [32, 0], `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing [x, y] where `x` is the count of bits in `cur` that are 0 and `y` is the count of bits in `cur` that are 1 for each bit position from 0 to 31, `i` is `n - 2`, `n` must be greater than 0, `cur` is `prefix[n-2]`, `j` is 31. After the loop completes, for each bit position `j` from 0 to 31, if the bit at position `j` in `cur` is 1, then `suf[j][1]` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `suf[j][0]` is incremented by 1.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the `suf` list will have been updated such that for each bit position from 0 to 31, the count of 0s and 1s in the corresponding bit position of `cur` (which is `prefix[n-2]`) will be reflected in `suf`. Specifically, for each bit position `j`, if the bit at position `j` in `cur` is 1, then the count of 1s (`suf[j][1]`) will be incremented by 1; otherwise, the count of 0s (`suf[j][0]`) will be incremented by 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `arr`, `prefix`, `pre`, `i`, and `cur`) remain unchanged.
