Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` remains a list of integers read from the input and contains exactly `n` elements, `prefix` remains a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` up to that point, `i` is 1, `cur` remains unchanged, `c` is now `prefix[1]`, `y` is now the first element of `arr`, `k` is the bit length of the first element of `arr` minus 1, `j` is 31, and `ans` is now `ans + pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]`.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(32):
    if c >> j & 1:
        pre[j][1] += 1
        suf[j][1] -= 1
    else:
        pre[j][0] += 1
        suf[j][0] -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` remains a list of integers read from the input and contains exactly `n` elements, `prefix` remains a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` up to that point, `i` is 1, `cur` remains unchanged, `c` is now `prefix[1]`, `y` is now the first element of `arr`, `k` is the bit length of the first element of `arr` minus 1, `j` is 0, `ans` is now `ans + pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]`. If the bit at position `j` in `c` is 1, then `pre[j][1]` is incremented by 1 and `suf[j][1]` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, if the bit at position `j` in `c` is 0, then `pre[j][0]` is incremented by 1 and `suf[j][0]` is decremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` remains a list of integers read from the input and contains exactly `n` elements, `prefix` remains a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` up to that point, `i` is 1, `cur` remains unchanged, `c` is now `prefix[1]`, `y` is now the first element of `arr`, `k` is the bit length of the first element of `arr` minus 1, `j` is 1, `ans` is now `ans + pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]`. If the bit at position `j` in `c` is 1, then `pre[j][1]` is incremented by 1 and `suf[j][1]` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, if the bit at position `j` in `c` is 0, then `pre[j][0]` is incremented by 1 and `suf[j][0]` is decremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` remains a list of integers read from the input and contains exactly `n` elements, `prefix` remains a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` up to that point, `i` is 1, `cur` remains unchanged, `c` is now `prefix[1]`, `y` is now the first element of `arr`, `k` is the bit length of the first element of `arr` minus 1, `j` is 2, `ans` is now `ans + pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]`. If the bit at position `j` in `c` is 1, then `pre[j][1]` is incremented by 1 and `suf[j][1]` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, if the bit at position `j` in `c` is 0, then `pre[j][0]` is incremented by 1 and `suf[j][0]` is decremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
