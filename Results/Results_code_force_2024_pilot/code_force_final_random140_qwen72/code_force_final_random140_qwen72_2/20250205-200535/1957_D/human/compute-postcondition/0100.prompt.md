Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input and contains exactly `n` elements, `prefix` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` up to that point, `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing [32, 0], `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing [x, y] where `x` is the total count of bits in all `cur` values that are 0 and `y` is the total count of bits in all `cur` values that are 1 for each bit position from 0 to 31, `i` is 1, `cur` is `prefix[1]`, `ans` is `pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]`, `y` is `arr[0]`, `k` is the bit length of `y` minus 1, `c` is `prefix[1]`.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(32):
    if c >> j & 1:
        pre[j][1] += 1
        suf[j][1] -= 1
    else:
        pre[j][0] += 1
        suf[j][0] -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input and contains exactly `n` elements, `prefix` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` up to that point, `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing [32, 0] except for the sublist at index `j` which is updated to either [32, 1] if the `j`-th bit of `c` is 1 or [33, 0] if the `j`-th bit of `c` is 0, `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing [x, y] where `x` is the total count of bits in all `cur` values that are 0 and `y` is the total count of bits in all `cur` values that are 1 for each bit position from 0 to 31, and `suf[j][1]` is decreased by 1 if the `j`-th bit of `c` is 1 or `suf[j][0]` is decreased by 1 if the `j`-th bit of `c` is 0, `i` is 1, `cur` is `prefix[1]`, `ans` is `pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]`, `y` is `arr[0]`, `k` is the bit length of `y` minus 1, and `c` is `prefix[1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input and contains exactly `n` elements, `prefix` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` up to that point, `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing [32, 0] except for the sublist at index 1 which is updated to [32, 1] if the 1st bit of `c` is 1, or [33, 0] if the 1st bit of `c` is 0, `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing [x, y] where `x` is the total count of bits in all `cur` values that are 0 and `y` is the total count of bits in all `cur` values that are 1 for each bit position from 0 to 31, and `suf[1][1]` is decreased by 1 if the 1st bit of `c` is 1, or `suf[1][0]` is decreased by 1 if the 1st bit of `c` is 0, `i` is 1, `cur` is `prefix[1]`, `ans` is `pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]`, `y` is `arr[0]`, `k` is the bit length of `y` minus 1, `c` is `prefix[1]`, `j` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input and contains exactly `n` elements, `prefix` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` up to that point, `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing [32, 0] except for the sublist at index 1 which is updated to [32, 1] if the 1st bit of `c` is 1, or [33, 0] if the 1st bit of `c` is 0, and the sublist at index 2 is updated to [32, 1] if the 2nd bit of `c` is 1, or [33, 0] if the 2nd bit of `c` is 0, `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing [x, y] where `x` is the total count of bits in all `cur` values that are 0 and `y` is the total count of bits in all `cur` values that are 1 for each bit position from 0 to 31, and `suf[1][1]` is decreased by 1 if the 1st bit of `c` is 1, or `suf[1][0]` is decreased by 1 if the 1st bit of `c` is 0, and `suf[2][1]` is decreased by 1 if the 2nd bit of `c` is 1, or `suf[2][0]` is decreased by 1 if the 2nd bit of `c` is 0, `i` is 1, `cur` is `prefix[1]`, `ans` is `pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]`, `y` is `arr[0]`, `k` is the bit length of `y` minus 1, `c` is `prefix[1]`, `j` is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
