The code snippet `suf[j][1] += 1` increments the second element of the sublist `suf[j]` by 1. Given the initial state:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
- `arr` is a list of integers read from the input and contains exactly `n` elements
- `prefix` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` up to that point
- `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing [32, 0]
- `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing [0, 0] except for the following: if the least significant bit of `cur` (i.e., `cur >> j & 1`) is 1, then `suf[j]` is [0, 1]; otherwise, `suf[j]` is [1, 0]
- `i` is `n`
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `cur` is `prefix[n]`
- `j` is 1

Given that `j` is 1, the sublist `suf[1]` is updated. If the least significant bit of `cur` (i.e., `cur >> 1 & 1`) is 1, then `suf[1]` is initially [0, 1]. Otherwise, `suf[1]` is initially [1, 0].

After executing the code snippet, the second element of `suf[1]` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the updated state is:

- If `cur >> 1 & 1` is 1, then `suf[1]` becomes [0, 2].
- If `cur >> 1 & 1` is 0, then `suf[1]` becomes [1, 1].

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input and contains exactly `n` elements, `prefix` is a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` up to that point, `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing [32, 0], `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing [0, 0] except for `suf[1]` which is [0, 2] if the second least significant bit of `cur` is 1, or [1, 1] if the second least significant bit of `cur` is 0, `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `cur` is `prefix[n]`, and `j` is 1.**
