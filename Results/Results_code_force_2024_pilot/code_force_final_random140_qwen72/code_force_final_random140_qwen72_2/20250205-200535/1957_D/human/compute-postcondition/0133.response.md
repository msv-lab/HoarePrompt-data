The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j`. The loop will execute if `j` is within the range specified by `range(32)`, which means `j` should start at 0 and increment until it reaches 31.

Given the initial state, `j` is already set to 31, which is the last value in the range. For the loop to execute, `j` needs to be reset to 0.

State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` remains a list of integers read from the input and contains exactly `n` elements, `prefix` remains a list containing `n + 1` elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` up to that point, `i` is 1, `cur` remains unchanged, `c` is now `prefix[1]`, `y` is now the first element of `arr`, `k` is the bit length of the first element of `arr` minus 1, `j` is 0, and `ans` is now `ans + pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]`**
