To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the state of the objects mentioned in the loop head, which in this case is `v` and `arr`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
- `n` is now an input integer.
- `arr` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `prefix` is a list containing a single element `[0]`.

For the loop to execute:
- `arr` must contain at least one element. This is because the loop iterates over each element in `arr`, and if `arr` is empty, the loop will not execute.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `arr` is not empty. The variable `v` will take the value of the first element in `arr` when the loop starts.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input and must contain at least one element, `prefix` is a list containing a single element `[0]`, `v` is the first element in `arr`**
