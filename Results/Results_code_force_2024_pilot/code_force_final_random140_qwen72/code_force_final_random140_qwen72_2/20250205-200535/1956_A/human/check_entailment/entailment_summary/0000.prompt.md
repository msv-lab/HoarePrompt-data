Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Nene invented a new game based on an increasing sequence of integers a_1, a_2,
\ldots, a_k .

In this game, initially n players are lined up in a row. In each of the rounds
of this game, the following happens:

  * Nene finds the a_1 -th, a_2 -th, \ldots , a_k -th players in a row. They are kicked out of the game simultaneously. If the i -th player in a row should be kicked out, but there are fewer than i players in a row, they are skipped. 

Once no one is kicked out of the game in some round, all the players that are
still in the game are declared as winners.

For example, consider the game with a=[3, 5] and n=5 players. Let the players
be named player A, player B, \ldots , player E in the order they are lined up
initially. Then,

  * Before the first round, players are lined up as ABCDE. Nene finds the 3 -rd and the 5 -th players in a row. These are players C and E. They are kicked out in the first round. 
  * Now players are lined up as ABD. Nene finds the 3 -rd and the 5 -th players in a row. The 3 -rd player is player D and there is no 5 -th player in a row. Thus, only player D is kicked out in the second round. 
  * In the third round, no one is kicked out of the game, so the game ends after this round. 
  * Players A and B are declared as the winners. 

Nene has not yet decided how many people would join the game initially. Nene
gave you q integers n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_q and you should answer the following
question for each 1 \le i \le q independently:

  * How many people would be declared as winners if there are n_i players in the game initially? 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 250 ). The description of test cases follows.

The first line case contains two integers k and q (1 \le k, q \le 100 ) — the
length of the sequence a and the number of values n_i you should solve this
problem for.

The second line contains k integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_k (1\leq
a_1<a_2<\ldots<a_k\leq 100 ) — the sequence a .

The third line contains q integers n_1,n_2,\ldots,n_q (1\leq n_i \leq 100 ).

Output

For each test case, output q integers: the i -th (1\le i \le q ) of them
should be the number of players declared as winners if initially n_i players
join the game.

    50 
    1 9 9 
    
Note

The first test case was explained in the statement.

In the second test case, when n=1 , the only player stays in the game in the
first round. After that, the game ends and the only player is declared as a
winner.

# Functions with Execution Summary:
import bisect

output = func_2()
for result in output:
    print(result)

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(p):
    max_n = 100
    remaining_players = [0] * (max_n + 1)
    for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
        cur_n = n
        while cur_n >= min(p):
            count = bisect.bisect_right(p, cur_n)
            cur_n -= count
        remaining_players[n] = cur_n
    return remaining_players
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` takes a list `p` of unique integers sorted in ascending order, where each integer is between 1 and 100. It processes each integer from 1 to 100, reducing it based on the values in `p`, and returns a list `remaining_players` where each element at index `n` (from 1 to 100) represents the final value of `cur_n` after processing that iteration. The original list `p` remains unchanged.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        (k, q) = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        qs = list(map(int, input().split()))
        remaining_players = func_1(p)
        res = [remaining_players[n] for n in qs]
        results.append(' '.join(map(str, res)))
    return results
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` reads multiple sets of input data, processes each set, and returns a list of results. Each set of input data includes the length of a sequence `p`, a list of integers `p`, and a list of query indices `qs`. For each set, the function computes a new list `remaining_players` by calling `func_1(p)`, then selects elements from `remaining_players` based on the indices in `qs`. These selected elements are converted to strings and concatenated into a single string, which is added to the final list `results`. After processing all sets, the function returns `results`, a list of `t` strings, where each string represents the concatenated results of the corresponding set of queries.
