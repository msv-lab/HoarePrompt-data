Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It precomputes the number of remaining players for all possible initial numbers of players (up to 100) using `func_1` and then uses this precomputed data to quickly answer the queries in `func_2`. The use of binary search (`bisect.bisect_right`) ensures efficient computation of the number of players to remove in each round. The overall structure and logic of the program align with the requirements of the problem statement.
