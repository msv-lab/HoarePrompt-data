Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program appears to correctly implement the described game logic. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function precomputes the number of remaining players for all possible initial player counts from 1 to 100.
   - It iterates over each possible initial player count `n`.
   - For each `n`, it simulates the rounds of the game by repeatedly removing players at positions specified in the list `p` until no more players can be removed.
   - The result of this simulation is stored in the `remaining_players` list.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `k` and `q`, the sequence `p`, and the list of initial player counts `qs`.
   - It uses the precomputed `remaining_players` list from `func_1` to quickly determine the number of remaining players for each initial player count in `qs`.
   - The results are collected and returned as a list of strings, each representing the results for a test case.

The program handles all edge cases and constraints mentioned in the problem description:
- It correctly handles the case where the number of players is less than the smallest value in `p`.
- It correctly handles the case where the number of players is greater than the largest value in `p`.
- It correctly handles the case where the number of players is exactly equal to one of the values in `p`.

Since the program correctly implements the game logic and handles all potential cases, it is considered correct.
