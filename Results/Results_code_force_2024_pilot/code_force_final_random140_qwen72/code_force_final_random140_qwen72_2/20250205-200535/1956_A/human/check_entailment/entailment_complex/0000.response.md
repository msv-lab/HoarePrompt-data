Reasoning:  
The program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the key points:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function initializes a list `remaining_players` to store the number of remaining players for each initial number of players from 1 to 100.
   - It iterates over each possible number of players `n` from 1 to 100.
   - For each `n`, it simulates the rounds of the game by repeatedly reducing `cur_n` (the current number of players) by the number of players to be kicked out in each round, as determined by the positions in the list `p`.
   - The final value of `cur_n` after all rounds is stored in `remaining_players[n]`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function handles multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `k` and `q`, the sequence `p`, and the list of query values `qs`.
   - It calls `func_1(p)` to get the list `remaining_players`.
   - It then constructs the result for each query by looking up the corresponding value in `remaining_players` and appends the results to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it returns the `results` list, which contains the answers for all test cases.

The logic in both functions aligns with the problem requirements, and the program correctly processes the input and produces the expected output. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
