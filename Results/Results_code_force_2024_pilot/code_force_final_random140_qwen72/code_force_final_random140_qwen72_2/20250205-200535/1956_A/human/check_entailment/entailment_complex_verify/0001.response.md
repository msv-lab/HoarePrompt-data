### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves simulating a game where players are removed from a line based on a sequence `a` of positions. The game continues until no more players can be removed according to the sequence `a`.
   - We need to determine the number of winners for different initial numbers of players `n`.

2. **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
   - This function precomputes the number of remaining players for all possible initial player counts from 1 to 100.
   - It initializes an array `remaining_players` to store the results.
   - For each `n` from 1 to 100, it simulates the game by repeatedly removing players according to the sequence `p` until no more players can be removed.
   - The number of remaining players is stored in `remaining_players[n]`.

3. **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
   - This function reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `k`, `q`, the sequence `p`, and the list of initial player counts `qs`.
   - It calls `func_1` to get the precomputed results for the sequence `p`.
   - It then retrieves the number of remaining players for each `n` in `qs` using the precomputed results and appends the results to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it returns the results for all test cases.

4. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - **Precomputation (`func_1`):**
     - The function correctly simulates the game for each `n` from 1 to 100.
     - It uses `bisect.bisect_right` to efficiently find the number of players to remove in each round.
     - The results are stored in `remaining_players`, which is used to quickly look up the number of remaining players for any given `n`.
     - The loop `while cur_n >= min(p):` ensures that the game continues until no more players can be removed according to the sequence `p`.

   - **Processing Test Cases (`func_2`):**
     - The function correctly reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
     - It uses the precomputed results from `func_1` to determine the number of remaining players for each `n` in `qs`.
     - The results are formatted and appended to the `results` list.
     - The function handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles edge cases such as when `n` is less than the smallest value in `p` or when `n` is exactly equal to a value in `p`.
   - The precomputation ensures that all possible values of `n` are handled correctly.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.

Final: **True**
