Output State: **`p` is a list of integers such that 1 <= p[0] < p[1] < ... < p[k-1] <= 100, `max_n` is 100, `remaining_players` is a list where the first element is 3 and the rest are zeros except the third element which is 0, `n` is 3, `cur_n` is `cur_n - count`, `count` is the index of the first element in `p` that is greater than the original `cur_n`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `cur_n` is decremented by `count`.
- All other variables (`p`, `max_n`, `remaining_players`, `n`, and `count`) remain unchanged.
- The new value of `cur_n` is `cur_n - count`, where `count` is the index of the first element in `p` that is greater than the original `cur_n`.
