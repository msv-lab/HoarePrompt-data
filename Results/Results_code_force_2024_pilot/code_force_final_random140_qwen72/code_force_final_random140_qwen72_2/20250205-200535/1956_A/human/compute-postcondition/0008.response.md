The code snippet `results.append(' '.join(map(str, res)))` converts each element in the list `res` to a string, joins these strings with a space, and appends the resulting string to the list `results`.

- `res` is a list containing elements from `remaining_players` at indices specified by `qs`.
- `results` is a list that will store the concatenated string.

Given the initial state:
- `t` must be greater than 0
- `_` is 0
- `k` and `q` are integers provided by the user
- `p` is a list of integers provided by the user
- `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user
- `remaining_players` is the result of `func_1(p)`
- `res` is a list containing elements from `remaining_players` at indices specified by `qs`

After executing the code snippet:
- `results` will contain one additional element, which is a string formed by joining the string representations of the elements in `res` with spaces.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `k` and `q` are integers provided by the user, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user, `remaining_players` is the result of `func_1(p)`, `res` is a list containing elements from `remaining_players` at indices specified by `qs`, `results` contains a new element which is a string formed by joining the string representations of the elements in `res` with spaces.**
