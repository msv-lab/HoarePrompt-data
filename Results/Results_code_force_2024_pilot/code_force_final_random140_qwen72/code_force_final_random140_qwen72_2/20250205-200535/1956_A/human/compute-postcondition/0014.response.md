Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, `k` and `q` are integers provided by the user, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user, `remaining_players` is the result of `func_1(p)`, `res` is a list containing elements from `remaining_players` at indices specified by the original `qs`, `results` contains a new element which is a string formed by joining the string representations of the elements in `res` with spaces.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `res = [remaining_players[n] for n in qs]` updates the value of `res` to be a list of elements from `remaining_players` at the indices specified by `qs`.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `k`, `q`, `p`, `qs`, `remaining_players`, and `results`) remain unchanged.
- The updated `res` is used to form a new element in `results`, which is a string formed by joining the string representations of the elements in `res` with spaces. However, since the code snippet only updates `res`, the actual content of `results` is not directly modified by this snippet.
