Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `_` is 2, `k` and `q` are integers provided by the user, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user, `remaining_players` is the result of `func_1(p)`, `res` is a list containing elements from `remaining_players` at indices specified by the original `qs`, `results` contains a new element which is a string formed by joining the string representations of the elements in `res` with spaces.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet updates the `res` list to contain elements from `remaining_players` at the indices specified by `qs`.
- The `results` list now contains a new element, which is a string formed by joining the string representations of the elements in `res` with spaces.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `k`, `q`, `p`, `qs`, `remaining_players`) remain unchanged and retain their initial values or conditions.
