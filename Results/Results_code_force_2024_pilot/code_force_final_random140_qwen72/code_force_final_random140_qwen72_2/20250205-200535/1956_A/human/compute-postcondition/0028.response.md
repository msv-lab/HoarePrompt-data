The only variables in the loop head are `n` and `max_n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n` being less than or equal to `max_n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is 2 and `max_n` is 100. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be incremented by 1 to 3, and `max_n` must still be greater than or equal to `n`.

State: **`p` is a list of integers such that 1 <= p[0] < p[1] < ... < p[k-1] <= 100, `max_n` is 100, `remaining_players` is a list where the first element is `cur_n` and the rest are zeros except the third element which is 0, `n` is 3, `cur_n` is 0**
