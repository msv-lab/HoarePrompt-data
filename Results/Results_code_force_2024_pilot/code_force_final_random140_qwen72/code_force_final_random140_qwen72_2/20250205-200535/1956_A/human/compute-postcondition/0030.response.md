To determine if the loop can execute at least once, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head: `cur_n >= min(p)`. The variables involved in this condition are `cur_n` and `min(p)`.

Given the state:
- `p` is a list of integers such that 1 <= p[0] < p[1] < ... < p[k-1] <= 100
- `max_n` is 100 (not directly relevant to the loop condition)
- `remaining_players` is a list where the first element is 3 and the rest are zeros except the third element which is 0 (not directly relevant to the loop condition)
- `n` is 3 (not directly relevant to the loop condition)
- `cur_n` is 3

We need to ensure that `cur_n >= min(p)` is true for the loop to execute at least once.

1. **Current Value of `cur_n`:** `cur_n` is 3.
2. **Minimum Value in `p`:** Since `p` is a sorted list of integers starting from 1, the minimum value in `p` (`min(p)`) is 1.

Given that `cur_n` is 3 and `min(p)` is 1, the condition `cur_n >= min(p)` is already satisfied because 3 >= 1.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`p` is a list of integers such that 1 <= p[0] < p[1] < ... < p[k-1] <= 100, `max_n` is 100, `remaining_players` is a list where the first element is 3 and the rest are zeros except the third element which is 0, `n` is 3, `cur_n` is 3**
