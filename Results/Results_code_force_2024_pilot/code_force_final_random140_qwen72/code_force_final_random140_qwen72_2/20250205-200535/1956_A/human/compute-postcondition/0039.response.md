Output State: **`p` is a list of integers such that 1 <= p[0] < p[1] < ... < p[k-1] <= 100, `max_n` is 100, `remaining_players` is a list where the first element is 3 and the rest are zeros except the third element which is 0, `n` is 3, `cur_n` is 0, `count` is the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to the initial value of `cur_n`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop continues to run as long as `cur_n` is greater than or equal to the minimum value in the list `p`.
- In each iteration, `count` is determined by the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `cur_n`.
- `cur_n` is then decremented by `count`.
- After the first iteration, `cur_n` becomes 0 because the initial `cur_n` (which is 3) is reduced by the count of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to 3 (which is 3).
- Since `cur_n` is now 0, it is no longer greater than or equal to the minimum value in `p`, and the loop terminates.
- Therefore, after all iterations, `cur_n` is 0, and `count` is the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to the initial value of `cur_n` (which is 3).
