Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `_` is `t - 1`, `k` and `q` are integers provided by the user, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user, `remaining_players` is the result of `func_1(p)`, `res` is a list containing elements from `remaining_players` at indices specified by `qs`, `results` contains `t` elements, each of which is a string formed by joining the string representations of the elements in `res` with spaces.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` must have been greater than or equal to the total number of iterations.
- The loop counter `_` will be `t - 1` (since it starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration).
- For each iteration, `k` and `q` are integers provided by the user, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, and `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user.
- The `remaining_players` list is the result of calling `func_1(p)` for each iteration.
- The `res` list is created by selecting elements from `remaining_players` at the indices specified by `qs`.
- The `results` list will contain `t` elements, where each element is a string formed by joining the string representations of the elements in `res` with spaces. Each of these strings corresponds to one iteration of the loop.
