Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, `k` and `q` are integers provided by the user, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user, `remaining_players` is the result of `func_1(p)`, `res` is a list containing elements from `remaining_players` at indices specified by the original `qs`, `results` contains a new element which is a string formed by joining the string representations of the elements in `res` with spaces.**

Explanation:
- The code `qs = list(map(int, input().split()))` updates the value of `qs` to a list of integers provided by the user.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `k`, `q`, `p`, `remaining_players`, `res`, `results`) remain unchanged.
- The updated `qs` now holds the new list of integers provided by the user, replacing its previous value.
