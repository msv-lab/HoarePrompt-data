Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes a list `p` of unique integers sorted in ascending order, where each integer is between 1 and 100. It processes each integer from 1 to 100, reducing it based on the values in `p`, and returns a list `remaining_players` where each element at index `n` (from 1 to 100) represents the final value of `cur_n` after processing that iteration. The original list `p` remains unchanged. **
