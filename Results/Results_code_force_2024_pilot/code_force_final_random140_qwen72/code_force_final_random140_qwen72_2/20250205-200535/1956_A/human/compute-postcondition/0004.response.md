The code snippet `p = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into substrings based on whitespace, converts each substring to an integer, and stores the resulting list of integers in the variable `p`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` must be greater than 0
- `_` is 0
- `k` and `q` are integers provided by the user

After executing the code snippet, the variable `p` will contain a list of integers provided by the user. The values of `t`, `_`, `k`, and `q` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `k` and `q` are integers provided by the user, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user.**
