The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `p`, which is a list of integers. The integers in `p` are unique and sorted in ascending order, with values ranging from 1 to 100. The function processes this list and returns a list `remaining_players` where each element at index `n` (from 1 to 100) represents the final value of `cur_n` after processing that iteration.
