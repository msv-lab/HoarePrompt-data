Output State: **`p` is a list of integers such that 1 <= p[0] < p[1] < ... < p[k-1] <= 100, `max_n` is 100, `remaining_players` is a list where the first element is `cur_n` and the rest are zeros except the third element which is 0, `n` is 2, `cur_n` is 0.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `cur_n` (which is 0) to the third element (index 2) of the `remaining_players` list. All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
