Output State: **After all iterations, `p` remains a list of integers such that 1 <= p[0] < p[1] < ... < p[k-1] <= 100, `max_n` is 100, `remaining_players` is a list where each element at index `n` (1 to 100) is the final value of `cur_n` after processing that iteration, and `n` is 100.**

### Explanation:
- **`p`**: The list `p` remains unchanged throughout the loop because it is only used for comparison and does not get modified.
- **`max_n`**: This variable remains 100, as it is only used to define the range of the loop and is not modified within the loop.
- **`remaining_players`**: After the loop completes, the list `remaining_players` will have been updated for each `n` from 1 to 100. Each element at index `n` in `remaining_players` will store the final value of `cur_n` after the corresponding iteration of the loop.
- **`n`**: The loop variable `n` will have reached its maximum value of 100 after all iterations.

The loop iterates through each integer from 1 to 100, and for each `n`, it updates `remaining_players[n]` with the final value of `cur_n` after processing the inner while loop. The inner while loop subtracts the count of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `cur_n` until `cur_n` is less than the minimum value in `p`. This process is repeated for each `n` from 1 to 100.
