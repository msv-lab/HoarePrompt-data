Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `_` is 2, `k` and `q` are integers provided by the user, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user, `remaining_players` is the result of `func_1(p)`, `res` is a list containing elements from `remaining_players` at indices specified by the original `qs`, `results` contains a new element which is a string formed by joining the string representations of the elements in `res` with spaces.**

Explanation:
- The code `remaining_players = func_1(p)` updates the variable `remaining_players` to the result of calling `func_1` with the list `p`.
- The rest of the variables (`t`, `_`, `k`, `q`, `p`, `qs`, `res`, and `results`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The value of `remaining_players` is now the result of `func_1(p)`.
- The list `res` contains elements from `remaining_players` at indices specified by `qs`.
- The list `results` contains a new element, which is a string formed by joining the string representations of the elements in `res` with spaces.
