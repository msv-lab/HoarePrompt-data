Output State: **The program returns a list `results` containing `t` elements, where each element is a string formed by joining the string representations of the elements in `res` with spaces. `res` is a list containing elements from `remaining_players` at indices specified by `qs`. `remaining_players` is the result of `func_1(p)`, and `p` is a list of integers provided by the user. `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user, and `t` is an integer greater than or equal to the number of iterations.**
