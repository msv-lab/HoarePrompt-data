Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `k` and `q` are integers provided by the user, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user, `remaining_players` is the result of `func_1(p)`, `res` is a list containing elements from `remaining_players` at indices specified by `qs`.**

Explanation:
- The code creates a new list `res` by selecting elements from `remaining_players` at the indices specified by the list `qs`.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `k`, `q`, `p`, `qs`, and `remaining_players` remain unchanged.
- The new list `res` contains elements from `remaining_players` at the positions given by the indices in `qs`.
