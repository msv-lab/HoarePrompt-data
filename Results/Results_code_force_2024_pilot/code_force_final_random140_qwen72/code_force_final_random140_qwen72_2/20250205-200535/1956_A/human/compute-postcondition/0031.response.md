The `bisect_right` function from the `bisect` module finds the insertion point for `cur_n` in the sorted list `p` to maintain sorted order. Since `p` is a list of integers in ascending order and `cur_n` is 3, `count` will be the index in `p` where 3 would fit to keep the list sorted. Given that `p` contains integers from 1 to 100 in increasing order, the value of `count` will be the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to 3.

Since `p` is a sorted list and `cur_n` is 3, if 3 is present in `p`, `count` will be the index of the first element in `p` that is greater than 3. If 3 is not in `p`, `count` will be the index where 3 should be inserted to maintain the sorted order.

Given the initial state, the value of `count` will be the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to 3. Since `p` is sorted and contains unique integers from 1 to 100, the value of `count` will be 3 (assuming `p` starts from 1 and includes 2 and 3).

Output State: **`p` is a list of integers such that 1 <= p[0] < p[1] < ... < p[k-1] <= 100, `max_n` is 100, `remaining_players` is a list where the first element is 3 and the rest are zeros except the third element which is 0, `n` is 3, `cur_n` is 3, `count` is 3.**
