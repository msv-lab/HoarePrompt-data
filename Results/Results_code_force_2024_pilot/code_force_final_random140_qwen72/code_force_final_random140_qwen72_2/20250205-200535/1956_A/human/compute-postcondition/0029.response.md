Output State: **`p` is a list of integers such that 1 <= p[0] < p[1] < ... < p[k-1] <= 100, `max_n` is 100, `remaining_players` is a list where the first element is 3 and the rest are zeros except the third element which is 0, `n` is 3, `cur_n` is 3**. 

The value of `cur_n` is updated to 3, which matches the value of `n`. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
