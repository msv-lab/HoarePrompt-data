To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition and the current state:

### Loop Condition:
```python
while cur_n >= min(p):
```
This means the loop will continue as long as `cur_n` is greater than or equal to the minimum value in the list `p`.

### Current State:
- `p` is a list of integers such that \(1 \leq p[0] < p[1] < \ldots < p[k-1] \leq 100\).
- `max_n` is 100.
- `remaining_players` is a list where the first element is 3 and the rest are zeros except the third element which is 0.
- `n` is 3.
- `cur_n` is `cur_n - count`.
- `count` is the index of the first element in `p` that is greater than the original `cur_n`.

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue if `cur_n` is greater than or equal to `min(p)`.
2. **Current Value of `cur_n`**: `cur_n` is `cur_n - count`, where `count` is the index of the first element in `p` that is greater than the original `cur_n`.
3. **Minimum Value in `p`**: Since `p` is a sorted list of integers starting from 1, `min(p)` is always 1.

### Adjustments Needed:
- For the loop to execute one more time, `cur_n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- Given that `cur_n` is `cur_n - count`, we need to ensure that the new `cur_n` is still greater than or equal to 1.

### Conclusion:
- The only state that needs to be adjusted is `cur_n`.
- `cur_n` must be greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute one more time.

### Final State:
State: **`p` is a list of integers such that 1 <= p[0] < p[1] < ... < p[k-1] <= 100, `max_n` is 100, `remaining_players` is a list where the first element is 3 and the rest are zeros except the third element which is 0, `n` is 3, `cur_n` is greater than or equal to 1, `count` is the index of the first element in `p` that is greater than the original `cur_n`.**
