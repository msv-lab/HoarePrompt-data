You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 250. k and q are positive integers representing the length of the sequence `a` and the number of values `n_i` to solve for, respectively, where 1 ≤ k, q ≤ 100. p is a list of k integers in strictly increasing order, where 1 ≤ p[0] < p[1] < ... < p[k-1] ≤ 100. qs is a list of q integers, where 1 ≤ qs[i] ≤ 100 for all 0 ≤ i < q.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        k, q = map(int, input().split())
        
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        qs = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        remaining_players = func_1(p)
        
        res = [remaining_players[n] for n in qs]
        
        results.append(' '.join(map(str, res)))
        
    #State: `t` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `_` is `t - 1`, `k` and `q` are integers provided by the user, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user, `remaining_players` is the result of `func_1(p)`, `res` is a list containing elements from `remaining_players` at indices specified by `qs`, `results` contains `t` elements, each of which is a string formed by joining the string representations of the elements in `res` with spaces.
    return results
    #The program returns a list `results` containing `t` elements, where each element is a string formed by joining the string representations of the elements in `res` with spaces. `res` is a list containing elements from `remaining_players` at indices specified by `qs`. `remaining_players` is the result of `func_1(p)`, and `p` is a list of integers provided by the user. `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user, and `t` is an integer greater than or equal to the number of iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_2` accepts no parameters directly but operates under the constraints provided by external inputs `t`, `k`, `q`, `p`, and `qs`. It returns a list `results` containing `t` elements, each a string formed by concatenating the string representations of elements from `remaining_players` at indices specified by `qs`, separated by spaces. `remaining_players` is derived from the list `p` through a process defined by `func_1`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list `results` containing `t` elements, where each element is a string formed by joining the string representations of the elements in `res` with spaces. `res` is a list containing elements from `remaining_players` at indices specified by `qs`. `remaining_players` is the result of `func_1(p)`, and `p` is a list of integers provided by the user. `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user, and `t` is an integer greater than or equal to the number of iterations.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
