The code snippet `g, h = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns these integers to the variables `g` and `h`.

- `g` and `h` are now assigned the values from the input.
- The values of `t`, `steps`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, and `f` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive, `steps` is 0, `a` and `b` are input integers, `c` and `d` are input integers, `e` and `f` are input integers, `g` and `h` are input integers.**
