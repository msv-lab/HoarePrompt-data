Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive, `steps` is 0, `a` and `b` are input integers, `c` and `d` are input integers, `e` and `f` are input integers, `g` and `h` are input integers, `n` is `(a - c) * (a - c) + (b - d) * (b - d)`**. 

This means that the value of `n` is calculated as the sum of the squares of the differences between `a` and `c`, and `b` and `d`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
