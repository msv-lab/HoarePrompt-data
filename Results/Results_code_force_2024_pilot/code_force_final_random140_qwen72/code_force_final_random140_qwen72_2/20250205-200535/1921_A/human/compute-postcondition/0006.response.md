The code snippet `g, h = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, and assigns the integer values of these parts to the variables `g` and `h`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive, `steps` is 0, `a` and `b` are input integers, `c` and `d` are input integers, `e` and `f` are input integers, `g` and `h` are input integers.**
