The only variables in the loop head are `steps` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` being an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive, ensures that the loop will execute at least once. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t`, but we should initialize `steps` to 0 for the loop to start correctly.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive, `steps` is 0**
