The function `func` does not accept any direct parameters. However, it operates under the assumption that the input is provided in a specific format. The input consists of multiple test cases, where the first line contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), indicating the number of test cases. Each test case is described by four lines, each containing two integers `x_i`, `y_i` (-1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000), representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. It is guaranteed that the points form a valid square with a positive area.

The function processes these test cases and returns the area of each square for each test case.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each representing a square defined by its corner coordinates. It returns the area of each square for each test case.**
