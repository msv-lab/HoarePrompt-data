Precondition: **The function receives no direct parameters but operates under the assumption that the input is provided in a specific format. The input consists of multiple test cases, where the first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), indicating the number of test cases. Each test case is described by four lines, each containing two integers x_i, y_i (-1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000), representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. It is guaranteed that the points form a valid square with a positive area.**
