The function reads multiple test cases from the standard input, where each test case consists of four pairs of integers representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. For each test case, it calculates the squared distances between two pairs of these coordinates and prints the smaller of the two squared distances. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results to the standard output. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without modifying any external state beyond the printed output.
