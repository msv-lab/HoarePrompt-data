Reasoning:  
The program aims to calculate the area of a square given the coordinates of its corners. However, the approach used in the program is flawed. The program calculates the squared distances between two pairs of coordinates and prints the smaller of the two squared distances. This method does not guarantee that the calculated distance corresponds to the side length of the square, especially since the coordinates are given in a random order.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to identify the side length of the square. Since the square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, the side length can be determined by finding the difference in the x-coordinates or y-coordinates of any two adjacent corners.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        points = []
        for _ in range(4):
            x, y = map(int, input().split())
            points.append((x, y))
        
        # Sort points to find the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates
        points.sort()
        
        # Calculate the side length of the square
        side_length = points[1][0] - points[0][0]
        
        # Calculate the area of the square
        area = side_length * side_length
        
        print(area)

func()
```

Explanation:
1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases and then reads the coordinates of the four corners for each test case.
2. **Sorting Points**: The points are sorted to ensure that the first two points have the smallest x-coordinates, which helps in identifying the side length.
3. **Calculating Side Length**: The side length is calculated as the difference between the x-coordinates of the first two points.
4. **Calculating Area**: The area of the square is the square of the side length.
5. **Printing Result**: The area is printed for each test case.

Given the original program's approach, it does not correctly identify the side length of the square, leading to incorrect results.

Correctness: **False**
