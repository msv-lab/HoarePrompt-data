Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the area of the square. The logic used to determine the side length of the square is flawed. Specifically, the program calculates the squared distances between two pairs of points and then selects the smaller of these two values as the side length of the square. This approach will not always yield the correct side length of the square, especially when the points are not adjacent corners.

To correctly solve this problem, you should:

1. Identify the unique x-coordinates and y-coordinates from the four given points.
2. Calculate the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (or y-coordinates), which will give you the side length of the square.
3. Compute the area by squaring the side length.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        points = []
        for _ in range(4):
            x, y = map(int, input().split())
            points.append((x, y))
        
        # Extract unique x and y coordinates
        x_coords = sorted(set(point[0] for point in points))
        y_coords = sorted(set(point[1] for point in points))
        
        # Calculate the side length of the square
        side_length = max(x_coords[1] - x_coords[0], y_coords[1] - y_coords[0])
        
        # Calculate the area
        area = side_length ** 2
        print(area)

# Example usage
func()
```

This corrected program will correctly compute the area of the square for the given test cases.
