Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to find the area of a square given the coordinates of its four corners. The sides of the square are parallel to the coordinate axes, and the coordinates are provided in random order.

2. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading four pairs of coordinates.

3. **Distance Calculation**: The program calculates the squared distances between the first point `(a, b)` and the other three points `(c, d)`, `(e, f)`, and `(g, h)`. It stores these distances in variables `n` and `x`.

4. **Logic for Finding the Side Length**: The program assumes that the smallest distance between any two points will be the side length of the square. This is because the sides of the square are parallel to the coordinate axes, and the smallest distance between any two points will be the side length.

5. **Area Calculation**: The program prints the smaller of the two calculated distances, which should be the side length squared (i.e., the area of the square).

6. **Potential Issues**:
   - The program only considers the distances between the first point and the other three points. This might not always correctly identify the side length of the square.
   - The program does not handle the case where the smallest distance might be zero (which should not happen given the problem constraints but is worth considering for robustness).
   - The program does not check if the calculated distances are indeed the side lengths of the square.

7. **Correct Approach**:
   - To correctly identify the side length, we should calculate the distances between all pairs of points and ensure that the smallest non-zero distance is the side length.
   - Alternatively, we can sort the points and directly compute the differences in the x and y coordinates to find the side length.

Given the current implementation, it is not guaranteed to always find the correct side length of the square, especially if the points are not in a specific order.

Correctness: **False**
