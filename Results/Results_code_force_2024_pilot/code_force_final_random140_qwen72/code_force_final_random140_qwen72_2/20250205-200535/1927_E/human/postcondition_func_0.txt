The function `func_1` reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, where `2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `k` is even. It generates a permutation of length `n` such that for each index `i` from 0 to `k-1`, the elements at positions `i + j*k` (for `j` from 0 to `n-1`) are filled with increasing values starting from 1 if `i` is even, and decreasing values starting from `n` if `i` is odd. The function then prints the generated permutation as a space-separated string. After the function concludes, the input integers `n` and `k` remain unchanged, and the permutation is printed to the console.
