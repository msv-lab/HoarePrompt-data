### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Input Handling**: The function reads `n` and `k` from the input, which is appropriate for the problem description.
   - **Initialization**: It initializes a permutation array of length `n` with zeros.
   - **Filling the Permutation**:
     - The function uses two pointers, `bottom_v` and `top_v`, to fill the permutation array.
     - It iterates over the indices from 0 to `k-1` and fills the permutation array in a specific pattern:
       - For even indices, it fills the array with increasing values starting from 1.
       - For odd indices, it fills the array with decreasing values starting from `n`.
   - **Pattern Explanation**:
     - By filling the permutation in this alternating pattern, the function ensures that the sums of continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1. This is because the pattern balances the distribution of high and low values across the segments.
   - **Output**: The function prints the permutation as a space-separated string.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Input Handling**: The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - **Test Case Processing**: It calls `func_1` for each test case, ensuring that the permutation is generated for each set of `n` and `k`.
   - **Loop Termination**: The loop continues until `t` becomes 0, which is correct as it processes all test cases.

### Evaluation:

- **Correctness**:
  - The function `func_1` correctly generates a k-level permutation by ensuring that the sums of continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1.
  - The function `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each test case.
  - The program handles the constraints and requirements specified in the problem description.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly generates a k-level permutation for the given inputs and meets all the requirements of the problem description.

Final: **True**
