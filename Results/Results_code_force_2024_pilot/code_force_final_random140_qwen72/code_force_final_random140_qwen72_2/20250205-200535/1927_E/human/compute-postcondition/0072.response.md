Output State: **`idx` is 2, `k` is greater than 2, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `2 + k`, `len(permutation)` is greater than or equal to `1 + n*k`, `permutation[2 + k]` is `bottom_v`, `bottom_v` is incremented by 1, `permutation[2]` is `bottom_v - 1`.** 

Explanation:
- The value of `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is set to `bottom_v`.
- Since `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `2 + k`, `permutation[2 + k]` is now `bottom_v`.
- According to the initial state, since `idx` is 2 (which is even), `permutation[2]` was initially set to `bottom_v`, and `bottom_v` was incremented by 1.
- Therefore, `permutation[2]` remains `bottom_v - 1` after the increment.
- All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
