Output State: **`idx` is 2, `k` is greater than 2, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is 2, `len(permutation)` is greater than or equal to `1 + n*k`. The elements in `permutation` at positions `1 + i*k` (for `i` from 0 to `n-1`) are set to either `bottom_v + i` if `idx % 2 == 0` or `top_v - i` if `idx % 2 != 0`.**

Explanation: The variable `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` was originally defined as `1 + n*k`, but the code snippet sets it to the value of `idx`, which is 2. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
