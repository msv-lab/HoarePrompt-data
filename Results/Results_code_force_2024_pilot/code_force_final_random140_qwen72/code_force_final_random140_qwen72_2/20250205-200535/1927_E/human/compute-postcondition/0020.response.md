Output State: **If `idx` is even: `permutation[0]` is 1, `permutation[k]` is `n`, `bottom_v` is 2, `top_v` is `n - 1`, `idx` is 0, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `k`. If `idx` is odd: `permutation[0]` is `n`, `permutation[k]` is `n - 1`, `bottom_v` is 1, `top_v` is `n - 2`, `idx` is 0, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `k`.** 

Explanation: The value of `top_v` is decremented by 1. If `idx` is even, `top_v` was initially `n` and is now `n - 1`. If `idx` is odd, `top_v` was initially `n - 1` and is now `n - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
