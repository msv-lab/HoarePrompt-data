Postcondition: ***`idx` is 2, `k` is greater than 2, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `2 + k`, `len(permutation)` is greater than or equal to `1 + n*k`. If `idx` is even, `permutation[2 + k]` is `bottom_v`, `bottom_v` is incremented by 2, and `permutation[2]` is `bottom_v - 2`. If `idx` is not divisible by 2, `permutation[2 + k]` is `top_v`, `top_v` is decreased by 1, `bottom_v` remains unchanged, and `permutation[2]` is `bottom_v`.***
