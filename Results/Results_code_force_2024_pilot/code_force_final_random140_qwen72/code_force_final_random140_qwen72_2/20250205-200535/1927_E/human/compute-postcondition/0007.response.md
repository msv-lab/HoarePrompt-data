The variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 2 (inclusive). For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 - 2 (inclusive), and `func_1` has been called**
