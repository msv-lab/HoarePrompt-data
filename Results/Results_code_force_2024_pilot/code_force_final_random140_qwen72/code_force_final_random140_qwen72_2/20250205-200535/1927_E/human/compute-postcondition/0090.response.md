The function `func_1` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided code snippet. However, based on the given parameter constraints, it is implied that the function should accept two parameters, `n` and `k`, where both are integers, and they satisfy the conditions 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5, with `k` being an even number. Since the output is not specified, I cannot determine the exact return value without additional information. However, I can describe the expected parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and `k` is even. The specific return value is not provided in the given information.**
