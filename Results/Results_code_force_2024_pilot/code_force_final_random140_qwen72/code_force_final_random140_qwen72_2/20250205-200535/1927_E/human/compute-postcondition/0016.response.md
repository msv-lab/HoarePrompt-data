To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition and the relevant variables:

### Loop Condition
The loop condition is:
```python
while multiples_of_k_plus_idx < len(permutation):
```

### Relevant Variables
- `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`: This variable is used in the loop condition.
- `len(permutation)`: The length of the `permutation` list, which is `n`.

### Current State
- `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even.
- `permutation` is a list of length `n` initialized with zeros.
- If `idx` is even:
  - `permutation[0]` is set to 1.
  - `bottom_v` is 2.
  - `top_v` is `n`.
  - `idx` is 0.
  - `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `k`.
- If `idx` is odd:
  - `permutation[0]` is set to `n`.
  - `bottom_v` is 1.
  - `top_v` is `n - 1`.
  - `idx` is 0.
  - `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `k`.

### Analysis
For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `multiples_of_k_plus_idx < len(permutation)` must be true. Given that `len(permutation)` is `n`, the condition simplifies to:
```python
multiples_of_k_plus_idx < n
```

### Adjusting the State
- The current value of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `k`.
- To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` must be less than `n`.

Since `k` is even and `2 <= k <= n`, the condition `k < n` is already satisfied. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

### Final State
The state remains unchanged because the condition `multiples_of_k_plus_idx < n` is already satisfied.

State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even, `permutation` is a list of length `n` initialized with zeros. If `idx` is even, `permutation[0]` is set to 1, `bottom_v` is 2, `top_v` is `n`, `idx` is 0, and `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `k`. If `idx` is odd, `permutation[0]` is set to `n`, `bottom_v` is 1, `top_v` is `n - 1`, `idx` is 0, and `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `k`.**
