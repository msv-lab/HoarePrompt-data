To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition and the current state:

- The loop condition is `idx < k`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `idx` is 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `idx` must still be less than `k`. Since `idx` is currently 1, the loop will execute again as long as `k` is greater than 1. Therefore, no adjustment is needed to `idx` or `k` for the loop to proceed.

State: **`idx` is 1, `k` is greater than 1**
