Output State: **No variables are passed to the function `func_2`. The function reads an integer `t` from standard input, and `t` is now an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). The function `func_1` has been called, but its internal operations and any changes it might make to the environment or variables are not specified, so no further changes to the state can be determined.**
