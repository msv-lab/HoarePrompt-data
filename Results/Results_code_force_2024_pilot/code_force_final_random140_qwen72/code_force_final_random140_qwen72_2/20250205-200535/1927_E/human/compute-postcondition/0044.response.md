The code snippet assigns the value of `bottom_v` to the element in the list `permutation` at the index `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`. Given that `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `1 + k`, the element at the index `1 + k` in the list `permutation` is updated to `bottom_v`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`idx` is 1, `k` is greater than 1, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `1 + k`, `len(permutation)` is greater than `1 + k`, and `permutation[1 + k]` is `bottom_v`.**
