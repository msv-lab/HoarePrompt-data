Output State: **`idx` is 1, `k` is greater than 1, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `1 + n*k` where `n` is the number of iterations, and `len(permutation)` is greater than or equal to `1 + n*k`. The elements in `permutation` at positions `1 + i*k` (for `i` from 0 to `n-1`) are set to either `bottom_v + i` if `idx % 2 == 0` or `top_v - i` if `idx % 2 != 0`.** 

This means that after all iterations of the loop, the variable `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` will be `1 + n*k`, where `n` is the total number of iterations the loop has executed. The length of the `permutation` list must be at least `1 + n*k` to ensure the loop could run `n` times without an index out of range error. The elements in the `permutation` list at positions `1 + i*k` (where `i` ranges from 0 to `n-1`) will be set to either `bottom_v + i` if `idx` is even, or `top_v - i` if `idx` is odd, depending on the value of `idx` at the start of each iteration.
