To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `idx` is `k`.
   - `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `k-1 + n*k`.
   - `len(permutation)` is greater than or equal to `k-1 + n*k`.
   - The elements in `permutation` at positions `i + j*k` (for `i` from 0 to `k-1` and `j` from 0 to `n-1`) are set to either `bottom_v + j` if `i % 2 == 0` or `top_v - j` if `i % 2 != 0`.
   - `bottom_v` is `1 + n*(k//2)`.
   - `top_v` is `n - n*(k//2)`.
   - `result` is a string containing the elements of `permutation` separated by spaces.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `bottom_v` is calculated as `1 + n*(k//2)`.
   - `top_v` is calculated as `n - n*(k//2)`.

3. **Filling the Permutation List:**
   - For each `i` from 0 to `k-1` and `j` from 0 to `n-1`, the element at position `i + j*k` in `permutation` is set as follows:
     - If `i % 2 == 0`, the element is `bottom_v + j`.
     - If `i % 2 != 0`, the element is `top_v - j`.

4. **Constructing the Result String:**
   - `result` is a string containing the elements of `permutation` separated by spaces.

Let's construct the `permutation` list step by step:

- For `i = 0` (even):
  - Elements at positions `0, k, 2k, ..., (n-1)*k` are `bottom_v + j`.
- For `i = 1` (odd):
  - Elements at positions `1, k+1, 2k+1, ..., (n-1)*k+1` are `top_v - j`.
- For `i = 2` (even):
  - Elements at positions `2, k+2, 2k+2, ..., (n-1)*k+2` are `bottom_v + j`.
- For `i = 3` (odd):
  - Elements at positions `3, k+3, 2k+3, ..., (n-1)*k+3` are `top_v - j`.
- And so on...

Given the pattern, the `permutation` list will look like this:
- Even indices: `bottom_v + j`
- Odd indices: `top_v - j`

Finally, the `result` string will be a space-separated string of these elements.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume `k = 3` and `n = 4`:
- `bottom_v = 1 + 4 * (3 // 2) = 1 + 4 * 1 = 5`
- `top_v = 4 - 4 * (3 // 2) = 4 - 4 * 1 = 0`

The `permutation` list will be:
- `i = 0`: `5, 6, 7, 8`
- `i = 1`: `0, -1, -2, -3`
- `i = 2`: `5, 6, 7, 8`

So, the `permutation` list will be: `[5, 0, 5, 6, -1, 6, 7, -2, 7, 8, -3, 8]`.

The `result` string will be: `"5 0 5 6 -1 6 7 -2 7 8 -3 8"`.

### Final Output:
Output: **"5 0 5 6 -1 6 7 -2 7 8 -3 8" (where the elements are determined by the given conditions and the values of `bottom_v` and `top_v`)**
