To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the given program state and the `while` loop condition:

### Program State:
- `idx` is 1
- `k` is greater than 1
- `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is 1

### Loop Condition:
```
while multiples_of_k_plus_idx < len(permutation):
```

### Analysis:
- The loop will execute if `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is less than the length of `permutation`.
- Currently, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is 1.
- For the loop to execute, `len(permutation)` must be greater than 1.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`.
- Since `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is 1, the loop will execute if `len(permutation)` is greater than 1.
- Therefore, no adjustment to `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is necessary, but we need to ensure that `len(permutation)` is greater than 1.

### Final State:
State: **`idx` is 1, `k` is greater than 1, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is 1, and `len(permutation)` must be greater than 1**
