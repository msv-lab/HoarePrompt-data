The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). Since `t` is already within a range that ensures the loop will execute at least once, no adjustments are necessary.

State: **No variables are passed to the function `func_2`. The function reads an integer `t` from standard input, and `t` is now an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive)**
