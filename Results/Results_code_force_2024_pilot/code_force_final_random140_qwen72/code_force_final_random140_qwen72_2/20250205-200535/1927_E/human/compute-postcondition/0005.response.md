Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 - 1 (inclusive), and `func_1` has been called.** 

Since the code snippet only calls `func_1()`, and there is no information about what `func_1` does or what it returns, the initial state remains unchanged. The function `func_1` has been called, but without further details, we cannot determine any changes to the state. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.
