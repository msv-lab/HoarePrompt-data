Output State: **`idx` is 1, `k` is greater than 1, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is 1, `len(permutation)` is greater than 1, `idx` is even, `permutation[1]` is `bottom_v + 1`, `bottom_v` is `bottom_v + 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `bottom_v` is incremented by 1. Since `permutation[1]` was initially equal to `bottom_v`, after the increment, `permutation[1]` is now equal to `bottom_v + 1`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
