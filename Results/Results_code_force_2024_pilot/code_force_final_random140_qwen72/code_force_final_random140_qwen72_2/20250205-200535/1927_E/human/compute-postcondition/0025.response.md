Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even, `permutation` is a list of length `n` initialized with zeros, `permutation[0]` is 1, `permutation[k]` is `n`, `permutation[2 * k]` is 2, `bottom_v` is 3, `top_v` is `n - 1`, `idx` is 0, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `2 * k`.**

Explanation: The value of `bottom_v` is incremented by 1, changing from 2 to 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
