Output State: **`idx` is 3, `k` is still greater than 2, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `2 + n*k`, and `len(permutation)` is greater than or equal to `1 + n*k`. If `idx` is not divisible by 2, `permutation[2 + i*k]` for `i` from 0 to `n-1` are set to `top_v - i`, and `top_v` is decremented by `n`.**

Explanation:
- `idx` was initially 2 and is incremented by 1, making it 3.
- `k` remains greater than 2.
- `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` remains `2 + n*k`.
- `len(permutation)` remains greater than or equal to `1 + n*k`.
- Since `idx` is now 3 (which is not divisible by 2), the condition for setting `permutation[2 + i*k]` for `i` from 0 to `n-1` to `top_v - i` and decrementing `top_v` by `n` is still valid.
