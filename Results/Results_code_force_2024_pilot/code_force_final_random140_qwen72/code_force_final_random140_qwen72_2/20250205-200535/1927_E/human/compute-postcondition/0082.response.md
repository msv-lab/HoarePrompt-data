Output State: **`idx` is 2, `k` is greater than 2, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `2 + 2*k`, `len(permutation)` is greater than `2 + 2*k`, `permutation[2 + 2*k]` is `top_v - 1`, `top_v` is decreased by 1, `bottom_v` remains unchanged, `permutation[2 + k]` is `bottom_v`, `permutation[2]` is `bottom_v`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `top_v` is decreased by 1.
- All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged from the initial state.
