You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y of the same length, consisting of digits
from 1 to 9 .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
swap the i -th digit in x and the i -th digit in y .

For example, if x=73 and y=31 , you can swap the 2 -nd digits and get x=71 and
y=33 .

Your task is to maximize the product of x and y using the aforementioned
operation any number of times. If there are multiple answers, print any of
them.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer x (1 \le x <
10^{100} ).

The second line of each test case contains a single integer y (1 \le y <
10^{100} ).

Additional constraint on input: the integers x and y consist only of digits
from 1 to 9 .

Output

For each test case, print two lines — the first line should contain the number
x after performing the operations; similarly, the second line should contain
the number y after performing the operations. If there are multiple answers,
print any of them.

    #State: `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `q` is `t-1`, `a` is a non-empty input string, `b` is a new input string, `i` is the length of `a` (or `b`). `kq1` and `kq2` are strings constructed based on the comparison of corresponding characters in `a` and `b`. For each pair of characters at the same position in `a` and `b`: if they are equal, both `kq1` and `kq2` are appended with that character. If they are not equal, the smaller character is appended to `kq1` and the larger character is appended to `kq2` when `vt` is 0; otherwise, the larger character is appended to `kq1` and the smaller character is appended to `kq2`. `vt` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the characters were different at any point during the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where the lengths of `a` and `b` are different. According to the problem description, the integers `x` and `y` are guaranteed to be of the same length, but the program does not explicitly check this condition. However, the logic of the program assumes that `a` and `b` are of the same length, which is a valid assumption based on the problem constraints. 

However, the main issue is in the logic used to maximize the product of `x` and `y`. The current logic swaps the digits in such a way that it alternates between placing the smaller digit in `kq1` and the larger digit in `kq2`, and vice versa. This approach does not necessarily maximize the product of `x` and `y`.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
3516
3982
```
The expected output should be:
```
3912
3586
```
However, the program will produce:
```
3512
3986
```
This output does not maximize the product of `x` and `y`.

To maximize the product, the program should aim to place the largest possible digits in the most significant positions of both numbers. The current logic does not achieve this goal consistently.
