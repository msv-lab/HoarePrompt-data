Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `q` is 0, `a` is an input string with at least 2 characters, `b` is an input string, `i` is 2. If the third characters of `a` and `b` are equal, `kq1` is updated to its previous value plus the third character of `a`, and `kq2` is also updated to its previous value plus the third character of `a`. If the third characters of `a` and `b` are not equal, `x` is the minimum of the integer values of the characters at index 2 of `a` and `b`, and `y` is the maximum of these values. If `vt` is 0, `kq1` is updated to its previous value plus the string representation of `x`, and `kq2` is updated to its previous value plus the string representation of `y`, and `vt` is set to 1. If `vt` is not 0, `kq1` is updated to its previous value plus the string representation of `y`, and `kq2` is updated to its previous value plus the string representation of `x`, and `vt` remains non-zero.***
