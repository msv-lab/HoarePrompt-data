Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `q` is 2, `a` is a new input string, `b` is a new input string, `i` is the length of `a` (or `b`), `kq1` is an empty string, `kq2` is an empty string, `vt` is 1 if there was at least one mismatch between the characters of `a` and `b`, otherwise it remains 0.**

Explanation:
- The line `kq2 = ''` reassigns `kq2` to an empty string, overriding its previous value.
- All other variables (`t`, `q`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `kq1`, and `vt`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
