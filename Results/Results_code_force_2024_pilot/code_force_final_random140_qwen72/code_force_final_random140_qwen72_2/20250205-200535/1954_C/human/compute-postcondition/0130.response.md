Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `q` is 2, `a` is a non-empty input string with at least 2 characters, `b` is a new input string, `i` is 1, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[1])` and `int(b[1])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[1])` and `int(b[1])`, `kq1` is the concatenation of its previous value and the string representation of `y`, `kq2` is the same as its previous value, `vt` is 1 if the first characters of `a` and `b` are different, otherwise `vt` remains 0.**
