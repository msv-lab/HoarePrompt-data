Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `q` is 1, `a` is an input string with at least 3 characters, `b` is a new input string, `i` is 2, `x` is the smaller of the integer values of the second characters of `a` and `b`, `y` is the larger of the integer values of the second characters of `a` and `b`. If `vt` is 0, `vt` is updated to 1, `kq1` is the string representation of `x`, and `kq2` is the concatenation of the previous value of `kq2` and the string representation of `y`. Otherwise, `vt` remains 0, `kq1` is the string representation of `y`, and `kq2` is the string representation of `x`.***
