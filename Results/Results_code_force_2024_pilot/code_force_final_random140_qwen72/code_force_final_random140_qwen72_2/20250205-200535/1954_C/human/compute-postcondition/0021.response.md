Postcondition: ***`t` must be greater than 0, `q` is 0, `a` is an input string that must have at least 1 character, `b` is an input string, `i` is 0, `x` is the minimum of the integer values of the first characters of `a` and `b`, `y` is the maximum of the integer values of the first characters of `a` and `b`. If `vt` is 0, `kq1` is the string representation of `x`, `kq2` is the string representation of `y`, and `vt` is set to 1. Otherwise, `kq1` is the string representation of `y`, `kq2` is the string representation of `x`, and `vt` is not 0.***
