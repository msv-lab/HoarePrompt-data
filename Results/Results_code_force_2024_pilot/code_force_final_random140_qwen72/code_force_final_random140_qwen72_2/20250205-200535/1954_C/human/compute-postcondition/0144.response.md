Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 2, `q` is 2, `a` is a non-empty input string with at least 2 characters, `b` is a new input string, `i` is 2, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`. If the first characters of `a` and `b` are equal, `kq1` and `kq2` are both set to the first character of `a`. If `vt` is 0, `kq1` is set to the string representation of `x` repeated twice, `kq2` is set to the string representation of `y` repeated twice, and `vt` is updated to 1. If `vt` is not 0, `kq1` is the concatenation of its previous value and the string representation of `y`, and `kq2` is the concatenation of its previous value and the string representation of `x`, and `vt` is 1. If the first characters of `a` and `b` are different, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[0])` and `int(b[0])`, and `y` is the maximum of `int(a[0])` and `int(b[0])`. If `vt` is 0, `kq1` is set to the string representation of `x` repeated twice, `kq2` is set to the string representation of `y` repeated twice, and `vt` is updated to 1. If `vt` is not 0, `kq1` is the concatenation of its previous value and the string representation of `y`, and `kq2` is the concatenation of its previous value and the string representation of `x`, and `vt` is 1.***
