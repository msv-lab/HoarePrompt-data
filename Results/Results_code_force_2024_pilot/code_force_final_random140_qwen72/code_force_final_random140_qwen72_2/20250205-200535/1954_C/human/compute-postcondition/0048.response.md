To determine what will be printed by the `print(kq1)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `q` is 0.
- `a` is an input string.
- `b` is an input string.
- `i` is the length of `a` (or `b`), meaning both strings `a` and `b` have the same length.
- `kq1` and `kq2` are strings formed based on rules applied in the loop.
- `vt` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the characters in `a` and `b` were different at any point during the loop.

### Loop Logic:
The loop likely iterates over the characters of the strings `a` and `b` and forms the strings `kq1` and `kq2` based on some conditions. The variable `vt` is set to 1 if any characters in `a` and `b` differ, otherwise it remains 0.

### Determining `kq1`:
- Since the exact rules for forming `kq1` and `kq2` are not provided, we need to infer the most likely behavior.
- Typically, `kq1` and `kq2` might be formed by comparing corresponding characters in `a` and `b` and appending some result to these strings.

### Possible Scenarios:
1. **If `a` and `b` are identical:**
   - `kq1` and `kq2` might be empty strings or contain some default value.
   - `vt` would be 0 because no characters differ.

2. **If `a` and `b` differ at any position:**
   - `kq1` and `kq2` might contain some representation of the differences.
   - `vt` would be 1.

### Conclusion:
Without the exact rules for forming `kq1`, we can only describe the output in general terms based on the given information.

### Output:
The `print(kq1)` statement will print the string `kq1`, which is formed based on the rules applied in the loop. If `a` and `b` are identical, `kq1` might be an empty string or some default value. If `a` and `b` differ at any position, `kq1` will contain some representation of the differences.

Output: **kq1 (where kq1 is a string formed based on the rules applied in the loop, possibly representing differences between the strings a and b)**
