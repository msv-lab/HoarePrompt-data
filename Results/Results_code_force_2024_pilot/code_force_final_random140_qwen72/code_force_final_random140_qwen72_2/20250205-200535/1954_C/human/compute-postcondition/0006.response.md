Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `q` is 0, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, `kq1` is an empty string, `kq2` is an empty string, `vt` is 0.** 

The variable `vt` is initialized to 0, and no other variables are affected. Therefore, the initial conditions for `t`, `q`, `a`, `b`, `kq1`, and `kq2` remain unchanged.
