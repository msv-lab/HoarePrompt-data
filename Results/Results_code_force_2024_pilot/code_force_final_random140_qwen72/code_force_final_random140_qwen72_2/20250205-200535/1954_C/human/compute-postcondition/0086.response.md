Output State: **If the second characters of `a` and `b` are equal: `t` is greater than 0, `q` is 1, `a` is an input string with at least 3 characters, `b` is a new input string, `i` is 2, `kq1` is the string representation of the first character of `a` concatenated with the second character of `a`, followed by the third character of `a`, `kq2` is the string representation of the first character of `a` followed by the second character of `a`, followed by the third character of `a`, `vt` is 0. If the second characters of `a` and `b` are not equal: `t` is greater than 0, `q` is 1, `a` is an input string with at least 3 characters, `b` is a new input string, `i` is 2, `x` is the smaller of the integer values of the second characters of `a` and `b`, `y` is the larger of the integer values of the second characters of `a` and `b`, `vt` is 1, `kq1` is the string representation of `y` followed by the string representation of `x`, followed by the third character of `a`, `kq2` is the string representation of `x` followed by the string representation of `y`, followed by the third character of `a`.**
