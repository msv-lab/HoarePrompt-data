Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `q` is 2, `a` is a new input string, `b` is a new input string, `i` is the length of `a` (or `b`), `kq1` is an empty string, `kq2` is a string where each character is either the corresponding character from `a` if it matches the corresponding character from `b`, or the larger of the two characters (as integers) if they do not match, with the order of alternation based on the value of `vt`. `vt` is 1 if there was at least one mismatch between the characters of `a` and `b`, otherwise it remains 0.**
