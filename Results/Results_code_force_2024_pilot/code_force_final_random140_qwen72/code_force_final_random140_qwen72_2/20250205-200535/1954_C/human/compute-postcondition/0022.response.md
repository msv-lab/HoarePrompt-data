Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `q` is 0, `a` is an input string with at least 1 character, `b` is an input string, `i` is 0. If the first characters of `a` and `b` are equal, `kq1` and `kq2` are both set to the first character of `a`, and `vt` remains 0. Otherwise, `x` is the minimum of the integer values of the first characters of `a` and `b`, `y` is the maximum of these values. If `vt` is 0, `kq1` is the string representation of `x`, `kq2` is the string representation of `y`, and `vt` is set to 1. If `vt` is not 0, `kq1` is the string representation of `y`, `kq2` is the string representation of `x`, and `vt` remains non-zero.***
