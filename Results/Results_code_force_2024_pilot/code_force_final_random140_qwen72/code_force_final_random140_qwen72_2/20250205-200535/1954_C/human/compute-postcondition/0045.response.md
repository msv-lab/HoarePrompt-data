Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `q` is 0, `a` is an input string with at least 2 characters, `b` is an input string, `i` is 2, `x` is the minimum of the integer values of the characters at index 2 of `a` and `b`, `y` is the maximum of the integer values of the characters at index 2 of `a` and `b`. If `vt` is 0, `kq1` is the original value of `kq1` concatenated with the string representation of `x`, `kq2` is the original value of `kq2` concatenated with the string representation of `y`, and `vt` is set to 1. If `vt` is not 0, `kq1` is the concatenation of its previous value and the string representation of `y`, `kq2` is the concatenation of its previous value and the string representation of `x`, and `vt` remains non-zero.***
