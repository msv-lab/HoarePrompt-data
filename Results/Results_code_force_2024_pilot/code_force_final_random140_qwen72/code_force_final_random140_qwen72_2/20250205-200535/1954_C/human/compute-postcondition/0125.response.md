Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `q` is 2, `a` is a non-empty input string with at least 2 characters, `b` is a new input string, `i` is 1, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[1])` and `int(b[1])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[1])` and `int(b[1])`. If the first character of `a` is equal to the first character of `b`, then `kq1` and `kq2` are both set to the first character of `a`, and `vt` remains 0. If the first character of `a` is not equal to the first character of `b`, then `x` is the minimum of `int(a[0])` and `int(b[0])`, and `y` is the maximum of `int(a[0])` and `int(b[0])`. If `vt` is 0, `kq1` is set to the string representation of `x` and `kq2` is set to the string representation of `y`, and `vt` is updated to 1. If `vt` is not 0, `kq1` is set to the string representation of `y` and `kq2` is set to the string representation of `x`.**
