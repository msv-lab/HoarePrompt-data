Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` and `y` are strings representing integers where 1 <= x, y < 10^100, and `x` and `y` consist only of digits from 1 to 9.
Code of the loop:
for q in range(t):
    a = input()
    b = input()
    kq1 = ''
    kq2 = ''
    vt = 0
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if a[i] == b[i]:
            kq1 = kq1 + a[i]
            kq2 = kq2 + a[i]
            continue
        else:
            x, y = min(int(a[i]), int(b[i])), max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))
            if vt == 0:
                vt = 1
                kq1 = kq1 + str(x)
                kq2 = kq2 + str(y)
            else:
                kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
                kq2 = kq2 + str(x)
    print(kq1)
    print(kq2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `q` is 0, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, `i` is the length of `a` (or `b`), `kq1` and `kq2` are strings formed based on the rules applied in the loop, and `vt` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the characters in `a` and `b` were different at any point during the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `q` is 1, `a` is an input string, `b` is a new input string, `i` is the length of `a` (or `b`), `kq1` is a string where each character is either the corresponding character from `a` if it matches the corresponding character from `b`, or the smaller of the two characters (as integers) if they do not match, with the order of alternation based on the value of `vt`. `kq2` is a string where each character is either the corresponding character from `a` if it matches the corresponding character from `b`, or the larger of the two characters (as integers) if they do not match, with the order of alternation based on the value of `vt`. `vt` is 1 if there was at least one mismatch between the characters of `a` and `b`, otherwise it remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 2, `q` is 2, `a` is a non-empty input string, `b` is a new input string, `i` is the length of `a` (or `b`). `kq1` and `kq2` are strings constructed based on the comparison of corresponding characters in `a` and `b`. For each pair of characters at the same position in `a` and `b`: if they are equal, both `kq1` and `kq2` are appended with that character. If they are not equal, the smaller character is appended to `kq1` and the larger character is appended to `kq2` when `vt` is 0; otherwise, the larger character is appended to `kq1` and the smaller character is appended to `kq2`. `vt` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the characters were different at any point during the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
