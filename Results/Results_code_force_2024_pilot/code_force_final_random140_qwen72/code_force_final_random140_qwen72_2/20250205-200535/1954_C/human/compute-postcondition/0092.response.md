The code snippet `kq1 = kq1 + str(y)` updates the variable `kq1` by concatenating the string representation of `y` to its current value. Since `kq1` was not initialized in the initial state, it is assumed to be an empty string before this operation.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `q` is 1
- `a` is an input string with at least 3 characters
- `b` is a new input string
- `i` is 2
- `x` is the smaller of the integer values of the second characters of `a` and `b`
- `y` is the larger of the integer values of the second characters of `a` and `b`
- `vt` remains 0

After executing the code:
- `kq1` is now a string containing the string representation of `y`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `q` is 1, `a` is an input string with at least 3 characters, `b` is a new input string, `i` is 2, `x` is the smaller of the integer values of the second characters of `a` and `b`, `y` is the larger of the integer values of the second characters of `a` and `b`, `vt` remains 0, `kq1` is the string representation of `y`.**
