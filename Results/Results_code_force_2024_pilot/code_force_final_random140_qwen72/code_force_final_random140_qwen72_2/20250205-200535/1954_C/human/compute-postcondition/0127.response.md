The code snippet `kq1 = kq1 + str(x)` concatenates the string representation of `x` to the existing value of `kq1`. Given that `kq1` was initially the string representation of `x`, this operation effectively duplicates the string representation of `x`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `q` is 2, `a` is a non-empty input string with at least 2 characters, `b` is a new input string, `i` is 1, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[1])` and `int(b[1])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[1])` and `int(b[1])`, `kq1` is the string representation of `x` repeated twice, `kq2` is the string representation of `y`, `vt` is 1.**
