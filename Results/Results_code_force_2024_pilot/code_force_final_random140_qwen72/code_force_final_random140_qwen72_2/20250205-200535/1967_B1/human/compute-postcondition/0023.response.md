The value of `ans` is updated by adding `n // b + 1` to its current value. Given that `b` is 3, the expression `n // b` performs integer division of `n` by 3. The initial value of `ans` is `n + n // 2 + 2`. After the update, `ans` becomes `n + n // 2 + 2 + n // 3 + 1`.

Therefore, the new value of `ans` is `n + n // 2 + n // 3 + 3`.

The other variables (`n`, `m`, `b`, `t`, `T`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers converted from their original string inputs such that `min(n, m)` is at least 3, `b` is 3, `t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `T` is 1, `ans` is `n + n // 2 + n // 3 + 3`.**
