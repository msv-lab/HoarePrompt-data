The value of `ans` is updated by adding `n // b + 1` to its current value. Given that `b` is 1, `n // b` simplifies to `n // 1`, which is just `n`. Therefore, `ans` becomes `ans + n + 1`. Since the initial value of `ans` is 0, the new value of `ans` is `n + 1`.

The other variables (`n`, `m`, `b`, `t`, `T`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers from input such that `min(n, m) >= 1`, `b` is 1, `t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `T` is 2, `ans` is `n + 1`**
