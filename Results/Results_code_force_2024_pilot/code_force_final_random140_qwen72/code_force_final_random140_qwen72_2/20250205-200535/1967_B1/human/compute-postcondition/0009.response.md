The value of `ans` is updated by adding `n // b + 1` to its current value. Given that `b` is 2, `n // b` is the integer division of `n` by 2. The initial value of `ans` is `n + 1`. Therefore, the new value of `ans` is `(n + 1) + (n // 2) + 1`.

Let's break it down:
- Initial `ans` = `n + 1`
- `n // b` = `n // 2`
- New `ans` = `(n + 1) + (n // 2) + 1` = `n + 1 + n // 2 + 1` = `n + n // 2 + 2`

The other variables (`n`, `m`, `b`, `t`, `T`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, `b` is 2, `t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `T` is 0, `ans` is `n + n // 2 + 2`**
