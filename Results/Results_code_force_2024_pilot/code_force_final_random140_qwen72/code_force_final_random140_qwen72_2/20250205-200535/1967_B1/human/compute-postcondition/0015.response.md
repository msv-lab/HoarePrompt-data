The code snippet `[n, m] = input().split()` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts using whitespace as the delimiter, and assigns these parts to the variables `n` and `m`. This changes the types of `n` and `m` from their initial numeric values to strings containing the input values.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are strings from user input, `b` is `min(n, m) + 1` (where `n` and `m` are the original numeric values), `t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `T` is 1, `ans` is the sum of `n // b + 1` for each `b` from 1 to `min(n, m)` (using the original numeric values of `n` and `m`).**
