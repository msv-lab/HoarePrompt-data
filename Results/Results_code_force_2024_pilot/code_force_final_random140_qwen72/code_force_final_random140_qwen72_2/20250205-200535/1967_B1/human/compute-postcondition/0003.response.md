The code snippet `[n, m] = input().split()` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into two parts based on whitespace, and assigns these parts to the variables `n` and `m`. This means that the values of `n` and `m` are now strings representing the input values.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are strings representing the input values, `t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `T` is 0**
