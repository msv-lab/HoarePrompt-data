The value of `ans` is updated by adding `n // b + 1` to its current value. Given that `b` is 2, the expression `n // b` performs integer division of `n` by 2. Since `ans` was initially `n + 1`, the new value of `ans` becomes `(n + 1) + (n // 2) + 1`.

Let's simplify this:
- `ans` was initially `n + 1`.
- Adding `n // 2` to `ans` gives `n + 1 + n // 2`.
- Adding 1 more gives `n + 1 + n // 2 + 1`, which simplifies to `n + n // 2 + 2`.

Therefore, the new value of `ans` is `n + n // 2 + 2`.

The other variables (`n`, `m`, `b`, `t`, `T`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers from input such that `min(n, m) >= 2`, `b` is 2, `t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `T` is 2, `ans` is `n + n // 2 + 2`.**
