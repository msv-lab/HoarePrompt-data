The value of `ans` is updated by adding the result of `n // b + 1` to its current value. Given that `n` is at least 1, `b` is 1, and `ans` is initially 0, the calculation `n // b + 1` simplifies to `n // 1 + 1`, which is `n + 1`. Therefore, `ans` becomes `0 + (n + 1)`, which is `n + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, `b` is 1, `t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `T` is 0, `ans` is `n + 1`**
