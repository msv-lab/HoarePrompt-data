The code snippet `[n, m] = input().split()` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into two parts using whitespace as the delimiter, and assigns these parts to the variables `n` and `m`. This changes the types of `n` and `m` from positive integers to strings, as `input().split()` returns a list of strings.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` and `m` are strings representing positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `T` is 0.**
