Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers from input such that `min(n, m) >= 1`, `b` is `min(n, m) + 1`, `t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `T` is 2, `ans` is `sum(n // i + 1 for i in range(1, min(n, m) + 1))`.**

### Explanation:
- **`n` and `m`**: These are the input integers that do not change throughout the loop.
- **`b`**: After the loop completes, `b` will be `min(n, m) + 1` because the loop iterates from `1` to `min(n, m)`.
- **`t` and `T`**: These variables are not modified within the loop, so they remain unchanged.
- **`ans`**: The final value of `ans` is the sum of `n // i + 1` for each `i` from `1` to `min(n, m)`. This is because the loop increments `ans` by `n // b + 1` for each iteration, where `b` ranges from `1` to `min(n, m)`.
