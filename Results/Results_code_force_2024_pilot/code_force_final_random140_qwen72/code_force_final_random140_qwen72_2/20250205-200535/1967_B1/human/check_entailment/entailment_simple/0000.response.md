Reasoning:

The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect for solving the problem as described:

1. **Incorrect Loop Boundaries**: The loop iterates over `b` from 1 to `min(n, m) + 1`. However, the problem requires iterating over all possible values of `b` from 1 to `m`, not just up to `min(n, m)`. This means the loop should be `for b in range(1, m + 1):`.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Valid Pairs**: The current implementation adds `n // b + 1` to `ans` for each `b`. This calculation does not correctly account for the condition that `a + b` must be a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. The correct approach would involve checking this condition for each pair `(a, b)`.

3. **Efficiency Concerns**: The current implementation is inefficient because it does not use the properties of the greatest common divisor (GCD) to optimize the counting of valid pairs. A more efficient approach would involve precomputing some values or using mathematical insights to reduce the complexity.

Given these issues, the provided solution does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
