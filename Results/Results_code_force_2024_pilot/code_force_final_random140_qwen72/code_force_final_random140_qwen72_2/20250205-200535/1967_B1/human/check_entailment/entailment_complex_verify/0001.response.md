### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to 0 for each test case, which is correct.

3. **Loop Over Possible Values of `b`:**
   - The loop iterates over `b` from 1 to `min(n, m)`. This is incorrect because the problem requires checking all values of `b` from 1 to `m`, not just up to `min(n, m)`.

4. **Condition Check:**
   - The program adds `n // b + 1` to `ans` for each `b`. This is incorrect because it does not check the condition \( a + b \) being a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \).

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the value of `ans` for each test case, but the value of `ans` is not computed correctly.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Correct Input Handling:**
  - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the values of `n` and `m` for each test case.

- **Incorrect Loop Range:**
  - The loop should iterate over `b` from 1 to `m`, not `min(n, m)`. This is a critical error because it misses potential valid pairs where `b > min(n, m)`.

- **Incorrect Condition Check:**
  - The program does not implement the required condition \( a + b \) being a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \). Instead, it simply adds `n // b + 1` to `ans`, which is unrelated to the problem's requirements.

- **Efficiency Concerns:**
  - Even if the loop range were corrected, the current approach would be highly inefficient for large values of `n` and `m` due to the nested loops. A more efficient approach using number theory properties is necessary.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the required logic and fails to meet the problem's specifications. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
