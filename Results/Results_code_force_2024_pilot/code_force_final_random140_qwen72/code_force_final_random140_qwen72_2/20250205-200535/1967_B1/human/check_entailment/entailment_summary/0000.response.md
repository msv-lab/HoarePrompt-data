Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that \( a + b \) is a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \). However, the program simply sums up \( n // b + 1 \) for each \( b \) from 1 to \( \min(n, m) \), which does not correspond to the required condition.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to check for each pair (a, b) whether \( a + b \) is a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \). The current implementation does not perform this check and instead uses a formula that does not match the problem's requirements.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
