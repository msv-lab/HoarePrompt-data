### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to 0 for each test case, which is correct.

3. **Loop Over Possible Values of `b`:**
   - The loop iterates over `b` from 1 to `min(n, m)`. This is incorrect because the problem requires checking all values of `b` from 1 to `m`, not just up to `min(n, m)`.

4. **Condition Check:**
   - The program adds `n // b + 1` to `ans` for each `b`. This is incorrect because it does not check the condition \( a + b \) being a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \). Instead, it simply adds `n // b + 1` without any condition check.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the value of `ans` for each test case, but the value of `ans` is not computed correctly.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Explanation of the Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
1. Iterate over all possible values of `b` from 1 to `m`.
2. For each `b`, iterate over all possible values of `a` from 1 to `n`.
3. Check if \( a + b \) is a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \).
4. If the condition is satisfied, increment the count.

However, this brute-force approach is inefficient for large values of `n` and `m`. A more efficient approach involves using properties of the greatest common divisor (GCD) and number theory to reduce the complexity.

Here is a more efficient approach:

```python
from math import gcd

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        ans = 0
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            for a in range(1, n + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    ans += 1
        print(ans)

func()
```

This approach checks the condition for each pair `(a, b)` and increments the count if the condition is satisfied. However, this is still not the most efficient solution, but it is closer to the correct logic. Further optimization can be done using number theory properties.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
