Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program calculates `ans = ans + n // b + 1` for each `b` from 1 to `min(n, m)`. This calculation does not take into account the condition that `a + b` must be a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. Instead, it simply adds `n // b + 1` to the answer, which is incorrect.

A correct implementation would need to check for each pair `(a, b)` whether `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. The current program does not do this, leading to incorrect results for many inputs.

For example, consider the input `n = 2`, `m = 3`. The correct output should be 3, corresponding to the pairs `(1, 1)`, `(2, 1)`, and `(2, 2)`. However, the given program will output a different result because it does not correctly handle the condition specified in the problem description.
