Functionality: **The function accepts a non-empty string `s` consisting only of characters "(" and ")", where `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000. It returns a string `result` constructed from characters in `s` sorted by their balance in ascending order and by their index in descending order for the same balance.**
