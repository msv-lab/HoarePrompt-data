Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes a non-empty string `s` consisting only of characters "(" and ")", where `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000. It returns a new string `result` that is constructed by sorting the characters in `s` based on their balance (number of unmatched opening parentheses minus closing parentheses) in ascending order, and for characters with the same balance, by their index in descending order. The original string `s` remains unchanged. **
