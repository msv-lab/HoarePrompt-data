#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    balance = 0
    positions = []
    for (i, char) in enumerate(s):
        if char == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        
        positions.append((balance, i, char))
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `s` remains a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `i` is `n-1` (the last index of the string); `balance` is 0 (since `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence); `positions` is a list containing `n` tuples, each representing the balance, index, and character at each position in the string.
    positions.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))
    result = ''.join([char for _, _, char in positions])
    return result
    #The program returns a string `result` constructed from the characters in `positions` in the specified order, which is sorted by balance in ascending order and by index in descending order for the same balance. The string `result` is derived from the balanced parentheses sequence `s`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a non-empty string `s` consisting only of characters "(" and ")", where `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000. It returns a new string `result` that is constructed by sorting the characters in `s` based on their balance (number of unmatched opening parentheses minus closing parentheses) in ascending order, and for characters with the same balance, by their index in descending order. The original string `s` remains unchanged.
