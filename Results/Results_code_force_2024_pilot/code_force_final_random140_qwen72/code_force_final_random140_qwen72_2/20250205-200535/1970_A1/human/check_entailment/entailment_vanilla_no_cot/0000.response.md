Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the input string `s` and strips any leading or trailing whitespace, which is appropriate for the given problem.

2. **Balance Calculation and Position Recording**:
   - It initializes a variable `balance` to keep track of the current balance of the parentheses.
   - It iterates through each character in the string `s`, updating the balance accordingly.
   - For each character, it appends a tuple `(balance, i, char)` to the list `positions`, where `i` is the index of the character in the string.

3. **Sorting**:
   - The list `positions` is sorted based on the balance in ascending order and, in case of ties, by the position in descending order. This sorting step ensures that the characters are rearranged according to the rules of the balanced shuffle operation.

4. **Result Construction**:
   - After sorting, the program constructs the result string by joining the characters from the sorted list `positions`.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result of the function `func_1(s)`.

The program handles the input and output as specified, and the logic for the balanced shuffle operation is implemented correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.
