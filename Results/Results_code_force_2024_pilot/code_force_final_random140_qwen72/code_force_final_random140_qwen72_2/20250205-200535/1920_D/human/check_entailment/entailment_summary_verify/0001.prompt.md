You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Jayden has an array a which is initially empty. There are n operations of two
types he must perform in the given order.

  1. Jayden appends an integer x (1 \leq x \leq n ) to the end of array a . 
  2. Jayden appends x copies of array a to the end of array a . In other words, array a becomes [a,\underbrace{a,\ldots,a}_{x}] . It is guaranteed that he has done at least one operation of the first type before this. 

Jayden has q queries. For each query, you must tell him the k -th element of
array a . The elements of the array are numbered from 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \leq n, q
\leq 10^5 ) — the number of operations and the number of queries.

The following n lines describe the operations. Each line contains two integers
b and x (b \in \\{1, 2\\} ), where b denotes the type of operation. If b=1 ,
then x (1 \leq x \leq n ) is the integer Jayden appends to the end of the
array. If b=2 , then x (1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ) is the number of copies Jayden
appends to the end of the array.

The next line of each test case contains q integers k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_q (1
\leq k_i \leq \min(10^{18}, c) ), which denote the queries, where c is the
size of the array after finishing all n operations.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and the sum of q over all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output q integers — answers to Jayden's queries.

Note

In the first test case:

  * After the first operation a = [1] ;
  * After the second operation a = [1, 2] ;
  * After the third operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2] ;
  * After the fourth operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3] ;
  * After the fifth operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3] .

In the fourth test case, after all operations a = [1, 2] .

- Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    a = [0]
    b = {}
    (c, d) = map(int, input().split())
    for i in range(c):
        (d, e) = map(int, input().split())
        if a[-1] > 10 ** 19:
            continue
        if d & 1:
            a[-1] += 1
            b[a[-1]] = e
        else:
            a.append(a[-1] * (e + 1))
    a = a[::-1]
    print(str(list(map(r, input().split())))[1:-1].replace(',', ''))

def func_1(x):
    x = int(x)
    if x in b:
        return b[x]
    for i in a:
        x = (x - 1) % i + 1
        if x in b:
            return b[x]



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` takes an integer `x` as input and operates on two external data structures, a list `a` and a set `b`. It returns a value from the set `b` based on the following logic: If `x` is directly in `b`, it returns the value associated with `x` in `b`. If `x` is not in `b`, it iterates through each element `i` in the list `a`, updating `x` using the formula `(x - 1) % i + 1`. During this iteration, if the updated `x` becomes an element of `b`, it returns the value associated with `x` in `b`. If no such `x` is found in `b` after iterating through all elements in `a`, the function does not return any value, effectively returning `None`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates through each test case. For each test case, it reads the number of operations `n` and the number of queries `q`.

2. **Operation Handling**:
   - The program initializes an array `a` with a single element `[0]` and a dictionary `b` to store the positions of the elements.
   - For each operation, it reads the type `d` and the value `e`.
   - If the type is 1 (append an integer), it increments the last element of `a` and stores the value `e` in the dictionary `b` at the position indicated by the incremented value.
   - If the type is 2 (append `x` copies of the array), it appends a new element to `a` which is the product of the last element of `a` and `(e + 1)`.

3. **Query Handling**:
   - After processing all operations, the array `a` is reversed.
   - The program reads the queries and maps each query to the function `func_1`.
   - The function `func_1` takes a query `x`, converts it to an integer, and checks if `x` is in the dictionary `b`. If it is, it returns the corresponding value.
   - If `x` is not in the dictionary, it iterates through the reversed array `a` and reduces `x` modulo each element until it finds a value in `b`.

4. **Output**:
   - The results of the queries are printed in the required format.

### Issues:
- The variable names `c` and `d` are reused, which can lead to confusion. Specifically, `d` is used both for the number of queries and for the operation type.
- The function `r` is not defined in the code, but it seems to be intended to be `func_1`.
- The condition `if a[-1] > 10 ** 19:` is not necessary and can be removed since the problem constraints do not require such a check.
- The logic for handling the queries and the operations is correct, but the implementation is a bit convoluted and could be simplified.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func_1(x):
    x = int(x)
    if x in b:
        return b[x]
    for i in a:
        x = (x - 1) % i + 1
        if x in b:
            return b[x]

for _ in range(int(input())):
    a = [0]
    b = {}
    n, q = map(int, input().split())
    for i in range(n):
        op, val = map(int, input().split())
        if op == 1:
            a[-1] += 1
            b[a[-1]] = val
        else:
            a.append(a[-1] * (val + 1))
    a = a[::-1]
    queries = list(map(func_1, input().split()))
    print(' '.join(map(str, queries)))
```

### Correctness:
Given the corrected code and the reasoning, the program is correct and should handle the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
