You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jayden has an array a which is initially empty. There are n operations of two
types he must perform in the given order.

  1. Jayden appends an integer x (1 \leq x \leq n ) to the end of array a . 
  2. Jayden appends x copies of array a to the end of array a . In other words, array a becomes [a,\underbrace{a,\ldots,a}_{x}] . It is guaranteed that he has done at least one operation of the first type before this. 

Jayden has q queries. For each query, you must tell him the k -th element of
array a . The elements of the array are numbered from 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \leq n, q
\leq 10^5 ) — the number of operations and the number of queries.

The following n lines describe the operations. Each line contains two integers
b and x (b \in \\{1, 2\\} ), where b denotes the type of operation. If b=1 ,
then x (1 \leq x \leq n ) is the integer Jayden appends to the end of the
array. If b=2 , then x (1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ) is the number of copies Jayden
appends to the end of the array.

The next line of each test case contains q integers k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_q (1
\leq k_i \leq \min(10^{18}, c) ), which denote the queries, where c is the
size of the array after finishing all n operations.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and the sum of q over all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output q integers — answers to Jayden's queries.

Note

In the first test case:

  * After the first operation a = [1] ;
  * After the second operation a = [1, 2] ;
  * After the third operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2] ;
  * After the fourth operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3] ;
  * After the fifth operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3] .

In the fourth test case, after all operations a = [1, 2] .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer representing the k-th element to be queried from the array a, where 1 ≤ x ≤ size of the array a after all operations have been performed.
def func_1(x):
    x = int(x)
    if (x in b) :
        return b[x]
        #The program returns the value of the element at index `x` in the set `b`. Since `x` is an integer representing the k-th element to be queried from the array `a`, and `x` is also an element of the set `b`, the program returns the value associated with the element `x` in the set `b`.
    #State: x is an integer representing the k-th element to be queried from the array a, where 1 ≤ x ≤ size of the array a after all operations have been performed, and x is not in b
    for i in a:
        x = (x - 1) % i + 1
        
        if x in b:
            return b[x]
        
    #State: `x` is the final result of the expression `((x - 1) % i + 1)` after iterating through all elements in `a`, and `x` is not in `b`. The loop has iterated through all elements in `a`, and no value was returned because `x` was never found in `b`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes an integer `x` as input and operates on two external data structures, a list `a` and a set `b`. It returns a value from the set `b` based on the following logic: If `x` is directly in `b`, it returns the value associated with `x` in `b`. If `x` is not in `b`, it iterates through each element `i` in the list `a`, updating `x` using the formula `(x - 1) % i + 1`. During this iteration, if the updated `x` becomes an element of `b`, it returns the value associated with `x` in `b`. If no such `x` is found in `b` after iterating through all elements in `a`, the function does not return any value, effectively returning `None`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly implementing the described operations and queries. Here are the specific problems:

1. **Variable Naming Conflicts**: The variable `d` is used both for the number of queries and as part of the loop iterating through the operations. This can lead to unexpected behavior and incorrect results.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Operations**: The program does not correctly handle the operations as described. Specifically, the logic for appending elements and duplicating the array is flawed. For example, the condition `if d & 1:` is checking if `d` is odd, which is not relevant to the problem description. The correct condition should be `if d == 1:` to check for the first type of operation.

3. **Incorrect Array Manipulation**: The program uses a list `a` to keep track of the size of the array after each operation, but it does not correctly update the array content. The logic for appending elements and duplicating the array is not implemented correctly.

4. **Query Handling**: The function `func_1` is supposed to handle the queries, but it is not defined in the provided code. The placeholder `r` is used in the `map` function, which is not defined and will cause a runtime error.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases correctly. For example, if the array size exceeds \(10^{18}\), the program should handle it appropriately, but the current implementation simply continues without updating the array, which can lead to incorrect results.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
