Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly implementing the described operations and queries. Here are the specific problems:

1. **Variable Naming Conflicts**: The variable `d` is used both for the number of queries and as part of the loop iterating through the operations. This can lead to unexpected behavior and incorrect results.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Operations**: The program does not correctly handle the operations as described. Specifically, the logic for appending elements and duplicating the array is flawed. For example, the condition `if d & 1:` is checking if `d` is odd, which is not relevant to the problem description. The correct condition should be `if d == 1:` to check for the first type of operation.

3. **Incorrect Array Manipulation**: The program uses a list `a` to keep track of the size of the array after each operation, but it does not correctly update the array content. The logic for appending elements and duplicating the array is not implemented correctly.

4. **Query Handling**: The function `func_1` is supposed to handle the queries, but it is not defined in the provided code. The placeholder `r` is used in the `map` function, which is not defined and will cause a runtime error.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases correctly. For example, if the array size exceeds \(10^{18}\), the program should handle it appropriately, but the current implementation simply continues without updating the array, which can lead to incorrect results.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
