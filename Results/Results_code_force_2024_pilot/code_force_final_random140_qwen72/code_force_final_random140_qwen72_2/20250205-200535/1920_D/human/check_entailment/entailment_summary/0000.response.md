Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**: The program starts by reading the number of test cases. For each test case, it initializes an array `a` with a single element `[0]` and a dictionary `b` to store the values appended to the array. It then reads the number of operations `c` and the number of queries `d`.

2. **Processing Operations**:
   - For each operation, it reads the operation type `d` and the value `e`.
   - If the last element of `a` exceeds \(10^{19}\), it skips the operation to avoid overflow.
   - If the operation type is 1 (append an integer), it increments the last element of `a` by 1 and stores the value in the dictionary `b`.
   - If the operation type is 2 (append multiple copies of the array), it appends a new element to `a` which is the product of the last element and `(e + 1)`.

3. **Reversing the Array**: The array `a` is reversed to facilitate the query processing.

4. **Query Processing**:
   - The program reads the queries and maps them to the function `func_1`.
   - The function `func_1` processes each query by checking if the query value `x` is directly in the dictionary `b`. If it is, it returns the corresponding value.
   - If `x` is not in `b`, it iterates through the reversed array `a`, updating `x` using the formula `(x - 1) % i + 1` until `x` is found in `b` or all elements in `a` have been processed.

5. **Output**: The results of the queries are printed in the required format.

### Issues and Considerations:
- **Overflow Handling**: The program checks if the last element of `a` exceeds \(10^{19}\) to avoid overflow, which is a good practice given the constraints.
- **Efficiency**: The program uses a dictionary `b` to store the values appended to the array, which allows for efficient lookups during query processing.
- **Query Processing**: The function `func_1` correctly handles the modulo operation to find the position in the array, ensuring that the correct value is returned for each query.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to handle the problem correctly based on the provided problem description and execution summary. It efficiently processes the operations and queries while avoiding overflow issues.

Correctness: **True**
