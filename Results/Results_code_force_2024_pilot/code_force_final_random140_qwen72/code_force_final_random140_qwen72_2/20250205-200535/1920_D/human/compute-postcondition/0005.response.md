The value of `x` is updated using the formula `(x - 1) % i + 1`. Given that `i` is the first element in `a`, and `x` is an integer within the bounds of the array `a` and not in `b`, the new value of `x` will be calculated based on the modulo operation and addition.

Let's break down the calculation:
- `x - 1` shifts `x` to a zero-based index.
- `(x - 1) % i` computes the remainder when `x - 1` is divided by `i`.
- Adding 1 to the result ensures that `x` remains a 1-based index.

Since `i` is the first element in `a`, the new value of `x` will be within the range [1, i].

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`x` is now `(x - 1) % i + 1`, `a` must have at least one element, `i` is the first element in `a`, and `x` is not in `b`.**
