Output State: **x is an integer representing the k-th element to be queried from the array a, where 1 ≤ x ≤ size of the array a after all operations have been performed.**

Explanation: The code `x = int(x)` ensures that `x` is converted to an integer. Since `x` was already described as an integer in the initial state, this conversion does not change its value. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
