The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `a`. If there is another element in `a` after the current `i`, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the second element in `a`, `a` has at least two elements, and `x` is not in `b`. For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must have at least three elements, and `i` will be the third element in `a`.

State: **`i` is the third element in `a`, `x` is `(x - 1) % i + 1`, `a` has at least three elements, and `x` is not in `b`.**
