Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `x`, which is a list containing two integers: the first representing the number of operations (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and the second representing the number of queries (1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5). The function attempts to return different values based on the following cases:**

- **Case_1:** If the function tries to return the value at index `[n, q]` in an undefined list `b`, it will raise an error.
- **Case_2:** If a valid index `a[2 * (f - 1) + 1]` is used to access an element in the list `b`, the function returns the value of `b[a[2 * (f - 1) + 1]]`.
- **Case_3:** If the loop completes all iterations without returning a value, the function returns the final value of `x`, which could be the original second element of `x` or a modified value based on the operations within the loop. The value of `f` remains unchanged.
