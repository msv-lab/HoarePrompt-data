The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the description, it should accept three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `s`. Here's the breakdown:

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10, representing the length of the strip.
- `s` is a string of length `n`, consisting of characters 'W' or 'B', where 'W' represents a white cell and 'B' represents a black cell. It is guaranteed that at least one cell in `s` is 'B'.

The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the input parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t` (an integer representing the number of test cases), `n` (an integer representing the length of the strip), and `s` (a string of length `n` consisting of 'W' or 'B'). For each test case, it returns a result based on the configuration of the strip `s`.**
