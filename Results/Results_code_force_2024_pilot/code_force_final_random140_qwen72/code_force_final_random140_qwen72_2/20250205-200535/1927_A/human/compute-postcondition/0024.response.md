Functionality: ** The function reads multiple test cases from the standard input. Each test case consists of an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` containing characters 'W' or 'B'. For each test case, the function calculates the minimum number of cells that need to be painted to cover all black cells ('B') in the string `s`. This value is printed for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes its execution. The final state of the program includes the last processed values of `n`, `s`, `first_black`, `last_black`, and `min_paint`, but these are not returned or used outside the function. **
