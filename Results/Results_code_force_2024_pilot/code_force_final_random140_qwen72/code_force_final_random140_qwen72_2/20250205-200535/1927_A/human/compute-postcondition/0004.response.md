The code snippet `first_black = s.find('B')` searches for the first occurrence of the character 'B' in the string `s` and assigns the index of this occurrence to the variable `first_black`. If 'B' is not found in `s`, `first_black` will be assigned the value `-1`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `first_black` is the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in `s` or -1 if 'B' is not found.**
