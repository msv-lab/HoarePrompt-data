Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `t` is an input integer, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' or 'B' with at least one 'B', `i` is `n-1`, and `x` is a list of characters from the last input. If the last input `x` contains any 'B', `start` is the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in the list `x`, and `end` is the index of the last occurrence of 'B' in the list `x`. Otherwise, `start` and `end` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: After the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n-1`, which is the last index of the loop. The variable `x` will hold the list of characters from the last input provided during the final iteration. If this last input contains any 'B', the variables `start` and `end` will be set to the indices of the first and last occurrences of 'B' in `x`, respectively. If the last input does not contain any 'B', `start` and `end` will remain unchanged from their previous values. The variables `t` and `n` will retain their initial values as they are not modified within the loop.
