The function `func` does not explicitly define its parameters within the function signature. However, based on the provided parameter constraints and relationships, it can be inferred that the function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and a string `s`. The integer `t` indicates the number of test cases, where each test case involves an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) representing the length of a strip, and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' or 'B'. The character 'W' represents a white cell, and 'B' represents a black cell. It is guaranteed that at least one cell in the strip is black.

The function's output is not explicitly provided, but typically, such a function would process each test case and return some form of result based on the input parameters for each test case.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and a string `s`. For each test case, `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) representing the length of a strip, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' or 'B', where 'W' represents a white cell and 'B' represents a black cell. It is guaranteed that at least one cell in the strip is black. The function returns a result for each test case based on the input parameters.**
