Output State: **`t` is now `t - 1` (but still greater than 0), `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `first_black` is the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in `s` or -1 if 'B' is not found, `last_black` is the index of the last occurrence of 'B' in `s` or -1 if 'B' is not found, `min_paint` is `last_black - first_black + 1`**

Explanation: The value of `n` is updated to the new input integer provided by the user. All other variables (`t`, `s`, `first_black`, `last_black`, and `min_paint`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
