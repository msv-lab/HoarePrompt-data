Correctness: **True**

The program correctly identifies the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white to make the entire strip white. It does this by finding the first and last occurrence of a black cell ('B') and calculating the length of the segment between these two positions, inclusive. This approach ensures that all black cells are covered by the segment, and it is the smallest possible segment that can achieve this. The program handles multiple test cases as specified in the problem statement.
