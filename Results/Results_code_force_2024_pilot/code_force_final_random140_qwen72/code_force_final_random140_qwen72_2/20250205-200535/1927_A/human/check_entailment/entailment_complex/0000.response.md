Reasoning:  
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the length of the strip (`n`) and the strip itself (`s`).

2. **Finding Black Cells**: The program uses `s.find('B')` to find the index of the first black cell and `s.rfind('B')` to find the index of the last black cell. These methods are appropriate for finding the first and last occurrences of 'B' in the string.

3. **Calculating Minimum Length**: The program calculates the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted by subtracting the index of the first black cell from the index of the last black cell and adding 1. This is correct because it ensures that all black cells are covered, and the segment is as small as possible.

4. **Output**: The program prints the calculated minimum length for each test case, which matches the required output format.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program should work correctly for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
