Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It reads the number of test cases, processes each test case by identifying the positions of the first and last black cells ('B'), and calculates the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white. This approach ensures that all black cells are covered by the smallest possible segment, which aligns with the problem's requirements. The program handles all edge cases, such as when there is only one black cell or when the strip is entirely white except for one black cell. No counterexample has been found where the program fails to produce the correct output.
