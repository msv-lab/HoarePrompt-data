### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `m` and processes each test case individually.
   - It also correctly reads the size of the array `k` and the elements of the array `a`.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1()` is defined to handle each test case. It reads the array, processes it, and appends the result (1 for "YES" or 0 for "NO") to the list `b`.

3. **Array Processing**:
   - The program iterates through each element of the array `a`.
   - If an element is greater than 10, it splits the element into its digits and checks if the resulting array remains sorted.
   - The program uses a list `c` to store the modified array after splitting elements.
   - It checks if the current element can be split and inserted back into the array while maintaining the sorted order.

4. **Splitting Logic**:
   - The logic for splitting elements and checking the sorted order is flawed. Specifically, the program does not handle cases where multiple elements need to be split and reinserted in a way that maintains the sorted order.
   - For example, consider the array `[12, 28, 5]`:
     - Splitting 12: `[1, 2, 28, 5]`
     - Splitting 28: `[1, 2, 2, 8, 5]`
     - The final array is not sorted, so the output should be "NO".
   - However, the program might incorrectly conclude that the array can be sorted because it does not properly handle the insertion of split elements.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program may fail in edge cases where the array has multiple elements that need to be split and reinserted in a specific order to maintain the sorted property.
   - For example, consider the array `[12, 3, 45, 67]`:
     - Splitting 12: `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]`
     - Splitting 45: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 67]`
     - Splitting 67: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`
     - The final array is sorted, so the output should be "YES".
   - However, the program might not correctly handle the insertion of 45 and 67, leading to an incorrect conclusion.

6. **Sorting Check**:
   - After processing the array, the program sorts the list `c` and checks if the modified array `c` is equal to the sorted version of `c`.
   - If they are equal, it appends 1 to the list `b`, indicating that the array can be sorted. Otherwise, it appends 0.
   - This check is correct, but the issue lies in the logic that generates the list `c`.

### Example Test Case Analysis:
- **Test Case 1**: `[12, 3, 45, 67]`
  - Splitting 12: `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]`
  - Splitting 45: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 67]`
  - Splitting 67: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`
  - The final array is sorted, so the output should be "YES".

- **Test Case 2**: `[12, 28, 5]`
  - Splitting 12: `[1, 2, 28, 5]`
  - Splitting 28: `[1, 2, 2, 8, 5]`
  - The final array is not sorted, so the output should be "NO".

- **Test Case 3**: `[0, 0]`
  - The array is already sorted, so the output should be "YES".

### Conclusion:
The program's logic for splitting elements and checking the sorted order is flawed, leading to incorrect results in some cases. The issues identified in the original assessment are valid, and the program does not handle the splitting and reinsertion of elements correctly in all scenarios.

### Correctness:
Final: **False**
