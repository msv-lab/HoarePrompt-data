Reasoning:  
The program aims to solve the problem of determining if an array can be made non-decreasing by splitting elements greater than 10 into their constituent digits. The logic in `func_1` attempts to handle this by creating a new list `c` and checking if it can be sorted after the transformation. However, there are several issues with the implementation:

1. **Incorrect Splitting Logic**: The program only splits numbers greater than 10 into their tens and units digits. This is insufficient because numbers like 123 should be split into [1, 2, 3], not just [12, 3]. The current logic only handles two-digit numbers correctly.

2. **Handling of Split Digits**: The program checks if the tens digit is less than or equal to the units digit before appending them to `c`. This is unnecessary and incorrect. The digits should always be appended in the order they appear in the original number.

3. **Sorting Check**: The program checks if the transformed list `c` is sorted. This is a good approach, but the transformation logic needs to be fixed first.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases well, such as when the array is already sorted or when all elements are less than 10.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
