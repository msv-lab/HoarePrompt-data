### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `m` and processes each test case individually.
   - It reads the size of the array `k` and the elements of the array `a`.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1()` is defined to handle each test case. It reads the array, processes it, and appends the result (1 for "YES" or 0 for "NO") to the list `b`.

3. **Array Processing**:
   - The program iterates through each element of the array `a`.
   - If an element is greater than 10, it splits the element into its digits and checks if the resulting array remains sorted.
   - The program uses a list `c` to store the modified array after splitting elements.
   - It checks if the current element can be split and inserted back into the array while maintaining the sorted order.

4. **Splitting Logic**:
   - The logic for splitting elements is flawed. Specifically, the program only considers the immediate previous element in the list `c` when deciding whether to split the current element. This approach fails to account for the possibility that multiple elements might need to be split and reinserted in a specific order to maintain the sorted property.
   - For example, in the test case `[12, 28, 5]`, the program incorrectly decides to keep 28 as a single element because it compares it with the previous element 2, which is less than 28. However, the correct approach would be to split 28 into 2 and 8, and then check if the resulting array can be sorted.

5. **Sorting Check**:
   - After processing the array, the program sorts the list `c` and checks if the modified array `c` is equal to the sorted version of `c`.
   - If they are equal, it appends 1 to the list `b`, indicating that the array can be sorted. Otherwise, it appends 0.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program may fail in edge cases where the array has multiple elements that need to be split and reinserted in a specific order to maintain the sorted property.
   - For example, in the test case `[12, 28, 5]`, the program should split 28 into 2 and 8, but it does not do so correctly.

### Example Test Case Analysis:
- **Test Case 1**: `[12, 3, 45, 67]`
  - Splitting 12: `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]`
  - Splitting 45: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 67]`
  - Splitting 67: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`
  - The final array is sorted, so the output should be "YES".
  - **Program Output**: "YES" (Correct)

- **Test Case 2**: `[12, 28, 5]`
  - Splitting 12: `[1, 2, 28, 5]`
  - Splitting 28: `[1, 2, 2, 8, 5]`
  - The final array is not sorted, so the output should be "NO".
  - **Program Output**: "NO" (Incorrect, should be "NO")

- **Test Case 3**: `[0, 0]`
  - The array is already sorted, so the output should be "YES".
  - **Program Output**: "YES" (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program's logic for splitting elements and checking the sorted order is flawed, leading to incorrect results in some cases. Specifically, the program fails to handle cases where multiple elements need to be split and reinserted in a specific order to maintain the sorted property.

### Correctness:
Final: **False**
