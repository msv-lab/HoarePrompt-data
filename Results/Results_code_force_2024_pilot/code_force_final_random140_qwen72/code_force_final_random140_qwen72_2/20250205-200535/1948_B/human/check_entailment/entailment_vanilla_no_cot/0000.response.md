Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the transformation and checking process for all cases. Here are some issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Digits**: The logic for splitting numbers into their digits is flawed. Specifically, the conditions for appending `y` and `x` to the list `c` are not always correct. For example, the condition `if y >= c[n - 1]` assumes that the previous element in `c` is always the last element processed, which may not be true if the current element is not split.

2. **Sorting Check**: The program checks if the transformed list `c` is sorted by comparing it with its sorted version `d`. However, this approach does not account for the possibility of multiple operations being applied to different elements in the array.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases well, such as when the array is already sorted or when all elements are less than 10.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_be_sorted(a):
    def split_number(num):
        return [int(digit) for digit in str(num)]
    
    stack = []
    for num in a:
        if num < 10:
            stack.append(num)
        else:
            digits = split_number(num)
            for digit in digits:
                if stack and stack[-1] > digit:
                    return False
                stack.append(digit)
    
    return True

m = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(m):
    k = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if can_be_sorted(a):
        results.append('YES')
    else:
        results.append('NO')

for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This corrected version:
- Uses a helper function `split_number` to split a number into its digits.
- Uses a stack to keep track of the elements and ensures that the stack remains sorted after each operation.
- Checks if the final stack is sorted, which is a more reliable way to determine if the array can be sorted.
