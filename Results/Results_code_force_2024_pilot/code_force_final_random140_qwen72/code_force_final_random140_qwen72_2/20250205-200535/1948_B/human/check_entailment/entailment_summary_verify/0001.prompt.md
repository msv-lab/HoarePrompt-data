You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program:
m = int(input())
b = []
for i in range(m):
    func_1()
for i in range(m):
    if b[i] == 1:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')

def func_1():
    k = int(input())
    a = input()
    a = list(map(int, a.split()))
    x = 0
    y = 0
    n = 0
    c = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if a[i] > 10 and i > 0:
            x = int(a[i] % 10)
            y = int(a[i] / 10)
            if y >= c[n - 1]:
                if y <= x:
                    c.append(y)
                    c.append(x)
                    n = n + 2
                else:
                    c.append(a[i])
                    n = n + 1
            else:
                c.append(a[i])
                n = n + 1
        elif i == 0 and a[i] > 10:
            x = int(a[i] % 10)
            y = int(a[i] / 10)
            if y <= x:
                c.append(y)
                c.append(x)
                n = n + 2
            else:
                c.append(a[i])
                n = n + 1
        else:
            c.append(a[i])
            n = n + 1
    d = sorted(c)
    if c == d:
        b.append(1)
    else:
        b.append(0)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` processes a series of test cases. Each test case involves an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. The function transforms the list `a` into a new list `c` based on specific conditions: if an element in `a` is greater than 10, it is split into its tens and units digits, and these digits are added to `c` under certain conditions. After processing, the function checks if the list `c` is sorted. If `c` is sorted, the function appends 1 to a list `b`; otherwise, it appends 0. The function does not return any value explicitly, but it modifies the list `b` to contain the results of the test cases.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `m` and processes each test case individually. It also correctly reads the size of the array `k` and the elements of the array `a`.

2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1()` is defined to handle each test case. It reads the array, processes it, and appends the result (1 for "YES" or 0 for "NO") to the list `b`.

3. **Array Processing**:
   - The program iterates through each element of the array `a`.
   - If an element is greater than 10, it splits the element into its digits and checks if the resulting array remains sorted.
   - The program uses a list `c` to store the modified array after splitting elements.
   - It checks if the current element can be split and inserted back into the array while maintaining the sorted order.

4. **Sorting Check**:
   - After processing the array, the program sorts the list `c` and checks if the modified array `c` is equal to the sorted version of `c`.
   - If they are equal, it appends 1 to the list `b`, indicating that the array can be sorted. Otherwise, it appends 0.

5. **Output**:
   - After processing all test cases, the program prints "YES" or "NO" based on the values in the list `b`.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Splitting Logic**: The logic for splitting the elements and checking the sorted order is not entirely correct. Specifically, the program does not handle cases where multiple elements need to be split and reinserted in a way that maintains the sorted order.
- **Edge Cases**: The program may fail in edge cases where the array has multiple elements that need to be split and reinserted in a specific order to maintain the sorted property.

### Example Test Case Analysis:
- **Test Case 1**: `[12, 3, 45, 67]`
  - Splitting 12: `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]`
  - Splitting 45: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 67]`
  - Splitting 67: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`
  - The final array is sorted, so the output should be "YES".

- **Test Case 2**: `[12, 28, 5]`
  - Splitting 12: `[1, 2, 28, 5]`
  - Splitting 28: `[1, 2, 2, 8, 5]`
  - The final array is not sorted, so the output should be "NO".

- **Test Case 3**: `[0, 0]`
  - The array is already sorted, so the output should be "YES".

### Conclusion:
The program's logic for splitting elements and checking the sorted order is flawed, leading to incorrect results in some cases.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
