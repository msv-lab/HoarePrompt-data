Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is either 0, 1, or 2, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `k` is an input integer, `i` is incremented by 1, `c` is a list containing the elements it previously had plus the element `a[i]`. If `a[i]` is greater than 10 and `i` is greater than 0, then `x` is the last digit of `a[i]`, `y` is the integer part of `a[i]` divided by 10, and `c` contains either `[y, x]` if `y` is less than or equal to `x` and `y` is greater than or equal to the element at index `n - 1` in `c`, or the element at index `i` in `a` if `y` is greater than `x` or `y` is less than the element at index `n - 1` in `c`. If `a[i]` is less than or equal to 10 or `i` is 0, then `n` is 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, and `c` is a list containing the first element of `a`. If `i` is 0 and `a[i]` is greater than 10, then `x` is the last digit of `a[0]`, `y` is the integer part of `a[0]` divided by 10, and if `y` is less than or equal to `x`, then `n` is 2 and `c` is a list containing the integer part of `a[0]` divided by 10 and `x`. If `y` is greater than `x`, then `n` is 1 and `c` is a list containing the first element of `a`.**
