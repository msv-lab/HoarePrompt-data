Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `k` is an input integer, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `c` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if a[i] > 10 and i > 0:
        x = int(a[i] % 10)
        y = int(a[i] / 10)
        if y >= c[n - 1]:
            if y <= x:
                c.append(y)
                c.append(x)
                n = n + 2
            else:
                c.append(a[i])
                n = n + 1
        else:
            c.append(a[i])
            n = n + 1
    elif i == 0 and a[i] > 10:
        x = int(a[i] % 10)
        y = int(a[i] / 10)
        if y <= x:
            c.append(y)
            c.append(x)
            n = n + 2
        else:
            c.append(a[i])
            n = n + 1
    else:
        c.append(a[i])
        n = n + 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is either 0, 1, or 2, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `k` is an input integer, `i` is 0 or greater than 0, and `c` is a list. If `a[i]` is greater than 10 and `i` is greater than 0, then `x` is the last digit of `a[i]`, `y` is the integer part of `a[i]` divided by 10, and `c` is a list containing either `[y, x]` if `y` is less than or equal to `x` and `y` is greater than or equal to the element at index `n - 1` in `c`, or the element at index `i` in `a` if `y` is greater than `x` or `y` is less than the element at index `n - 1` in `c`. If `a[i]` is less than or equal to 10 or `i` is 0, then `n` is 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, and `c` is a list containing the first element of `a`. If `i` is 0 and `a[i]` is greater than 10, then `x` is the last digit of `a[0]`, `y` is the integer part of `a[0]` divided by 10, and if `y` is less than or equal to `x`, then `n` is 2 and `c` is a list containing the integer part of `a[0]` divided by 10 and `x`. If `y` is greater than `x`, then `n` is 1 and `c` is a list containing the first element of `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `k` is an input integer, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is greater than 10 and `i` is greater than 0, `x` is the last digit of `a[i]`, `y` is the integer part of `a[i]` divided by 10. If `y` is less than or equal to `x` and `y` is greater than or equal to the element at index `n - 1` in `c`, `c` is a list containing `[y, x]`. If `y` is greater than `x` or `y` is less than the element at index `n - 1` in `c`, `c` is a list containing the element at index `i` in `a`. If `a[i]` is less than or equal to 10 or `i` is 0, `n` is 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, and `c` is a list containing the first element of `a`. If `i` is 0 and `a[0]` is greater than 10, `x` is the last digit of `a[0]`, `y` is the integer part of `a[0]` divided by 10. If `y` is less than or equal to `x`, `n` is 2 and `c` is a list containing the integer part of `a[0]` divided by 10 and `x`. If `y` is greater than `x`, `n` is 1 and `c` is a list containing the first element of `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `k` is an input integer, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is greater than 10 and `i` is greater than 0, `x` is the last digit of `a[i]`, `y` is the integer part of `a[i]` divided by 10, and `c` is updated as follows: If `y` is greater than or equal to the element at index `n - 1` in `c` and `y` is less than or equal to `x`, `c` contains `[y, x]` appended to its previous contents. If `y` is greater than `x`, `c` contains the element at index `i` in `a` appended to its previous contents. If `a[i]` is less than or equal to 10 or `i` is 0, `c` contains the first element of `a`. If `i` is 0 and `a[0]` is greater than 10, `c` contains the integer part of `a[0]` divided by 10 and `x` if `y` is less than or equal to `x` and `n` is 2, or the first element of `a` if `y` is greater than `x` and `n` is 1. If `y` is less than the element at index `n - 1` in `c`, `c` contains the element at index `i` in `a` appended to its previous contents. If `a[i]` is less than or equal to 10 or `i` is 0, `c` contains the first element of `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
