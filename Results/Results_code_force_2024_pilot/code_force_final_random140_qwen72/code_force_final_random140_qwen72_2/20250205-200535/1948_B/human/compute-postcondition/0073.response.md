Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `k` is an input integer, `i` is incremented by 1, `x` is the last digit of `a[i]`, `y` is the integer part of `a[i]` divided by 10, `c` is a list containing `[y, x]` if `y` is less than or equal to `x` and `y` is greater than or equal to the element at index `n - 1` in `c`. If `y` is less than or equal to `x`, `c` now contains the additional element `x`. If `y` is greater than `x`, `c` now contains the element at index `i` in `a` appended to its end. If `a[i]` is less than or equal to 10 or `i` is 0, `c` contains the first element of `a`. If `i` is 0 and `a[0]` is greater than 10, `c` contains the integer part of `a[0]` divided by 10 and `x` if `y` is less than or equal to `x`, or the first element of `a` if `y` is greater than `x`.***
