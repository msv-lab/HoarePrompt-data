Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is 0, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `k` is an input integer, `x` is the last digit of the element at index `i` in `a`, `y` is the integer part of the element at index `i` in `a` divided by 10, `c` is an empty list, `i` is greater than 0, the element at index `i` in `a` is greater than 10, and the integer part of the element at index `i` in `a` divided by 10 (`y`) is greater than or equal to the element at index `n - 1` in `c`. Additionally, `y` is greater than `x`.***
