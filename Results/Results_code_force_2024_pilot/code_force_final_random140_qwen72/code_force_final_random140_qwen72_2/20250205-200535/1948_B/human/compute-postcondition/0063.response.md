Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `k` is an input integer, `i` is incremented by 1. If `i` is 0 and `a[0]` is greater than 10, `x` is the last digit of `a[0]`, `y` is the integer part of `a[0]` divided by 10. If `y` ≤ `x`, `n` is 2 and `c` is a list containing the integer part of `a[0]` divided by 10 and `x`. If `y` > `x`, `n` is 1 and `c` is a list containing the first element of `a`. If `i` is 0 and `a[0]` is less than or equal to 10, `n` is 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, and `c` is a list containing the first element of `a`. If `i` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is greater than 10, `x` is the last digit of `a[i]`, `y` is the integer part of `a[i]` divided by 10. If `y` ≤ `x` and `y` ≥ the element at index `n - 1` in `c`, `c` is a list containing `[y, x]`. If `y` > `x` or `y` < the element at index `n - 1` in `c`, `c` is a list containing the element at index `i` in `a`. If `a[i]` is less than or equal to 10 or `i` is 0, `n` is 1, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, and `c` is a list containing the first element of `a`.**
