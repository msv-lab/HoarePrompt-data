Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `k` is an input integer, `x` is 0, `y` is 0.**

Explanation: The value of `n` is set to 0, overriding its previous value. All other variables (`t`, `a`, `k`, `x`, `y`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
