Functionality: ** The function `func_1` processes a series of test cases. Each test case involves an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. The function transforms the list `a` into a new list `c` based on specific conditions: if an element in `a` is greater than 10, it is split into its tens and units digits, and these digits are added to `c` under certain conditions. After processing, the function checks if the list `c` is sorted. If `c` is sorted, the function appends 1 to a list `b`; otherwise, it appends 0. The function does not return any value explicitly, but it modifies the list `b` to contain the results of the test cases. **
