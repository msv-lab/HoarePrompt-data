### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read`, splits it into a list of strings, and processes each test case sequentially. This method is efficient and suitable for the given constraints.

2. **Test Case Processing:**
   - For each test case, the program extracts the length `n` and the encoded string `encoded`.
   - It then calls `func_1` to decode the string and appends the result to the `results` list.

3. **Decoding Function (`func_1`):**
   - **Unique Characters Extraction:**
     - The function `func_1` starts by extracting the unique characters from the encoded string and sorting them to form the auxiliary string `r`.
     - This step ensures that the characters are in alphabetical order, as required by the problem statement.
   - **Character Mapping:**
     - A dictionary `char_map` is created to map each character in `r` to its symmetric counterpart in `r`.
     - This is done by iterating over the characters in `r` and mapping each character to the corresponding character from the end of `r`.
   - **Decoding:**
     - The function then constructs the decoded string by replacing each character in the encoded string with its mapped character from `char_map`.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, the program prints the decoded strings, each on a new line.

### Validation of Original Assessment:

- **Correctness:**
  - The program correctly implements the decoding algorithm as described in the problem statement.
  - The use of a sorted set to create the auxiliary string `r` ensures that the characters are in alphabetical order.
  - The character mapping and decoding steps are implemented correctly, ensuring that the first character in `r` is mapped to the last, the second to the second last, and so on.
  - The program handles multiple test cases and large inputs efficiently.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles edge cases such as single-character strings and strings with repeated characters correctly.
  - For example, for the input "w", the program correctly outputs "w" since the auxiliary string `r` is "w" and the mapping is trivial.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly decodes the encoded string according to the specified algorithm and handles all valid inputs as expected.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**
