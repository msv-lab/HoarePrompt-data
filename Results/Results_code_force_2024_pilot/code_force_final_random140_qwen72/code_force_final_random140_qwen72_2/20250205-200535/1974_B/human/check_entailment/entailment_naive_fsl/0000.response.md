Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program correctly decodes the encoded string according to the specified algorithm. It constructs the auxiliary string `r` from the unique, sorted characters of the encoded string, creates a mapping from each character in `r` to its symmetric counterpart, and then applies this mapping to decode the string. This approach ensures that the decoding process accurately reverses the encoding process described in the problem statement. No edge cases or potential issues have been identified that would cause the program to fail for any valid input.
