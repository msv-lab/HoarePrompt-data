Reasoning:  
The provided program seems to correctly follow the decoding process as described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the entire input at once and splits it into a list of strings. This is efficient for handling multiple test cases.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - It extracts the length of the encoded string `n` and the encoded string itself.
   - It calls the function `func_1` to decode the string.

3. **Decoding Function (`func_1`)**:
   - **Extract Unique Characters**: It creates a set of unique characters from the encoded string and sorts them alphabetically to form the string `r`.
   - **Create Character Mapping**: It creates a dictionary `char_map` where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric character in `r` (first to last, second to second-last, etc.).
   - **Decode the String**: It constructs the decoded string by replacing each character in the encoded string with its corresponding character from the mapping.

4. **Output**: The program collects the results of all test cases and prints them separated by newlines.

The logic in `func_1` correctly mirrors the encoding process described in the problem statement. Each character in the encoded string is replaced by its symmetric counterpart in the sorted unique characters, which is the reverse of the encoding process.

Given the problem constraints and the steps taken, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
