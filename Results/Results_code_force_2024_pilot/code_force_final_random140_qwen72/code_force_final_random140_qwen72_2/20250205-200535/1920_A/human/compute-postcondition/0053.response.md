The code snippet `count_num += 1` increments the value of `count_num` by 1. Given the initial state, `i` is the third integer in `num`, and if `i` is within the range `[start, end]`, `count_num` is increased by 1. The values of `num`, `i`, `start`, and `end` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`num` must contain at least three integers, `i` is the third integer in `num`, `start` and `end` remain unchanged, `count_num` is increased by 1.**
