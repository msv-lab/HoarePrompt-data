The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `num`. The loop iterates over each element in `num`, so the state of `i` changes to the next element in `num` for the loop to execute one more time. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` was the first integer in `num`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must now be the second integer in `num`. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that there must be at least one more integer in `num`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`num` must contain at least two integers, and `i` is the second integer in `num`. If `i` is less than `start` or greater than `end`, the current iteration of the loop ends immediately, and control moves to the next iteration. If `i` is within the range `[start, end]`, `count_num` is increased by 1.**
