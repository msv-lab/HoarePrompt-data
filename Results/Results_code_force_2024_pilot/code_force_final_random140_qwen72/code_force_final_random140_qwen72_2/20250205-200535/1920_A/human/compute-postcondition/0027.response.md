The code snippet `num.append(v)` adds the value of `v` to the list `num`. This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `i`, `t`, `start`, or `end`. However, the list `num` now contains one element, which is the value of `v`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `i` is 1, `num` is a list containing `[v]`, `t` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer. If `t` == 2 and `end` > `v`, then `end` is updated to `v`. Otherwise, if `t` == 1 and `start` < `v`, then `start` is updated to `v`. If neither condition is met, `start` and `end` remain as they were initially.**
