Postcondition: ***`num` must contain at least two integers, and `i` is the second integer in `num`. If `i` is less than `start` or greater than `end`, the current iteration of the loop ends immediately, and control moves to the next iteration without changing `count_num`. If `i` is within the range `[start, end]`, `count_num` is increased by 1. The values of `num`, `i`, `start`, and `end` remain unchanged, but the loop continues to the next iteration.***
