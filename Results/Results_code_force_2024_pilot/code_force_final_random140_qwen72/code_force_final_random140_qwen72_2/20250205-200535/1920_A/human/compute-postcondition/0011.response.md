Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `i` is 0, `num` is an empty list, `t` is an input integer, and `v` is an input integer. The value of `t` is 2. If `t` was 1, then `start` would have been updated to `v` if `start` < `v`, and `start` would remain less than `end`. However, since `t` is 2, `start` remains -1.**
