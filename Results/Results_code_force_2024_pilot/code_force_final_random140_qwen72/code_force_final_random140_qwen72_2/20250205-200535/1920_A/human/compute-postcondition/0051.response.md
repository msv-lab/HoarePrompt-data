The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `num`. The loop iterates over each element in `num`, so for the loop to execute one more time, the next element in `num` needs to be considered.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` was the second integer in `num`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must now be the third integer in `num`.

The conditions for the loop to continue are that `num` must contain at least three integers, and the next value of `i` (the third integer) must be within the range `[start, end]` for `count_num` to potentially increase by 1.

State: **`num` must contain at least three integers, and `i` is the third integer in `num`. If `i` is less than `start` or greater than `end`, the current iteration of the loop ends immediately, and control moves to the next iteration without changing `count_num`. If `i` is within the range `[start, end]`, `count_num` is increased by 1. The values of `num`, `i`, `start`, and `end` remain unchanged, but the loop continues to the next iteration.**
