Output State: **After the loop executes all `n` iterations, `i` is `n-1`, `num` is a list containing all the integers `v` for which `t` was 3 during the iterations. `start` is the maximum value of `v` encountered when `t` was 1, or remains -1 if no such `v` was greater than the initial `start`. `end` is the minimum value of `v` encountered when `t` was 2, or remains 1000000000 if no such `v` was less than the initial `end`. The value of `n` remains unchanged.**
