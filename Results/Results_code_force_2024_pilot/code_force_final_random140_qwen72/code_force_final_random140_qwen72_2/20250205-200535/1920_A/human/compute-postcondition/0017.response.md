The code `num.append(v)` adds the value of `v` to the list `num`. Since `num` was initially an empty list, after executing this line of code, `num` will contain one element, which is the value of `v`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `i` is 0, `num` is a list containing `[v]`, `t` is 3, and `v` is an input integer.**
