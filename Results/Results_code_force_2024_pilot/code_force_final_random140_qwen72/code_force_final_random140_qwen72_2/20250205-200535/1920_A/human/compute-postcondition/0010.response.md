Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `i` is 0, `num` is an empty list, `t` is an input integer, and `v` is an input integer. If `t` == 1, then if `start` < `v`, `start` is updated to `v` and remains less than `end`. Otherwise, `start` remains -1. If `t` is not 1, the variables retain their initial values.***
