Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `i` is 0, `num` is an empty list, `t` is an input integer, and `v` is an input integer. If `t` == 1, then if `start` < `v`, `start` is updated to `v` and remains less than `end`. Otherwise, `start` remains -1. If `t` == 2, `start` remains -1, and if `end` > `v`, then `end` is set to `v`. Otherwise, `end` remains unchanged. If `t` == 3, `num` is a list containing `[v]`. If `t` is neither 1, 2, nor 3, all variables retain their initial values.***
