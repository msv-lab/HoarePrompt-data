Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `i` is 0, `start` is `v`, `end` is 1000000000, `num` is an empty list, `t` is 1, `v` is an input integer, and `start` is less than `end`.** 

Explanation: The value of `start` is updated to be equal to the value of `v`. All other variables remain unchanged. The condition that `start` is less than `end` is still valid.
