Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `i` is 1, `num` is an empty list, `t` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `start` is `v`, `end` is unchanged (if `t` != 2)**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `v` to `start`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `start` now holds the value of `v`, while the rest of the variables retain their original values.
