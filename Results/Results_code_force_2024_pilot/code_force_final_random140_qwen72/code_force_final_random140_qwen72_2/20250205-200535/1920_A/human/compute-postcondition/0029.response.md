The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `i` is 2, `num` remains as it was at the end of the previous iteration (if `t` == 3, `num` contains `[v]`; if `t` == 2 and `end` > `v`, then `end` is updated to `v`; if `t` == 1 and `start` < `v`, then `start` is updated to `v`; otherwise, `start` and `end` remain as they were initially)**
