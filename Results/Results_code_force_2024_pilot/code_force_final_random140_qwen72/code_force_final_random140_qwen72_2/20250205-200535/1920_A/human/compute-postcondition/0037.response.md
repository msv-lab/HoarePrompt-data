The code snippet `num.append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the list `num`. This operation modifies the `num` list by adding `v` as its new last element. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `t`, `start`, and `end`) remain unchanged unless they were modified by the conditions specified in the initial state.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100
- `i` is 2
- `num` remains as it was at the end of the previous iteration
- `t` is an input integer
- `v` is an input integer
- If `t` == 1 and `start` < `v`, then `start` is set to `v`; otherwise, `start` remains unchanged
- If `t` == 2 and `end` > `v`, then `end` is set to `v`; otherwise, `end` remains unchanged

After executing the code snippet:
- `num` now includes the value `v` as its new last element
- All other variables remain unchanged

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `i` is 2, `num` is the list from the previous iteration with `v` appended, `t` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, if `t` == 1 and `start` < `v`, then `start` is set to `v`; otherwise, `start` remains unchanged, if `t` == 2 and `end` > `v`, then `end` is set to `v`; otherwise, `end` remains unchanged.**
