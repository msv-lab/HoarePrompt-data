The function `func_6` takes three parameters: `arr` (a list of lists), `index` (a non-negative integer), and `value` (an integer). It searches through `arr` to find the first sublist where the element at the specified `index` matches `value`. If such a sublist is found, it is returned. If no sublist meets this condition, the function returns `None`. The function does not modify the input parameters.
