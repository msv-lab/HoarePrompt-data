The function `func_2` takes two boolean parameters, `space` and `to_int`. It reads a line of input from the user. If `space` is True, it splits the input by spaces; otherwise, it splits the input into individual characters. If `to_int` is True, it converts each item in the resulting list to an integer. The function returns a list of integers if `to_int` is True, or a list of strings/characters if `to_int` is False. The final state of the program is that the function has returned one of these lists based on the input parameters.
