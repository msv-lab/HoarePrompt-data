The function `func_3` takes two parameters: `arr`, a list of elements that can be converted to strings, and `sym`, a string. It returns a single string that is the concatenation of the string representations of all elements in `arr`, with each element followed by `sym`, except for the last element which is not followed by `sym`. The original `arr` and `sym` remain unchanged.
