Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It reads the number of constraints, processes each constraint to determine the valid range for `k`, and accounts for the constraints where `k` must not equal certain values. The function `func_7` effectively calculates the number of integers `k` that satisfy all the given constraints, and the logic within the function is consistent with the problem requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.
