### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases (`n`) using `func_1()`. This function should return the number of test cases, which is correctly implemented.
   - For each test case, the program reads the number of constraints (`n`) and then processes each constraint using a loop.

2. **Constraint Processing**:
   - The program initializes `start` to `-1` and `end` to `1000000000` to represent the range of possible values for `k`.
   - For each constraint, the program updates `start` and `end` based on the type of constraint:
     - If the constraint is of type 1 (`k >= x`), `start` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `x`.
     - If the constraint is of type 2 (`k <= x`), `end` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `x`.
     - If the constraint is of type 3 (`k != x`), the value `x` is added to the list `num`.

3. **Counting Valid Integers**:
   - After processing all constraints, the program counts the number of integers in `num` that fall within the range `[start, end]`.
   - The final result is calculated as `end - start + 1 - count_num` if `start` is less than or equal to `end`; otherwise, it returns 0.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles edge cases where the range `[start, end]` is invalid (i.e., `start > end`), returning 0 in such cases.
   - The program also correctly handles the case where there are no constraints of type 3, ensuring that `count_num` is 0 in such cases.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result for each test case, which is the number of integers `k` that satisfy all constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It handles all constraints and edge cases appropriately, and the final output is computed correctly.

### Correctness:
**True**
