Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided has a logical error in the way it handles the constraints and calculates the valid range for `k`. Specifically, the function `func_7` does not correctly account for the "not equal" constraints (type 3) when calculating the final count of valid integers `k`.

### Issue:
- **Handling "Not Equal" Constraints**: The program iterates over the list of "not equal" values (`num`) and checks if they fall within the range `[start, end]`. However, it only increments `count_num` for each value in `num` that falls within this range. This means that if a value in `num` is outside the range `[start, end]`, it is not counted, which is incorrect. The correct approach should be to ensure that all values in `num` that fall within the range `[start, end]` are excluded from the final count.

### Example Case:
Consider the following input:
```
1
4
1 3
2 10
3 1
3 5
```
- **Constraints**:
  - `k >= 3`
  - `k <= 10`
  - `k != 1` (irrelevant since 1 is not in the range [3, 10])
  - `k != 5` (relevant since 5 is in the range [3, 10])

- **Expected Output**: The valid values for `k` are `3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10`, so the output should be `7`.

- **Actual Output**: The program will incorrectly exclude `5` but will not exclude `1` (which is outside the range), leading to an incorrect count of `8`.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle the "not equal" constraints correctly, leading to incorrect results in certain cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
