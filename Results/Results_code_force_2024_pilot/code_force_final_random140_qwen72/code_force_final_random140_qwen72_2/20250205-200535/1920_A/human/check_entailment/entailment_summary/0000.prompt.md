Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

# Functions with Execution Summary:
import math
import re

n = func_1()
ans = []
alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
for i in range(n):
    ans.append(func_7())
for i in ans:
    print(i)

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(isOne=False):
    if not isOne:
        return int(input())
    else:
        return 1
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts a boolean parameter `isOne`. If `isOne` is `False`, it prompts the user to enter an integer and returns that integer. If `isOne` is `True`, it returns the integer 1. The function modifies the program state by returning either the user-input integer or the integer 1, depending on the value of `isOne`.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(space=True, to_int=True):
    line = input()
    if space:
        items = line.split()
    else:
        items = list(line)
    if to_int:
        return [int(i) for i in items]
    else:
        return items
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` takes two boolean parameters, `space` and `to_int`. It reads a line of input from the user. If `space` is True, it splits the input by spaces; otherwise, it splits the input into individual characters. If `to_int` is True, it converts each item in the resulting list to an integer. The function returns a list of integers if `to_int` is True, or a list of strings/characters if `to_int` is False. The final state of the program is that the function has returned one of these lists based on the input parameters.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3(arr, sym):
    string = ''
    for i in arr:
        string += str(i) + sym
    return string
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3` takes two parameters: `arr`, a list of elements that can be converted to strings, and `sym`, a string. It returns a single string that is the concatenation of the string representations of all elements in `arr`, with each element followed by `sym`, except for the last element which is not followed by `sym`. The original `arr` and `sym` remain unchanged.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4(string, substring):
    indices = []
    index = string.find(substring)
    while index != -1:
        indices.append(index)
        index = string.find(substring, index + 1)
    return indices
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function `func_4` takes two parameters: `string` (a string) and `substring` (a non-empty string). It returns a list of integers representing the starting positions of all occurrences of `substring` within `string`. If `substring` is not found in `string`, the function returns an empty list. After the function concludes, the original `string` and `substring` remain unchanged, and the returned list contains the indices of the starting positions of `substring` in `string`.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5(arr, element):
    return [index for (index, value) in enumerate(arr) if value == element]
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function `func_5` takes two parameters: `arr`, a list of integers, and `element`, an integer. It returns a list of indices where the elements in `arr` are equal to `element`. If no elements in `arr` match `element`, the function returns an empty list. The original list `arr` remains unchanged.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6(arr, index, value):
    for subArray in arr:
        if subArray[index] == value:
            return subArray
    return None
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  The function `func_6` takes three parameters: `arr` (a list of lists), `index` (a non-negative integer), and `value` (an integer). It searches through `arr` to find the first sublist where the element at the specified `index` matches `value`. If such a sublist is found, it is returned. If no sublist meets this condition, the function returns `None`. The function does not modify the input parameters.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7():
    n = int(input())
    start = -1
    end = int(1000000000.0)
    num = []
    for i in range(n):
        (t, v) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        if t == 1:
            if start < v:
                start = v
        if t == 2:
            if end > v:
                end = v
        if t == 3:
            num.append(v)
    count_num = 0
    for i in num:
        if i < start or i > end:
            continue
        else:
            count_num += 1
    return end - start + 1 - count_num if start <= end else 0
''' 

 Output hints for function7:  The function `func_7` processes a series of inputs to determine a specific count and range. It starts by reading an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100), followed by `n` pairs of integers `(t, v)`. Based on the value of `t`, it updates the values of `start` and `end` and collects certain values of `v` into a list `num`. After processing all inputs, it calculates the number of elements in `num` that fall within the range `[start, end]`. Finally, it returns the difference between `end` and `start` plus 1, minus this count, if `start` is less than or equal to `end`; otherwise, it returns 0. The function modifies the values of `start`, `end`, and `num` internally but does not affect any external variables.
