Reasoning:  
The provided program aims to solve the problem of maximizing the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an \(n \times n\) grid. However, the program's approach is flawed. Here's why:

1. **Initial Points**: The program always starts by printing the points (1, 1) and (1, 2). This is a fixed pattern and does not necessarily maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\).

2. **Subsequent Points**: For \(i\) from 3 to \(n + 1\), the program prints the points \((i, i)\). This means it places points along the diagonal starting from (3, 3) to (n+1, n+1). This pattern does not ensure that the Manhattan distances between all pairs of points are maximized.

3. **Maximizing Distinct Distances**: To maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\), the points should be chosen such that the differences in their coordinates cover a wide range of values. Placing points along the diagonal (as the program does) does not achieve this goal effectively.

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - For \(n = 2\), the points (1, 1) and (1, 2) yield \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1\}\), which is correct.
   - For \(n = 3\), the points (1, 1), (1, 2), and (3, 3) yield \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 4\}\), but this is not the maximum possible set. A better arrangement would be (1, 1), (1, 3), and (3, 1), which yields \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\}\).

Given these points, the program does not correctly maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all \(n\).

Correctness: **False**
