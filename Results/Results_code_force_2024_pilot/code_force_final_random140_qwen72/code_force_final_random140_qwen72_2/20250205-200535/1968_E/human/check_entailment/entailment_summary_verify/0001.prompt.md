You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n . You choose n cells (x_1,y_1),
(x_2,y_2),\dots,(x_n,y_n) in the grid n\times n where 1\le x_i\le n and 1\le
y_i\le n .

Let \mathcal{H} be the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of
cells. Your task is to maximize the size of \mathcal{H} . Examples of sets and
their construction are given in the notes.

If there exists more than one solution, you are allowed to output any.

Manhattan distance between cells (x_1,y_1) and (x_2,y_2) equals
|x_1-x_2|+|y_1-y_2| .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 10^3 ).

Output

For each test case, output n points which maximize the size of \mathcal{H} .
It is not necessary to output an empty line at the end of the answer for each
test case.

Note

In the first testcase we have n=2 . One of the possible arrangements is:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/4d7adaa08c9ee5ebf2a0caba13185ac968d6bcd9.png)
The arrangement with cells located in (1,1) and (1,2) . In this case
\mathcal{H}=\\{|1-1|+|1-1|,|1-1|+|2-2|,|1-1|+|1-2|\\}=\\{0,0,1\\}=\\{0,1\\} .
Hence, the size of \mathcal{H} is 2 . It can be shown that it is the greatest
possible answer.

In the second testcase we have n=3 . The optimal arrangement is:

The arrangement with cells located in (2,1) , (2,3) and (3,1) .

\mathcal{H}
=\\{|2-2|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|3-3|,|3-3|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|1-3|,|2-3|+|1-1|,|2-3|+|3-1|\\}
=\\{0,0,0,2,1,3\\} =\\{0,1,2,3\\} .

For n=4 a possible arrangement is:

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(0, int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        print(1, 1)
        print(1, 2)
        for i in range(3, n + 2):
            print(i, i)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 50. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` (2 <= n <= 10^3). It then prints a series of pairs of integers. Specifically, it prints (1, 1), (1, 2), and for each integer `i` from 3 to `n + 1`, it prints (i, i). The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the console. After the function concludes, the input variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and the program state reflects the printed output for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to place `n` points in an `n x n` grid such that the number of unique Manhattan distances between any two points is maximized.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n`.
   - It prints the points `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)` for the first two points.
   - For the remaining points, it prints `(i, i)` for `i` ranging from 3 to `n + 1`.

3. **Evaluation of the Solution**:
   - The first two points `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)` are fixed and will always be part of the solution.
   - The remaining points are placed along the diagonal starting from `(3, 3)` to `(n+1, n+1)`.
   - This approach ensures that the points are spread out diagonally, which helps in maximizing the number of unique Manhattan distances.

4. **Checking for Unique Distances**:
   - The points `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)` will have a Manhattan distance of 1.
   - The points `(1, 1)` and `(i, i)` for `i >= 3` will have a Manhattan distance of `i - 1 + i - 1 = 2(i - 1)`.
   - The points `(1, 2)` and `(i, i)` for `i >= 3` will have a Manhattan distance of `i - 1 + i - 2 = 2i - 3`.
   - The points `(i, i)` and `(j, j)` for `i < j` will have a Manhattan distance of `|i - j| + |i - j| = 2|i - j|`.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program ensures that the points are placed in a way that maximizes the number of unique Manhattan distances.
   - However, the program has a small issue: it prints one extra point beyond the grid size `n`. Specifically, it prints up to `(n+1, n+1)`, which is outside the `n x n` grid.

Given the above reasoning, the program is almost correct but has a minor issue with the range of the loop. The loop should run from 3 to `n + 1` instead of `n + 2`.
