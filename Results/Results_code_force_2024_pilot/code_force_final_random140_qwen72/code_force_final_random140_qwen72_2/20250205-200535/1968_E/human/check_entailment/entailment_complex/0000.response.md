Reasoning:  
The program aims to maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an \(n \times n\) grid. The program's logic is as follows:

1. For each test case, it reads an integer \(n\).
2. It prints the coordinates (1, 1) and (1, 2).
3. It then prints the coordinates \((i, i)\) for \(i\) ranging from 3 to \(n + 1\).

However, this approach has a few issues:

- The coordinates (1, 1) and (1, 2) are always printed, which might not contribute to maximizing the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all \(n\).
- The loop that prints \((i, i)\) for \(i\) from 3 to \(n + 1\) will print \(n - 1\) additional points, but these points are all on the diagonal, which may not maximize the distinct Manhattan distances.

To maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\), the points should be chosen to cover a wide range of distances. A better approach would be to place points in a way that maximizes the variety of distances, such as placing points at the corners and along the edges of the grid.

Given the current implementation, the program does not necessarily maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all \(n\). Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
