You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n . You choose n cells (x_1,y_1),
(x_2,y_2),\dots,(x_n,y_n) in the grid n\times n where 1\le x_i\le n and 1\le
y_i\le n .

Let \mathcal{H} be the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of
cells. Your task is to maximize the size of \mathcal{H} . Examples of sets and
their construction are given in the notes.

If there exists more than one solution, you are allowed to output any.

Manhattan distance between cells (x_1,y_1) and (x_2,y_2) equals
|x_1-x_2|+|y_1-y_2| .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 10^3 ).

Output

For each test case, output n points which maximize the size of \mathcal{H} .
It is not necessary to output an empty line at the end of the answer for each
test case.

Note

In the first testcase we have n=2 . One of the possible arrangements is:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/4d7adaa08c9ee5ebf2a0caba13185ac968d6bcd9.png)
The arrangement with cells located in (1,1) and (1,2) . In this case
\mathcal{H}=\\{|1-1|+|1-1|,|1-1|+|2-2|,|1-1|+|1-2|\\}=\\{0,0,1\\}=\\{0,1\\} .
Hence, the size of \mathcal{H} is 2 . It can be shown that it is the greatest
possible answer.

In the second testcase we have n=3 . The optimal arrangement is:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/52d127e3dbe0141bb58dbdf4158586772a208758.png)
The arrangement with cells located in (2,1) , (2,3) and (3,1) .

\mathcal{H}
=\\{|2-2|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|3-3|,|3-3|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|1-3|,|2-3|+|1-1|,|2-3|+|3-1|\\}
=\\{0,0,0,2,1,3\\} =\\{0,1,2,3\\} .

For n=4 a possible arrangement is:

For n=5 a possible arrangement is:

For n=6 a possible arrangement is:

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(0, int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        print(1, 1)
        print(1, 2)
        for i in range(3, n + 2):
            print(i, i)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 50. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` (2 <= n <= 10^3). It then prints a series of pairs of integers. Specifically, it prints (1, 1), (1, 2), and for each integer `i` from 3 to `n + 1`, it prints (i, i). The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the console. After the function concludes, the input variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and the program state reflects the printed output for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not always generate a set of points that maximizes the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances (\(\mathcal{H}\)) for every \(n\). 

For example, consider \(n = 3\). The program outputs:
```
1 1
1 2
2 2
```
However, this set of points does not maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\). The Manhattan distances between these points are:
- Between (1, 1) and (1, 2): \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\)
- Between (1, 1) and (2, 2): \(|1-2| + |1-2| = 2\)
- Between (1, 2) and (2, 2): \(|1-2| + |2-2| = 1\)

The set of distinct Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{1, 2\}\), which has a size of 2. However, a better arrangement could be:
```
1 1
1 3
3 1
```
The Manhattan distances between these points are:
- Between (1, 1) and (1, 3): \(|1-1| + |1-3| = 2\)
- Between (1, 1) and (3, 1): \(|1-3| + |1-1| = 2\)
- Between (1, 3) and (3, 1): \(|1-3| + |3-1| = 4\)

The set of distinct Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{2, 4\}\), which has a size of 2. However, the maximum possible size for \(n = 3\) is 3, which can be achieved with the arrangement:
```
2 1
2 3
3 1
```
The Manhattan distances between these points are:
- Between (2, 1) and (2, 3): \(|2-2| + |1-3| = 2\)
- Between (2, 1) and (3, 1): \(|2-3| + |1-1| = 1\)
- Between (2, 3) and (3, 1): \(|2-3| + |3-1| = 3\)

The set of distinct Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{1, 2, 3\}\), which has a size of 3.

Thus, the program does not always generate the optimal set of points for maximizing the size of \(\mathcal{H}\). Therefore, the program is incorrect.
