The value of `n` is updated to the new input value, which is specified to be greater than `n + 3`. The variable `i` was initially `n + 3`, but since `n` has now changed, `i` is no longer necessarily `n + 3`. However, the initial condition that `int(input())` must be greater than `n + 3` ensures that the new value of `n` is indeed greater than the original value of `i`.

Output State: **`i` is the original `n + 3`, `n` is an input integer greater than the original `n + 3`**
