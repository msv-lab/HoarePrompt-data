The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters within its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function deals with a number of test cases `t` (where 1 <= t <= 50) and for each test case, an integer `n` (where 2 <= n <= 10^3). The function's output is not specified in the prompt, but typically in such scenarios, the function would process each test case and return a result for each `n`.

Given the lack of explicit parameters in the function signature and the typical behavior of functions dealing with multiple test cases, the functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 50), and for each test case, an integer `n` is provided (2 <= n <= 10^3). The function returns a result for each test case based on the value of `n`.**
