The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop starts with `i` being 3 and continues as long as `i` is less than `n + 2`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 (as per the behavior of the `range` function), making `i` equal to 4. Additionally, for the loop to continue, `n` must still be such that `i` is less than `n + 2`. Therefore, `n` must be at least 4 (since 4 < 4 + 2).

State: **`i` is 4, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4**
