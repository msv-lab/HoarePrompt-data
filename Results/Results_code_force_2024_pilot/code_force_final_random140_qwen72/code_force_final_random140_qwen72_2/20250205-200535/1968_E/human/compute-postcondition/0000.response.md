To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and conditions in the loop head. The loop head contains the variable `i` and the result of `int(input())`.

1. **Variable `i`:** This is the loop iterator and is automatically initialized to 0 by the `range` function.
2. **Result of `int(input())`:** This determines the number of iterations the loop will run. For the loop to execute at least once, this value must be greater than 0.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50.
- For each of the `t` test cases, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3.

However, the loop head does not directly use `t` or `n`. Instead, it uses the result of `int(input())`, which should be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the input provided is a positive integer.

State: **`i` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
