Initial State: `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The variable `i` is explicitly stated to be 0.
2. The variable `n` is mentioned but not used in the print statement, so it does not affect the output.
3. The print statement `print(i, i)` will print the value of `i` twice.

Given that `i` is 0, the print statement will output two zeros.

Output: **0 0**
