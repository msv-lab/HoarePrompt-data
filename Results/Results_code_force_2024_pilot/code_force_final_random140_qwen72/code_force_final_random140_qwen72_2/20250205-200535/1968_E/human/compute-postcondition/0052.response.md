Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t < 48\). This means `t` can be any integer from 0 to 47.
- For each of the `t` test cases:
  - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^3\) and is set to the input value.
  - If `n` is 3, no changes are made.
  - Otherwise, if `n` is not 3, `i` is set to `n - 2`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(2, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is inside a loop that runs `t` times.
- Each time the loop runs, it prints the number 2 followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

### Explanation:
- Regardless of the value of `n` (whether it is 3 or not), the `print` statement will always execute and print the number 2 followed by a space.
- The value of `t` determines how many times this `print` statement will execute, but each execution will always print "2 ".

### Final Output:
- Since the `print` statement is executed `t` times, the output will be "2 " repeated `t` times.

Output: **2 2 2 ... (repeated t times)**

This means the output will be a sequence of "2 " repeated `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
