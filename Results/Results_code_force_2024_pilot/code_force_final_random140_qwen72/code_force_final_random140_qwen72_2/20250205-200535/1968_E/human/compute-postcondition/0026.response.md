To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the conditions specified in the loop head. The loop is defined as:

```python
for i in range(3, n + 2):
```

This means the loop will iterate over values of `i` starting from 3 up to but not including `n + 2`. For the loop to execute at least once, the start value (3) must be less than the stop value (`n + 2`). Therefore, `n + 2` must be greater than 3.

Let's break down the given state and the necessary adjustments:

- **Given State**: `i` is the original `n + 3`, `n` is an input integer greater than the original `n + 3`.
- **Loop Condition**: `3 < n + 2`.

Since `n` is already stated to be greater than `n + 3`, this implies that `n` is a very large positive number. However, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 2 more than 3 (i.e., `n > 1`).

Given that `i` is not used in the loop head, we don't need to adjust `i`. We only need to ensure that `n` is set correctly.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:

State: **`i` is the original `n + 3`, `n` must be greater than 1**
