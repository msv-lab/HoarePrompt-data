Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t < 48\), `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is `n - 2`.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: This variable remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`n`**: The value of `n` must be greater than or equal to 3 for the loop to execute at least once. The loop will continue to execute until `i` reaches `n - 2`.
- **`i`**: After the loop has completed all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n - 2`, which is the last value it takes before the loop terminates. This is because the loop iterates from `1` to `n - 2` (inclusive).

Thus, the final state of the loop is when `i` has reached `n - 2`, and the loop has executed all its iterations.
