The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the result of `int(input())`, which we can consider as a fixed value once the loop starts. The loop condition is `i` being less than this fixed value.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n + 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 (as per the typical behavior of a for loop), making it `n + 3`. However, since `i` is already `n + 2` and the loop is based on `i` being less than the value of `int(input())`, for the loop to execute again, the value of `int(input())` must be greater than `n + 2`.

Since `n` remains unchanged, and `i` is incremented by 1 in the next iteration, the new state should reflect that `i` is now `n + 3` and the condition for the loop to continue is that `int(input())` must be greater than `n + 3`.

State: **`i` is `n + 3`, `n` remains unchanged, `int(input())` must be greater than `n + 3`**
