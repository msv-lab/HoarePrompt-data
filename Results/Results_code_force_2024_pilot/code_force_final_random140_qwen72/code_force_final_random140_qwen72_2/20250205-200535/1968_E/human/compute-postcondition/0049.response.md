Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 50, inclusive, `i` is `t - 1`, and `n` is a new input integer. If `n` is 3, `j` remains undefined. If `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `j` is set to `n + 1`. Otherwise, `j` remains undefined.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 50.
- After the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be `t - 1` because the loop index `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration.
- For each iteration, `n` is a new input integer provided by the user.
- If `n` is 3, no additional changes are made to `j`.
- If `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `j` is set to `n + 1` after the inner loop completes.
- If `n` is less than 3, `j` remains undefined.
- The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was defined before the loop started.
