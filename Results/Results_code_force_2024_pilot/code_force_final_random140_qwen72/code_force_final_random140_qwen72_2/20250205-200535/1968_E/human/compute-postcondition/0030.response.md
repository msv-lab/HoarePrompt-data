To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- State at the end of the previous iteration: `i` is `n + 2`, `n` must be greater than 1.
- Loop statement: `for i in range(3, n + 2):`

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.
2. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n + 2`.
3. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n + 2`.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n + 2`.
- Since `i` is currently `n + 2`, the loop condition `i < n + 2` is not satisfied, and the loop would terminate.
- To adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `i` is less than `n + 2`.

### Adjustments:
- The value of `i` should be set to the next value in the range, which is `n + 1`.
- The value of `n` must remain such that `n + 2` is still greater than `i`.

### Final State:
- `i` is `n + 1`.
- `n` must be greater than 1.

### Conclusion:
State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 1**
