Let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer between 1 and 50.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` is a new input integer.
   - If `n` is 3, `j` remains undefined.
   - If `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `j` is set to `n + 1`.
   - Otherwise, `j` remains undefined.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('2 4')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is printing a fixed string `'2 4'`.
   - The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `j` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the `print` statement is explicitly printing a string literal.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will always print the string `'2 4'` regardless of the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, or `j`.

Output: **2 4**
