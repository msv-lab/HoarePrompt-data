The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop iterates from `1` to `n-2` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 2, and `n` must still be greater than 2 (or equivalently, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3).

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t < 48\), `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 2**
