Output State: **`i` is `t`, and `n` remains unchanged for each test case.**

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will have reached the value of `t`, which is the total number of test cases. The variable `n` for each test case remains unchanged because the loop does not modify the value of `n` within its body; it only prints values based on `n`. Each iteration of the outer loop processes one test case, and the inner loop prints a sequence of numbers based on the value of `n` for that test case. Once all `t` test cases have been processed, the loop terminates with `i` equal to `t`.
