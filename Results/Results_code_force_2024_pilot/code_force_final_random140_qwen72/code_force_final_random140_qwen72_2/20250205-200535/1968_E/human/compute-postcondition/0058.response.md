Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t < 48\).
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.
- `i` is 2.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print(i, end=' ')
```

This statement will print the value of `i` followed by a space (since `end=' '` is specified).

Given that `i` is explicitly defined as 2, the output of the `print` statement will be:

Output: **2 **
