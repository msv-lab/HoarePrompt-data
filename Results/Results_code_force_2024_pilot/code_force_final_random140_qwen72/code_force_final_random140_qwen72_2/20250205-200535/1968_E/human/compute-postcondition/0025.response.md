The given Python code snippet is:

```python
print(1, 2)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any variables or objects from the initial state.
- The `print` statement simply outputs the numbers 1 and 2, separated by a space.

### Initial State:
- `i` is the original `n + 3`.
- `n` is an input integer greater than the original `n + 3`.

### Explanation:
- The initial state provides information about the variables `i` and `n`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement.
- The `print` statement only outputs the constants 1 and 2.

### Output:
Output: **1 2**
