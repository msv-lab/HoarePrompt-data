Based on the initial state:

- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 50.
- `i` is 2.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 4.
- `j` is 4.

The print statement is:
```python
print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))
```

Let's break it down step by step:

1. `j` is explicitly given as 4.
2. The `print` statement converts `j` to a string using `str(j)`, which results in the string `'4'`.
3. The `+` operator concatenates the two strings `'4'` and `'4'` with a space in between, resulting in the string `'4 4'`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be:
Output: **4 4**
