To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given State:
- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 50.
- `i` is 2.
- `n` is a new input integer.
- If `n` is 3, `j` remains undefined.
- If `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `j` is set to `n + 1`.
- Otherwise, `j` remains undefined.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(4, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The variables in the loop head are `j`, `4`, and `n`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if the range `range(4, n + 1)` is non-empty. This means `n + 1` must be greater than 4, or equivalently, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`n`**: For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4.
- **`j`**: The variable `j` will be set to the values from 4 to `n` (inclusive) during the loop iterations. However, before the loop starts, `j` is not defined in the initial state. We need to ensure that `j` is set to 4 for the first iteration.

### Final State:
- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 50 (unchanged).
- `i` is 2 (unchanged).
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 4.
- `j` is set to 4 for the first iteration.

### State:
**`t` is an input integer between 1 and 50, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `j` is 4**
