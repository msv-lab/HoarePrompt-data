Output State: **`i` is `n + 2`, `n` remains unchanged.**

### Explanation:
- The loop starts with `i` being initialized to 3 and runs as long as `i` is less than `n + 2`.
- In each iteration, the value of `i` is printed twice, but `i` itself is not modified within the loop body.
- The loop increments `i` automatically by 1 after each iteration until `i` reaches `n + 2`.
- After the loop finishes, `i` will be `n + 2` because the loop stops when `i` is no longer less than `n + 2`.
- The value of `n` remains unchanged throughout the loop execution.

Thus, the final output state is that `i` is `n + 2` and `n` remains the same as it was initially.
