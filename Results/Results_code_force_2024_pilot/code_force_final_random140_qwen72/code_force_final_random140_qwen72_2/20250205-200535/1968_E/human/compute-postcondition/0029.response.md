Initial State: `i` is `n + 2`, `n` must be greater than 1.

Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. The variable `i` is defined as `n + 2`.
2. The variable `n` is specified to be greater than 1.
3. The `print` statement will print the value of `i` twice.

Since `n` is greater than 1, let's denote `n` as some integer greater than 1. For example, if `n = 3`, then `i` would be `3 + 2 = 5`.

However, since the exact value of `n` is not specified, we can only describe `i` in terms of `n`.

Output: **i, i (where i is n + 2 and n is an integer greater than 1)**
