The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` being less than `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 5 and `n` must be greater than or equal to 5. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 6, and `n` must still be greater than or equal to 6 for the loop condition to hold true.

State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 50, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 6, `j` is 6**
