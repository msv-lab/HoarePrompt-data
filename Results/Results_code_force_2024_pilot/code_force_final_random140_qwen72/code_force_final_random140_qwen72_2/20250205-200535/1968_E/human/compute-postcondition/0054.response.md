To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t < 48\).
- For each of the `t` test cases, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^3\) and is set to the input value.
- If `n` is 3, no changes are made.
- Otherwise, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, and `i` is set to `n - 2`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, n - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if the range `range(1, n - 1)` is non-empty. This means that `n - 1` must be greater than 1, which implies `n > 2`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`n`**: For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 2.
- **`i`**: The variable `i` is initialized by the loop itself and will start from 1.

### Conclusion:
- The state of `t` and the condition for `n` being 3 or greater are already given and do not need adjustment.
- The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 2, and `i` will be initialized by the loop.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t < 48\), `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 1 (initialized by the loop)**.
