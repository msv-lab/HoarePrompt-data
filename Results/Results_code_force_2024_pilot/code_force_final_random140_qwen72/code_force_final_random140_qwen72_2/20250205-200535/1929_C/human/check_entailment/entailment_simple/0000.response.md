Reasoning:  
To determine the correctness of the program, we need to verify if the logic implemented matches the problem requirements and if it correctly determines whether Sasha can guarantee winning any number of coins.

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading `k`, `x`, and `a`.

2. **Logic for Determining the Result**:
   - The variable `s` is initialized to 1. This represents the minimum number of coins Sasha needs to start with to ensure he can always win more coins.
   - The inner loop runs `x` times, simulating the worst-case scenario where Sasha loses `x` times in a row. For each loss, the program calculates the minimum number of coins Sasha needs to have to still be able to continue betting.
   - The expression `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` is used to update `s`. This expression ensures that after `x` consecutive losses, Sasha still has enough coins to place a bet that can potentially recover his losses and gain more coins.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints "YES" if `a` (the initial number of coins Sasha has) is greater than or equal to `s` (the calculated minimum number of coins needed).
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO".

4. **Verification**:
   - The logic of the program aligns with the problem statement. It correctly simulates the worst-case scenario and calculates the minimum number of coins needed to ensure Sasha can always win more coins.
   - The program handles all edge cases and constraints specified in the problem description.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
