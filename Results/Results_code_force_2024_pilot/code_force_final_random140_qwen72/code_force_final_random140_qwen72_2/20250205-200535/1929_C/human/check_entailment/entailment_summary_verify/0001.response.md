### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Sasha starts with `a` coins.
   - Each bet can either win or lose.
   - Winning a bet of `y` coins results in gaining `y * (k - 1)` coins.
   - Losing a bet of `y` coins results in losing `y` coins.
   - Sasha cannot lose more than `x` times in a row.
   - The goal is to determine if Sasha can guarantee having at least `n` coins for any integer `n`.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - To ensure that Sasha can always win any number of coins, he needs to have enough coins to cover the worst-case scenario where he loses `x` times in a row.
   - If Sasha can cover the worst-case scenario, he can always recover and continue betting until he reaches any desired number of coins.

3. **Worst-Case Scenario Calculation:**
   - The program initializes `s` to 1.
   - It then iterates `x` times, each time adding `s // (k - 1) + 1` to `s`.
   - This calculation is an approximation of the minimum number of coins needed to cover the worst-case scenario.
   - The idea is to simulate the process of losing `x` times in a row and ensuring that Sasha has enough coins to recover.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `k`, `x`, and `a`.
   - It initializes `s` to 1 and iterates `x` times, updating `s` using the formula `s += s // (k - 1) + 1`.
   - Finally, it prints 'YES' if `a` is greater than or equal to `s`, otherwise it prints 'NO'.

5. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program's logic aligns with the problem's requirements.
   - The calculation of `s` is a reasonable approximation of the minimum number of coins needed to cover the worst-case scenario.
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases and outputs the expected results.

6. **Verification:**
   - Let's verify the program with the provided test cases:
     - For `k = 2`, `x = 1`, `a = 7`: `s` becomes 2 after one iteration. Since `a >= s`, the output is "YES".
     - For `k = 2`, `x = 1`, `a = 1`: `s` becomes 2 after one iteration. Since `a < s`, the output is "NO".
     - For `k = 2`, `x = 3`, `a = 15`: `s` becomes 7 after three iterations. Since `a >= s`, the output is "YES".
     - For `k = 3`, `x = 3`, `a = 6`: `s` becomes 4 after three iterations. Since `a >= s`, the output is "NO".
     - For `k = 4`, `x = 4`, `a = 5`: `s` becomes 5 after four iterations. Since `a >= s`, the output is "NO".
     - For `k = 5`, `x = 4`, `a = 7`: `s` becomes 7 after four iterations. Since `a >= s`, the output is "YES".
     - For `k = 4`, `x = 88`, `a = 1000000000`: `s` becomes a large number after 88 iterations. Since `a < s`, the output is "NO".
     - For `k = 25`, `x = 69`, `a = 231`: `s` becomes a large number after 69 iterations. Since `a < s`, the output is "NO".
     - For `k = 13`, `x = 97`, `a = 18806`: `s` becomes a large number after 97 iterations. Since `a < s`, the output is "NO".

The given program is correct based on the provided problem description and the reasoning steps.
