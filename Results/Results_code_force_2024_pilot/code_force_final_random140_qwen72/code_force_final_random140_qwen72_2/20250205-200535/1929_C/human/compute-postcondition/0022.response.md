To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `k` is an input integer.
- `x` is an input integer.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `s` is the result of the expression `s = 1 + sum((s // (k - 1) + 1) for _ in range(x))`.
- `i` is `x`.

### Expression Breakdown:
1. **Initialization of `s`:**
   - `s` starts with an initial value of 1.
   - The expression inside the `sum` function is `(s // (k - 1) + 1)` for each iteration from 0 to `x-1`.

2. **Sum Calculation:**
   - For each iteration, `s` is updated by adding the result of `(s // (k - 1) + 1)` to the current value of `s`.
   - This means `s` grows in a cumulative manner based on the formula.

3. **Final Value of `s`:**
   - After `x` iterations, `s` will have a final value that depends on `k` and `x`.

### Print Statement:
- The print statement checks if `a` is greater than or equal to `s`.
- If `a >= s`, it prints 'YES'.
- Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

### Example Calculation:
Let's consider an example to illustrate the calculation:
- Suppose `k = 3`, `x = 2`, and `a = 5`.

1. **Initial `s` value:**
   - `s = 1`

2. **First Iteration:**
   - `s = 1 + (1 // (3 - 1) + 1) = 1 + (1 // 2 + 1) = 1 + (0 + 1) = 2`

3. **Second Iteration:**
   - `s = 2 + (2 // (3 - 1) + 1) = 2 + (2 // 2 + 1) = 2 + (1 + 1) = 4`

4. **Final `s` value:**
   - `s = 4`

5. **Comparison:**
   - `a = 5` and `s = 4`
   - Since `a >= s`, the print statement will output 'YES'.

### General Case:
- The value of `s` will depend on the values of `k` and `x`.
- The print statement will output 'YES' if `a` is greater than or equal to the final value of `s`, otherwise it will output 'NO'.

### Final Output:
Output: **'YES' if a >= s else 'NO' (where s is the result of the expression 1 + sum((s // (k - 1) + 1) for _ in range(x)), and a is the input integer)**
