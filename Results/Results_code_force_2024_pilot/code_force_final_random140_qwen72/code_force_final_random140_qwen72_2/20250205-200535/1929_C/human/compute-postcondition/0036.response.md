The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships described, it is implied that the function should accept parameters related to the test cases and their specific conditions. The function likely processes a series of test cases, each defined by the parameters `k`, `x`, and `a`, and returns a result for each test case.

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers where 2 ≤ k ≤ 30, 1 ≤ x ≤ 100, and 1 ≤ a ≤ 10^9.

The function's output is not explicitly described, but it can be inferred that the function processes each test case and returns a result based on the values of `k`, `x`, and `a`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts integers `k`, `x`, and `a` within specified ranges. It processes each test case and returns a result for each test case based on the values of `k`, `x`, and `a`.**
