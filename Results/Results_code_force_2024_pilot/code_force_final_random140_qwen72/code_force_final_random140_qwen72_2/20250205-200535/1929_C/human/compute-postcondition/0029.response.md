The value of `s` is updated by adding the result of `s // (k - 1) + 1` to its current value. Initially, `s` is 2. The expression `s // (k - 1)` performs integer division of `s` by `(k - 1)`, and then 1 is added to the result. This sum is then added to the current value of `s`.

Let's break down the calculation:
- `s` starts as 2.
- `s // (k - 1)` depends on the value of `k`. Since `k` is an input integer, let's denote the result of `s // (k - 1)` as `q`.
- The new value of `s` will be `2 + q + 1`.

Since `s` is initially 2, the new value of `s` will be `3 + q`, where `q` is the integer division of 2 by `(k - 1)`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer and must be greater than 1, `a` is an input integer, `s` is 3 + (2 // (k - 1)), `i` is 1**.
