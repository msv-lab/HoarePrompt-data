The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `x` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again. Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration, `i` becomes 2. For the loop to execute again, `x` must still be greater than `i`, which means `x` must be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `k` is an integer, `x` must be greater than 2, `a` is an integer, `s` is `3 + (2 // (k - 1))`, `i` is 2**
