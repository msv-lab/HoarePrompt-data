Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `s` is 1 + 1 + (1 // (k - 1)), `i` is 0**

Explanation:
- The initial value of `s` is 1.
- The expression `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` updates the value of `s`.
- `s // (k - 1)` performs integer division of `s` by `(k - 1)`. Since `s` is initially 1, this results in `1 // (k - 1)`, which is 0 for any `k` greater than 1.
- Adding 1 to this result gives `1 + 0 + 1`, which simplifies to `2`.
- Therefore, `s` is updated to `2`.
- The values of `t`, `k`, `x`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged.
