The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `k`, `x`, and `a`. It then calculates a value `s` by repeatedly updating `s` using the formula `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` for `x` iterations, starting with `s = 1`. Finally, it prints 'YES' if `a` is greater than or equal to `s`, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value; it only outputs the results for each test case.
