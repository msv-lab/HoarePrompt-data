Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to verify if it correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of times Bob can win, given the constraints and the problem description.

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually. This part is correct as it matches the problem description.

2. **Counting the Numbers**: For each test case, the program reads four integers `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`, which represent the counts of the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. This is also correct according to the problem description.

3. **Winning Condition Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the number of pairs of each type of number that can be removed (`a // 2`, `b // 2`, `c // 2`, `d // 2`). This is because removing pairs of numbers does not change the XOR result.
   - It then adds a condition to check if the remaining numbers (after removing pairs) can form a configuration where Bob wins. Specifically, it checks if the sum of the remainders of `a`, `b`, and `c` modulo 2 equals 3. This is because if there are three odd counts left, the XOR of these three numbers will be zero, allowing Bob to win.

4. **Output**: The program prints the calculated value for each test case, which should be the maximum number of times Bob can win.

Let's break down the logic:
- `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2` counts the number of pairs that can be removed without affecting the XOR result.
- `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 3 == 3)` checks if the remaining numbers can form a configuration where Bob wins. This is correct because if there are three odd counts left, the XOR of these three numbers will be zero.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program appears to correctly solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
