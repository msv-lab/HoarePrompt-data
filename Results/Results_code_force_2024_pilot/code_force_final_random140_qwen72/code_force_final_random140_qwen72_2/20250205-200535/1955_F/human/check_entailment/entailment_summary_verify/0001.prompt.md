You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b, c, d) = map(int, input().split())
        print(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 3 == 3))



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, it reads four integers `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` (0 <= p_i <= 200), representing counts of the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 in a sequence. It then calculates and prints a value based on these inputs, which is the sum of the integer divisions of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` by 2, plus 1 if the sum of their remainders when divided by 2 and 3 equals 3. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes numbers optimally.
   - Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all remaining numbers is zero.
   - The numbers in the sequence are 1, 2, 3, and 4, and their counts are given as \( p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 \).

2. **Bitwise XOR Properties:**
   - The XOR of a set of numbers is zero if and only if the count of each bit position that is set to 1 is even.
   - For the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4:
     - 1 (binary: 001)
     - 2 (binary: 010)
     - 3 (binary: 011)
     - 4 (binary: 100)

3. **Optimal Removal Strategy:**
   - To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should remove numbers in such a way that the remaining sequence's XOR is zero.
   - Removing pairs of numbers that contribute to the same bit positions helps achieve this.

4. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.
   - It calculates the number of pairs of each type of number that can be removed.
   - It adds an additional term to account for the case where the sum of the remainders of the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s is exactly 3.

5. **Explanation of the Additional Term:**
   - The term `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 3 == 3)` checks if the sum of the remainders of the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s is exactly 3.
   - If this condition is true, it means that removing one more number will make the XOR zero, thus allowing Bob to win one more time.

6. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly calculates the number of pairs of each type of number that can be removed.
   - The additional term ensures that the final count of Bob's wins is maximized by considering the remainder condition.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct in its approach to solving the problem. It correctly calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by removing numbers optimally.
