Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. The key issue is in the final condition `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 3 == 3)`, which incorrectly handles the parity and distribution of the numbers. The correct approach should consider the total count of odd and even numbers and how their removal affects the XOR result.

A more accurate approach would involve calculating the total number of odd and even numbers and then determining how many optimal removals can be made to maximize Bob's wins. The current implementation does not accurately reflect this logic.
