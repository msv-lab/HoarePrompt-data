The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the result of `int(input())`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and the result of `int(input())`. If `i` is less than `int(input())`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `int(input())` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `int(input())` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `p_i` are integers such that 0 <= p_i <= 200, `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers provided by the user, and `int(input())` must be greater than 1**
