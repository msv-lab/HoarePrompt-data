The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and the context, it is implied that the function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts four integers `p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4` representing the counts of the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 in a sequence, respectively. The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the given constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts four integers `p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4` (0 <= p_i <= 200) representing the counts of the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 in a sequence. The function returns a result based on the processing of these inputs.**
