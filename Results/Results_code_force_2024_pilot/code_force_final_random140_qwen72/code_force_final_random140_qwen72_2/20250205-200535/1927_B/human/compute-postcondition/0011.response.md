The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` is `k + 1`
- `n` must be greater than `k + 1`

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `k + 2`. For the loop to continue executing, `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`, which means `n` must be greater than `k + 2`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `a` is a list of n integers where each `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ a_i < n, `sam` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz', `a_map` is a dictionary mapping each integer from 0 to n-1 to 0 except `a_map[a[i]]` which is now 2, `res` is 'ab', `beg` is `a_map[a[k + 1]]`, `i` is `k + 2`, `n` must be greater than `k + 2`**
