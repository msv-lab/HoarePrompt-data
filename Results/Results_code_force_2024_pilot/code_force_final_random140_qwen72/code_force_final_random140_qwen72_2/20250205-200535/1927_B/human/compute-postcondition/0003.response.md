To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and conditions present in the loop head. The loop head contains the variable `i` and the range defined by `n`.

1. **Variable `i`**: This variable is initialized by the loop itself and does not need to be adjusted manually.
2. **Variable `n`**: The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. Since the state already specifies that `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), this condition is already satisfied.

Given that the loop will execute as long as `n` is a positive integer, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute. The other variables (`a`, `sam`, `a_map`, and `res`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state remains as follows:

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `a` is a list of n integers where each a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_i < n, `sam` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz', `a_map` is a dictionary mapping each integer from 0 to n-1 to 0, `res` is an empty string**
