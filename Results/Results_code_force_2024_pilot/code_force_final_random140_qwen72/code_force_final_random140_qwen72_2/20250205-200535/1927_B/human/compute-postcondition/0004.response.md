The code snippet `beg = a_map[a[i]]` retrieves the value associated with the key `a[i]` from the dictionary `a_map` and assigns it to the variable `beg`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5)
- `a` is a list of n integers where each `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ a_i < n
- `sam` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz'
- `a_map` is a dictionary mapping each integer from 0 to n-1 to 0
- `res` is an empty string

After executing the code snippet:
- `beg` is assigned the value `0` because `a_map` maps every integer from 0 to n-1 to 0, and `a[i]` is an integer within this range.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `a` is a list of n integers where each `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ a_i < n, `sam` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz', `a_map` is a dictionary mapping each integer from 0 to n-1 to 0, `res` is an empty string, `beg` is 0.**
