The code snippet `a_map[a[i]] += 1` increments the value associated with the key `a[i]` in the dictionary `a_map` by 1. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5)
- `a` is a list of n integers where each `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ a_i < n
- `sam` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz'
- `a_map` is a dictionary mapping each integer from 0 to n-1 to 0
- `res` is 'a'
- `beg` is 0

After executing the code snippet:
- The value of `a_map[a[i]]` is incremented by 1.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `a` is a list of n integers where each `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ a_i < n, `sam` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz', `a_map` is a dictionary mapping each integer from 0 to n-1 to 0 except `a_map[a[i]]` which is now 1, `res` is 'a', `beg` is 0.**
