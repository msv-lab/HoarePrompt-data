Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `a` is a list of n integers where each `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ a_i < n, `sam` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz', `a_map` is a dictionary mapping each integer from 0 to n-1 to 0 except `a_map[a[i]]` which is now 2, `res` is 'ab', `beg` is `a_map[a[k + 2]]`, `i` is `k + 2`, `n` must be greater than `k + 2`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `beg` is updated to `a_map[a[i]]`.
- Since `i` is `k + 2`, `beg` is now `a_map[a[k + 2]]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
