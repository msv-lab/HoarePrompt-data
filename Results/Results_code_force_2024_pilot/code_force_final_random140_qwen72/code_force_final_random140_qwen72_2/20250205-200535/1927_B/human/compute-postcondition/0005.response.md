To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet:

```python
res += sam[a_map[a[i]] % 27]
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5).
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ a_i < n.
   - `sam` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz'.
   - `a_map` is a dictionary mapping each integer from 0 to n-1 to 0.
   - `res` is an empty string.
   - `beg` is 0.

2. **Code Execution:**
   - The code snippet `res += sam[a_map[a[i]] % 27]` appends a character to the string `res`.
   - `a_map[a[i]]` retrieves the value associated with the key `a[i]` from the dictionary `a_map`.
   - Since `a_map` maps each integer from 0 to n-1 to 0, `a_map[a[i]]` will always be 0.
   - `0 % 27` is 0.
   - `sam[0]` is the first character of the string `sam`, which is 'a'.
   - Therefore, `res` is updated to include the character 'a'.

3. **Updated State:**
   - `res` is now 'a'.
   - All other variables remain unchanged.

### Output State:
**`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `a` is a list of n integers where each `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ a_i < n, `sam` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz', `a_map` is a dictionary mapping each integer from 0 to n-1 to 0, `res` is 'a', `beg` is 0.**
