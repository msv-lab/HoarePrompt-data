The value of `beg` is updated to the value of `a_map[a[i]]`. Since `i` is `k + 1`, the value of `beg` will be the value of `a_map[a[k + 1]]`. According to the initial state, `a_map` maps each integer from 0 to n-1 to 0, except for the values in the list `a` which map to 1. Therefore, `beg` will be 1 if `a[k + 1]` is in the list `a`, and 0 otherwise.

The rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `a` is a list of n integers where each `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ a_i < n, `sam` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz', `a_map` is a dictionary mapping each integer from 0 to n-1 to 0 except `a_map[a[i]]` which is now 1, `res` is 'a', `beg` is `a_map[a[k + 1]]`, `i` is `k + 1`, `n` must be greater than `k + 1`**.
