Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution has a couple of issues:

1. **String `sam`**: The string `sam` is defined as `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz'`, which is incorrect because it contains a typo (`qw` instead of `xy`). It should be `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'`.

2. **Mapping and Indexing**: The logic for mapping the trace values to characters in the alphabet is flawed. The current implementation uses `a_map[a[i]] % 27` to index into the `sam` string, but this can lead to incorrect results because the modulo operation with 27 can produce indices that are out of bounds for the `sam` string (which has 26 characters).

A corrected version of the function `func_1` would look like this:

```python
def func_1(n, a):
    sam = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
    a_map = {x: 0 for x in range(n)}
    res = ''
    for i in range(n):
        beg = a_map[a[i]]
        res += sam[beg % 26]  # Corrected to use modulo 26
        a_map[a[i]] += 1
    return res
```

With these corrections, the program should correctly generate a string that matches the given trace.
