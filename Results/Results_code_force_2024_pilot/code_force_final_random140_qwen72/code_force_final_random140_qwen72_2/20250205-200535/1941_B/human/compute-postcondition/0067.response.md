Output State: **`inputarray` remains a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 3, `length` is greater than 2, `elementIndex` is 1, `highestNumber` is -1, `highestIndex` is 1, `newArray` is the result of `func_1(inputarray, 1)`, `loop_counter` is increased by 1 and must not be equal to 100, the result of `func_2(newArray)` remains unchanged and is `False`. Additionally, the current value of `inputarray[elementIndex]` is greater than or equal to `highestNumber`.**

Explanation:
- `highestIndex` is updated to the value of `elementIndex`, which is 1.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
