Output State: **The program returns nothing explicitly, but the final state includes `inputarray` as a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 3, `length` as the length of `inputarray`, `elementIndex` as `length - 1`, `highestNumber` as the highest value in `inputarray` from index 1 to `length - 2`, `highestIndex` as the index of the highest value in `inputarray` from index 1 to `length - 2`, `newArray` as the result of `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`, `loop_counter` increased by the number of iterations (which is `length - 2`), `func_2(newArray)` returning `True`, `highestNumber` being greater than or equal to 0, and `answers` including the string 'YES'.**
