Output State: **The program returns nothing explicitly, but the final state includes `inputarray` as a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 3, `length` as the length of `inputarray`, `elementIndex` as `length - 2`, `highestNumber` as the highest value in `inputarray` from index 1 to `length - 2`, `highestIndex` as the index of `highestNumber` within this range, `newArray` as the result of `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`, `loop_counter` unchanged, and `answers` including the string 'YES'. Additionally, `func_2(newArray)` evaluates to `True`.**
