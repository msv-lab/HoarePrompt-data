Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `inputarray` is a list of non-negative integers, and its length is at least 3, `func_2(inputarray)` returns `False`, `loop_counter` is 1, `length` is the length of `inputarray` (at least 3), `highestNumber` is -1, `highestIndex` is -1.
Code of the loop:
for elementIndex in range(1, length - 1):
    if inputarray[elementIndex] >= highestNumber:
        highestIndex = elementIndex
        highestNumber = inputarray[elementIndex]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`inputarray` is a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 3, `func_2(inputarray)` returns `False`, `loop_counter` is 1, `length` is at least 3, `elementIndex` is 1. If `inputarray[1]` is greater than or equal to -1, `highestNumber` is set to the value of `inputarray[1]` and `highestIndex` is set to 1. Otherwise, `highestNumber` remains -1 and `highestIndex` remains -1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`inputarray` is a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 3, `func_2(inputarray)` returns `False`, `loop_counter` is 1, `length` is at least 3, `elementIndex` is 2. If `inputarray[1]` is greater than or equal to -1, `highestNumber` is set to the value of `inputarray[1]` and `highestIndex` is set to 1. If `inputarray[2]` is greater than or equal to `highestNumber`, `highestNumber` is updated to the value of `inputarray[2]` and `highestIndex` is set to 2. Otherwise, `highestNumber` and `highestIndex` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`inputarray` is a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 3, `func_2(inputarray)` returns `False`, `loop_counter` is 1, `length` is at least 4, `elementIndex` is 3. If `inputarray[1]` is greater than or equal to -1, `highestNumber` is initially set to the value of `inputarray[1]` and `highestIndex` is set to 1. If `inputarray[2]` is greater than or equal to `highestNumber`, `highestNumber` is updated to the value of `inputarray[2]` and `highestIndex` is set to 2. If `inputarray[3]` is greater than or equal to `highestNumber`, `highestNumber` is updated to the value of `inputarray[3]` and `highestIndex` is set to 3. Otherwise, `highestNumber` and `highestIndex` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
