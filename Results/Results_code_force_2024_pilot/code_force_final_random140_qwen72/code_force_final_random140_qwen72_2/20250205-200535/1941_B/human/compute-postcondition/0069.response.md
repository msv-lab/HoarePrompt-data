Postcondition: ***`inputarray` remains a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 3, `length` is greater than 2, `elementIndex` is 1, `loop_counter` is increased by 1 and must not be equal to 100, the result of `func_2(newArray)` remains unchanged and is `False`. If `inputarray[1]` is greater than or equal to `highestNumber`, then `highestNumber` is updated to `inputarray[1]` and `highestIndex` is set to 1, and `newArray` is the result of `func_1(inputarray, 1)`. Otherwise, `highestNumber` and `highestIndex` remain unchanged, and `newArray` is the result of `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`.***
