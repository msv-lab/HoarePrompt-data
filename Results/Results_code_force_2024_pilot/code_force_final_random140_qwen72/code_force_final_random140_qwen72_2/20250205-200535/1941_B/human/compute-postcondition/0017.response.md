Postcondition: ***`inputarray` is a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 3, `func_2(inputarray)` returns `False`, `loop_counter` is 1, `length` is at least 3, `elementIndex` is 2. If `inputarray[1]` is greater than or equal to -1, `highestNumber` is set to the value of `inputarray[1]` and `highestIndex` is set to 1. If `inputarray[2]` is greater than or equal to `highestNumber`, `highestNumber` is updated to the value of `inputarray[2]` and `highestIndex` is set to 2. Otherwise, `highestNumber` and `highestIndex` remain unchanged.***
