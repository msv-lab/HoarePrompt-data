Output State: **The program returns nothing. However, it's important to note that before the return, `answers` includes 'NO' as its last element, and `highestNumber` is less than 0. The other variables (`inputarray`, `length`, `elementIndex`, `highestIndex`, `loop_counter`, `newArray`, and the result of `func_2(newArray)`) remain unchanged.**
