Functionality: **The function `func_3` accepts a parameter `inputarray`, which is a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 3. Depending on the internal logic and the state of various variables, the function may return 'YES', 'NO', or nothing. Specifically:**

- **Case_1:** If `func_2` applied to `inputarray` returns `True`, the function does not return anything, but `answers` contains the string 'YES'.
- **Case_2:** The function returns the string 'NO' if `answers` contains the string 'NO'.
- **Case_3:** The function returns 'YES'.
- **Case_4:** The function does not return anything, but `answers` includes 'NO' as its last element, and `highestNumber` is less than 0.
- **Case_5:** The function does not return anything, but the final state includes `inputarray` as a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 3, `length` as the length of `inputarray`, `elementIndex` as `length - 2`, `highestNumber` as the highest value in `inputarray` from index 1 to `length - 2`, `highestIndex` as the index of `highestNumber` within this range, `newArray` as the result of `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`, and `answers` including the string 'YES'. Additionally, `func_2(newArray)` evaluates to `True`.
- **Case_6:** The function does not return anything, but the final state includes `inputarray` remaining a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 3, `length` as the length of `inputarray`, `elementIndex` as `length - 1`, `highestNumber` as the highest value in `inputarray` from index 1 to `length - 2` and less than 0, `highestIndex` as the index of the highest value in `inputarray` from index 1 to `length - 2`, `newArray` as the result of `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`, `loop_counter` increased by the number of iterations (which is `length - 2`), `func_2(newArray)` remaining unchanged and `False`, and `answers` including the string 'NO'.
- **Case_7:** The function does not return anything, but the final state includes `inputarray` as a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 3, `length` as the length of `inputarray`, `elementIndex` as `length - 1`, `highestNumber` as the highest value in `inputarray` from index 1 to `length - 2`, `highestIndex` as the index of the highest value in `inputarray` from index 1 to `length - 2`, `newArray` as the result of `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`, `loop_counter` increased by the number of iterations (which is `length - 2`), `func_2(newArray)` returning `True`, `highestNumber` being greater than or equal to 0, and `answers` including the string 'YES'.
