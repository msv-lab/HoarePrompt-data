Postcondition: ***`inputarray` is a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 3, `length` is at least 4, `elementIndex` is 3. If `inputarray[3]` is greater than or equal to `highestNumber`, then `highestIndex` is updated to 3, and `highestNumber` is updated to `inputarray[3]`. Otherwise, `highestIndex` and `highestNumber` remain unchanged.***
