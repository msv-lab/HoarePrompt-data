The only objects in the loop head are `elementIndex` and `length`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `elementIndex` being less than `length - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `elementIndex` is 1 and `length` is at least 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `elementIndex` must be incremented by 1 (so it becomes 2) and `length` must still be at least 3.

State: **`inputarray` is a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 3, `func_2(inputarray)` returns `False`, `loop_counter` is 1, `length` is at least 3, `elementIndex` is 2. If `inputarray[1]` is greater than or equal to -1, `highestNumber` is set to the value of `inputarray[1]` and `highestIndex` is set to 1. Otherwise, `highestNumber` remains -1 and `highestIndex` remains -1.**
