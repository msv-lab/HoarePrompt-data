You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: inputarray is a list of non-negative integers, and its length is at least 3.
def func_3(inputarray):
    if func_2(inputarray) :
        answers.append('YES')
        return
        #The program returns nothing. However, it's known that `inputarray` is a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 3, `func_2` applied to `inputarray` returns `True`, and `answers` contains the string 'YES'.
    #State: inputarray is a list of non-negative integers, and its length is at least 3, and `func_2(inputarray)` returns `False`.
    loop_counter = 1
    while loop_counter != 100:
        length = len(inputarray)
        
        highestNumber = -1
        
        highestIndex = -1
        
        for elementIndex in range(1, length - 1):
            if inputarray[elementIndex] >= highestNumber:
                highestIndex = elementIndex
                highestNumber = inputarray[elementIndex]
        
        if highestNumber < 0:
            answers.append('NO')
            return
        
        newArray = func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)
        
        if func_2(newArray):
            answers.append('YES')
            return
        
        loop_counter += 1
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `inputarray` remains a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 3, `func_2(inputarray)` returns `False`, `loop_counter` is 100, `length` is the length of `inputarray`, `elementIndex` is `length - 1`, `highestNumber` is the highest value in `inputarray` from index 1 to `length - 2`, `highestIndex` is the index of the highest value in `inputarray` from index 1 to `length - 2`, `newArray` is the result of `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`, and `func_2(newArray)` returns `False`.
    answers.append('NO')
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_3` accepts a parameter `inputarray`, which is a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 3. Depending on the internal logic and the state of various variables, the function may return 'YES', 'NO', or nothing. Specifically:

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns nothing. However, it's known that `inputarray` is a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 3, `func_2` applied to `inputarray` returns `True`, and `answers` contains the string 'YES'.

Case_2: The program returns the string 'NO' contained in the variable `answers`.

Case_3: The program returns 'YES'.

Case_4: The program returns nothing. However, it's important to note that before the return, `answers` includes 'NO' as its last element, and `highestNumber` is less than 0. The other variables (`inputarray`, `length`, `elementIndex`, `highestIndex`, `loop_counter`, `newArray`, and the result of `func_2(newArray)`) remain unchanged.

Case_5: The program returns nothing explicitly, but the final state includes `inputarray` as a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 3, `length` as the length of `inputarray`, `elementIndex` as `length - 2`, `highestNumber` as the highest value in `inputarray` from index 1 to `length - 2`, `highestIndex` as the index of `highestNumber` within this range, `newArray` as the result of `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`, `loop_counter` unchanged, and `answers` including the string 'YES'. Additionally, `func_2(newArray)` evaluates to `True`.

Case_6: The program returns nothing, but the final state includes: `inputarray` remains a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 3, `length` is the length of `inputarray`, `elementIndex` is `length - 1`, `highestNumber` is the highest value in `inputarray` from index 1 to `length - 2` and is less than 0, `highestIndex` is the index of the highest value in `inputarray` from index 1 to `length - 2`, `newArray` is the result of `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`, `loop_counter` is increased by the number of iterations (which is `length - 2`), the result of `func_2(newArray)` remains unchanged and is `False`, and `answers` now includes the string 'NO'.

Case_7: The program returns nothing explicitly, but the final state includes `inputarray` as a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 3, `length` as the length of `inputarray`, `elementIndex` as `length - 1`, `highestNumber` as the highest value in `inputarray` from index 1 to `length - 2`, `highestIndex` as the index of the highest value in `inputarray` from index 1 to `length - 2`, `newArray` as the result of `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`, `loop_counter` increased by the number of iterations (which is `length - 2`), `func_2(newArray)` returning `True`, `highestNumber` being greater than or equal to 0, and `answers` including the string 'YES'.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
