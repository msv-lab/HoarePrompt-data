The only variable in the loop head is `loop_counter`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `loop_counter`. If `loop_counter` is not equal to 100, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `loop_counter` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `loop_counter` must still not be equal to 100.

State: **`inputarray` is a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 3, `func_2(inputarray)` returns `False`, `loop_counter` is 2, `length` is the length of `inputarray`, `elementIndex` is `length - 1`, `highestNumber` is the maximum value among the elements from index 1 to `length - 2` in `inputarray`, `highestIndex` is the index of the first occurrence of this maximum value, `highestNumber` is greater than or equal to 0, `newArray` is the result of `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`, and `func_2(newArray)` returns `False`**
