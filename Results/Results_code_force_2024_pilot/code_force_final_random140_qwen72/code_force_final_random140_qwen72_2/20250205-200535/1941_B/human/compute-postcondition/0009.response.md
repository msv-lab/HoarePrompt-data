To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the conditions that affect the loop's ability to run based on the loop head. The loop head is:

```python
for elementIndex in range(1, length - 1):
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Range Definition**: The loop iterates over `elementIndex` from 1 to `length - 2` (inclusive). This means the loop will run if `1 <= elementIndex < length - 1`.
2. **Length Condition**: For the loop to execute at least once, `length - 1` must be greater than 1. Therefore, `length` must be greater than 2.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`length`**: Must be at least 3 for the loop to execute at least once.
- **`elementIndex`**: Starts at 1, which is already given by the loop head.

### Other States:
- **`inputarray`**: A list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 3.
- **`func_2(inputarray)`**: Returns `False`.
- **`loop_counter`**: Is 1.
- **`highestNumber`**: Is -1.
- **`highestIndex`**: Is -1.

These other states do not directly affect the loop's ability to execute, but they are part of the initial state.

### Final State:
State: **`inputarray` is a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 3, `func_2(inputarray)` returns `False`, `loop_counter` is 1, `length` is at least 3, `highestNumber` is -1, `highestIndex` is -1, `elementIndex` is 1**
