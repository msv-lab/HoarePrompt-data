Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `inputarray` remains a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 3, `func_2(inputarray)` returns `False`, `loop_counter` is 100, `length` is the length of `inputarray`, `elementIndex` is `length - 1`, `highestNumber` is the highest value in `inputarray` from index 1 to `length - 2`, `highestIndex` is the index of the highest value in `inputarray` from index 1 to `length - 2`, `newArray` is the result of `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`, and `func_2(newArray)` returns `False`.** 

This means that after the loop has executed 100 times, the `loop_counter` has reached 100, and the conditions checked within the loop (such as `func_2(newArray)` returning `False`) have remained consistent throughout the iterations. The `inputarray` and its properties, including the highest number and its index, have been updated according to the loop's logic, but the overall structure and constraints of the array have not changed.
