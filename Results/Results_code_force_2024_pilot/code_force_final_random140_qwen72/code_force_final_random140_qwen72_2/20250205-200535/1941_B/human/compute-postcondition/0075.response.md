The code snippet `highestIndex = elementIndex` updates the value of `highestIndex` to the value of `elementIndex`. Given that `elementIndex` is 3, `highestIndex` is now 3. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`inputarray` remains a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 3, `length` is greater than 2, `elementIndex` is 3, `loop_counter` is increased by 1 and must not be equal to 100, the result of `func_2(newArray)` remains unchanged and is `False`, `highestIndex` is 3, `highestNumber` remains unchanged, and `newArray` is the result of `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`.**
