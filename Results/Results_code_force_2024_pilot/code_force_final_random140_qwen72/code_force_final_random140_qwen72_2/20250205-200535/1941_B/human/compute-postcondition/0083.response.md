Output State: **`inputarray` remains a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 3, `length` is the length of `inputarray`, `elementIndex` is `length - 1`, `highestNumber` is the highest value in `inputarray` from index 1 to `length - 2`, `highestIndex` is the index of the highest value in `inputarray` from index 1 to `length - 2`, `newArray` is the result of `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`, `loop_counter` is increased by the number of iterations (which is `length - 2`), the result of `func_2(newArray)` remains unchanged and is `False`, and `highestNumber` is greater than or equal to 0.**

Explanation: The code snippet `newArray = func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)` reassigns the value of `newArray` to the result of calling `func_1` with `inputarray` and `highestIndex` as arguments. This does not change the values of `inputarray`, `length`, `elementIndex`, `highestNumber`, `highestIndex`, or `loop_counter`. The result of `func_2(newArray)` remains unchanged and is `False`. The condition that `highestNumber` is greater than or equal to 0 also remains valid.
