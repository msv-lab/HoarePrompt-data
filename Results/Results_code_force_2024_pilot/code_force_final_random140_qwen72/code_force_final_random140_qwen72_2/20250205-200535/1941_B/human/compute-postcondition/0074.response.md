To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop head:

### Given Information:
- `inputarray` remains a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 3.
- `length` is greater than 2.
- `elementIndex` is 2.
- `loop_counter` is increased by 1 and must not be equal to 100.
- The result of `func_2(newArray)` remains unchanged and is `False`.
- If `inputarray[2]` is greater than or equal to `highestNumber`, then `highestNumber` is updated to `inputarray[2]` and `highestIndex` is set to 2, and `newArray` is the result of `func_1(inputarray, 2)`. Otherwise, `highestNumber` and `highestIndex` remain unchanged, and `newArray` is the result of `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`.

### Loop Head:
```python
for elementIndex in range(1, length - 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over `elementIndex` from 1 to `length - 2` (inclusive).
- At the end of the previous iteration, `elementIndex` is 2.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `elementIndex` must be incremented by 1.
- The loop will continue as long as `elementIndex` is less than `length - 1`.

### Adjustments:
- `elementIndex` needs to be incremented by 1 to 3.
- `length` must remain greater than 2 to ensure the loop condition `elementIndex < length - 1` holds true.

### Final State:
State: **`inputarray` remains a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 3, `length` is greater than 2, `elementIndex` is 3, `loop_counter` is increased by 1 and must not be equal to 100, the result of `func_2(newArray)` remains unchanged and is `False`. If `inputarray[2]` is greater than or equal to `highestNumber`, then `highestNumber` is updated to `inputarray[2]` and `highestIndex` is set to 2, and `newArray` is the result of `func_1(inputarray, 2)`. Otherwise, `highestNumber` and `highestIndex` remain unchanged, and `newArray` is the result of `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`.**
