Output State: **`inputarray` remains a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 3, `length` is the length of `inputarray`, `elementIndex` is `length - 1`, `highestNumber` is the highest value in `inputarray` from index 1 to `length - 2`, `highestIndex` is the index of the highest value in `inputarray` from index 1 to `length - 2`, `newArray` is the result of `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`, `loop_counter` is increased by the number of iterations (which is `length - 2`), and the result of `func_2(newArray)` remains unchanged and is `False`.**

This means that after the loop has completed all its iterations:
- The `inputarray` remains unchanged.
- The `length` of `inputarray` is still the same.
- The `elementIndex` is now `length - 1`, indicating the loop has finished iterating over the valid indices.
- `highestNumber` holds the maximum value found in `inputarray` from index 1 to `length - 2`.
- `highestIndex` holds the index of the maximum value found in `inputarray` from index 1 to `length - 2`.
- `newArray` is the result of calling `func_1` with `inputarray` and the final `highestIndex`.
- `loop_counter` has been incremented by the number of iterations, which is `length - 2`.
- The result of `func_2(newArray)` remains `False`.
