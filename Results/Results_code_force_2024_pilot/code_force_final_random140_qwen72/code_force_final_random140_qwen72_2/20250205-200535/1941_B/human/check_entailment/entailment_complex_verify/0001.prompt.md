You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

    array[index] = array[index] - 2

    #The program returns the list `array` where the value at `array[index - 1]` is decreased by 1, the value at `array[index]` is decreased by 2, and the value at `array[index + 1]` is decreased by 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `array` and an integer `index` (where 2 <= index < len(array) - 1). It modifies the list by decreasing the value at `array[index - 1]` by 1, the value at `array[index]` by 2, and the value at `array[index + 1]` by 1. The function then returns the modified list `array`.

    #State: The loop will continue to iterate over all elements in `arrayForSuccess`. If any element `x` in the list is not equal to 0, the function will return `False` immediately. If all elements in the list are equal to 0, the loop will complete without returning `False`, and the function will implicitly return `None` (or the function will reach its end without returning a value).
    return True
    #The program returns `True`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` takes a list of integers `arrayForSuccess` as a parameter. It checks if all elements in the list are equal to 0. If any element is not 0, the function immediately returns `False`. If all elements are 0, the function returns `True`. In all other cases where the list contains at least one non-zero element, the function returns `False`.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: inputarray is a list of non-negative integers, and its length is at least 3.
def func_3(inputarray):

    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `inputarray` remains a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 3, `func_2(inputarray)` returns `False`, `loop_counter` is 100, `length` is the length of `inputarray`, `elementIndex` is `length - 1`, `highestNumber` is the highest value in `inputarray` from index 1 to `length - 2`, `highestIndex` is the index of the highest value in `inputarray` from index 1 to `length - 2`, `newArray` is the result of `func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)`, and `func_2(newArray)` returns `False`.
    answers.append('NO')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` takes a list of non-negative integers `inputarray` with a minimum length of 3. It checks if a condition defined by `func_2` is met for `inputarray`. If `func_2(inputarray)` returns `True`, the function appends 'YES' to the global list `answers` and returns. If `func_2(inputarray)` returns `False`, the function enters a loop that iterates up to 100 times. In each iteration, it finds the highest number in `inputarray` (excluding the first and last elements) and applies `func_1` to `inputarray` using the index of the highest number. If `func_2` returns `True` for the new array, 'YES' is appended to `answers` and the function returns. If the loop completes without finding a suitable condition, 'NO' is appended to `answers`. The function does not return any value explicitly but modifies the global list `answers` to contain either 'YES' or 'NO'.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if we can make all elements of an array zero using the specified operation.
   - The operation involves selecting an index \( i \) (where \( 2 \le i \le n-1 \)) and decrementing \( a_{i-1} \), \( a_i \), and \( a_{i+1} \) by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Functions:**
   - **func_1:** This function performs the operation on the array at the specified index.
   - **func_2:** This function checks if all elements in the array are zero.
   - **func_3:** This function attempts to make all elements zero by repeatedly applying the operation to the highest element in the middle of the array.

3. **Evaluating the Logic:**
   - **func_1** correctly implements the operation as described.
   - **func_2** correctly checks if all elements are zero.
   - **func_3** has a few issues:
     - It uses a fixed loop counter (`loop_counter` with a limit of 100), which may not be sufficient for all test cases. The number of operations required to make all elements zero can vary widely depending on the input.
     - It selects the highest element in the middle of the array, but this approach may not always lead to a solution. For example, if the highest element is not part of a sequence that can be reduced to zero, the algorithm might fail.
     - The condition `if highestNumber < 0:` is incorrect because the elements are non-negative (as per the problem statement).

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - A correct approach would involve checking if the sum of the elements is divisible by 4 (since each operation reduces the total sum by 4).
   - Additionally, we need to ensure that the elements can be reduced to zero without creating negative values.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The provided program is incorrect because it relies on a fixed number of iterations and an incorrect selection criterion for the operation.
