### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function correctly implements the operation described in the problem. It decreases the value at `array[index - 1]` by 1, the value at `array[index]` by 2, and the value at `array[index + 1]` by 1. This matches the problem's requirements.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function checks if all elements in the array are zero. It returns `True` if all elements are zero and `False` otherwise. This is a correct implementation for checking if the array can be reduced to all zeros.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - This function attempts to reduce the array to all zeros by repeatedly applying the operation described in `func_1` to the highest value in the array (excluding the first and last elements). If the array can be reduced to all zeros within 100 iterations, it appends 'YES' to the `answers` list. If not, it appends 'NO'.
   - The loop limit of 100 iterations is arbitrary and may not always be sufficient to determine if the array can be reduced to all zeros. However, the problem does not specify a maximum number of operations, so this approach might fail for some edge cases where more than 100 operations are needed.

4. **Main Program**:
   - The main program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by calling `func_3` and appending the result to the `answers` list. Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

### Issues:
- **Loop Limit**: The loop in `func_3` is limited to 100 iterations. This might not be enough for some test cases where more operations are required to reduce the array to all zeros. This could lead to incorrect results for some inputs.

### Conclusion:
Given the arbitrary loop limit of 100 iterations in `func_3`, the program may not correctly handle all test cases, especially those requiring more than 100 operations. Therefore, the program is not fully correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
