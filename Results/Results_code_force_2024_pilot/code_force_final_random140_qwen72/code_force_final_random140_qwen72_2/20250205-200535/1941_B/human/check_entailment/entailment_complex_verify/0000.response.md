### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires determining if it's possible to make all elements of an array zero using a specific operation. The operation involves selecting an index \( i \) (where \( 2 \le i \le n-1 \)) and decrementing the elements at indices \( i-1 \), \( i \), and \( i+1 \) by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function correctly performs the operation as described in the problem statement. It modifies the array by decrementing the specified elements.
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function checks if all elements in the array are zero. It returns `True` if all elements are zero and `False` otherwise. This function is correct.
   - **Function 3 (`func_3`)**: This function attempts to solve the problem by repeatedly applying the operation until either all elements are zero or a maximum of 100 iterations have been performed. The key issue here is the fixed loop counter of 100 iterations.

3. **Original Assessment**:
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that the fixed loop counter of 100 iterations is insufficient for some cases. For example, if the array contains very large numbers, it might require more than 100 operations to make all elements zero. This limitation can lead to incorrect "NO" results for cases where more operations are needed.

4. **Annotated Code Evaluation**:
   - The annotations confirm that the program correctly performs the operations and checks for the desired condition. However, the fixed loop counter is a significant flaw that can cause the program to terminate prematurely without achieving the goal.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The original assessment is accurate. The program is incorrect because it uses a fixed loop counter that may not be sufficient for all input cases. This can lead to incorrect results for arrays that require more than 100 operations to become zero.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
