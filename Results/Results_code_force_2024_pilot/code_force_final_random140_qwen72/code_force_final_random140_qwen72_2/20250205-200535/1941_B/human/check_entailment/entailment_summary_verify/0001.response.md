### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires determining if it's possible to make all elements of an array zero using the specified operation. The operation involves selecting an index \( i \) (where \( 2 \le i \le n-1 \)) and decrementing \( a_{i-1} \), \( a_i \), and \( a_{i+1} \) by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Functions:**
   - **func_1:** This function correctly implements the operation as described.
   - **func_2:** This function correctly checks if all elements in the array are zero.
   - **func_3:** This function attempts to make all elements zero by repeatedly applying the operation to the highest element in the middle of the array.

3. **Evaluating the Logic:**
   - **func_1** and **func_2** are implemented correctly.
   - **func_3** has several issues:
     - **Fixed Loop Counter:** The loop counter is limited to 100 iterations, which may not be sufficient for all test cases. The number of operations required to make all elements zero can vary widely depending on the input.
     - **Selection Criterion:** The function selects the highest element in the middle of the array, but this approach may not always lead to a solution. For example, if the highest element is not part of a sequence that can be reduced to zero, the algorithm might fail.
     - **Negative Check:** The condition `if highestNumber < 0:` is incorrect because the elements are non-negative (as per the problem statement).

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - A correct approach would involve checking if the sum of the elements is divisible by 4 (since each operation reduces the total sum by 4).
   - Additionally, we need to ensure that the elements can be reduced to zero without creating negative values.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The provided program is incorrect because it relies on a fixed number of iterations and an incorrect selection criterion for the operation. The logic does not guarantee that the array can be reduced to zero in all valid cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
