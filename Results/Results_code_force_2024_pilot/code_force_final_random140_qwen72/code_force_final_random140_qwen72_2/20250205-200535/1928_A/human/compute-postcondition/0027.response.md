The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints given, it appears that the function is expected to handle multiple test cases, each involving two positive integers `a` and `b`, and a total number of test cases `t`. The function should process each test case and produce an output based on the values of `a` and `b`.

Given the constraints:
- `t` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- For each test case, `a` and `b` are positive integers where 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.

Since the specific output is not detailed, I will assume the function processes each test case and returns a result for each pair `(a, b)`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`. It processes each test case and returns a result for each pair `(a, b)`.**
