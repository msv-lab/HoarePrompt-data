Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `n` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`. It checks the following conditions for each pair `(a, b)`: if both `a` and `b` are odd, or if one is exactly twice the other and the other is odd, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES". After processing all `n` test cases, the function completes, having printed "YES" or "NO" for each pair of integers. **
