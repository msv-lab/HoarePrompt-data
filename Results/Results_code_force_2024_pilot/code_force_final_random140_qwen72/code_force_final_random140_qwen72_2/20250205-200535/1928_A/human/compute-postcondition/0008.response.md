Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` and `b` are the integers provided by the user input, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, and at least one of `a` or `b` is even. Additionally, either `a / 2` is not equal to `b` or `b % 2` is 0, and either `b / 2` is not equal to `a` or `a % 2` is 0.***
