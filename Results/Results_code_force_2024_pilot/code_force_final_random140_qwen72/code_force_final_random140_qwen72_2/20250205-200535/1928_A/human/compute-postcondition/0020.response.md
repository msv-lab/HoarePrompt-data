The provided Python code snippet reads two integers from user input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. This operation updates the values of `a` and `b` based on the input provided.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user input, `n` must be greater than 2, and `i` is 2. The values of `a` and `b` are now the integers entered by the user.**
