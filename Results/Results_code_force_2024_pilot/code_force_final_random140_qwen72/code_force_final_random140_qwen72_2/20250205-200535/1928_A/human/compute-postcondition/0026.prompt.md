Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, a and b are positive integers where 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9; n is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    a, b = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
        print('NO')
    elif a / 2 == b and b % 2 != 0 or b / 2 == a and a % 2 != 0:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user input, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` is 0. If both `a` and `b` are odd integers, the condition is met. Otherwise, at least one of `a` or `b` is even, and if `a` is twice `b` and `b` is odd, or `b` is twice `a` and `a` is odd, then the condition is met. If neither of these conditions is true, then either `a / 2` is not equal to `b` or `b % 2` is 0, and either `b / 2` is not equal to `a` or `a % 2` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user input, `n` must be greater than 1, and `i` is 1. If both `a` and `b` are odd integers, the condition is met. Otherwise, if at least one of `a` or `b` is even, and if `a` is twice `b` and `b` is odd, or `b` is twice `a` and `a` is odd, then the condition is met. If neither of these conditions is true, then either `a / 2` is not equal to `b` or `b % 2` is 0, and either `b / 2` is not equal to `a` or `a % 2` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` and `b` are integers provided by the user input, `n` must be greater than 2, and `i` is 2. If both `a` and `b` are odd, the values of `a` and `b` remain as the integers entered by the user. If either `a` or `b` is even, or if `a / 2 == b` and `b % 2 != 0` or `(b / 2 == a` and `a % 2 != 0), the values of `a` and `b` also remain as the integers entered by the user.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
