Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `a` and `b` are integers provided by user input.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- At least one of `a` or `b` is even.
- Either `a / 2` is not equal to `b` or `b % 2` is 0.
- Either `b / 2` is not equal to `a` or `a % 2` is 0.

Given these conditions, the `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print('YES')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'YES'` to the console. The conditions described in the initial state do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **YES**
