Reasoning:

The program aims to determine whether Bob can form a new rectangle from the given \(a \times b\) rectangle by cutting it into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them. The logic of the program is based on the following conditions:

1. **Both dimensions are odd:** If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, it is impossible to form a new rectangle because cutting an odd-length side will always result in two smaller odd-length sides, and no combination of these can form a new rectangle with different dimensions.
2. **One dimension is exactly twice the other and the other is odd:** If \(a\) is exactly twice \(b\) and \(b\) is odd, or vice versa, it is also impossible to form a new rectangle. This is because cutting the longer side will result in two smaller rectangles of the same odd length, and no rearrangement can form a new rectangle with different dimensions.
3. **All other cases:** In all other cases, it is possible to form a new rectangle. This includes when at least one of the dimensions is even, or when neither dimension is exactly twice the other and both are not odd.

Let's analyze the program step-by-step:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer \(n\) indicating the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \(a\) and \(b\).

2. **Conditions:**
   - **If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd:** The program prints "NO".
   - **If \(a\) is exactly twice \(b\) and \(b\) is odd, or \(b\) is exactly twice \(a\) and \(a\) is odd:** The program prints "NO".
   - **Otherwise:** The program prints "YES".

3. **Output:**
   - The program correctly prints "YES" or "NO" for each test case based on the conditions.

Given the problem description and the conditions checked by the program, the logic is sound and covers all necessary cases. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
