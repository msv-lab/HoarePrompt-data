Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The given solution has a logical flaw in its conditions for determining whether a new rectangle can be formed. Specifically, the condition `elif a / 2 == b and b % 2 != 0 or (b / 2 == a and a % 2 != 0):` incorrectly identifies some cases where a new rectangle can actually be formed as not possible.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the following:

1. If both dimensions \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, it is impossible to cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides, so the answer is "No".
2. If either dimension is even, it is always possible to cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and form a new rectangle with different dimensions (considering rotations).

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

This version correctly checks if at least one of the dimensions is even, which is sufficient to determine if a new rectangle can be formed. If both dimensions are odd, it prints "No". This logic aligns with the problem requirements and should produce the correct output for all test cases.
