Reasoning:

The problem requires determining whether a rectangle of dimensions \(a \times b\) can be cut into two smaller rectangles and then reassembled into a new rectangle that is different from the original, considering rotations as equivalent. The key points to consider are:
1. If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, no cut can produce a rectangle that can be reassembled into a different shape.
2. If one dimension is exactly twice the other and the other dimension is odd, the only possible cuts will result in rectangles that, when reassembled, will form the same original rectangle or its rotation.

The provided program correctly implements these conditions:
- It reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads the dimensions \(a\) and \(b\).
- It checks if both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd. If so, it prints "NO".
- It checks if one dimension is exactly twice the other and the other dimension is odd. If so, it prints "NO".
- Otherwise, it prints "YES".

These conditions cover all the necessary cases to determine if Bob can form a different rectangle. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
