### Reasoning:

1. **Factorial Precomputation**:
   - The program precomputes factorials up to 200,000 and stores them in the list `facts`. This is necessary for calculating combinations later in the program.
   - The computation is done modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to handle large numbers.

2. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of \(n\), \(m_1\), and \(m_2\), followed by the indices of prefix maximums and suffix maximums.

3. **Initial Validity Check**:
   - The program checks if the last prefix maximum index is the same as the first suffix maximum index, and if the first prefix maximum index is 1 and the last suffix maximum index is \(n\). If any of these conditions fail, it prints 0, indicating no valid permutation exists.

4. **Combination Calculation**:
   - The program uses the `func_2` function to calculate combinations. This function internally calls `func_1` to compute the modular inverse using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm.
   - The combination calculation is used to determine the number of ways to arrange the remaining elements between the prefix and suffix maximums.

5. **Suffix Maximums Processing**:
   - The program iterates over the suffix maximums and calculates the number of ways to arrange the elements before each suffix maximum.
   - It updates the total number of arrangements (`ans`) by multiplying it with the calculated combinations and taking the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

6. **Prefix Maximums Processing**:
   - The program reverses the list of prefix maximums (excluding the last one) and processes it similarly to the suffix maximums.
   - It updates the total number of arrangements (`ans`) by multiplying it with the calculated combinations and taking the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

7. **Final Output**:
   - After processing both the suffix and prefix maximums, the program prints the final result for each test case.

### Correctness Analysis:

- **Factorial Precomputation**: Correctly computes factorials modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
- **Input Handling**: Correctly reads and processes multiple test cases.
- **Initial Validity Check**: Ensures the basic conditions for a valid permutation are met.
- **Combination Calculation**: Uses the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to compute modular inverses and correctly calculates combinations.
- **Suffix and Prefix Maximums Processing**: Correctly processes the suffix and prefix maximums to determine the number of valid permutations.
- **Modulo Operations**: Ensures all intermediate and final results are within the required modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
