### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given the indices of prefix and suffix maximums of a permutation.
   - We need to count the number of possible permutations that match these indices.
   - The result should be modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Precomputation of Factorials**:
   - The code precomputes factorials up to \(200002\) and stores them in the list `facts`.
   - This is necessary for efficient computation of combinations using modular arithmetic.

3. **Main Loop**:
   - The main loop processes each test case.
   - It reads the input values \(n\), \(m_1\), and \(m_2\), and the lists of prefix and suffix maximum indices.
   - It checks if the last prefix maximum index matches the first suffix maximum index, and if the first prefix maximum index is 1 and the last suffix maximum index is \(n\). If any of these conditions fail, it prints 0, indicating no valid permutation exists.

4. **Combination Calculation**:
   - The function `func_2` is used to compute the modular inverse of a number, which is essential for calculating combinations in modular arithmetic.
   - The combination \(C(n, k)\) is calculated using the formula \(C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\) under modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

5. **Permutation Counting**:
   - The code iterates over the suffix maximum indices and calculates the number of ways to place the remaining elements.
   - It then iterates over the prefix maximum indices (in reverse order) and performs similar calculations.
   - The product of these combinations gives the total number of valid permutations.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code correctly handles edge cases where the conditions for valid permutations are not met (e.g., the first prefix maximum is not 1 or the last suffix maximum is not \(n\)).

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to count the number of valid permutations based on the given prefix and suffix maximum indices. The precomputation of factorials, the use of modular arithmetic for combination calculations, and the handling of edge cases ensure that the program meets the problem requirements.

**Correctness: True**
