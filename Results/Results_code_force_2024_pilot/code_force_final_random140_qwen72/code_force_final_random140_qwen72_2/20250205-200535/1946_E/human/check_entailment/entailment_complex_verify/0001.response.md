### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires counting the number of permutations of length \( n \) that match the given indices of prefix and suffix maximums.
   - The result should be modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1(a, b)**: This function implements the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which is used to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers and the coefficients of Bézout's identity. It is also used to find the modular inverse of `b` under modulo `a`.
     - If `b == 0`, it returns `(1, 0)`.
     - If `a < b`, it swaps `a` and `b` and calls itself recursively.
     - If `a % b == 0`, it returns `(1, -(a // b - 1))`.
     - Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with `b` and `a % b` and adjusts the results.
   - **func_2(a, b)**: This function uses the result of `func_1` to compute the modular inverse of `b` under modulo \(1000000007\) and then multiplies it by `a` and takes the result modulo \(1000000007\).

3. **Relevance to the Problem**:
   - The problem requires combinatorial calculations, and the use of modular arithmetic (specifically modulo \(10^9 + 7\)) is common to handle large numbers.
   - The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are used to perform modular arithmetic operations, such as finding modular inverses, which are necessary for certain combinatorial calculations.

4. **Program Logic**:
   - The program initializes a list `facts` with factorials up to \(200001\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - For each test case, it reads the input values \(n\), \(m1\), and \(m2\), and the lists of prefix and suffix maximum indices.
   - It checks if the last prefix maximum index matches the first suffix maximum index, the first prefix maximum index is 1, and the last suffix maximum index is \(n\). If any of these conditions fail, it prints 0.
   - It then calculates the number of valid permutations using the combinatorial formula involving factorials and modular inverses.
   - The program correctly handles the combinatorial calculations and modular arithmetic to ensure the result is within the required constraints.

5. **Correctness of the Functions**:
   - **func_1**: The implementation of the Extended Euclidean Algorithm is correct and is a standard way to find the GCD and the coefficients of Bézout's identity.
   - **func_2**: The function correctly computes the modular inverse and then performs the required multiplication and modulo operation.

6. **Overall Program**:
   - The functions provided are mathematically sound and appropriate for the problem's requirements.
   - The main logic to count the permutations based on the given indices of prefix and suffix maximums is correctly implemented in the program.
   - The program handles all edge cases and ensures the result is modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Conclusion:
The provided functions and the main logic of the program are correct and appropriate for the problem's requirements. The program correctly counts the number of permutations that match the given indices of prefix and suffix maximums and ensures the result is modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Final: **True**
