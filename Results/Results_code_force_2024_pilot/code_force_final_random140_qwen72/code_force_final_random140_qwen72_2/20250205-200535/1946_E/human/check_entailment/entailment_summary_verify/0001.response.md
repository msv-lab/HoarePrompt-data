### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires counting the number of permutations of length `n` that match the given indices of prefix and suffix maximums.
   - The result should be modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1(a, b)**: This function implements the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the GCD of `a` and `b` and the coefficients of Bézout's identity. It is also used to find the modular inverse of `b` under modulo `a`.
     - If `b == 0`, it returns `(1, 0)`.
     - If `a < b`, it swaps `a` and `b` and calls itself recursively.
     - If `a % b == 0`, it returns `(1, -(a // b - 1))`.
     - Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with `b` and `a % b` and adjusts the results.
   - **func_2(a, b)**: This function uses the result of `func_1` to compute the modular inverse of `b` under modulo `1000000007` and then multiplies it by `a` and takes the result modulo `1000000007`.

3. **Relevance to the Problem**:
   - The problem involves combinatorial calculations, and the use of modular arithmetic (specifically modulo \(10^9 + 7\)) is common to handle large numbers.
   - The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are likely used to perform modular arithmetic operations, such as finding modular inverses, which are necessary for certain combinatorial calculations.

4. **Correctness of the Functions**:
   - **func_1**: The implementation of the Extended Euclidean Algorithm is correct and is a standard way to find the GCD and the coefficients of Bézout's identity.
   - **func_2**: The function correctly computes the modular inverse and then performs the required multiplication and modulo operation.

5. **Overall Program**:
   - The functions provided are mathematically sound and appropriate for the problem's requirements.
   - However, the main logic to count the permutations based on the given indices of prefix and suffix maximums is not provided in the given code. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are just utility functions for modular arithmetic.

### Conclusion:
The provided functions are correct in their implementation and are appropriate for the problem's requirements. However, the complete solution to the problem is not provided, as the main logic to count the permutations is missing. Therefore, the correctness of the entire program cannot be determined without the missing part.

Final: **False** (since the main logic to solve the problem is missing).
