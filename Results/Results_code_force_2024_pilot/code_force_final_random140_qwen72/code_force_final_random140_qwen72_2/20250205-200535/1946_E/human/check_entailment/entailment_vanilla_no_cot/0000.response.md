Correctness: **False**

The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not directly solve the problem as described. The problem requires calculating the number of permutations that match the given prefix and suffix maximums, and the provided functions seem to be related to the Extended Euclidean Algorithm and modular inverse calculations, which are not directly applicable to solving this specific permutation problem.

To correctly solve the problem, you would need to implement logic that considers the constraints of the prefix and suffix maximums and calculates the number of valid permutations accordingly. The current functions do not provide this functionality.
