Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not directly address the problem described. The problem requires calculating the number of permutations based on prefix and suffix maximums, but the functions provided seem to be related to the Extended Euclidean Algorithm and modular inverses, which are not directly relevant to solving the permutation problem.

A specific case where the program does not work correctly:
- Input: `n = 4`, `m1 = 2`, `m2 = 3`, `prefix_max = [1, 2]`, `suffix_max = [2, 3, 4]`.
- Expected Output: `3` (as explained in the problem description).
- Actual Output: The provided functions will not produce the correct output because they do not handle the permutation logic required by the problem.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
