Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in stating that the provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not directly address the problem of counting permutations based on prefix and suffix maximums. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(a, b)`**: This function appears to implement the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which is used to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers and the coefficients of Bézout's identity. However, it is not clear how this function is intended to be used in the context of the permutation problem.
   - **`func_2(a, b)`**: This function uses the result from `func_1` to compute a modular inverse and then multiplies it by `a` modulo \(10^9 + 7\). This is typically used in modular arithmetic to divide by a number in a modular system. Again, it is not clear how this is relevant to the permutation problem.

2. **Problem Requirements**:
   - The problem requires counting the number of permutations of length `n` that match given prefix and suffix maximums.
   - The solution should involve combinatorial logic to count valid permutations, not modular arithmetic operations.

3. **Relevance of Provided Functions**:
   - The provided functions are not designed to handle the combinatorial aspects of the problem. They are more suited for problems involving modular arithmetic and number theory, which are not directly applicable here.

4. **Specific Case Analysis**:
   - For the input `n = 4`, `m1 = 2`, `m2 = 3`, `prefix_max = [1, 2]`, `suffix_max = [2, 3, 4]`, the expected output is `3` as mentioned in the problem description.
   - The provided functions will not produce this output because they do not implement the necessary combinatorial logic to count permutations based on prefix and suffix maximums.

Given the above analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The provided functions do not solve the problem as described.

Final: **False**
