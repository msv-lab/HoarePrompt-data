#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers where b >= 0.
def func_1(a, b):
    if (b == 0) :
        return 1, 0
        #The program returns the tuple (1, 0)
    #State: a and b are integers where b > 0.
    if (a < b) :
        c, d = func_1(b, a)
        return d, c
        #The program returns two values: the second value returned by `func_1(b, a)` as the first element, and the first value returned by `func_1(b, a)` as the second element.
    #State: a and b are integers where b > 0, and a is greater than or equal to b
    if (a % b == 0) :
        return 1, -(a // b - 1)
        #The program returns a tuple (1, -(a // b - 1)), where the second element is the negative of the quotient of a divided by b minus 1. Since a is divisible by b with no remainder, the quotient (a // b) is a whole number, and the expression -(a // b - 1) simplifies to -(quotient - 1).
    #State: a and b are integers where b > 0, and a is greater than or equal to b, and a is not divisible by b
    c, d = func_1(b, a % b)
    return d, c - a // b * d
    #The program returns the values `d` and `c - a // b * d`, where `c` and `d` are the results of `func_1(b, a % b)`. Here, `a` and `b` are integers with `b > 0`, `a >= b`, and `a` is not divisible by `b`. The value `a % b` gives the remainder when `a` is divided by `b`, and `a // b` gives the integer division result.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes two integers `a` and `b` where `b` is non-negative and returns a tuple of two integers. Depending on the relationship between `a` and `b`, the function behaves as follows: 

1. If `b` is 0, the function returns the tuple `(1, 0)`.
2. If `a` is less than `b`, the function returns a tuple with the elements swapped from the result of `func_1(b, a)`.
3. If `a` is exactly divisible by `b`, the function returns the tuple `(1, -(a // b - 1))`.
4. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b` and not divisible by `b`, the function returns a tuple `(d, c - a // b * d)`, where `c` and `d` are the results of `func_1(b, a % b)`.

In all cases, the function modifies the input values through recursive calls and arithmetic operations to produce the final tuple.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is an integer, b is a list of integers, and the length of b is at least 1.
def func_2(a, b):
    c, d = func_1(b, 1000000007)
    return c * a % 1000000007
    #The program returns the result of (c * a) % 1000000007, where `c` is the first value returned by `func_1(b, 1000000007)` and `a` is an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts an integer `a` and a list of integers `b` (with a minimum length of 1). It computes and returns the result of `(c * a) % 1000000007`, where `c` is the first value returned by the function `func_1(b, 1000000007)`. The final state of the program includes the returned integer, which is the computed result.
