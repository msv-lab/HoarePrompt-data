To solve this, let's break down the given information and the code:

- Initial State: `a` and `b` are integers where `b > 0` and `a < b`.
- `c` and `d` are the values returned by `func_1(b, a)`.

The code snippet:
```
return d, c
```

Since we don't have the definition of `func_1`, we cannot determine the exact values of `c` and `d`. However, we know that `c` and `d` are the results of calling `func_1(b, a)`, and they are being returned in reverse order (`d, c`).

Output State: **The program returns two values: the second value returned by `func_1(b, a)` as the first element, and the first value returned by `func_1(b, a)` as the second element.**
