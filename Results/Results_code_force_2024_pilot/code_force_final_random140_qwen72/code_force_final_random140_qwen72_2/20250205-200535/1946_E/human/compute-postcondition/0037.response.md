Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `N`, `M1`, and `M2` remain integers such that 1 ≤ M1, M2 ≤ N ≤ 2 * 10^5. `L` remains a list of integers of length `M1` where 1 ≤ L[i] ≤ N and `L` is strictly increasing. `R` remains a list of integers provided by the user input, where each element is an integer. The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. `L[0]` is 1 and `R[-1]` is `N`. `M1` is greater than 1. `ans` is the final result of the loop's computation, which is the product of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` and the sequence of `nums_left` values from `L[-1] - 2` down to 2, all taken modulo `MOD`. `cur` is `0` or `-1` depending on whether `L[1]` was encountered during the loop. `nums_left` is `1`. `i` is `1`.**

Explanation:
- The loop continues until `i` is no longer greater than 1.
- Each iteration of the loop decrements `i` by 1 and `nums_left` by 1.
- If `i` matches an element in `L` (starting from `L[cur]`), `cur` is decremented by 1.
- If `i` does not match an element in `L`, `ans` is updated by multiplying it with `nums_left` and taking the result modulo `MOD`.
- When the loop ends, `i` will be 1, and `nums_left` will be 1 (since `i` starts at `L[-1] - 1` and is decremented to 1).
- `cur` will be 0 if `L[1]` was encountered, otherwise it will be -1 (if `L[1]` was not encountered).
- The final value of `ans` will be the product of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` and the sequence of `nums_left` values from `L[-1] - 2` down to 2, all taken modulo `MOD`.
