Output State: **`i` is `N`, `cur` is the number of elements in `R` that were encountered during the loop, `nums_left` is `0`, and `ans` is the final computed value of the product of `nums_left` values from `L[-1] - 2` down to 2, all taken modulo `MOD`.** 

### Explanation:
- **`i` is `N`:** The loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration until `i` reaches `N`. Therefore, after the loop completes, `i` will be equal to `N`.
- **`cur` is the number of elements in `R` that were encountered during the loop:** The variable `cur` is incremented each time `i` matches an element in `R`. By the end of the loop, `cur` will be equal to the number of elements in `R` that were encountered.
- **`nums_left` is `0`:** The variable `nums_left` starts as `N - R[0] - 1` and is decremented by 1 in each iteration. Since the loop runs `N - i` times (where `i` starts at `R[0] + 1`), `nums_left` will be decremented `N - (R[0] + 1)` times, resulting in `0`.
- **`ans` is the final computed value of the product of `nums_left` values from `L[-1] - 2` down to 2, all taken modulo `MOD`:** The variable `ans` is updated in each iteration where `i` does not match an element in `R`. It multiplies the current `nums_left` value and takes the result modulo `MOD`. After the loop completes, `ans` will hold the final computed value.
