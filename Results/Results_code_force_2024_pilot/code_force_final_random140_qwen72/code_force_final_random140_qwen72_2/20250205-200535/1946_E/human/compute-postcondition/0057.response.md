The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and the loop condition is `i < N`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must still be less than `N`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, and `N` is decremented by 1. Therefore, to ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `i` must be less than `N` after these changes.

Given that `i` was incremented by 1 and `N` was decremented by 1, the new values of `i` and `N` need to satisfy the condition `i < N`.

Since `i` was incremented by 1 and `N` was decremented by 1, the relative difference between `i` and `N` remains the same as before the last iteration. Therefore, if the loop executed successfully in the previous iteration, it should be able to execute again unless `i` has reached `N`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, no additional adjustments are needed beyond the given state changes.

State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `L`, `R`, and `nums_left` are each decremented by 1, `cur` is incremented by 1 if `i == R[cur]`, otherwise `ans` is updated to `ans * (nums_left + 1) % MOD`**
