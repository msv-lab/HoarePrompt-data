Output State: **The program returns the values `d` and `c - a // b * d`, where `c` and `d` are the results of `func_1(b, a % b)`. Here, `a` and `b` are integers with `b > 0`, `a >= b`, and `a` is not divisible by `b`. The value `a % b` gives the remainder when `a` is divided by `b`, and `a // b` gives the integer division result.**

To break it down further:
- `d` is one of the results from the function `func_1(b, a % b)`.
- `c` is the other result from the same function.
- The expression `c - a // b * d` calculates the difference between `c` and the product of `a // b` and `d`.

Thus, the program returns two values: `d` and the calculated result of `c - a // b * d`.
