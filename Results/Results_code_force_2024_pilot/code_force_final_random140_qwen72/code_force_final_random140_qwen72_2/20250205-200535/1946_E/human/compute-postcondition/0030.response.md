The code snippet `i -= 1` decrements the value of `i` by 1. Given the initial state, let's determine the new value of `i` and the overall state after executing this line.

### Initial State:
- `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are integers such that 1 ≤ M1, M2 ≤ N ≤ 2 * 10^5.
- `L` is a list of integers of length `M1` where 1 ≤ L[i] ≤ N and `L` is strictly increasing.
- `R` is a list of integers provided by the user input, where each element is an integer.
- The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`.
- `L[0]` is 1 and `R[-1]` is `N`.
- `M1` is greater than 1.
- `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 4`.
- `i` is `L[-1] - 2` and `L[-1]` must be greater than or equal to 4.
- If `i == L[cur]`, then `cur` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1) * (L[-1] - 3) % MOD`.

### Impact of the Code:
- The value of `i` is decremented by 1.

### Calculation:
- Initially, `i` is `L[-1] - 2`.
- After executing `i -= 1`, the new value of `i` is `L[-1] - 3`.

### Updated State:
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

### Output State:
**`N`, `M1`, and `M2` are integers such that 1 ≤ M1, M2 ≤ N ≤ 2 * 10^5. `L` is a list of integers of length `M1` where 1 ≤ L[i] ≤ N and `L` is strictly increasing. `R` is a list of integers provided by the user input, where each element is an integer. The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. `L[0]` is 1 and `R[-1]` is `N`. `M1` is greater than 1. `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 4`. `i` is `L[-1] - 3`. `L[-1]` must be greater than or equal to 4. If `i == L[cur]`, then `cur` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1) * (L[-1] - 3) % MOD`.**
