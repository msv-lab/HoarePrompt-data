To determine the output state, we need to consider the function `func_1` and its impact on the variables `c` and `d`. Since the function `func_1` is not defined in the provided code, we can only infer the changes based on the typical behavior of such functions.

Given:
- `a` is an integer.
- `b` is a list of integers, and the length of `b` is at least 1.
- `c, d = func_1(b, 1000000007)`

Assuming `func_1` returns two values, `c` and `d`, which are derived from the list `b` and the integer `1000000007`, the specific values of `c` and `d` depend on the implementation of `func_1`.

However, without the definition of `func_1`, we can only state that `c` and `d` are now assigned the values returned by `func_1(b, 1000000007)`.

Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is a list of integers with at least one element, `c` and `d` are the values returned by `func_1(b, 1000000007)`.**
