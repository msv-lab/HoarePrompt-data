Postcondition: ***`i` is incremented by 1, `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `L`, `R`, and `nums_left` are each decremented by 1. If `i == R[cur]`, `cur` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `ans * (nums_left + 1) % MOD`. Regardless of the condition, `ans` may be updated to `ans * (nums_left) % MOD` if the else part is executed.***
