The code snippet `nums_left -= 1` decrements the value of `nums_left` by 1. Let's analyze the impact of this operation on the program state:

- The initial value of `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 2`.
- After executing `nums_left -= 1`, the new value of `nums_left` will be `L[-1] - 3`.

All other variables (`N`, `M1`, `M2`, `L`, `R`, `ans`, `i`, `cur`, `MOD`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N`, `M1`, and `M2` are integers such that 1 ≤ M1, M2 ≤ N ≤ 2 * 10^5. `L` is a list of integers of length `M1` where 1 ≤ L[i] ≤ N and `L` is strictly increasing. `R` is a list of integers provided by the user input, where each element is an integer. The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. `L[0]` is 1 and `R[-1]` is `N`. `M1` is greater than 1. `ans` is the result of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`. `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 3`. `i` is `L[-1] - 1`. If `i` is equal to `L[cur]`, then `cur` is updated to `M1 - 3`. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to the result of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` multiplied by `nums_left` modulo `MOD`.**
