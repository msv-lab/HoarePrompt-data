The code snippet `nums_left -= 1` decrements the value of `nums_left` by 1. Given the initial state, `nums_left` is initially set to `L[-1] - 3`. After decrementing, `nums_left` becomes `L[-1] - 4`.

All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`N`, `M1`, and `M2` are integers such that 1 ≤ M1, M2 ≤ N ≤ 2 * 10^5. `L` is a list of integers of length `M1` where 1 ≤ L[i] ≤ N and `L` is strictly increasing. `R` is a list of integers provided by the user input, where each element is an integer. The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. `L[0]` is 1 and `R[-1]` is `N`. `M1` is greater than 1. `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 4`. `i` is `L[-1] - 2` and `L[-1]` must be greater than or equal to 4. If `i == L[cur]`, then `cur` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1) * (L[-1] - 3) % MOD`.**
