The code snippet updates the value of `ans` by multiplying it with `nums_left` and taking the modulus with `MOD`. Let's break down the changes:

- `ans` was initially the result of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`.
- `nums_left` is defined as `L[-1] - 3`.
- The new value of `ans` is calculated as `ans * nums_left % MOD`.

Given the initial state:
- `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are integers such that 1 ≤ M1, M2 ≤ N ≤ 2 * 10^5.
- `L` is a list of integers of length `M1` where 1 ≤ L[i] ≤ N and `L` is strictly increasing.
- `R` is a list of integers provided by the user input, where each element is an integer.
- The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`.
- `L[0]` is 1 and `R[-1]` is `N`.
- `M1` is greater than 1.
- `ans` is the result of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`.
- `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 3`.
- `i` is `L[-1] - 2` and `L[-1]` must be greater than or equal to 4.

After executing the code:
- `ans` is updated to `ans * (L[-1] - 3) % MOD`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`N`, `M1`, and `M2` are integers such that 1 ≤ M1, M2 ≤ N ≤ 2 * 10^5. `L` is a list of integers of length `M1` where 1 ≤ L[i] ≤ N and `L` is strictly increasing. `R` is a list of integers provided by the user input, where each element is an integer. The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. `L[0]` is 1 and `R[-1]` is `N`. `M1` is greater than 1. `ans` is `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1) * (L[-1] - 3) % MOD`. `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 3`. `i` is `L[-1] - 2` and `L[-1]` must be greater than or equal to 4.**
