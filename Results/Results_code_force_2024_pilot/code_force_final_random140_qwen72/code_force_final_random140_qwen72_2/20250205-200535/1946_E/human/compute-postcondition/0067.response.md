Functionality: ** The function `func_2` processes two strictly increasing lists of integers, `L` and `R`, and an integer `N`, under the constraints that 1 ≤ M1, M2 ≤ N ≤ 2 * 10^5, where `M1` and `M2` are the lengths of `L` and `R` respectively. The function returns 0 if any of the following conditions are met: the last element of `L` is not equal to the first element of `R`, `L[0]` is not 1, `R[-1]` is not `N`, or if both `M1` and `M2` are greater than 1 and `L[-2]` equals `R[1]`. Otherwise, it computes a value `ans` based on the lengths of `L` and `R` and the results of `func_1`. Specifically, if `M1` > 1, `ans` is the product of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` and a sequence of `nums_left` values from `L[-1] - 2` down to 2, all taken modulo `MOD`. If `M1` ≤ 1, `ans` is simply the result of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`. If `M2` > 1, `ans` is further modified by the product of `nums_left` values from `L[-1] - 2` down to 2, all taken modulo `MOD`. If `M2` ≤ 1, `ans` remains the result of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`. The function ultimately returns `ans`. **
