To determine the output state, we need to consider the function `func_1(b, a)` and its impact on the variables `c` and `d`. Since the function `func_1` is not defined in the provided code, we can only assume that it returns two values which are assigned to `c` and `d`.

Given the initial state:
- `a` and `b` are integers where `b > 0` and `a < b`.

After executing the code:
- `c` and `d` are assigned the values returned by `func_1(b, a)`.
- The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers where `b > 0` and `a < b`; `c` and `d` are the values returned by `func_1(b, a)`.**
