Output State: **`N`, `M1`, and `M2` are integers such that 1 ≤ M1, M2 ≤ N ≤ 2 * 10^5. `L` is a list of integers of length `M1` where 1 ≤ L[i] ≤ N and `L` is strictly increasing. `R` is a list of integers provided by the user input, where each element is an integer. The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. `L[0]` is 1 and `R[-1]` is `N`. `M1` is greater than 1. `ans` is the result of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`. `cur` is `M1 - 3`. `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 2`. `i` is `L[-1] - 1`. Additionally, `i` is equal to `L[cur + 1]`.**

Explanation: The value of `cur` is decremented by 1, changing from `M1 - 2` to `M1 - 3`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
