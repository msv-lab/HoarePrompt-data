Output State: **a and b are integers where b > 0, and a is greater than or equal to b, and a is not divisible by b; c and d are the results of `func_1(b, a % b)`**. 

This means that the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged, but `c` and `d` now hold the values returned by the function `func_1` when called with arguments `b` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b`.
