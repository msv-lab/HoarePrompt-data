To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the conditions in the loop head:

The loop condition is:
```
while i < N:
```

The relevant variables in the loop head are `i` and `N`.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 2 * 10^5.
- `i` is `R[0] + 1`.

For the loop to execute at least once, the condition `i < N` must be true.

Let's break this down:
- `i` is set to `R[0] + 1`.
- `N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 2 * 10^5.

For the loop to execute, `i` must be less than `N`. Therefore, `R[0] + 1` must be less than `N`.

This means:
- `R[0] + 1 < N`
- `R[0] < N - 1`

Since `N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 2 * 10^5, `R[0]` must be an integer such that `R[0] < N - 1`.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `R[0]` is less than `N - 1`.

State: **`N`, `M1`, and `M2` remain integers such that 1 ≤ M1, M2 ≤ N ≤ 2 * 10^5. `L` remains a list of integers of length `M1` where 1 ≤ L[i] ≤ N and `L` is strictly increasing. `R` remains a list of integers provided by the user input, where each element is an integer. The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. `L[0]` is 1 and `R[-1]` is `N`. If `M1` > 1, `ans` is the final result of the loop's computation, which is the product of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` and the sequence of `nums_left` values from `L[-1] - 2` down to 2, all taken modulo `MOD`. `cur` is `1`. `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 1`. `i` is `R[0] + 1`. If `M1` ≤ 1, `ans` remains the result of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`, and `cur` is `1`. Additionally, `M2` is greater than 1. `R[0]` must be less than `N - 1`.**
