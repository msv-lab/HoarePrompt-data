Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `L`, `R`, and `nums_left` are each decremented by 1. If `i == R[cur]`, `cur` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `ans * (nums_left + 1) % MOD`. `nums_left` is now `nums_left - 1`.** 

Explanation:
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `L`, `R`, and `nums_left` are each decremented by 1.
- If `i` equals `R[cur]`, then `cur` is incremented by 1.
- If `i` does not equal `R[cur]`, then `ans` is updated to `ans * (nums_left + 1) % MOD`.
- Regardless of the condition, `nums_left` is now `nums_left - 1`.
