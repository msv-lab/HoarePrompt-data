Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `L`, `R`, and `nums_left` are each decremented by 1, `cur` is incremented by 1 if `i == R[cur]`, otherwise `ans` is updated to `ans * (nums_left + 1) % MOD`.**

Explanation:
- `nums_left` is decremented by 1.
- All other conditions from the initial state remain unchanged:
  - `i` is incremented by 1.
  - `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `L`, and `R` remain unchanged.
  - If `i == R[cur]`, `cur` is incremented by 1.
  - Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `ans * nums_left % MOD`, but since `nums_left` was just decremented, the actual calculation is `ans * (nums_left + 1) % MOD`.
