To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition and the relevant variables:

### Loop Condition
The loop condition is:
```python
while i > 1:
```
This means the loop will continue executing as long as `i` is greater than 1.

### Current State
- `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are integers such that 1 ≤ M1, M2 ≤ N ≤ 2 * 10^5.
- `L` is a list of integers of length `M1` where 1 ≤ L[i] ≤ N and `L` is strictly increasing.
- `R` is a list of integers provided by the user input, where each element is an integer.
- The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`.
- `L[0]` is 1 and `R[-1]` is `N`.
- `M1` is greater than 1.
- `ans` is the result of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`.
- `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 3`.
- `i` is `L[-1] - 2`.

### Analysis
- The variable `i` is the only one in the loop head that affects the loop condition.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be greater than 1.

### Adjusting the State
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `L[-1] - 2`.
- To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `i` must be greater than 1.

Given that `L` is strictly increasing and `L[0]` is 1, the smallest possible value for `L[-1]` is 2 (since `M1` is greater than 1). Therefore, `i = L[-1] - 2` must be at least 0. However, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be greater than 1.

Thus, the state of `i` needs to be adjusted to ensure it is greater than 1. Since `i` is `L[-1] - 2`, we need to ensure that `L[-1]` is at least 4 to make `i` greater than 1.

### Final State
State: **`N`, `M1`, and `M2` are integers such that 1 ≤ M1, M2 ≤ N ≤ 2 * 10^5. `L` is a list of integers of length `M1` where 1 ≤ L[i] ≤ N and `L` is strictly increasing. `R` is a list of integers provided by the user input, where each element is an integer. The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. `L[0]` is 1 and `R[-1]` is `N`. `M1` is greater than 1. `ans` is the result of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`. `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 3`. `i` is `L[-1] - 2` and `L[-1]` must be greater than or equal to 4.**
