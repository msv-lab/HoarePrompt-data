Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `N`, `M1`, and `M2` remain integers such that 1 ≤ M1, M2 ≤ N ≤ 2 * 10^5. `L` remains a list of integers of length `M1` where 1 ≤ L[i] ≤ N and `L` is strictly increasing. `R` remains a list of integers provided by the user input, where each element is an integer. The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. `L[0]` is 1 and `R[-1]` is `N`. If `M1` > 1, `ans` is the final result of the loop's computation, which is the product of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` and the sequence of `nums_left` values from `L[-1] - 2` down to 2, all taken modulo `MOD`. `cur` is `1`. `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 1`. `i` is `R[0] + 1`. If `M1` ≤ 1, `ans` remains the result of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`, and `cur` is `1`. Additionally, `M2` is greater than 1.
Code of the loop:
while i < N:
    if i == R[cur]:
        cur += 1
    else:
        ans = ans * nums_left % MOD
    nums_left -= 1
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is incremented by 1, `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `L`, `R`, `cur`, `ans`, and `nums_left` remain unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `i` is incremented by 1, `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `L`, `R`, and `nums_left` are each decremented by 1, `cur` is incremented by 1 if `i == R[cur]`, otherwise `ans` is updated to `ans * (nums_left + 1) % MOD`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `i` is incremented by 1, `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `L`, `R`, and `nums_left` are each decremented by 1. If `i == R[cur]`, `cur` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `ans * (nums_left + 1) % MOD`. `nums_left` is now `nums_left - 1`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
