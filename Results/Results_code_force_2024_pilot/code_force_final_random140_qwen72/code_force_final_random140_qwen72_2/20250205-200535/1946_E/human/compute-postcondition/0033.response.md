The given code snippet updates the value of `ans` by multiplying it with `nums_left` and taking the modulus with `MOD`. Let's break down the changes:

- `ans` is updated to `ans * nums_left % MOD`.
- `nums_left` is defined as `L[-1] - 4`.
- `L[-1]` is the last element of the list `L`.

Given the initial state:
- `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are integers such that 1 ≤ M1, M2 ≤ N ≤ 2 * 10^5.
- `L` is a list of integers of length `M1` where 1 ≤ L[i] ≤ N and `L` is strictly increasing.
- `R` is a list of integers provided by the user input, where each element is an integer.
- The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`.
- `L[0]` is 1 and `R[-1]` is `N`.
- `M1` is greater than 1.
- `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 4`.
- `i` is `L[-1] - 3`.
- `L[-1]` must be greater than 4.
- If `i == L[cur]`, then `cur` is decreased by 1.
- Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1) * (L[-1] - 3) % MOD`.

After executing the code snippet:
- `ans` is updated to `ans * (L[-1] - 4) % MOD`.

The rest of the variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N`, `M1`, and `M2` are integers such that 1 ≤ M1, M2 ≤ N ≤ 2 * 10^5. `L` is a list of integers of length `M1` where 1 ≤ L[i] ≤ N and `L` is strictly increasing. `R` is a list of integers provided by the user input, where each element is an integer. The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. `L[0]` is 1 and `R[-1]` is `N`. `M1` is greater than 1. `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 4`. `i` is `L[-1] - 3`. `L[-1]` must be greater than 4. If `i == L[cur]`, then `cur` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1) * (L[-1] - 3) % MOD`. `ans` is now `ans * (L[-1] - 4) % MOD`.**
