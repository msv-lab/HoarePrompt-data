Postcondition: **`N`, `M1`, and `M2` remain integers such that 1 ≤ M1, M2 ≤ N ≤ 2 * 10^5. `L` remains a list of integers of length `M1` where 1 ≤ L[i] ≤ N and `L` is strictly increasing. `R` remains a list of integers provided by the user input, where each element is an integer. The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. `L[0]` is 1 and `R[-1]` is `N`. If `M1` > 1, `ans` is the final result of the loop's computation, which is the product of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` and the sequence of `nums_left` values from `L[-1] - 2` down to 2, all taken modulo `MOD`. `cur` is `1`. `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 1`. `i` is `R[0] + 1`. If `M1` ≤ 1, `ans` remains the result of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`, and `cur` is `1`. Additionally, `M2` is greater than 1. `R[0]` must be less than `N - 1`. `i` is not equal to `R[cur]`.**
