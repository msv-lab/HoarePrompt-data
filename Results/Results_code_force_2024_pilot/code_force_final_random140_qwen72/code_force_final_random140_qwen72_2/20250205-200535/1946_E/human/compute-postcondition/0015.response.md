Output State: **`N`, `M1`, and `M2` are integers such that 1 ≤ M1, M2 ≤ N ≤ 2 * 10^5. `L` is a list of integers of length `M1` where 1 ≤ L[i] ≤ N and `L` is strictly increasing. `R` is a list of integers provided by the user input, where each element is an integer. The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. `L[0]` is 1 and `R[-1]` is `N`. `M1` is greater than 1. `ans` is the result of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`. `cur` is `M1 - 2`. `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 2`.** 

Explanation: The code snippet assigns the value `L[-1] - 2` to the variable `nums_left`. Since `L[-1]` is the last element of the list `L`, which is also the first element of the list `R`, and given that `L[-1]` is an integer within the range [1, N], the value of `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 2`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
