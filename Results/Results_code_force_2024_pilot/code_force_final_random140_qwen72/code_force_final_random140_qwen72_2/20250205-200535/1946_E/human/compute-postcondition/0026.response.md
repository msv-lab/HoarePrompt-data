The code snippet `cur -= 1` decrements the value of `cur` by 1. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `cur`, we cannot determine its exact new value, but we know it has been decreased by 1.

Output State: **`N`, `M1`, and `M2` are integers such that 1 ≤ M1, M2 ≤ N ≤ 2 * 10^5. `L` is a list of integers of length `M1` where 1 ≤ L[i] ≤ N and `L` is strictly increasing. `R` is a list of integers provided by the user input, where each element is an integer. The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. `L[0]` is 1 and `R[-1]` is `N`. `M1` is greater than 1. `ans` is the result of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`. `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 3`. `i` is `L[-1] - 2` and `L[-1]` must be greater than or equal to 4. `cur` is decreased by 1.**
