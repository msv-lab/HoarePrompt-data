Output State: **`N`, `M1`, and `M2` are integers such that 1 ≤ M1, M2 ≤ N ≤ 2 * 10^5. `L` is a list of integers of length `M1` where 1 ≤ L[i] ≤ N and `L` is strictly increasing. `R` is a list of integers provided by the user input, where each element is an integer. The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. `L[0]` is 1 and `R[-1]` is `N`. `M1` is greater than 1. `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 5`. `i` is `L[-1] - 4`. `L[-1]` must be greater than 4. If `i == L[cur]`, then `cur` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1) * (L[-1] - 3) % MOD` and then further updated to `ans * (L[-1] - 5) % MOD`.**

Explanation:
- The initial value of `i` was `L[-1] - 3`.
- The code `i -= 1` decrements `i` by 1.
- Therefore, the new value of `i` is `L[-1] - 4`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
