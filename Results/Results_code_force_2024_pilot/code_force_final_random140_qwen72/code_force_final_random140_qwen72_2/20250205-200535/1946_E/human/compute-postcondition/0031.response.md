To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition and the relevant variables:

The loop condition is:
```
while i > 1:
```

The variable `i` is the only one involved in the loop condition. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be greater than 1.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is `L[-1] - 3`
- `L[-1]` must be greater than or equal to 4

Given these conditions, let's check if `i` is greater than 1:
- Since `L[-1]` is at least 4, `i` is at least `4 - 3 = 1`.

However, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be greater than 1. Therefore, `L[-1]` must be greater than 4 to ensure that `i` is greater than 1.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `L[-1]` is greater than 4, which will make `i` greater than 1.

State: **`N`, `M1`, and `M2` are integers such that 1 ≤ M1, M2 ≤ N ≤ 2 * 10^5. `L` is a list of integers of length `M1` where 1 ≤ L[i] ≤ N and `L` is strictly increasing. `R` is a list of integers provided by the user input, where each element is an integer. The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. `L[0]` is 1 and `R[-1]` is `N`. `M1` is greater than 1. `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 4`. `i` is `L[-1] - 3`. `L[-1]` must be greater than 4. If `i == L[cur]`, then `cur` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1) * (L[-1] - 3) % MOD`.**
