Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts no parameters directly but operates under the constraints that `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are integers such that 1 ≤ M1, M2 ≤ N ≤ 2 * 10^5. It also uses two lists, `L` and `R`, where `L` is a strictly increasing list of integers of length `M1` (1 ≤ L[i] ≤ N), and `R` is a strictly increasing list of integers of length `M2` (1 ≤ R[i] ≤ N). The function returns 0 in three specific cases (Case_1, Case_2, Case_3). In another case (Case_4), it returns `ans`, which is computed based on the values of `M1` and `M2`. If `M1` > 1, `ans` is the product of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` and a sequence of `nums_left` values from `L[-1] - 2` down to 2, all taken modulo `MOD`. If `M1` ≤ 1, `ans` is the result of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`. If `M2` > 1, `ans` is further modified by the product of `nums_left` values from `L[-1] - 2` down to 2, all taken modulo `MOD`. If `M2` ≤ 1, `ans` remains the result of `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`.**
