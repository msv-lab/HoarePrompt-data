Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program fails to handle the case where the vertices chosen by Bessie are not consecutive and the gap between them is more than 2. For example, consider the input:

```
1
6 3 0
1 3 5
```

The expected output should be `1` because the only triangle that can be formed is using the vertices 1, 3, and 5. However, the program will output `2`, which is incorrect. The issue lies in the logic where the program assumes that a triangle can be formed whenever the difference between consecutive vertices is 2, without considering the possibility of larger gaps.
