Output State: **`t` is an input integer and must be greater than 0 (decremented by 1) - 1, `n` is the new first integer from the input, `x` is the new second integer from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `y` is the new third integer from the input, `arr` is now a sorted list of integers containing the first `x` elements from the original `arr` list plus the element `n + arr[0]`, `ans` is updated based on the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `arr` is 2, `i` is `x + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The code `arr.append(n + arr[0])` adds the value `n + arr[0]` to the end of the list `arr`.
- The initial state specifies that `arr` is a sorted list of integers containing the first `x` elements from the original `arr` list.
- After appending `n + arr[0]` to `arr`, the list `arr` now contains the first `x` elements plus the new element `n + arr[0]`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- The value of `ans` remains based on the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `arr` is 2, but the new element added might affect this count. However, since the exact values of `arr` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact impact on `ans`.
- The state of `i` remains `x + 1`.
