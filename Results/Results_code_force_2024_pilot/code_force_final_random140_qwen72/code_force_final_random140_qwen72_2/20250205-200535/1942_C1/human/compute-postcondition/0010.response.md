To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for i in range(1, x + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The only variable in the loop head is `i`.
   - The loop will iterate over the range from 1 to `x + 1`.

2. **Determine Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if the range `range(1, x + 1)` contains at least one value.
   - For `range(1, x + 1)` to contain at least one value, `x + 1` must be greater than 1.
   - Therefore, `x` must be greater than or equal to 1.

3. **Adjust States:**
   - The state of `i` will be adjusted by the loop itself, starting from 1.
   - The state of `x` must be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute. Specifically, `x` must be at least 1.

### Final Adjusted State:
- `t` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 0 (decremented by 1).
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `x` is the second integer from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `y` is the third integer from the input.
- `arr` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, and `arr` now includes an additional element which is `n + arr[0]`.
- `ans` is `x - 2`.

### Adjusted State:
State: **`t` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 0 (decremented by 1), `n` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `y` is the third integer from the input, `arr` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, and `arr` now includes an additional element which is `n + arr[0]`, `ans` is `x - 2`, `i` is 1**
