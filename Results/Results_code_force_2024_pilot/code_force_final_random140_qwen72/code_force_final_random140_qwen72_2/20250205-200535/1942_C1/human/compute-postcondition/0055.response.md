The code snippet `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. Given the initial state, `ans` is initially `x - 2`. After incrementing `ans` by 1, the new value of `ans` becomes `x - 1`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, and `i`) are not affected by this code snippet, so their values remain the same.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an input integer greater than 0 (decremented by 2), `n` is the new first integer from the input, `x` is the new second integer from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `y` is the new third integer from the input, `arr` is now a sorted list of integers containing the elements from the original `arr` starting from index 0 up to index `x-1` with `n + arr[0]` appended to it, `i` is `x + 2`, and `ans` is `x - 1`.**
