Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an input integer greater than 0, and it is decremented by 2.
2. `n` is the new first integer from the input.
3. `x` is the new second integer from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1.
4. `y` is the new third integer from the input.
5. `arr` is now a sorted list of integers containing the elements from the original `arr` starting from index 0 up to index `x-1` with `n + arr[0]` appended to it.
6. `i` is `x + 1`.
7. `ans` is `x - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `arr` from index 1 to `x` is exactly 2.

### Explanation:
1. **`t`**: This variable is not directly used in the print statement, but it indicates that the input integer is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 2.
2. **`n`**: This is the first new integer from the input.
3. **`x`**: This is the second new integer from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1.
4. **`y`**: This is the third new integer from the input.
5. **`arr`**: This is a sorted list of integers. It contains elements from the original `arr` from index 0 to `x-1`, and it also includes `n + arr[0]` appended to it.
6. **`i`**: This is simply `x + 1`.
7. **`ans`**: This is the value that will be printed. It is calculated as `x - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `arr` from index 1 to `x` is exactly 2.

### Calculation of `ans`:
- **`x - 2`**: This is a fixed part of the calculation.
- **Number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `arr` from index 1 to `x` is exactly 2**: This requires checking the differences between consecutive elements in the sublist `arr[1:x+1]`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume:
- Original `arr` is `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`.
- `n = 2`, `x = 3`, `y = 4`.

1. **New `arr`**:
   - Elements from original `arr` from index 0 to `x-1` (i.e., 0 to 2): `[1, 3, 5]`.
   - Append `n + arr[0]` (i.e., `2 + 1`): `[1, 3, 5, 3]`.
   - Sort the list: `[1, 3, 3, 5]`.

2. **Calculate `ans`**:
   - `x - 2 = 3 - 2 = 1`.
   - Check differences between consecutive elements in `arr[1:4]`:
     - `3 - 1 = 2` (count: 1).
     - `3 - 3 = 0` (count: 1).
     - `5 - 3 = 2` (count: 2).

   - Number of times the difference is exactly 2: 2.

   - Therefore, `ans = 1 + 2 = 3`.

### Final Output:
Output: **3 (where 3 is the value of ans, calculated as x - 2 plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in arr from index 1 to x is exactly 2)**.
