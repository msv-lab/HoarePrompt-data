The code snippet reads input from the user and splits it into three parts, converting each part to an integer and assigning them to `n`, `x`, and `y` respectively. This changes the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` based on the input provided.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 0 (decremented by 1), `n` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input, `y` is the third integer from the input, and the second line consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.**
