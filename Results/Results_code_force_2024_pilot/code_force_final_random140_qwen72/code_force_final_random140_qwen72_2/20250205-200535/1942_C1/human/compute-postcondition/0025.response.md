The code `arr = input().split()` reads a line of input from the user and splits it into a list of strings, which is then assigned to the variable `arr`. This operation changes the value of `arr` from its initial state to a new list of strings.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer and must be greater than 0 (decremented by 1) - 1, `n` is the new first integer from the input, `x` is the new second integer from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `y` is the new third integer from the input, `arr` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `ans` is updated based on the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `arr` is 2, `i` is `x + 1`.**
