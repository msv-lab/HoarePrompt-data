The provided code snippet converts each element in the list `arr` from a string to an integer, iterating over the first `x` elements of `arr`. The updated list `arr` now contains integers instead of strings.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 0 (decremented by 1), `n` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input, `y` is the third integer from the input, `arr` is a list of integers containing the second line of input which consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`.**
