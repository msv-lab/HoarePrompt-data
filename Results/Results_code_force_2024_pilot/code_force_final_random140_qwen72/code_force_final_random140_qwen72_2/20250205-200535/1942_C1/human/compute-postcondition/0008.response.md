Output State: **`t` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 0 (decremented by 1), `n` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input, `y` is the third integer from the input, `arr` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, and `arr` now includes an additional element which is `n + arr[0]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not modified by the code.
- The values of `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged as they were not modified by the code.
- The list `arr` originally contains `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, and it is now appended with the value `n + arr[0]`. This new element is added to the end of the list.
