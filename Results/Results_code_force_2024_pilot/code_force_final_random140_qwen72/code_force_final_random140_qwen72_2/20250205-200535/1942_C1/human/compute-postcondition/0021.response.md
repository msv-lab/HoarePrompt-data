To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 0 (decremented by 1).
   - `n` is the first integer from the input.
   - `x` is the second integer from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - `y` is the third integer from the input.
   - `arr` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`.
   - `arr` now includes an additional element which is `n + arr[0]`.

2. **Processing:**
   - The variable `ans` is updated based on the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `arr` is 2.
   - After all iterations, `ans` will be `x - 2 + k`, where `k` is the number of times the condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] == 2` was true.
   - `i` is `x + 1`.

3. **Explanation:**
   - `arr` initially contains `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`.
   - An additional element `n + arr[0]` is added to `arr`, making the length of `arr` equal to `x + 1`.
   - The condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] == 2` is checked for each pair of consecutive elements in `arr`.
   - The variable `k` counts the number of times this condition is true.
   - The final value of `ans` is calculated as `x - 2 + k`.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - Since `arr` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` plus one additional element `n + arr[0]`, the last element of `arr` will be `n + arr[0]`.
   - The condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] == 2` is checked for each pair of consecutive elements in `arr`.
   - The value of `k` depends on the specific values in `arr`, but it represents the number of times the difference between consecutive elements is 2.
   - Therefore, `ans` will be `x - 2 + k`.

Given the above steps, the output of the `print(ans)` statement will be:

Output: **x - 2 + k (where k is the number of times the condition arr[i] - arr[i - 1] == 2 was true)**
