Output State: **`t` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 0 (decremented by 1), `n` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `y` is the third integer from the input, `arr` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, and `arr` now includes an additional element which is `n + arr[0]`. The variable `ans` is updated based on the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `arr` is 2. After all iterations, `ans` will be `x - 2 + k`, where `k` is the number of times the condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] == 2` was true. `i` is `x + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = x + 1`.
- For each iteration, the loop checks if the difference between the current element `arr[i]` and the previous element `arr[i - 1]` is 2.
- If the condition is true, `ans` is incremented by 1.
- The final value of `ans` will be `x - 2 + k`, where `k` is the number of times the condition was true.
- The loop counter `i` will be `x + 1` after the loop completes.
