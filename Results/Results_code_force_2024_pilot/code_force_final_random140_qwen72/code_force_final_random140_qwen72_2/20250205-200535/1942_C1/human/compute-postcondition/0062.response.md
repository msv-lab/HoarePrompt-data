Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` is 0, `n` is the last first integer from the input, `x` is the last second integer from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `y` is the last third integer from the input, `arr` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` with an additional element `n + arr[0]` appended to it, and `ans` is `x - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `arr` (from index 1 to `x`) is exactly 2.** 

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `t` has been decremented to 0, indicating that no more iterations are left. The variables `n`, `x`, and `y` hold the values from the last set of inputs provided during the last iteration of the loop. The list `arr` contains the sorted integers from the last input, with an additional element `n + arr[0]` appended to it. The variable `ans` holds the final result, which is calculated as `x - 2` plus the count of consecutive pairs in `arr` that have a difference of 2.
