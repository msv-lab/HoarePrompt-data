The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `x`, and `y` respectively. This operation updates the values of these variables based on the new input.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer and must be greater than 0 (decremented by 1) - 1
- `n` is the first integer from the input
- `x` is the second integer from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1
- `y` is the third integer from the input
- `arr` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, and `arr` now includes an additional element which is `n + arr[0]`
- `ans` is updated based on the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `arr` is 2
- `i` is `x + 1`

After executing the code snippet:
- `n`, `x`, and `y` are reassigned to the new values read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer and must be greater than 0 (decremented by 1) - 1, `n` is the new first integer from the input, `x` is the new second integer from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `y` is the new third integer from the input, `arr` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, and `arr` now includes an additional element which is `n + arr[0]`, `ans` is updated based on the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `arr` is 2, `i` is `x + 1`.**
