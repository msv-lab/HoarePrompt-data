Postcondition: ***`t` is 0, `n` is the last first integer from the input, `x` is the last second integer from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `y` is the last third integer from the input, `arr` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` with an additional element `n + arr[0]` appended to it, and `ans` is `x - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `arr` (from index 1 to `x`) is exactly 2.***
