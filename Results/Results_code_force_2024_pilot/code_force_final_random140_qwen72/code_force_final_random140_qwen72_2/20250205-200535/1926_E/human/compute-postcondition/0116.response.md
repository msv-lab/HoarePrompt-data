Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `n` and `k` are the values read from the input, `s` is equal to `k`, `d` is 0, `h` is 0, `p` is `i`, `g` is the sum of the series of `(h + 1) // 2` for each iteration, `f` is `k - g`, `y` is undefined, and `i` is the number of iterations it took for `s` to reach or exceed `k`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `f` is assigned the value `k - g`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `s`, `d`, `h`, `p`, `g`, `y`, `i`) retain their previous values as specified in the initial state.
