Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `n` and `k` are the values read from the input. For each test case, if `k` > `(n + 1) // 2`, then `s` is equal to `k`, `d` is 0, `h` is 0, `p` is `i`, `g` is the sum of the series of `(h + 1) // 2` for each iteration, `f` is `k - g`, and `y` is 2. Otherwise, if `k` ≤ `(n + 1) // 2`, then `s` is 0, `d` is `n`, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, `f` is undefined, `y` is undefined, and `i` is 0.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: The number of test cases remains unchanged as it is defined before the loop starts.
- **`n` and `k`**: These are the input values for each test case and are read from the input.
- **If `k` > `(n + 1) // 2`:**
  - **`s`**: After the loop, `s` will be equal to `k` because the loop continues until `s` reaches or exceeds `k`.
  - **`d`**: `d` will be 0 because the loop reduces `d` by `(d + 1) // 2` until `d` becomes 0.
  - **`h`**: Similarly, `h` will be 0 because it is reduced by `(h + 1) // 2` in the second part of the loop.
  - **`p`**: `p` will be equal to `i`, which is the number of iterations it took to reach `s = k`.
  - **`g`**: `g` is the sum of the series `(h + 1) // 2` for each iteration.
  - **`f`**: `f` is calculated as `k - g`.
  - **`y`**: `y` is calculated as `2 ** (i - 1) * f`.
- **If `k` ≤ `(n + 1) // 2`:**
  - **`s`**: Remains 0 because the condition `k > (n + 1) // 2` is not met.
  - **`d`**: Remains `n` because the loop does not modify `d` in this case.
  - **`h`**: Remains `n` because the loop does not modify `h` in this case.
  - **`p`**: Remains 1 because the loop does not modify `p` in this case.
  - **`g`**: Remains 0 because the loop does not modify `g` in this case.
  - **`f`**: Remains undefined because the loop does not calculate `f` in this case.
  - **`y`**: Remains undefined because the loop does not calculate `y` in this case.
  - **`i`**: Remains 0 because the loop does not modify `i` in this case.

This output state reflects the final values of the variables after the loop has executed all its iterations for each test case.
