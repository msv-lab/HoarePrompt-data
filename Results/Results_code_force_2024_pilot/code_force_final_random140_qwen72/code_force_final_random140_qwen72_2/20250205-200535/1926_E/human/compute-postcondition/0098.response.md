To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and its impact on the variables:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4
- `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9
- `n` and `k` are the values read from the input
- `s` is `(d + 1) // 2 + (d + 1) // 2`
- `d` is `(n - (n + 1) // 2) - ((n - (n + 1) // 2) + 1) // 2`
- `d` must be greater than 0
- `h` is `n`
- `p` is 1
- `g` is 0
- `f` is undefined
- `y` is undefined
- `i` is 2
- `d + 1 < k`

### Code:
```
s += (d + 1) // 2
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial Value of `s`:**
   - `s` is initially defined as `(d + 1) // 2 + (d + 1) // 2`.
   - Simplifying, `s = (d + 1) // 2 + (d + 1) // 2 = 2 * ((d + 1) // 2)`.

2. **Value of `d`:**
   - `d` is defined as `(n - (n + 1) // 2) - ((n - (n + 1) // 2) + 1) // 2`.
   - Let's break it down:
     - `n + 1` is an even number if `n` is odd, and an odd number if `n` is even.
     - `(n + 1) // 2` is the integer division of `n + 1` by 2.
     - `n - (n + 1) // 2` simplifies to `n - (n // 2 + 1 // 2)`.
     - For even `n`, `n - (n // 2) = n - n // 2`.
     - For odd `n`, `n - (n // 2 + 1) = n - (n // 2 + 1)`.
     - The second part `((n - (n + 1) // 2) + 1) // 2` further reduces the value.
   - Given `d` must be greater than 0, the exact value of `d` depends on `n`.

3. **Update of `s`:**
   - The code `s += (d + 1) // 2` adds `(d + 1) // 2` to the current value of `s`.
   - Since `s` was initially `2 * ((d + 1) // 2)`, adding `(d + 1) // 2` results in:
     - `s = 2 * ((d + 1) // 2) + (d + 1) // 2 = 3 * ((d + 1) // 2)`.

### Output State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4
- `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9
- `n` and `k` are the values read from the input
- `s` is now `3 * ((d + 1) // 2)`
- `d` is `(n - (n + 1) // 2) - ((n - (n + 1) // 2) + 1) // 2`
- `d` must be greater than 0
- `h` is `n`
- `p` is 1
- `g` is 0
- `f` is undefined
- `y` is undefined
- `i` is 2
- `d + 1 < k`

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `n` and `k` are the values read from the input, `s` is `3 * ((d + 1) // 2)`, `d` is `(n - (n + 1) // 2) - ((n - (n + 1) // 2) + 1) // 2`, `d` must be greater than 0, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, `f` is undefined, `y` is undefined, `i` is 2, and `d + 1 < k`.**
