The code assigns the value of `k - g` to the variable `f`. Since `g` is the sum of the series `(h + 1) // 2` for each iteration, and `k` is a known integer, the value of `f` can be calculated as `k - g`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `n` and `k` are the values read from the input, `s` is equal to `k`, `d` is 0, `h` is 0, `p` is `i`, `g` is the sum of the series of `(h + 1) // 2` for each iteration, `f` is `k - g`, `y` is undefined, and `i` is the number of iterations it took for `s` to reach or exceed `k`.**
