Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `n` and `k` are the values read from the input. If `k` > `(n + 1) // 2`, then `s` is equal to `k`, `d` is 0, `h` is 0, `p` is `i`, `g` is the sum of the series of `(h + 1) // 2` for each iteration, `f` is `k - g`, and `y` is 2. Otherwise, `s` is 0, `d` is `n`, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, `f` is undefined, `y` is undefined, and `i` is 0.***
