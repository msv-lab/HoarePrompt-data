To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the conditions in the loop head: `s < k` and `d > 0`.

### Initial State:
- `s` is 0
- `d` is `n`
- `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9

### Analysis:
1. **Condition `s < k`:**
   - `s` is 0.
   - For `s < k` to be true, `k` must be greater than 0.
   - Given that `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, this condition is already satisfied because `k` is at least 1.

2. **Condition `d > 0`:**
   - `d` is `n`.
   - For `d > 0` to be true, `n` must be greater than 0.
   - Given that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, this condition is also already satisfied because `n` is at least 1.

Since both conditions `s < k` and `d > 0` are already satisfied with the given initial state, no adjustments are needed.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `n` and `k` are the values read from the input, `s` is 0, `d` is `n`, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, `f` is undefined, `y` is undefined, `i` is 0**
