Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `n` and `k` are the values read from the input, `s` is `k`, `i` is at least 2, `d` is 0, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is `(n + 1) // 2`, and `k` is greater than `(n + 1) // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `g` is updated to `(h + 1) // 2`.
- Since `h` is `n`, the new value of `g` is `(n + 1) // 2`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `s`, `i`, `d`, `h`, `p`) remain unchanged.
- The condition `k` is greater than `(n + 1) // 2` is still valid.
