Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `n` and `k` are the values read from the input, `s` is `(d + 1) // 2 + (d + 1) // 2`, `d` is `(n - (n + 1) // 2) - ((n - (n + 1) // 2) + 1) // 2`, `d` must be greater than 0, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, `f` is undefined, `y` is undefined, `i` is 2.**

Explanation:
- The variable `i` was initially 1.
- The code `i += 1` increments `i` by 1.
- Therefore, `i` is now 2.
- All other variables remain unchanged and retain their initial values or conditions.
