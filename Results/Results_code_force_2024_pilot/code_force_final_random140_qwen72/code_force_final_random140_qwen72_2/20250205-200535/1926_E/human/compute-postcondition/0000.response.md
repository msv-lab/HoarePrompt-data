To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the conditions that affect the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
```

The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute at least once, `int(input())` must be greater than 0.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Input Value**: The loop will execute based on the value provided by `int(input())`.
2. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute if `int(input())` is greater than 0.
3. **Initial State**: The initial state includes `t`, `n`, and `k` with their respective constraints, but these are not directly involved in the loop head.

### Adjusted State:
- The loop will execute if the input value is greater than 0.
- The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the input value is greater than 0.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
