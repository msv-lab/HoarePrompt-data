Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `n` and `k` are the values read from the input, `s` is `(d + 1) // 2`, `d` is `n`, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, `f` is undefined, `y` is undefined, `i` is 0**

Explanation:
- The value of `s` is updated to `s + (d + 1) // 2`.
- Since `d` is initially `n`, the new value of `s` becomes `(n + 1) // 2`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `h`, `p`, `g`, `f`, `y`, `i`) remain unchanged.
