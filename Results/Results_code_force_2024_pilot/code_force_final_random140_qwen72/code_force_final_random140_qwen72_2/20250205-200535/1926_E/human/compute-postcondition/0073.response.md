Output State: **`i` is at least 2, `g` is updated to `g + (h + 1) // 2`, `h` is now `h - (h + 1) // 2 - (h - (h + 1) // 2 + 1) // 2`, `p` is increased by 2.**

Explanation:
- The value of `p` is increased by 1, so if it was previously increased by 1, it is now increased by 2.
- The values of `i`, `g`, and `h` remain unchanged from their initial state as they are not affected by the given code snippet.
