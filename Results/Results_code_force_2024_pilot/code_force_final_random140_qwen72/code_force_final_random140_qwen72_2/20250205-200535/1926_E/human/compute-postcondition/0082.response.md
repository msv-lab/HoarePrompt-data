The provided code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k`. Let's analyze the impact of this code on the program:

- The initial state specifies that `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and they are read from the input.
- The code snippet `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads these values from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k`.

Since the initial state already indicates that `n` and `k` are read from the input, the code snippet does not change the values of `n` and `k` from their initial state. However, it confirms that these values are indeed set based on the input.

The other variables (`t`, `s`, `d`, `h`, `p`, `g`, `f`, and `y`) are not affected by this code snippet, so their values remain the same as in the initial state.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `n` and `k` are the values read from the input, `s` is 0, `d` is `n`, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, `f` is undefined, and `y` is undefined.**
