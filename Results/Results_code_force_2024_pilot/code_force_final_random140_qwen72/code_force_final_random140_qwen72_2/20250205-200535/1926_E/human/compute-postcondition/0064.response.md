The value of `h` is updated by subtracting `(h + 1) // 2` from itself. This operation effectively reduces `h` by half, rounding down if necessary. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of `g` is also not affected by the current code snippet, but it was previously updated to `g + (h + 1) // 2`.

Output State: **`i` is at least 2, `g` is updated to `g + (h + 1) // 2`, `h` is now `h - (h + 1) // 2`.**
