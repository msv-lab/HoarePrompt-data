The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and the context, it seems that the function should accept at least two parameters: `n` and `k`, and possibly a third parameter `t` which represents the number of test cases. 

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4.
- For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9.

The function likely processes multiple test cases, each defined by a pair of integers `n` and `k`. The exact output is not specified, but it is implied that the function returns some result based on the values of `n` and `k` for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `k`. `t` is the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4. For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9. The function returns a result for each test case based on the values of `n` and `k`.**
