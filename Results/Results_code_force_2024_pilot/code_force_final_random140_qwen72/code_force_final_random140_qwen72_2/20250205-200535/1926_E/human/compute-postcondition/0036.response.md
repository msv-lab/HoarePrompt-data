Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `s` is `k`, `i` is the number of iterations it took to reach `s = k`, `d` is 0, `h` is 0, `p` is `i`, `g` is the sum of the series `(n + 1) // 2 + (n - (n + 1) // 2 + 1) // 2 + ...` up to `i` terms, `k` is greater than `(n + 1) // 2`, `f` is `k - g`, `y` is `2 ** (i - 1) * (k - g)`**

Explanation:
- The variable `y` is calculated as `2 ** (i - 1) * f`.
- The value of `f` is `k - g`.
- Therefore, `y` is `2 ** (i - 1) * (k - g)`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `s`, `i`, `d`, `h`, `p`, `g`, `f`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
