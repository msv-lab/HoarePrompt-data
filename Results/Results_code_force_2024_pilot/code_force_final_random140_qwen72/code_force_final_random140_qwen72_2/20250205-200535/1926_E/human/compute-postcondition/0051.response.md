Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `n` and `k` are the values read from the input, `s` is `(d + 1) // 2`, `i` is 0, `d` is `(n - (n + 1) // 2)`, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, `f` is undefined, `y` is undefined.**

Explanation:
- The value of `d` is updated to `d - (d + 1) // 2`.
- Since `d` was initially equal to `n`, the new value of `d` is `n - (n + 1) // 2`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
