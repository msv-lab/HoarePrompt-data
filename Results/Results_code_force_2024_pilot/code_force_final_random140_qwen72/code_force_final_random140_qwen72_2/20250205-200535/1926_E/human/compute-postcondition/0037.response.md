Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4.
- `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
- `s` is set to `k`.
- `i` is the number of iterations it took to reach `s = k`.
- `d` is 0.
- `h` is 0.
- `p` is `i`.
- `g` is the sum of the series \((n + 1) // 2 + (n - (n + 1) // 2 + 1) // 2 + ...\) up to `i` terms.
- `k` is greater than \((n + 1) // 2\).
- `f` is `k - g`.
- `y` is 2.

The `print(y)` statement will print the value of `y`.

Given that `y` is explicitly defined as 2, the output will be:

Output: **2**
