Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `n` and `k` are the values read from the input, `s` is 0.** 

The variable `s` is initialized to 0, while the values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged and retain their initial conditions.
