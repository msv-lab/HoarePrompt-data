Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `n` and `k` are the values read from the input, `s` is `(d + 1) // 2`, `i` is 1, `d` is `(n - (n + 1) // 2)`, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, `f` is undefined, `y` is undefined.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `s`, `d`, `h`, `p`, `g`, `f`, `y`) remain unchanged and retain their initial values or conditions.
