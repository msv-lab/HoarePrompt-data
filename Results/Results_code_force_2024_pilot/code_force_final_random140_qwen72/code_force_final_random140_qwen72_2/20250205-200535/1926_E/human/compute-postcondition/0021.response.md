Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `n` and `k` are the values read from the input, `s` is `k`, `i` is the number of iterations it took to reach `s = k`, `d` is 0, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, and `k` is greater than `(n + 1) // 2`.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`n` and `k`**: These values are read from the input and remain unchanged throughout the loop.
- **`s`**: Initially 0, `s` accumulates the value of `(d + 1) // 2` in each iteration until it reaches or exceeds `k`. After the loop completes, `s` will be equal to `k`.
- **`i`**: This variable counts the number of iterations the loop has executed. It starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration. The final value of `i` will be the number of iterations it took to reach `s = k`.
- **`d`**: Initially set to `n`, `d` decreases by `(d + 1) // 2` in each iteration. After the loop completes, `d` will be 0 because the loop stops when `d` becomes 0.
- **`h`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`p`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`g`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`k`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop, and it is given that `k` is greater than `(n + 1) // 2`.

The loop continues to execute until either `s` reaches or exceeds `k` or `d` becomes 0. Since `k` is greater than `(n + 1) // 2`, the loop will terminate when `s` equals `k`, and `d` will be 0 at that point.
