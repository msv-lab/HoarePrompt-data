The code snippet reads two integers, `n` and `k`, from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. This operation updates the values of `n` and `k` based on the input provided.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `n` and `k` are the values read from the input, `s` is 0, `i` is 0, `d` is `n`, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, `f` is undefined, `y` is undefined.** 

Explanation: The initial conditions for `t`, `n`, and `k` remain valid, but `n` and `k` are now specifically the values read from the input. The variables `s`, `i`, `d`, `h`, `p`, and `g` retain their initial values as specified in the initial state, while `f` and `y` remain undefined because they are not initialized in the given code snippet.
