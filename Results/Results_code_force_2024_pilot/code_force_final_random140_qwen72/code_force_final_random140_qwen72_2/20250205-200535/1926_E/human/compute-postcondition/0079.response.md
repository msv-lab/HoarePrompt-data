Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4.
- `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
- `n` and `k` are the values read from the input.
- `s` is 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `d` is `n`.
- `h` is `n`.
- `p` is 1.
- `g` is 0.
- `f` is undefined.
- `y` is undefined.
- `k` is less than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(2 * k - 1)
```

### Explanation:
- The expression `2 * k - 1` is evaluated.
- `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n and k ≤ (n + 1) // 2.
- Therefore, the value of `2 * k - 1` will be an odd integer between 1 and 2 * ((n + 1) // 2) - 1, inclusive.

### Output:
Output: **2 * k - 1 (where k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n and k ≤ (n + 1) // 2)**
