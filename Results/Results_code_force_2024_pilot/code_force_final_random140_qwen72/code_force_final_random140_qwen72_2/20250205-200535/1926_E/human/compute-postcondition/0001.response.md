The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k`. These values replace the previous placeholders for `n` and `k` in the initial state. The constraints for `n` and `k` remain the same, and the value of `t` (which represents the number of test cases) is not affected by this code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and `n` and `k` are the values read from the input.**
