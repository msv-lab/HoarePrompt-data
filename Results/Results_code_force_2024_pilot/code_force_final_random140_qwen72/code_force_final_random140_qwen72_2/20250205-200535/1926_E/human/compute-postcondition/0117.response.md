Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `n` and `k` are the values read from the input, `s` is equal to `k`, `d` is 0, `h` is 0, `p` is `i`, `g` is the sum of the series of `(h + 1) // 2` for each iteration, `f` is `k - g`, `y` is `2 ** (i - 1) * (k - g)`, and `i` is the number of iterations it took for `s` to reach or exceed `k`.**

Explanation:
- The code assigns the value `2 ** (i - 1) * f` to the variable `y`.
- The value of `f` is calculated as `k - g`, where `g` is the sum of the series of `(h + 1) // 2` for each iteration.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `s`, `d`, `h`, `p`, `i`) remain unchanged.
- The value of `y` is now `2 ** (i - 1) * (k - g)`.
