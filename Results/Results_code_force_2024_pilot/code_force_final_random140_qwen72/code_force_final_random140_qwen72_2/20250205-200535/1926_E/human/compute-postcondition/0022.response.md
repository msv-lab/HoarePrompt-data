To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the loop condition:

```python
while p <= i - 1:
```

The loop will execute if `p` is less than or equal to `i - 1`.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4
- `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9
- `n` and `k` are the values read from the input
- `s` is `k`
- `i` is the number of iterations it took to reach `s = k`
- `d` is 0
- `h` is `n`
- `p` is 1
- `g` is 0
- `k` is greater than `(n + 1) // 2`

The variables in the loop head are `p` and `i`.

For the loop to execute the first time, `p` must be less than or equal to `i - 1`. Given that `p` is 1, the condition simplifies to:
- `1 <= i - 1`

This means:
- `i >= 2`

Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be at least 2.

Since `i` is the number of iterations it took to reach `s = k`, and `s` is already `k` (as given), `i` should be at least 2 for the loop to execute.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `i` is at least 2.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `n` and `k` are the values read from the input, `s` is `k`, `i` is at least 2, `d` is 0, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, and `k` is greater than `(n + 1) // 2`**
