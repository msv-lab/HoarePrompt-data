Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `n` and `k` are the values read from the input, `s` is `(d + 1) // 2 + (d + 1) // 2`, `i` is 1, `d` is `n - (n + 1) // 2`, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, and `k` is greater than `(n + 1) // 2`.**

Explanation:
- `s` was initially `(d + 1) // 2`.
- The code updates `s` by adding `(d + 1) // 2` to its current value.
- Therefore, `s` becomes `(d + 1) // 2 + (d + 1) // 2`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
