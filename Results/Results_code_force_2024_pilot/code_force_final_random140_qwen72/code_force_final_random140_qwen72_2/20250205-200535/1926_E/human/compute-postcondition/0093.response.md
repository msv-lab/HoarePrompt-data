To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions in the loop head:

```python
while s < k and d > 0:
```

### Current State:
- `s` is `(d + 1) // 2`
- `d` is `(n - (n + 1) // 2)`
- `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9

### Conditions for Loop Execution:
1. `s < k`
2. `d > 0`

### Analysis:
- The loop will continue to execute as long as both conditions are true.
- We need to ensure that `s < k` and `d > 0` for the loop to execute one more time.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`s` and `d`** are the variables in the loop head that need to be considered.
- Since `s` is defined as `(d + 1) // 2`, and `d` is defined as `(n - (n + 1) // 2)`, we need to ensure that these definitions hold true for the next iteration.

### Current Values:
- `s` is `(d + 1) // 2`
- `d` is `(n - (n + 1) // 2)`

### Ensuring the Loop Executes One More Time:
- For `s < k` to be true, `s` must be less than `k`.
- For `d > 0` to be true, `d` must be greater than 0.

Given the current state:
- `s` is `(d + 1) // 2`
- `d` is `(n - (n + 1) // 2)`

We need to ensure that:
- `s` remains less than `k`
- `d` remains greater than 0

Since `d` is derived from `n`, and `n` is a fixed value read from the input, `d` will remain constant unless modified within the loop body. However, since we are only adjusting the state for the loop head, we assume `d` remains the same.

### Final State:
- `s` must be less than `k`
- `d` must be greater than 0

Therefore, the state should be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `n` and `k` are the values read from the input, `s` is `(d + 1) // 2` and `s` must be less than `k`, `d` is `(n - (n + 1) // 2)` and `d` must be greater than 0, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, `f` is undefined, `y` is undefined, `i` is 1**
