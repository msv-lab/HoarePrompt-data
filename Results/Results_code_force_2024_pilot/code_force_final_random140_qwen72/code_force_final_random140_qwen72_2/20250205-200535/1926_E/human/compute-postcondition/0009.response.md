To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the conditions in the loop head:

```python
while s < k and d > 0:
```

### Variables in the Loop Head:
- `s`: This variable must be less than `k` for the loop to execute.
- `d`: This variable must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

### Initial State:
- `s` is 0.
- `d` is `n`.

### Analysis:
1. **Condition `s < k`:**
   - `s` is 0.
   - `k` is greater than `(n + 1) // 2`.
   - Since `k` is greater than `(n + 1) // 2`, and `s` is 0, the condition `s < k` is always true initially.

2. **Condition `d > 0`:**
   - `d` is `n`.
   - `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
   - Since `n` is at least 1, `d` is at least 1, so the condition `d > 0` is always true initially.

### Conclusion:
Both conditions `s < k` and `d > 0` are satisfied with the given initial state. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `n` and `k` are the values read from the input, `s` is 0, `i` is 0, `d` is `n`, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, and `k` is greater than `(n + 1) // 2`**
