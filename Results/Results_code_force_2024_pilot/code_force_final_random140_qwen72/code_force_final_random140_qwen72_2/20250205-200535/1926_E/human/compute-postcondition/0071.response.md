Output State: **`i` is at least 2, `g` is updated to `g + (h + 1) // 2`, `h` is now `h - (h + 1) // 2`, `p` is increased by 1, `h` is further reduced by `(h + 1) // 2`**

Explanation:
- The value of `g` is updated to `g + (h + 1) // 2`.
- The value of `h` is first reduced by `(h + 1) // 2`, and then further reduced by `(h + 1) // 2` again.
- The value of `p` is increased by 1.
- The value of `i` remains unchanged and is still at least 2.
