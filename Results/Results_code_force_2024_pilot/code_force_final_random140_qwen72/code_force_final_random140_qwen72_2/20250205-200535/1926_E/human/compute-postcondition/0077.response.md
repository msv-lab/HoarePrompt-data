Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `i` is at least 2.
- `g` is the sum of `(h + 1) // 2` for each iteration.
- `h` is reduced by `(h + 1) // 2` for each iteration until `p` equals `i`.
- `p` is equal to `i`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `s`, `d`, and `y` remain unchanged.
- `f` is now equal to `k - g`.
- `y` is now equal to `2`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(y)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `y` is explicitly stated to be equal to `2` in the initial state.
- Since `y` is not modified after this point, the value of `y` remains `2`.

### Conclusion:
The `print(y)` statement will print the value of `y`, which is `2`.

Output: **2**
