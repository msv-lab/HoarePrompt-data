Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` is at least 2, `g` is the sum of `(h + 1) // 2` for each iteration, `h` is reduced by `(h + 1) // 2` for each iteration until `p` equals `i`, and `p` is equal to `i`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `s`, `d`, and `y` remain unchanged. `f` is now equal to `k - g`. `y` is now equal to `2 ** (i - 1) * (k - g)`.**
