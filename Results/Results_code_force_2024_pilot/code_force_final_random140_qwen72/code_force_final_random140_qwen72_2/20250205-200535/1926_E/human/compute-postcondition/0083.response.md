Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `n` and `k` are the values read from the input, `s` is 0, `d` is `n`, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, `f` is undefined, and `y` is undefined.**

Explanation: The code snippet `s = 0` sets the variable `s` to 0. Since `s` was already 0 in the initial state, no change occurs to `s`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is identical to the initial state.
