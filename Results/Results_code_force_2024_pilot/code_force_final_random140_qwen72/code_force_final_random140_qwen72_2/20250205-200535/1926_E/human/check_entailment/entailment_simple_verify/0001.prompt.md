You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n cards numbered 1, 2, \dots, n . He wants to lay them down in a
row as follows:

  * First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 2 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 3 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 4 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 4 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * And so on, until all cards are laid down. 

What is the k -th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a
card down, he cannot use that card again.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n
\leq 10^9 ) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you
need to output.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the k -th card Vladislav lays
down.

Note

In the first seven test cases, n=7 . Vladislav lays down the cards as follows:

  * First — all the odd-numbered cards in the order 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . 
  * Next — all cards that are twice an odd number in the order 2 , 6 . 
  * Next, there are no remaining cards that are 3 times an odd number. (Vladislav has only one of each card.) 
  * Next — all cards that are 4 times an odd number, and there is only one such card: 4 . 
  * There are no more cards left, so Vladislav stops. 

Thus the order of cards is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 2 , 6 , 4 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Vladislav lays down cards in a specific pattern: first the odd numbers, then the even multiples of odd numbers (2 times odd, 3 times odd, etc.), until all cards are laid down.
   - We need to find the k-th card laid down in this process.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (the total number of cards) and `k` (the position of the card to find).

3. **Handling Odd-Numbered Cards:**
   - If `k` is less than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, the k-th card is an odd number. This is because the first `(n + 1) // 2` cards are the odd numbers in ascending order.
   - The program correctly prints `2 * k - 1` for these cases.

4. **Handling Even-Multiples of Odd Numbers:**
   - If `k` is greater than `(n + 1) // 2`, the k-th card is an even multiple of an odd number.
   - The program uses a loop to calculate the position of the k-th card among the even multiples.
   - It iterates to find the correct multiplier `i` and then calculates the k-th card using the formula `2 ** (i - 1) * f`.

5. **Detailed Steps:**
   - `s` keeps track of the cumulative count of cards laid down.
   - `d` and `h` are used to manage the remaining cards.
   - `p` and `g` are used to manage the cumulative count of cards laid down up to the previous multiplier.
   - The program correctly identifies the multiplier `i` and the position `f` within that multiplier.

6. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly handles both the odd-numbered and even-multiples of odd-numbered cases.
   - The logic for calculating the k-th card is consistent with the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles both the odd-numbered and even-multiples of odd-numbered cases appropriately.
