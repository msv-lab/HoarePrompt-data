Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It handles the two main cases separately:

1. When `k` is within the range of the first half of the sequence (i.e., the odd numbers), it directly calculates the `k`-th odd number.
2. When `k` is beyond the first half, it calculates the position of the `k`-th card among the even multiples of odd numbers.

The program uses a loop to skip over the groups of cards that have already been laid down and then calculates the exact position of the `k`-th card in the sequence. The logic for both cases is implemented correctly, and the program should produce the expected output for the given inputs.
