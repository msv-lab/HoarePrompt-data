The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is non-zero, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) - 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1 to ensure it remains within the valid range and is non-zero.

State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) - 3, `x` is a list of integers read from the input, `n` is `x[0]`, `a` is `x[1]`, `b` is `x[2]`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, `profit` is `n * a`. Otherwise, `k` is the minimum of `n - 1` and `b - a`, and `profit` is `n * a + (b - a) * (k + 1) - k * (k + 1) / 2`.**
