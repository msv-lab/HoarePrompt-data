Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) - 3, `x` is a new list of integers read from the input, `n` is `x[0]`, `a` is `x[1]`, `b` is `x[2]`, and `profit` remains as previously calculated or undefined if not yet calculated.**

Explanation: The value of `n` is updated to be the first element of the list `x`. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `profit` remain unchanged.
