Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) - 3, `x` is a new list of integers read from the input, `n` is `x[0]`, `a` is `x[1]`, `b` is `x[2]`, `profit` is `n * a`, `k` is `b - a`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `k` is calculated as `b - a`.
- All other variables (`t`, `x`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `profit`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
