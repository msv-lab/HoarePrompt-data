The provided Python code snippet reads a space-separated list of integers from the input and assigns it to the variable `x`. This impacts the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`, which are derived from the elements of `x`. The initial state specifies that `n` is `x[0]`, `a` is `x[1]`, and `b` is `x[2]`. After the code executes, these variables will take the values from the new `x`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) - 1, `x` is a list of integers read from the input, `n` is `x[0]`, `a` is `x[1]`, `b` is `x[2]`, `profit` is not yet calculated.**
