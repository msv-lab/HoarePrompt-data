Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) - 3, `x` is a new list of integers read from the input, `n` is `x[0]`, `a` is `x[1]`, `b` is `x[2]`, `profit` is `n * a`.** 

Explanation: The variable `profit` is now assigned the value of `n * a`, where `n` is the first element of the list `x` and `a` is the second element of the list `x`. All other variables remain unchanged.
