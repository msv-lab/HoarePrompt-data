Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) - 3, `x` is a new list of integers read from the input, `n` is `x[0]`, `a` is `x[1]`, `b` is `x[2]`, `profit` is `n * a + (b - a) * (k + 1) - k * (k + 1) / 2`, `k` is `min(n - 1, b - a)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` remains unchanged.
- The list `x` remains unchanged.
- The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
- The value of `profit` is updated to `n * a + (b - a) * (k + 1) - k * (k + 1) / 2`.
- The value of `k` remains `min(n - 1, b - a)`.
