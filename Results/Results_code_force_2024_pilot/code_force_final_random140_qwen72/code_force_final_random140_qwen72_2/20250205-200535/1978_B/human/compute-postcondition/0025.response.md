Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) - 1, `x` is a list of integers read from the input, `n` is `x[0]`, `a` is `x[1]`, `b` is `x[2]`, `profit` is `n * a`, `k` is the minimum of `n - 1` and `b - a`.** 

Explanation:
- The value of `k` is updated to be the minimum of `n - 1` and the original value of `k` (`b - a`).
- All other variables (`t`, `x`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `profit`) remain unchanged.
