Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) - 1, `x` is a list of integers read from the input, `n` is `x[0]`, `a` is `x[1]`, `b` is `x[2]`, `profit` is not yet calculated.**

Explanation: The code snippet `a = x[1]` assigns the value of `x[1]` to the variable `a`. Since `a` was already set to `x[1]` in the initial state, this assignment does not change the value of `a`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
