The code `x = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` reads a line of input, splits it into parts separated by spaces, converts each part to an integer, and stores the resulting list in the variable `x`.

- `t` remains an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
- `n`, `a`, and `b` remain positive integers (1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9).
- `x` is now a list of integers read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers (1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9), `x` is a list of integers read from the input.**
