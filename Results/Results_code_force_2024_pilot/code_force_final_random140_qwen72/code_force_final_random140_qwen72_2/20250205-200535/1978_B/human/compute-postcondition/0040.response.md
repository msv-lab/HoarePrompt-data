Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 3\).
- `x` is a new list of integers read from the input.
- `n` is the first element of the list `x` (i.e., `x[0]`).
- `a` is the second element of the list `x` (i.e., `x[1]`).
- `b` is the third element of the list `x` (i.e., `x[2]`).
- `k` is the minimum of `n - 1` and `b - a` (i.e., `k = min(n - 1, b - a)`).
- `profit` is calculated as `n * a + (b - a) * (k + 1) - k * (k + 1) / 2`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(int(profit))
```

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Determine `k`**:
   - `k = min(n - 1, b - a)`.
   - This means `k` is the smaller value between `n - 1` and `b - a`.

2. **Calculate `profit`**:
   - `profit = n * a + (b - a) * (k + 1) - k * (k + 1) / 2`.
   - Let's break this down further:
     - `n * a` is the product of `n` and `a`.
     - `(b - a) * (k + 1)` is the product of the difference between `b` and `a` and `k + 1`.
     - `k * (k + 1) / 2` is the sum of the first `k` natural numbers (since the sum of the first `k` natural numbers is \( \frac{k(k + 1)}{2} \)).

3. **Combine the terms**:
   - `profit = n * a + (b - a) * (k + 1) - k * (k + 1) / 2`.

4. **Convert `profit` to an integer**:
   - The `int(profit)` function will convert the result to an integer.

### Final Output:
The `print(int(profit))` statement will print the integer value of the calculated profit.

Output: **int(profit) (where profit is calculated as n * a + (b - a) * (k + 1) - k * (k + 1) / 2, with k being the minimum of n - 1 and b - a)**
