The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints given, it is implied that the function likely accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b`. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

- `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
- For each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers (1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9).

Given these parameters, the function is expected to process each test case and return a result based on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.

Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b`. `t` is the number of test cases, and for each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers. The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.**
