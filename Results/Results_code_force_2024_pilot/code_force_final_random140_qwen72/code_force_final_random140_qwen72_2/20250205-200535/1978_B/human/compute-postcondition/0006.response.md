Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is `x[0]`, `a` is `x[1]`, `b` is `x[2]`, `x` is a list of integers read from the input, `profit` is `n * a`.**

Explanation: The variable `profit` is assigned the value of `n * a`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `x` remain unchanged. The new state includes the updated value of `profit` which is the product of `n` and `a`.
