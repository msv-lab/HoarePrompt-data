Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) - 1, `n` is `x[0]`, `a` is `x[1]`, `b` is `x[2]`, `x` is a list of integers read from the input. If `a` ≥ `b`, `profit` is `n * a`. If `a` < `b`, `profit` is `n * a + (b - a) * (k + 1) - k * (k + 1) / 2`, where `k` is the minimum of `n - 1` and `b - a`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` is decremented by 1, so `t` is now an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) - 1.
- The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, `x`, and `profit` remain unchanged.
