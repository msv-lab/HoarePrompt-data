Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) - 3, `x` is a new list of integers read from the input, `n` is `x[0]`, `a` is `x[1]`, `b` is `x[2]`, and `profit` remains as previously calculated or undefined if not yet calculated.**

Explanation: The code snippet `b = x[2]` assigns the value of `x[2]` to the variable `b`. Since `b` was already defined as `x[2]` in the initial state, this assignment does not change the value of `b`. All other variables (`t`, `x`, `n`, `a`, and `profit`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.
