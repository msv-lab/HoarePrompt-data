Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) - 1, `x` is a list of integers read from the input, `n` is `x[0]`, `a` is `x[1]`, `b` is `x[2]`, `profit` is `n * a`, `k` is `b - a`.** 

The variable `k` is assigned the value of `b - a`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
