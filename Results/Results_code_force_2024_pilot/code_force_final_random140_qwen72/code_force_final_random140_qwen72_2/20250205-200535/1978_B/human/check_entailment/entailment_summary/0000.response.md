Reasoning:  
The program aims to calculate the maximum profit Bob can make by selling buns under the given conditions. The logic of the program can be broken down into two main parts:

1. **When `a` is greater than or equal to `b`:**
   - In this case, selling all buns at the usual price `a` is the best strategy because the promotional price would not yield more profit. Thus, the profit is simply `n * a`.

2. **When `a` is less than `b`:**
   - Here, Bob should consider selling some buns at the promotional price to maximize profit. The program calculates the optimal number of buns to sell at the promotional price (`k`) and then computes the total profit.
   - The formula used to calculate the profit when `a < b` is:
     \[
     \text{profit} = n \cdot a + (b - a) \cdot (k + 1) - \frac{k \cdot (k + 1)}{2}
     \]
   - This formula accounts for the profit from the first `k` buns sold at the promotional price and the remaining `n - k` buns sold at the usual price.

The program correctly handles the edge cases and the general logic for calculating the maximum profit. The execution summary confirms that the program processes the input as expected and outputs the correct profit values for each test case.

Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description and the provided execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
