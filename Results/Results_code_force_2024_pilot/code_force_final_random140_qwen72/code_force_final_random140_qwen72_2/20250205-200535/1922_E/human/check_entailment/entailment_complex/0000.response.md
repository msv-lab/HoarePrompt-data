Reasoning:

The provided program aims to solve the problem of generating an array with exactly \(X\) increasing subsequences. However, there are a few issues that need to be addressed to determine its correctness:

1. **Handling of \(X = 1\)**: The program does not handle the case where \(X = 1\). According to the problem statement, \(X\) ranges from 2 to \(10^{18}\), so this specific edge case is not applicable. However, if the program were to be extended to handle \(X = 1\), it would need to return a special case, such as an empty array or a single-element array.

2. **Output Format**: The program prints the length of the array and the array itself, which aligns with the output format specified in the problem statement. However, the program does not explicitly handle the case where no such array can be generated, which is not a concern here since the problem guarantees that \(X\) will always have a solution.

3. **Algorithm Logic**:
   - The program uses a greedy approach to construct the array by alternating between adding the maximum value (starting from 100,000,000) and the minimum value (starting from -100,000,000) based on the parity of \(X\).
   - When \(X\) is even, it divides \(X\) by 2 and appends the current maximum value to the result.
   - When \(X\) is odd, it subtracts 1 from \(X\) and appends the current minimum value to the result.
   - This approach ensures that the resulting array has exactly \(X\) increasing subsequences.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles large values of \(X\) up to \(10^{18}\).
   - The program ensures that the length of the array does not exceed 200, which is a requirement of the problem.

5. **Potential Issues**:
   - The program does not explicitly check if the generated array meets the condition of having exactly \(X\) increasing subsequences. However, the logic used (dividing by 2 for even and subtracting 1 for odd) is mathematically sound and should generate the correct number of subsequences.
   - The program does not handle the case where no such array can be generated, but this is not necessary given the problem constraints.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as specified.

Correctness: **True**
