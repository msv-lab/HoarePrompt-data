The value of `x` is updated to `x // 2`, which means `x` is divided by 2 using integer division. The other variables remain unchanged.

- If the original `x` was even, `x` was originally the input integer divided by 2, and now it becomes `(input integer / 2) // 2`.
- If the original `x` was odd, `x` was originally the input integer minus 1, and now it becomes `(input integer - 1) // 2`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 2
- `x` is either the original input integer divided by 2 if it was even, or the original input integer minus 1 if it was odd.
- `max` is 99999998 if the original `x` was even, or 99999997 if the original `x` was odd.
- `min` is -100000000 if the original `x` was even, or -99999999 if the original `x` was odd.
- `ans` is "99999999 100000000 100000000" if the original `x` was even, or "99999998 99999999 -100000000" if the original `x` was odd, or "99999999 -100000000 100000000" if the original `x` was even and became odd, or "99999998 -99999999 -100000000" if the original `x` was odd and remained odd.
- `t` is 2.

After executing `x = x // 2`:

- If the original `x` was even, `x` is now `(input integer / 2) // 2`.
- If the original `x` was odd, `x` is now `(input integer - 1) // 2`.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is either `(input integer / 2) // 2` if the original `x` was even, or `(input integer - 1) // 2` if the original `x` was odd, `max` is 99999998 if the original `x` was even, or 99999997 if the original `x` was odd, `min` is -100000000 if the original `x` was even, or -99999999 if the original `x` was odd, `ans` is "99999999 100000000 100000000" if the original `x` was even, or "99999998 99999999 -100000000" if the original `x` was odd, or "99999999 -100000000 100000000" if the original `x` was even and became odd, or "99999998 -99999999 -100000000" if the original `x` was odd and remained odd, `t` is 2.**
