The value of `max` is decremented by 1. Since `max` is 99999999 if `x` was initially odd, or 99999998 if `x` was initially even, the new value of `max` will be 99999998 if `x` was initially odd, or 99999997 if `x` was initially even. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is not 1, `max` is 99999998 if `x` was initially odd, or 99999997 if `x` was initially even, `min` is -99999999 if `x` was initially odd, or -100000000 if `x` was initially even, `ans` is "99999998 99999999 100000000" if `x` was initially even, or "99999999 -100000000 100000000" if `x` was initially odd, `t` is 2.**
