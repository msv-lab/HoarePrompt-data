The value of `x` is decremented by 1. Since `x` was not 1 initially, it is now `x - 1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is `x - 1`, `max` is 99999999 if `x` was initially odd, or 99999998 if `x` was initially even, `min` is -99999998 if `x` was initially odd, or -99999999 if `x` was initially even, `ans` is `-100000000 99999999 100000000` if `x` was initially even, or `-99999999 -100000000 100000000` if `x` was initially odd, `t` is 2.**
