The only variable in the loop head is `x`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. If `x` is not equal to 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is an input integer and must not be 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must still not be 1.

State: **`i` is 1, `x` is an input integer and must not be 1. If `x` is even, `x` is divided by 2, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is "100000000", and `t` is 1. If `x` is odd, `x` is now even, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999999, `ans` is '-100000000', and `t` is 1.**
