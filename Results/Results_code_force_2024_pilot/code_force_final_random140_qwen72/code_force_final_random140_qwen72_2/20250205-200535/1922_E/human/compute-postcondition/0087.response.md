Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is an even input integer divided by 2, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is "100000000 ", `t` is 0.**

Explanation: The value of `x` is updated to `x // 2`, which means `x` is now half of its original value (since `x` was an even integer, the result of `x // 2` is also an integer). All other variables remain unchanged.
