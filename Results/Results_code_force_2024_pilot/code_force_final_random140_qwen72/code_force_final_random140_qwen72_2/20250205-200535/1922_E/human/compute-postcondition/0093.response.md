Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is an input integer and `x` must not be 1, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is an empty string, `t` is 1. If `x` is even, `x` is divided by 2, `max` is 99999999, `ans` is "100000000 ". If `x` is odd, `x` is now even, `max` remains 100000000, `min` is -99999999, and `ans` is '-100000000'.**
