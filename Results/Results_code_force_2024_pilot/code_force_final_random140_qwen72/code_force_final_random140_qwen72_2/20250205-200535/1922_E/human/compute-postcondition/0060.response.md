The value of `min` is incremented by 1. Since `min` was initially -100000000 or -99999999 depending on whether `x` is even or odd, after the increment, `min` will be -99999999 or -99999998, respectively. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is an input integer and must not be 1, `max` is 99999999 or 100000000 depending on whether `x` is even or odd, `min` is -99999999 or -99999998 depending on whether `x` is even or odd, `ans` is "-100000000 100000000" if `x` is even or "-99999999 -100000000" if `x` is odd, `t` is 1.**
