The only variable in the loop head is `x`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. If `x` is not equal to 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` has been modified based on whether it was originally even or odd.

- If `x` was originally even, `x` is now `x // 2`.
- If `x` was originally odd, `x` is now `x - 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must not be 1. Therefore, we need to ensure that `x` is not 1. Since the exact value of `x` is not specified, we can only state that `x` must not be 1.

State: **`i` is 0, `t` is 2. If `x` was originally even, `x` is now `x // 2` and must not be 1, `max` is 99999998, `min` is -100000000, and `ans` is "99999999 100000000". If `x` was originally odd, `x` is now `x - 1` and must not be 1, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999998, and `ans` is "-99999999 -100000000"**
