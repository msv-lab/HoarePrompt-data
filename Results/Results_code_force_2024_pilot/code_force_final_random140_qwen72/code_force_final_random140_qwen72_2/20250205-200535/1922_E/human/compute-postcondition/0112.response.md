The value of `t` is incremented by 1, changing from 2 to 3. The values of the other variables (`i`, `x`, `max`, `min`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is transformed based on the original input as described, `max` is 99999998 if the original `x` was even and `x % 2 == 0`, 99999997 if the original `x` was odd and `x % 2 == 0`, 99999999 if the original `x` was even and `x % 2 != 0`, or 99999998 if the original `x` was odd and `x % 2 != 0`, `min` is -100000000 if the original `x` was even and `x % 2 == 0`, -99999999 if the original `x` was odd and `x % 2 == 0`, -99999999 if the original `x` was even and `x % 2 != 0`, or -99999998 if the original `x` was odd and `x % 2 != 0`, `ans` is "99999999 100000000 100000000" if the original `x` was even and `x % 2 == 0`, "99999998 99999999 -100000000" if the original `x` was odd and `x % 2 == 0`, "-100000000 100000000 100000000" if the original `x` was even and `x % 2 != 0`, "-99999999 99999999 -100000000" if the original `x` was odd and `x % 2 != 0", "-100000000 -100000000 100000000" if the original `x` was even and became odd, or "-99999999 -99999999 -100000000" if the original `x` was odd and remained odd, `t` is 3.**
