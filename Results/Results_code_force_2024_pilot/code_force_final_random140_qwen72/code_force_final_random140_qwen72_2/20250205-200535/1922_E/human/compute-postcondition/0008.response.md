The value of `ans` is updated by concatenating the string representation of `max` (which is 100000000) with a space and the current value of `ans` (which is an empty string). Therefore, `ans` becomes "100000000 ". The states of the other variables (`i`, `x`, `max`, `min`, and `t`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `x` is an input integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is "100000000 ", `t` is 0, and `x` is even.**
