The value of `min` is incremented by 1. The value of `min` depends on whether the original `x` was even or odd. If the original `x` was even, `min` was `-100000000`, and now it becomes `-99999999`. If the original `x` was odd, `min` was `-99999999`, and now it becomes `-99999998`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is either the original input integer divided by 2 if it was even, or the original input integer minus 1 if it was odd. `max` is 99999999 if the original `x` was even, or 99999998 if the original `x` was odd. `min` is -99999999 if the original `x` was even, or -99999998 if the original `x` was odd. `ans` is `"-100000000 100000000 100000000"` if the original `x` was even, or `"-99999999 99999999 -100000000"` if the original `x` was odd, or `"-100000000 -100000000 100000000"` if the original `x` was even and became odd, or `"-99999999 -99999999 -100000000"` if the original `x` was odd and remained odd. `t` is 2.**
