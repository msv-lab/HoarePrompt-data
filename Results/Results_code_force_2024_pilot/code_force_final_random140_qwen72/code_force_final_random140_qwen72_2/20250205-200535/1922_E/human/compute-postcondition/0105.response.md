The value of `max` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `max` depends on whether the original `x` was even or odd. If the original `x` was even, `max` was 99999999, and if the original `x` was odd, `max` was 99999998. After decrementing by 1:

- If the original `x` was even, `max` becomes 99999998.
- If the original `x` was odd, `max` becomes 99999997.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is either the original input integer divided by 2 if it was even, or the original input integer minus 1 if it was odd. `max` is 99999998 if the original `x` was even, or 99999997 if the original `x` was odd. `min` is -100000000 if the original `x` was even, or -99999999 if the original `x` was odd. `ans` is "99999999 100000000 100000000" if the original `x` was even, or "99999998 99999999 -100000000" if the original `x` was odd, or "99999999 -100000000 100000000" if the original `x` was even and became odd, or "99999998 -99999999 -100000000" if the original `x` was odd and remained odd. `t` is 2.**
