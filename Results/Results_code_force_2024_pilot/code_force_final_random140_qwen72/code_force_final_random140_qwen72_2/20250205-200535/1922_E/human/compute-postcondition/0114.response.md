To determine what will be printed by the `print(t)` statement, let's break down the initial state and understand the variables involved:

- `i` is 2.
- `x` is 1.
- `max` is 100000000 - (number of even steps).
- `min` is -100000000 + (number of odd steps).
- `ans` is a string of numbers starting from the initial `max` or `min` value and decreasing/increasing respectively with each step, separated by spaces.
- `t` is the total number of iterations required to reduce `x` to 1.

Given that `x` is already 1, no iterations are needed to reduce `x` to 1. Therefore, the total number of iterations required (`t`) is 0.

Thus, the `print(t)` statement will print the value of `t`, which is 0.

Output: **0**
