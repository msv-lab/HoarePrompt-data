The value of `x` is decremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

- If `x` was even before the operation, it is now odd.
- If `x` was odd before the operation, it is now even.

Given the initial conditions, let's consider both cases:

1. If `x` was even:
   - `x` is now `x - 1`, which is odd.
   - `max` remains 99999999.
   - `min` remains -99999999.
   - `ans` remains "-100000000 100000000".

2. If `x` was odd:
   - `x` is now `x - 1`, which is even.
   - `max` remains 100000000.
   - `min` remains -99999998.
   - `ans` remains "-99999999 -100000000".

Since `x` is guaranteed to be greater than 1 and not equal to 1, the decrement operation will always result in a valid integer.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `x` is `x - 1`, `max` is 99999999 if `x` was even, otherwise `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999999 if `x` was even, otherwise `min` is -99999998, `ans` is "-100000000 100000000" if `x` was even, otherwise `ans` is "-99999999 -100000000", `t` is 1.**
