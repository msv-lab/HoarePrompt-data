The value of `min` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `min` depends on whether `x` was odd or even in the previous iteration. If `x` was even, `min` was -100000000, and if `x` was odd, `min` was -99999999. After incrementing `min` by 1, the new value of `min` will be -99999999 if `x` was even, or -99999998 if `x` was odd. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is an input integer and `x` must not be 1, `max` is 100000000 (or 99999999 if `x` was even in the previous iteration), `min` is -99999999 (if `x` was even) or -99999998 (if `x` was odd), `ans` is "-100000000 100000000" if `x` was even, or "-99999999 -100000000" if `x` was odd, `t` is 1**
