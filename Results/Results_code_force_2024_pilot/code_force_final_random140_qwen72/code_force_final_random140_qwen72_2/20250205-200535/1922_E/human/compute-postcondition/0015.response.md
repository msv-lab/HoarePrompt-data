Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `x` is an input integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1, `max` is 99999999 if `x` is even, otherwise `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000 if `x` is even, otherwise `min` is -99999999, `ans` is "100000000 " if `x` is even, otherwise `ans` is '-100000000', `t` is 0, and `x` is `x // 2` if `x` is even, otherwise `x` remains unchanged.***
