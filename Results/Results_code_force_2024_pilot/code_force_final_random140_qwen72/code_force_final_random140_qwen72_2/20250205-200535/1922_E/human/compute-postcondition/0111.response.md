Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `x` is transformed based on the original input: if the original `x` was even, `x` becomes `(input integer / 2) // 2` if `x % 2 == 0`, or `(input integer / 2) - 1` if `x % 2 != 0`; if the original `x` was odd, `x` becomes `(input integer - 1) // 2` if `x % 2 == 0`, or `(input integer - 2)` if `x % 2 != 0`. `max` is 99999998 if the original `x` was even and `x % 2 == 0`, 99999997 if the original `x` was odd and `x % 2 == 0`, 99999999 if the original `x` was even and `x % 2 != 0`, or 99999998 if the original `x` was odd and `x % 2 != 0`. `min` is -100000000 if the original `x` was even and `x % 2 == 0`, -99999999 if the original `x` was odd and `x % 2 == 0`, -99999999 if the original `x` was even and `x % 2 != 0`, or -99999998 if the original `x` was odd and `x % 2 != 0`. `ans` is "99999999 100000000 100000000" if the original `x` was even and `x % 2 == 0`, "99999998 99999999 -100000000" if the original `x` was odd and `x % 2 == 0`, "-100000000 100000000 100000000" if the original `x` was even and `x % 2 != 0`, "-99999999 99999999 -100000000" if the original `x` was odd and `x % 2 != 0", "-100000000 -100000000 100000000" if the original `x` was even and became odd, or "-99999999 -99999999 -100000000" if the original `x` was odd and remained odd. `t` is 2.**
