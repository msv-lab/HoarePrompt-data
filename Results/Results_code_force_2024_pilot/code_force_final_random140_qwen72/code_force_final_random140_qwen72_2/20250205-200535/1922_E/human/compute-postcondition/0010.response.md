Output State: **`i` is 0, `x` is an input integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is "100000000 ", `t` is 0, and `x` is now `x // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is updated to `x // 2`, which means `x` is divided by 2 and the result is the integer division (floor division).
- All other variables (`i`, `max`, `min`, `ans`, `t`) remain unchanged.
- The condition that `x` is even is no longer explicitly mentioned, but the new value of `x` will still be an integer.
