Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 2, `x` is an input integer, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is an empty string, `t` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while x != 1:
    if x % 2 == 0:
        ans = f'{max}' + ' ' + ans
        max -= 1
        x = x // 2
    else:
        ans = f'{min}' + ' ' + ans
        min += 1
        x -= 1
    t += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 2, `x` is an input integer and `x` must not be 1, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is an empty string, `t` is 1. If `x` is even, `x` is divided by 2, `max` is 99999999, `ans` is "100000000 ". If `x` is odd, `x` is now even, `max` remains 100000000, `min` is -99999999, and `ans` is '-100000000'.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `i` is 2, `x` is either the original input integer divided by 2 if it was even, or the original input integer minus 1 if it was odd. `max` is 99999999 if the original `x` was even, or 99999998 if the original `x` was odd. `min` is -100000000 if the original `x` was even, or -99999999 if the original `x` was odd. `ans` is "100000000 100000000" if the original `x` was even, or "99999999 -100000000" if the original `x` was odd, or "-100000000 100000000" if the original `x` was even and became odd, or "-99999999 -100000000" if the original `x` was odd and remained odd. `t` is 2.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `i` is 2, `x` is transformed based on the original input as described, `max` is 99999998 if the original `x` was even and `x % 2 == 0`, 99999997 if the original `x` was odd and `x % 2 == 0`, 99999999 if the original `x` was even and `x % 2 != 0`, or 99999998 if the original `x` was odd and `x % 2 != 0`, `min` is -100000000 if the original `x` was even and `x % 2 == 0`, -99999999 if the original `x` was odd and `x % 2 == 0`, -99999999 if the original `x` was even and `x % 2 != 0`, or -99999998 if the original `x` was odd and `x % 2 != 0`, `ans` is "99999999 100000000 100000000" if the original `x` was even and `x % 2 == 0`, "99999998 99999999 -100000000" if the original `x` was odd and `x % 2 == 0`, "-100000000 100000000 100000000" if the original `x` was even and `x % 2 != 0`, "-99999999 99999999 -100000000" if the original `x` was odd and `x % 2 != 0", "-100000000 -100000000 100000000" if the original `x` was even and became odd, or "-99999999 -99999999 -100000000" if the original `x` was odd and remained odd, `t` is 3.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
