The code snippet updates the value of `ans` by concatenating the string representation of `max` followed by a space and the current value of `ans`.

Let's break down the impact:

- `max` is 99999999 if the original `x` was even, or 99999998 if the original `x` was odd.
- `ans` is "100000000 100000000" if the original `x` was even, or "99999999 -100000000" if the original `x` was odd, or "-100000000 100000000" if the original `x` was even and became odd, or "-99999999 -100000000" if the original `x` was odd and remained odd.

### Case 1: Original `x` was even
- `max` = 99999999
- `ans` = "100000000 100000000"
- New `ans` = "99999999 100000000 100000000"

### Case 2: Original `x` was odd
- `max` = 99999998
- `ans` = "99999999 -100000000"
- New `ans` = "99999998 99999999 -100000000"

### Case 3: Original `x` was even and became odd
- `max` = 99999999
- `ans` = "-100000000 100000000"
- New `ans` = "99999999 -100000000 100000000"

### Case 4: Original `x` was odd and remained odd
- `max` = 99999998
- `ans` = "-99999999 -100000000"
- New `ans` = "99999998 -99999999 -100000000"

The values of `i`, `x`, `max`, `min`, and `t` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is either the original input integer divided by 2 if it was even, or the original input integer minus 1 if it was odd. `max` is 99999999 if the original `x` was even, or 99999998 if the original `x` was odd. `min` is -100000000 if the original `x` was even, or -99999999 if the original `x` was odd. `ans` is "99999999 100000000 100000000" if the original `x` was even, or "99999998 99999999 -100000000" if the original `x` was odd, or "99999999 -100000000 100000000" if the original `x` was even and became odd, or "99999998 -99999999 -100000000" if the original `x` was odd and remained odd. `t` is 2.**
