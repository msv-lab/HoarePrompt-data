Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is an input integer, `max` is reduced by the number of even steps taken, `min` is increased by the number of odd steps taken, `ans` contains a sequence of numbers starting from the initial `max` or `min` value (depending on whether `x` was even or odd) and decreasing/increasing respectively with each step, and `t` is the total number of iterations taken to reach `x = 1`.** 

Explanation: The value of `x` is updated to the integer value provided by the user input. All other variables (`i`, `max`, `min`, `ans`, and `t`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
