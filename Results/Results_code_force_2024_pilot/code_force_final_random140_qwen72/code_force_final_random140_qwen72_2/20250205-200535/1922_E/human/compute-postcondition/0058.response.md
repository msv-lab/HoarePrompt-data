The code `x = x // 2` performs integer division of `x` by 2, which means `x` is updated to half of its original value, rounded down to the nearest whole number.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 1
- `x` is an input integer and must not be 1
- If `x` is even, `x` is divided by 2, `max` is 99999998, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is "99999999 100000000", and `t` is 1
- If `x` is odd, `x` is now even, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -99999999, `ans` is "100000000 -100000000", and `t` is 1

After executing the code `x = x // 2`:

- If `x` was even, it is now halved and remains even.
- If `x` was odd, it is now halved and becomes even (since the result of integer division of an odd number by 2 is always even).

The values of `max`, `min`, `ans`, and `t` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is `x // 2`, `max` is 99999998 or 99999999 depending on whether `x` was initially even or odd, `min` is -100000000 or -99999999 depending on whether `x` was initially even or odd, `ans` is "99999999 100000000" or "100000000 -100000000" depending on whether `x` was initially even or odd, and `t` is 1.**
