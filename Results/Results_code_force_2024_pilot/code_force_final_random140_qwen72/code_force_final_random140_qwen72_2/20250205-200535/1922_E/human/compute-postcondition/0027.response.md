The code concatenates the string representation of `max` with the existing string in `ans`, separated by a space.

- If `x` was originally even:
  - `max` is 99999998
  - `ans` was "99999999 100000000"
  - After the code, `ans` becomes "99999998 99999999 100000000"

- If `x` was originally odd:
  - `max` is 100000000
  - `ans` was "-99999999 -100000000"
  - After the code, `ans` becomes "100000000 -99999999 -100000000"

The values of `i`, `t`, `x`, `min`, and the condition that `x` must not be 1 remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is 2, if `x` was originally even, `x` is now `x // 2` and must not be 1, `max` is 99999998, `min` is -100000000, and `ans` is "99999998 99999999 100000000". If `x` was originally odd, `x` is now `x - 1` and must not be 1, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999998, and `ans` is "100000000 -99999999 -100000000".**
