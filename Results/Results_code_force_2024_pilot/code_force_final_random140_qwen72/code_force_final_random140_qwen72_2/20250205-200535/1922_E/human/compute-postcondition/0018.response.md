The code concatenates the string representation of `max` with a space and the current value of `ans`. Let's evaluate the impact:

- `ans` is updated to the new concatenated string.
- The values of `i`, `x`, `max`, `min`, and `t` remain unchanged.

Given the initial conditions:
- If `x` is even, `max` is 99999999, `ans` is "100000000", and `x` is halved.
- If `x` is odd, `max` is 100000000, `ans` is "-100000000", and `x` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
- If `x` is even: `ans` becomes "99999999 100000000".
- If `x` is odd: `ans` becomes "100000000 -100000000".

Output State: **`i` is 0, `x` is an input integer greater than 1 and not equal to 1, `max` is 99999999 if `x` is even, otherwise `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000 if `x` is even, otherwise `min` is -99999999, `ans` is "99999999 100000000" if `x` is even, otherwise `ans` is "100000000 -100000000", `t` is 1, and `x` is `x // 2` if `x` is even, otherwise `x` remains unchanged.**
