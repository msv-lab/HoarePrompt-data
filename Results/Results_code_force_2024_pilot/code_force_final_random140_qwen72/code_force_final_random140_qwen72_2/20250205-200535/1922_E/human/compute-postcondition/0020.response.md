Output State: **`i` is 0, `x` is `x // 2` (where `x` was originally an input integer greater than 1 and not equal to 1), `max` is 99999998 if the original `x` was even, otherwise `max` is 99999999, `min` is -100000000 if the original `x` was even, otherwise `min` is -99999999, `ans` is "99999999 100000000" if the original `x` was even, otherwise `ans` is "100000000 -100000000", `t` is 1.** 

Explanation: The value of `x` is updated to `x // 2`, which means `x` is now half of its original value if it was even. All other variables (`i`, `max`, `min`, `ans`, and `t`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
