The value of `max` is decremented by 1. Since `max` was initially 100000000 if `x` was even, or 99999999 if `x` was odd, the new value of `max` will be 99999999 if `x` was even, or 99999998 if `x` was odd. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is an input integer and `x` must not be 1, `max` is 99999999 if `x` was even, or 99999998 if `x` was odd, `min` is -100000000 (or -99999999 if `x` was odd in the previous iteration), `ans` is "100000000 100000000" if `x` was even, or "99999999 -100000000" if `x` was odd, `t` is 1.**
