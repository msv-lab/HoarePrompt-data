To determine what will be printed by the `print(t)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions described:

1. **Loop Execution**: The loop continues until `x` becomes 1.
2. **Variable States**:
   - `i` remains 0.
   - `x` is 1 at the end of the loop.
   - `max` is reduced by the number of times `x` was even during the loop.
   - `min` is increased by the number of times `x` was odd during the loop.
   - `ans` is a string containing the sequence of `max` values (when `x` was even) and `min` values (when `x` was odd) in reverse order of their occurrence.
   - `t` is the total number of iterations the loop has executed.

Given these conditions, the key variable to focus on is `t`, which represents the total number of iterations the loop has executed.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - Assume `x` starts with some initial value (not specified, but it must be greater than 1 to enter the loop).
   - `i` is initialized to 0.
   - `max` and `min` are initialized (values not specified, but they change based on the loop conditions).
   - `ans` is initialized as an empty string.
   - `t` is initialized to 0.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs until `x` becomes 1.
   - For each iteration:
     - If `x` is even, `max` is reduced.
     - If `x` is odd, `min` is increased.
     - The corresponding value (`max` or `min`) is appended to `ans`.
     - `t` is incremented by 1.

3. **Final State**:
   - After the loop ends, `x` is 1.
   - `i` remains 0.
   - `max` and `min` have been updated based on the number of even and odd occurrences of `x`.
   - `ans` contains the sequence of `max` and `min` values in reverse order.
   - `t` is the total number of iterations the loop has executed.

### Conclusion:
The `print(t)` statement will print the total number of iterations the loop has executed. Since the exact initial value of `x` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `t`. However, based on the structure of the problem, `t` will be the total number of iterations required to reduce `x` to 1.

Output: **t (where t is the total number of iterations the loop has executed)**
