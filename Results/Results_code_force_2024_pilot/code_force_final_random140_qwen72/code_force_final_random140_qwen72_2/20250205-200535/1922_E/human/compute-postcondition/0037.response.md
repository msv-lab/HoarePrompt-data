To determine what will be printed by the `print(*ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

### Initial State:
- The loop continues until `x` becomes 1.
- At the end of the loop:
  - `i` remains 0.
  - `x` is 1.
  - `max` is reduced by the number of times `x` was even during the loop.
  - `min` is increased by the number of times `x` was odd during the loop.
  - `ans` is a string containing the sequence of `max` values (when `x` was even) and `min` values (when `x` was odd) in reverse order of their occurrence.
  - `t` is the total number of iterations the loop has executed.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop continues until `x` becomes 1.
   - During each iteration, if `x` is even, `max` is reduced.
   - If `x` is odd, `min` is increased.
   - The value of `max` or `min` is appended to `ans` depending on whether `x` is even or odd.
   - The loop iterates `t` times.

2. **Final Values**:
   - `i` remains 0.
   - `x` is 1.
   - `max` and `min` are updated based on the number of even and odd occurrences of `x`.
   - `ans` contains the sequence of `max` and `min` values in reverse order of their occurrence.
   - `t` is the total number of iterations.

3. **Understanding `ans`**:
   - `ans` is a string that contains the sequence of `max` and `min` values in reverse order.
   - For example, if `x` was even twice and odd once, `ans` might look like "max max min".

4. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print(*ans)` statement will print the elements of `ans` separated by spaces.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume `x` starts with a value of 10:
- Iteration 1: `x` is 10 (even), `max` is reduced, `ans` = "max".
- Iteration 2: `x` is 5 (odd), `min` is increased, `ans` = "max min".
- Iteration 3: `x` is 3 (odd), `min` is increased, `ans` = "max min min".
- Iteration 4: `x` is 1 (odd), `min` is increased, `ans` = "max min min min".

### Final Output:
The `print(*ans)` statement will print the elements of `ans` separated by spaces.

Output: **max min min min** (where `ans` is the sequence of `max` and `min` values in reverse order of their occurrence during the loop).
