#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case is defined by a single integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18). The function should return an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly X increasing subsequences, or -1 if no such array exists. The elements of the returned array should be within the range [-10^9, 10^9].
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        
        max = 100000000
        
        min = -100000000
        
        ans = ''
        
        t = 0
        
        while x != 1:
            if x % 2 == 0:
                ans = f'{max}' + ' ' + ans
                max -= 1
                x = x // 2
            else:
                ans = f'{min}' + ' ' + ans
                min += 1
                x -= 1
            t += 1
        
        print(t)
        
        print(*ans)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` is equal to the number of test cases provided as input, `x` is 1 for each test case, `max` is reduced by the total number of even steps across all test cases, `min` is increased by the total number of odd steps across all test cases, `ans` contains the sequence of numbers generated for each test case, and `t` is the total number of iterations required to reduce `x` to 1 for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `X` (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18). For each test case, it generates and prints a sequence of integers that, when arranged, have exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The sequence is constructed using a combination of the maximum value starting from 100,000,000 and the minimum value starting from -100,000,000, adjusting these values based on the parity of `X`. The function prints the length of the sequence and the sequence itself for each test case. If no such sequence can be generated, the function does not explicitly return `-1`, but the behavior for such cases is not defined in the provided code.
