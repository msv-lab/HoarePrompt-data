Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the removal of the minimum number of characters correctly in all cases. Specifically, the program increments `ans` by 1 and `i` by 3 whenever it finds a substring "map" or "pie". However, this approach is incorrect because it assumes that removing one character from the substring will always make the string beautiful, which is not necessarily true.

For example, consider the string "mappie". The program will find the substring "map" and increment `ans` by 1, then skip the next two characters. This leaves the string "pie" which is still ugly. The correct approach would be to remove the minimum number of characters to ensure no "map" or "pie" substrings remain.

A correct solution would need to handle overlapping substrings and ensure that the minimum number of deletions is made to remove all occurrences of "map" and "pie". The current implementation fails to do this, leading to incorrect results in certain cases.
