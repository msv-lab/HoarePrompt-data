You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has a string s of length n . Rudolf considers the string s to be ugly
if it contains the substring^\dagger "pie" or the substring "map", otherwise
the string s will be considered beautiful.

For example, "ppiee", "mmap", "dfpiefghmap" are ugly strings, while "mathp",
"ppiiee" are beautiful strings.

Rudolf wants to shorten the string s by removing some characters to make it
beautiful.

The main character doesn't like to strain, so he asks you to make the string
beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters. He can remove
characters from any positions in the string (not just from the beginning or
end of the string).

^\dagger String a is a substring of b if there exists a consecutive segment of
characters in string b equal to a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^6
) — the length of the string s .

The next line of each test case contains the string s of length n . The string
s consists of lowercase Latin letters.

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of characters
that need to be deleted to make the string s beautiful. If the string is
initially beautiful, then output 0 .

Note

In the first test case, for example, you can delete the 4 th and 9 th
characters to make the string beautiful.

In the second test case, the string is already beautiful.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = input()
        ans = 0
        i = 0
        while i < len(a) - 2:
            s = a[i:i + 3]
            print(s)
            if s == 'map' or s == 'pie':
                i += 3
                ans += 1
            else:
                i += 1
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a string `a` of lowercase Latin letters. For each test case, it counts the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substrings "map" or "pie" in the string `a` and prints this count. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the program state includes the printed counts for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the removal of the minimum number of characters correctly in all cases. Specifically, the program increments `ans` by 1 and `i` by 3 whenever it finds a substring "map" or "pie". However, this approach is incorrect because it assumes that removing one character from the substring will always make the string beautiful, which is not necessarily true.

For example, consider the string "mappie". The program will find the substring "map" and increment `ans` by 1, then skip the next two characters. This leaves the string "pie" which is still ugly. The correct approach would be to remove the minimum number of characters to ensure no "map" or "pie" substrings remain.

A correct solution would need to handle overlapping substrings and ensure that the minimum number of deletions is made to remove all occurrences of "map" and "pie". The current implementation fails to do this, leading to incorrect results in certain cases.
