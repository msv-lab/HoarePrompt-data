You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, representing the length of the string s, and s is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = input()
        
        ans = 0
        
        i = 0
        
        while i < len(a) - 2:
            s = a[i:i + 3]
            print(s)
            if s == 'map' or s == 'pie':
                i += 3
                ans += 1
            else:
                i += 1
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: After the loop has executed all iterations, `_` remains a placeholder, `int(input())` must be greater than 0 (ensured by the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). For each test case, `a` is a string containing the user's input. The variable `i` will be equal to the length of `a` or greater, depending on how many times the condition `s == 'map' or s == 'pie'` was met. The variable `ans` will be the total number of occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' found in `a`. The variable `s` will be the last valid substring of length 3 processed by the loop, or it may not exist if no valid substring was found.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases, each containing an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It processes each test case and returns a result based on the input parameters. The number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
