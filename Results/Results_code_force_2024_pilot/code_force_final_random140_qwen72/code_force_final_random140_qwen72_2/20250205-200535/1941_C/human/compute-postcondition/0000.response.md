The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder to iterate over the range. The loop's execution depends on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the value of `int(input())` must be greater than 0.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, representing the length of the string `s`.
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.

To ensure the loop executes, the input value must be at least 1, which aligns with the given constraint that `t` is at least 1. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t` itself, but we need to ensure that the input value is correctly set to match the constraints.

State: **`_` is a placeholder, `int(input())` must be greater than 0 (which is ensured by the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)**
