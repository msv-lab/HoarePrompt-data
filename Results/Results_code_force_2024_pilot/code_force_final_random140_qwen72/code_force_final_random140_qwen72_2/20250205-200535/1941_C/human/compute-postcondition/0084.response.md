Postcondition: ***`a` has a length greater than 8, `s` is the substring `a[i:i + 3]`. If `s` is 'map' or 'pie', `ans` is 3 and `i` is 9. If `s` is not 'map' or 'pie', but the substring from index `i-1` to `i + 1` is 'map' or 'pie', `ans` is 2 and `i` is 7. If neither `s` nor the substring from index `i-1` to `i + 1` is 'map' or 'pie', `ans` is 1 and `i` is 5. If none of these conditions are met, `ans` is 0 and `i` is 3.***
