Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `_` is a placeholder (not used in the code).
   - `int(input())` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive).
   - `a` is a string provided by the user, and its length (`len(a)`) must be greater than 2.
   - `ans` is initialized to 0.
   - `i` is initialized to 0.
   - `s` is a substring of `a` starting from index 0 and ending at index 2 (inclusive).

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(s)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The variable `s` is defined as the substring of `a` from index 0 to index 2 (inclusive). This means `s` will contain the first three characters of the string `a`.
   - Since `len(a)` is guaranteed to be greater than 2, the substring `s` will always have exactly 3 characters.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print(s)` statement will print the first three characters of the string `a`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **the first three characters of the string `a`**.
