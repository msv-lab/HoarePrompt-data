The value of `i` is incremented by 3. The previous value of `i` was either 6, 4, or 2 depending on the conditions given in the initial state. Therefore, the new value of `i` will be 9, 7, or 5 respectively. The other variables (`a`, `s`, `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` has a length greater than 8, `s` is the substring `a[i:i + 3]`, if `s` is 'map' or 'pie', `ans` is 2 and `i` is 9; if `s` is not 'map' or 'pie', but `s` (substring from index `i-1` to `i + 1`) is 'map' or 'pie', `ans` is 1 and `i` is 7; otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `i` is 5.**
