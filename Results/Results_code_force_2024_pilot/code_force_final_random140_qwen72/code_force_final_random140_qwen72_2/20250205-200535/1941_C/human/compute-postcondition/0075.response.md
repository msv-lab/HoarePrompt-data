The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `ans` could be either 1 or 0 depending on whether `s` was 'map' or 'pie'. If `s` was 'map' or 'pie', `ans` was 1 and `i` was 6; otherwise, `ans` was 0 and `i` was 4. After incrementing `ans`, the new value of `ans` will be 2 if `s` was 'map' or 'pie', and 1 if `s` was not 'map' or 'pie'. The value of `i` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`a` has a length greater than 5, `s` is the substring of `a` from index `i` to index `i + 2` (inclusive), if `s` is 'map' or 'pie', `ans` is 2 and `i` is 6; otherwise, `ans` is 1 and `i` is 4.**
