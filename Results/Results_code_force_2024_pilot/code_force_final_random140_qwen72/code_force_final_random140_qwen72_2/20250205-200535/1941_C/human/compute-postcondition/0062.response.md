To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop condition:

### Given State:
- The loop will execute again if the initial value of `int(input())` was greater than 1.
- `a` is the user input.
- `ans` is 0.
- `i` is 0.

### Loop Condition:
```python
while i < len(a) - 2:
```

### Analysis:
- The loop condition checks if `i` is less than `len(a) - 2`.
- `i` is 0, so the condition simplifies to `0 < len(a) - 2`.
- For the loop to execute, `len(a) - 2` must be greater than 0, which means `len(a)` must be greater than 2.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `a`.
- To ensure the loop executes at least once, `len(a)` must be greater than 2.

### Final State:
State: **`a` must have a length greater than 2, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0**
