The value of `i` is incremented by 3. Given the initial state, `i` was either 1 or 3. If `i` was 1, it becomes 4. If `i` was 3, it becomes 6. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` remains a placeholder, `int(input())` is greater than 0, `a` is the user's input string with a length greater than 2, `s` is the substring of `a` starting at index `i` and of length 3, `i` is 4 if it was initially 1, or `i` is 6 if it was initially 3, `ans` is 0 if `i` was initially 1, or `ans` is 1 if `i` was initially 3, and `len(a)` must be greater than 3 if `i` was initially 1, or `len(a)` must be greater than 5 if `i` was initially 3.**
