To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the loop condition:

```python
while i < len(a) - 2:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variables in the Loop Condition:**
   - `i`: This is the loop counter.
   - `len(a)`: This is the length of the string `a`.

2. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `a` is a string containing the user's input.

3. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop will execute if `i < len(a) - 2`.
   - For the first iteration, `i` is 0, so the condition simplifies to `0 < len(a) - 2`.

4. **Ensuring the Loop Executes:**
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `0 < len(a) - 2` must be true.
   - This simplifies to `len(a) > 2`.

### Conclusion:
- The only variable that needs to be adjusted is `a` to ensure that its length is greater than 2.

### Final State:
- `a` must be a string with a length greater than 2.

Therefore, the modified state is:
State: **`_` is a placeholder, `int(input())` must be greater than 0 (ensured by the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `a` is a string containing the user's input and `len(a)` must be greater than 2, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0**
