Postcondition: **`_` is a placeholder, `int(input())` must be greater than 0 (ensured by the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `a` is a string containing the user's input and `len(a)` must be greater than 8, `s` is the substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 2`. If `s` is 'map' or 'pie', `ans` is 3 and `i` is 9. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `i` is 3.**
