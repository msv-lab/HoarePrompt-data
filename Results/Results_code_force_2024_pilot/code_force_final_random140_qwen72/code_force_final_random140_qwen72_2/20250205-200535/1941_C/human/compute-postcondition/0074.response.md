Output State: **`a` has a length greater than 5, `s` is the substring of `a` from index `i` to index `i + 2` (inclusive), if `s` is 'map' or 'pie', `ans` is 1 and `i` is 6; otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `i` is 4.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` is incremented by 3.
- If `s` is 'map' or 'pie', `i` was initially 3, so after incrementing, `i` becomes 6.
- If `s` is not 'map' or 'pie', `i` was initially 1, so after incrementing, `i` becomes 4.
- The values of `a`, `s`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
