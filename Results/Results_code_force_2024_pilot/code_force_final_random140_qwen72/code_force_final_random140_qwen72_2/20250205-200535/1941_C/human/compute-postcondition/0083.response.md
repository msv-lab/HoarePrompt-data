The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The conditions for `ans` and the substring `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` has a length greater than 8, `s` is the substring `a[i:i + 3]`, if `s` is 'map' or 'pie', `ans` is 2 and `i` is 7; if `s` is not 'map' or 'pie', but `s` (substring from index `i-1` to `i + 1`) is 'map' or 'pie', `ans` is 1 and `i` is 5; otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `i` is 3.

Output State: **`a` has a length greater than 8, `s` is the substring `a[i:i + 3]`, if `s` is 'map' or 'pie', `ans` is 2 and `i` is 7; if `s` is not 'map' or 'pie', but `s` (substring from index `i-1` to `i + 1`) is 'map' or 'pie', `ans` is 1 and `i` is 5; otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `i` is 3.**
