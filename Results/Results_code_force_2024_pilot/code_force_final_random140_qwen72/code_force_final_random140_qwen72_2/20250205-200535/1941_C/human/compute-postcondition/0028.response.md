Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `_` remains a placeholder (not used in the print statement).
- `int(input())` must be greater than 0 (ensured by the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). This means `t` is a positive integer.
- `a` is a string containing the user's input.
- The variable `i` will be equal to `len(a) - 2` or greater, depending on how many times the condition `s == 'map' or s == 'pie'` was met.
- The variable `ans` will be the total number of occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' found in `a`.
- The variable `s` will be the last valid substring of length 3 processed by the loop.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(ans)
```

### Explanation:
- The `print(ans)` statement will output the value of `ans`.
- `ans` is the total number of occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' found in the string `a`.

### Final Output:
Output: **ans (where ans is the total number of occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' found in the string a)**
