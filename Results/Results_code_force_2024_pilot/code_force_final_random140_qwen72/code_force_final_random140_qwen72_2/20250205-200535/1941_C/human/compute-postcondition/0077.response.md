Postcondition: ***`a` has a length greater than 5. If `s` (substring from index `i` to `i + 2`) is 'map' or 'pie', `ans` is 2 and `i` is 6. If `s` is not 'map' or 'pie', but `s` (substring from index `i-1` to `i + 1`) is 'map' or 'pie', `ans` is 1 and `i` is 4. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `i` is 2.***
