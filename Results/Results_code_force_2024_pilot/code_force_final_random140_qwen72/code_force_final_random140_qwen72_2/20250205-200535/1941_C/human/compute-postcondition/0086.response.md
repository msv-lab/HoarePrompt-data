To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic behind it:

### Initial State:
- `i` is equal to the length of `a` minus 2.
- `ans` is the total number of occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' found in `a`, where each occurrence skips the next two characters.

### Explanation:
1. **Variable `i`**:
   - `i` is set to `len(a) - 2`. This means `i` is the index of the third-to-last character in the string `a`.

2. **Variable `ans`**:
   - `ans` is the count of occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in the string `a`.
   - Each time one of these substrings is found, the search skips the next two characters to avoid overlapping matches.

### Example:
Let's consider an example string `a = "mapmapmapiepie"` to illustrate how `ans` is calculated:
- The first 'map' is found at index 0.
  - Skip the next two characters (index 1 and 2), so the next search starts at index 3.
- The second 'map' is found at index 3.
  - Skip the next two characters (index 4 and 5), so the next search starts at index 6.
- The third 'map' is found at index 6.
  - Skip the next two characters (index 7 and 8), so the next search starts at index 9.
- The first 'pie' is found at index 9.
  - Skip the next two characters (index 10 and 11), so the next search starts at index 12 (which is out of bounds).

In this example, `ans` would be 4 because there are 4 occurrences of 'map' or 'pie'.

### General Case:
Without the specific string `a`, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the initial state, we know that `ans` is the total number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' in the string `a`.

### Final Output:
The `print(ans)` statement will print the total number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in the string `a`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the total number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in the string a)**
