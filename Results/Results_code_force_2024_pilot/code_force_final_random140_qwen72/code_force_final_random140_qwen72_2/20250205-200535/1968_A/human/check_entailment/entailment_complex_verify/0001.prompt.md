You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

- Program: 
def func():
    num = int(input('Enter number of entries- '))
    L1 = []
    res = []
    for i in range(num):
        L1.append(int(input('Enter entry no.' + str(i + 1) + '- ')))
    for i in range(num):
        for j in range(2, L1[i] + 1):
            if L1[i] % j == 0:
                res.append(L1[i] // j * (j - 1))
                break
    print(*res, sep='\n')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000.
def func():
    num = int(input('Enter number of entries- '))
    L1 = []
    res = []
    for i in range(num):
        L1.append(int(input('Enter entry no.' + str(i + 1) + '- ')))
        
    #State: `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000, `num` is an input integer representing the number of entries, `L1` is a list containing `num` elements, each element being an input integer, `res` is an empty list, `i` is `num - 1`.
    for i in range(num):
        for j in range(2, L1[i] + 1):
            if L1[i] % j == 0:
                res.append(L1[i] // j * (j - 1))
                break
        
    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `x` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000, `num` is greater than 0, `L1` is a list containing `num` elements, each element being an input integer, `res` is a list containing exactly `num` elements. Each element in `res` corresponds to the result of `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` for the smallest divisor `j` of `L1[i]` greater than or equal to 2, where `i` ranges from 0 to `num - 1`. The index `i` will have iterated through all valid indices in `L1` (i.e., from 0 to `num - 1`).
    print(*res, sep='\n')
    #This is printed: Each element of `res` on a new line, where each element is the result of `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` for the smallest divisor `j` of `L1[i]` greater than or equal to 2, and `i` ranges from 0 to `num - 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It prompts the user to enter the number of entries (`num`) and then asks for `num` integers, storing them in a list `L1`. For each integer in `L1`, the function finds the smallest divisor greater than or equal to 2, calculates the result of `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` for this divisor, and appends this result to a list `res`. Finally, it prints each element of `res` on a new line. The function modifies the state by creating and populating the lists `L1` and `res`, and printing the contents of `res`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to find an integer \( y \) such that \( 1 \le y < x \) and the value \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized.
   - The greatest common divisor (GCD) of \( x \) and \( y \) is a key factor in this problem.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads an integer \( x \).
   - It then iterates from 2 to \( x \) to find the smallest divisor \( j \) of \( x \).
   - Once a divisor \( j \) is found, it calculates \( y \) as \( \frac{x}{j} \times (j - 1) \) and appends it to the result list.
   - Finally, it prints the results.

3. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly identifies the smallest divisor \( j \) of \( x \).
   - The calculation \( y = \frac{x}{j} \times (j - 1) \) is derived from the fact that \( y \) should be a multiple of \( \frac{x}{j} \) and less than \( x \).
   - This ensures that \( y \) is a valid candidate and maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - For \( x = 2 \), the smallest divisor is 2, and \( y = 1 \), which is correct.
   - For larger values of \( x \), the program correctly finds a suitable \( y \) that maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).

5. **Output Verification:**
   - The program prints the results in the correct format, one per line.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It finds a valid \( y \) for each \( x \) that maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).
