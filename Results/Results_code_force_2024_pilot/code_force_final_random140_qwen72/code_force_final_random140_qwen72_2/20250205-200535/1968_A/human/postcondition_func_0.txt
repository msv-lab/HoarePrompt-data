The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It prompts the user to enter the number of entries (`num`) and then asks for `num` integers, storing them in a list `L1`. For each integer in `L1`, the function finds the smallest divisor greater than or equal to 2, calculates the result of `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` for this divisor, and appends this result to a list `res`. Finally, it prints each element of `res` on a new line. The function modifies the state by creating and populating the lists `L1` and `res`, and printing the contents of `res`.
