Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000, `num` is greater than 0, `L1` is a list containing `num` elements, each element being an input integer, `res` is a list containing up to `num` elements. If `L1[i]` is divisible by 4, `res` has a new element `L1[i] // 4 * 3` appended, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged, and the program continues. `i` is a valid index in `L1` (i.e., `i < num`), `L1[i]` must be at least 4, and `j` is 4.***
