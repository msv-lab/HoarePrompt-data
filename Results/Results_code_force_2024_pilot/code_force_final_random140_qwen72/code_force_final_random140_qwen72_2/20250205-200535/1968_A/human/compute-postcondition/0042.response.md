Postcondition: **`x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000, `num` is greater than 0, `L1` is a list containing `num` elements, each element being an input integer, `res` is a list containing up to `num` elements, `i` is a valid index in `L1` (i.e., `i < num`), `L1[i]` must be at least 1, `j` is 2, and `L1[i]` is divisible by 2.**
