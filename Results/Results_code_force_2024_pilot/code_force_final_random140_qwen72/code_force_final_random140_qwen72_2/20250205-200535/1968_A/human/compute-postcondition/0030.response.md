Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000, `num` is greater than 0, `L1` is a list containing `num` elements, each element being an input integer, `res` is a list containing up to `num` elements. If `L1[i]` is divisible by `j`, then `res` contains the first element `(L1[0] // j * (j - 1))`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged and the program continues. `i` is 0, and `L1[i]` must be at least 2.***
