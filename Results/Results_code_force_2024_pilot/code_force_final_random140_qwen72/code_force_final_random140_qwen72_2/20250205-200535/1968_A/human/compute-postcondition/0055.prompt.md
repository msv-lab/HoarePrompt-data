Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000, `num` is an input integer representing the number of entries, `L1` is a list containing `num` elements, each element being an input integer, `res` is an empty list, `i` is `num - 1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(num):
    for j in range(2, L1[i] + 1):
        if L1[i] % j == 0:
            res.append(L1[i] // j * (j - 1))
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000, `num` is greater than 0, `L1` is a list containing `num` elements, each element being an input integer, `res` is a list containing up to `num` elements. Each element in `res` is the result of `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` where `j` is the smallest divisor of `L1[i]` greater than or equal to 2, and `i` is `num`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000, `num` is greater than 0, `L1` is a list containing `num` elements, each element being an input integer, `res` is a list containing up to `num` elements. For each element `L1[i]` in `L1`, `res` contains the result of `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`, where `j` is the smallest divisor of `L1[i]` greater than or equal to 2. The index `i` has iterated through all elements of `L1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After the loop executes all the iterations, `x` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000, `num` is greater than 0, `L1` is a list containing `num` elements, each element being an input integer, `res` is a list containing up to `num` elements. Each element in `res` corresponds to the result of `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` for the smallest divisor `j` of `L1[i]` greater than or equal to 2, where `i` ranges from 0 to `num - 1`. The index `i` will have iterated through all valid indices in `L1` (i.e., from 0 to `num - 1`).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
