Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000, `num` is greater than 0, `L1` is a list containing `num` elements, each element being an input integer, `res` is a list containing up to `num` elements, `i` is 0, `L1[i]` is at least 2, `j` is 4, and `res` now contains one element which is `L1[0] // 4 * 3`.**

Explanation:
- The code appends the result of `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` to the list `res`.
- Given `i` is 0, `L1[i]` is `L1[0]`.
- `j` is 4, so `j - 1` is 3.
- Therefore, the expression `L1[0] // 4 * 3` is evaluated and appended to `res`.
- All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
