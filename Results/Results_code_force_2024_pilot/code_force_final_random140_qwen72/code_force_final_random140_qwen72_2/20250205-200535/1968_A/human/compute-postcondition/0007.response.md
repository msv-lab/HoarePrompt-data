The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `num`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `num`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `num` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1 to become 2, and `num` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000, `num` must be greater than 2, `L1` is a list containing two elements where the first element is an input integer and the second element is another input integer, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 2**
