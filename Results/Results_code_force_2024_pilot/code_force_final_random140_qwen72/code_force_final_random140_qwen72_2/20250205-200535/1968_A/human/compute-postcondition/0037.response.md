Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000, `num` is greater than 0, `L1` is a list containing `num` elements, each element being an input integer, `res` is a list containing one element which is `L1[0] // 4 * 3`, `i` is 0, `L1[i]` is at least 2, `j` is 4, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
