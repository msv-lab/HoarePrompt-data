Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000, `num` is greater than 0, `L1` is a list containing `num` elements, each element being an input integer, `res` is a list containing up to `num` elements. Each element in `res` is the result of `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` where `j` is the smallest divisor of `L1[i]` greater than or equal to 2, and `i` is `num`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each element in the list `L1`.
- For each element `L1[i]`, the loop finds the smallest divisor `j` (starting from 2) that divides `L1[i]` without a remainder.
- Once such a divisor is found, the value `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` is appended to the list `res`.
- The loop then moves to the next element in `L1` by incrementing `i`.
- After all elements in `L1` have been processed, `i` will be equal to `num`, and `res` will contain up to `num` elements, each corresponding to the result of the computation for each element in `L1`.
