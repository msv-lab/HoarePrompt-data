To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the loop head:

### Given Information:
- `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000.
- `num` is greater than 0.
- `L1` is a list containing `num` elements, each element being an input integer.
- `res` is a list containing up to `num` elements. Each element in `res` is the result of `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` where `j` is the smallest divisor of `L1[i]` greater than or equal to 2, and `i` is `num`.

### Loop Head:
```python
for j in range(2, L1[i] + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variable `j` and the expression `L1[i]`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if `L1[i]` is at least 2 because `range(2, L1[i] + 1)` will generate a sequence starting from 2 up to `L1[i]`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`i`**: The index `i` must be within the bounds of the list `L1`. Since `i` is mentioned as `num`, and `num` is the length of `L1`, `i` should be set to 0 to start the loop.
- **`L1[i]`**: For the loop to execute, `L1[i]` must be at least 2.

### Final State:
- `x` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop head.
- `num` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop head.
- `L1` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop head.
- `res` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop head.
- `i` must be 0.
- `L1[i]` must be at least 2.

### State:
**`x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000, `num` is greater than 0, `L1` is a list containing `num` elements, each element being an input integer, `res` is a list containing up to `num` elements, `i` is 0, `L1[i]` must be at least 2**
