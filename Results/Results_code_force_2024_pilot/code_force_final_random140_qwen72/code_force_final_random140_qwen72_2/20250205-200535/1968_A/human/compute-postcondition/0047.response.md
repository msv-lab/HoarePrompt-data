The code snippet `res.append(L1[i] // j * (j - 1))` performs the following actions:

1. It computes the value of `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`.
2. It appends the computed value to the list `res`.

Given the initial state:
- `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000.
- `num` is greater than 0.
- `L1` is a list containing `num` elements, each element being an input integer.
- `res` is a list containing up to `num` elements.
- `i` is a valid index in `L1` (i.e., `i < num`).
- `L1[i]` must be at least 1.
- `j` is 3.

Let's calculate the result:
- `L1[i] // j` performs integer division of `L1[i]` by 3.
- `(j - 1)` is 2.
- Therefore, the expression `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` simplifies to `L1[i] // 3 * 2`.

The value `L1[i] // 3 * 2` is appended to the list `res`.

Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000, `num` is greater than 0, `L1` is a list containing `num` elements, each element being an input integer, `res` is a list containing up to `num` elements, `i` is a valid index in `L1` (i.e., `i < num`), `L1[i]` must be at least 1, `j` is 3, `res` now contains one additional element which is `L1[i] // 3 * 2`.**
