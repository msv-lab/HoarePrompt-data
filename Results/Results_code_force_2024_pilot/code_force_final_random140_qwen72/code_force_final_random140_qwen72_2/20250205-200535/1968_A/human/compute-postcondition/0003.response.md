To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the conditions that involve the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `num`.

- The variable `i` is initialized by the `range` function, starting from 0.
- The loop will execute if `num` is greater than 0, as this determines the number of iterations.

The other variables (`x`, `L1`, and `res`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not affect whether the loop executes or not. However, they are part of the initial state and should be included in the final state description.

Given these points, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `num` is greater than 0 and `i` starts at 0.

State: **`x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000, `num` must be greater than 0, `L1` is an empty list, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
