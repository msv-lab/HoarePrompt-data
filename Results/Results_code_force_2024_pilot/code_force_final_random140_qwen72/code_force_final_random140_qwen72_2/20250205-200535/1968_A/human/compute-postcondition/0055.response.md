Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `x` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000, `num` is greater than 0, `L1` is a list containing `num` elements, each element being an input integer, `res` is a list containing exactly `num` elements. Each element in `res` corresponds to the result of `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` for the smallest divisor `j` of `L1[i]` greater than or equal to 2, where `i` ranges from 0 to `num - 1`. The index `i` will have iterated through all valid indices in `L1` (i.e., from 0 to `num - 1`).**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations:
- The value of `x` remains unchanged, still within the range 2 to 1000.
- `num` is still greater than 0, indicating the number of elements in `L1`.
- `L1` is still a list with `num` elements, each being an input integer.
- `res` is now a list with exactly `num` elements. Each element in `res` is calculated by taking the corresponding element from `L1`, finding its smallest divisor greater than or equal to 2, and then performing the operation `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`.
- The loop has processed all elements in `L1` from index 0 to `num - 1`.
