Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000, `num` is greater than 0, `L1` is a list containing `num` elements, each element being an input integer, `res` is a list containing up to `num` elements. For each element `L1[i]` in `L1`, `res` contains the result of `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`, where `j` is the smallest divisor of `L1[i]` greater than or equal to 2. The index `i` has iterated through all elements of `L1`.**

### Explanation:
- **`x`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`num`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`L1`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`res`**: After all iterations, `res` will contain the results of the operation `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` for each element `L1[i]` in `L1`, where `j` is the smallest divisor of `L1[i]` greater than or equal to 2.
- **`i`**: The index `i` has iterated through all elements of `L1`, from 0 to `num - 1`.
- **`j`**: For each `L1[i]`, `j` starts from 2 and increments until it finds the smallest divisor of `L1[i]` greater than or equal to 2. Once found, the result is appended to `res` and the loop breaks for that particular `i`.

This means that after the loop completes, `res` will contain the transformed values for each element in `L1` based on the smallest divisor condition.
