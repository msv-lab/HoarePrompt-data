The code snippet `res.append(L1[i] // j * (j - 1))` performs the following actions:

1. It calculates the value of `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`.
2. It appends this calculated value to the list `res`.

Given the initial state:
- `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000.
- `num` is greater than 0.
- `L1` is a list containing `num` elements, each element being an input integer.
- `res` is a list containing up to `num` elements.
- `i` is 0.
- `L1[i]` must be at least 2.
- `j` is 3.

Let's break down the calculation:
- `L1[i]` is the first element of the list `L1`.
- `j` is 3.
- The expression `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` simplifies to `L1[i] // 3 * 2`.

Since `L1[i]` is at least 2, let's denote `L1[0]` as `a` (where `a` is an integer and `a ≥ 2`).

The calculation becomes:
- `a // 3 * 2`.

This value is then appended to the list `res`.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000.
- `num` is greater than 0.
- `L1` is a list containing `num` elements, each element being an input integer.
- `res` now contains one element, which is `a // 3 * 2`.
- `i` is 0.
- `L1[i]` is at least 2.
- `j` is 3.

Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000, `num` is greater than 0, `L1` is a list containing `num` elements, each element being an input integer, `res` is a list containing one element which is `L1[0] // 3 * 2`, `i` is 0, `L1[i]` is at least 2, `j` is 3.**
