Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000, `num` must be greater than 0, `L1` is a list containing `num` elements, each element being an input integer where the first element `L1[0]` must be at least 1, `res` is a list containing one element which is the result of `L1[0] // j * (j - 1)`, `i` is 0, and the current value of `L1[i]` is divisible by `j`.**
