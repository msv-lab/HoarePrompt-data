The code appends the result of the expression `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` to the list `res`. Given the initial conditions, let's break down the impact:

- `L1[i]` is an integer and is divisible by 2.
- `j` is 2.
- The expression `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` simplifies to `L1[i] // 2 * (2 - 1)`, which further simplifies to `L1[i] // 2`.

Since `L1[i]` is divisible by 2, `L1[i] // 2` will be an integer equal to half of `L1[i]`.

Therefore, the value `L1[i] // 2` is appended to the list `res`.

The other variables (`x`, `num`, `L1`, `i`, and `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000, `num` is greater than 0, `L1` is a list containing `num` elements, each element being an input integer, `res` is a list containing up to `num` elements, `i` is a valid index in `L1` (i.e., `i < num`), `L1[i]` must be at least 1, `j` is 2, and `L1[i]` is divisible by 2. The list `res` now contains one additional element, which is `L1[i] // 2`.**
