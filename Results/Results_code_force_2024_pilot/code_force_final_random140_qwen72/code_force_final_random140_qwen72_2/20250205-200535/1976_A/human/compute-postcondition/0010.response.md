Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `password` is the second element of the first tuple in `test_cases` and must be a non-empty string, `letters` is an empty string, and `digits` is a string containing the first character of `password` if it is a digit. Otherwise, `digits` remains an empty string.***
