Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `password` is the second element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `letters` is an empty string, `digits` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for ch in password:
    if ch.isalpha():
        letters += ch
    elif ch.isdigit():
        digits += ch


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `password` is the second element of the first tuple in `test_cases` and must be a non-empty string. If the first character of `password` (`ch`) is an alphabetic character, `letters` is a string containing `ch`, and `digits` remains an empty string. If `ch` is a digit, `digits` is a string containing `ch`, and `letters` remains an empty string. If `ch` is neither an alphabetic character nor a digit, both `letters` and `digits` remain empty strings.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `password` is the second element of the first tuple in `test_cases` and must be a non-empty string. If the first character of `password` (`ch1`) is an alphabetic character, `letters` is a string containing `ch1`, and `digits` remains an empty string. If `ch1` is a digit, `digits` is a string containing `ch1`, and `letters` remains an empty string. If `ch1` is neither an alphabetic character nor a digit, both `letters` and `digits` remain empty strings. After the if-else block, if the second character of `password` (`ch2`) is an alphabetic character, `letters` is a string containing both `ch1` and `ch2` if `ch1` was an alphabetic character, or just `ch2` if `ch1` was not an alphabetic character, and `digits` remains an empty string. If `ch2` is a digit, `digits` is a string containing both `ch1` and `ch2` if `ch1` was a digit, or just `ch2` if `ch1` was not a digit, and `letters` remains an empty string. If `ch2` is neither an alphabetic character nor a digit, `letters` and `digits` retain their previous values.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `password` is the second element of the first tuple in `test_cases` and must be a string with at least two characters, `ch` is the second character of `password` (denoted as `ch2`). If `ch` is an alphabetic character, `letters` is updated to include `ch2`, and `digits` retains its original value. If `ch` is a digit, `digits` is incremented by the value of `ch2`. Otherwise, `digits` retains its original value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
