Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least two tuples, `results` is a list that may contain the string 'NO' or 'YES' based on the conditions, `n` is the first element of the second tuple in `test_cases`, `password` is the second element of the second tuple in `test_cases` and must be a non-empty string, `letters` is a string containing all the alphabetic characters from `password`, and `digits` is a string containing all the digit characters from `password`. If either the alphabetic characters in `letters` are not in sorted order or the digit characters in `digits` are not in sorted order, `results` contains the string 'NO'. The program continues to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement. Additionally, either `letters` is empty, or `digits` is empty, or the last character in `letters` does not appear after the first character in `digits` in the `password`.***
