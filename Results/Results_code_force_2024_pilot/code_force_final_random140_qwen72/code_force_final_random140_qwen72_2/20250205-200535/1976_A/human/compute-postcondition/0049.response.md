The code snippet `letters += ch` appends the character `ch` to the string `letters`. Given the initial state, `ch` is the third character of `password`, which is the second element of the second tuple in `test_cases`. If `ch` is an alphabetic character, it will be appended to `letters`. If `ch` is a digit, `letters` remains unchanged because the initial state specifies that `digits` would be updated instead, but the code snippet only affects `letters`.

Let's break down the impact:

- `t` remains a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `test_cases` remains a list of tuples that must have at least two tuples.
- `results` remains a list that may contain the string 'NO' or 'YES' based on the conditions.
- `n` remains the first element of the second tuple in `test_cases`.
- `password` remains the second element of the second tuple in `test_cases` and must be a non-empty string.
- `ch` remains the third character of `password`.
- If `ch` is an alphabetic character, `letters` now contains `ch` (previously it was a string containing `ch`).
- If `ch` is a digit, `letters` remains an empty string.
- If `ch` is neither an alphabetic character nor a digit, both `letters` and `digits` remain empty strings.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least two tuples, `results` is a list that may contain the string 'NO' or 'YES' based on the conditions, `n` is the first element of the second tuple in `test_cases`, `password` is the second element of the second tuple in `test_cases` and must be a non-empty string, `ch` is the third character of `password`, if `ch` is an alphabetic character, `letters` is a string containing `ch`; if `ch` is a digit, `letters` remains an empty string; if `ch` is neither an alphabetic character nor a digit, both `letters` and `digits` remain empty strings.**
