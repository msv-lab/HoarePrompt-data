Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of tuples that has exactly `t` tuples, `results` is a list that contains `t` elements, each of which is either 'NO' or 'YES' based on the conditions evaluated for each corresponding tuple in `test_cases`. For each tuple `(n, password)` in `test_cases`, the string `letters` contains all alphabetic characters from `password` in the order they appear, and the string `digits` contains all digit characters from `password` in the order they appear. If either the list of `letters` is not sorted in ascending order or the list of `digits` is not sorted in ascending order, the corresponding element in `results` is 'NO'. If `letters` and `digits` are both non-empty and the last character in `letters` appears after the first character in `digits` in the `password`, the corresponding element in `results` is 'NO'. Otherwise, the corresponding element in `results` is 'YES'.**
