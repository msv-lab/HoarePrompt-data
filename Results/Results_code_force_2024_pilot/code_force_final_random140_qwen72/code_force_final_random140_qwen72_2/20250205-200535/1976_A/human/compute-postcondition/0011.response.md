Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `password` is the second element of the first tuple in `test_cases` and must be a non-empty string. If the first character of `password` (`ch`) is an alphabetic character, `letters` is a string containing `ch`, and `digits` remains an empty string. If `ch` is a digit, `digits` is a string containing `ch`, and `letters` remains an empty string. If `ch` is neither an alphabetic character nor a digit, both `letters` and `digits` remain empty strings.***
