Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least three tuples, `results` is a list that may contain the string 'NO' or 'YES' based on the conditions, `n` is the first element of the third tuple in `test_cases`, `password` is the second element of the third tuple in `test_cases` and must be a non-empty string, `letters` is an empty string, and `digits` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for ch in password:
    if ch.isalpha():
        letters += ch
    elif ch.isdigit():
        digits += ch


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least three tuples, `results` is a list that may contain the string 'NO' or 'YES' based on the conditions, `n` is the first element of the third tuple in `test_cases`, `password` is the second element of the third tuple in `test_cases` and must be a non-empty string, `letters` is a string containing the current character `ch` if `ch` is an alphabetic character, otherwise `letters` remains an empty string, and `digits` is a string containing the current character `ch` if `ch` is a digit, otherwise `digits` remains an empty string.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least three tuples, `results` is a list that may contain the string 'NO' or 'YES' based on the conditions, `n` is the first element of the third tuple in `test_cases`, `password` is the second element of the third tuple in `test_cases` and must be a non-empty string, `letters` is a string containing the current character `ch` if `ch` is an alphabetic character, otherwise `letters` remains an empty string, `digits` is a string containing the current character `ch` if `ch` is a digit, otherwise `digits` remains an empty string, `ch` is the next character in `password`. If `ch` is an alphabetic character, `letters` now contains `ch`. If `ch` is a digit, `digits` now contains the current character `ch`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least three tuples, `results` is a list that may contain the string 'NO' or 'YES' based on the conditions, `n` is the first element of the third tuple in `test_cases`, `password` is the second element of the third tuple in `test_cases` and must be a non-empty string, `letters` is a string containing the current character `ch` if `ch` is an alphabetic character, otherwise `letters` remains an empty string, `digits` is a string containing the current character `ch` if `ch` is a digit, otherwise `digits` remains an empty string, `ch` is the next character in `password`. If `ch` is an alphabetic character, `letters` now contains `ch`. If `ch` is a digit, `digits` now contains `ch`. If `ch` is neither an alphabetic character nor a digit, both `letters` and `digits` remain unchanged. `password` must have at least one more character left.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
