Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Monocarp is working on his new site, and the current challenge is to make the
users pick strong passwords.

Monocarp decided that strong passwords should satisfy the following
conditions:

  * password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits; 
  * there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends); 
  * all digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order; 
  * all letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order. 

Note that it's allowed for the password to have only letters or only digits.

Monocarp managed to implement the first condition, but he struggles with the
remaining ones. Can you help him to verify the passwords?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 20 )
— the length of the password.

The second line contains a string, consisting of exactly n characters. Each
character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if the given password is strong and "NO"
otherwise.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    12ac
    
    5
    
    123wa
    
    9
    
    allllmost
    
    5
    
    ac123
    
    6
    
    011679

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the second testcase, the letters are not sorted in the non-decreasing
order.

In the fourth testcase, there is a digit that comes after a letter — digit '1'
after a letter 'c'.

# Annotated Program:
t = int(input('Number of test cases, t = '))
test_cases = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input('Length of password, n: '))
    password = input('enter passowrd: ').strip()
    test_cases.append((n, password))
results = func_1(t, test_cases)
for result in results:
    print(result)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, representing the number of test cases. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 20) and a string s of length n, consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, password) in test_cases:
        letters = ''
        
        digits = ''
        
        for ch in password:
            if ch.isalpha():
                letters += ch
            elif ch.isdigit():
                digits += ch
        
        if list(letters) != sorted(letters) or list(digits) != sorted(digits):
            results.append('NO')
            continue
        
        if letters and digits and password.index(letters[-1]) > password.index(digits
            [0]):
            results.append('NO')
        else:
            results.append('YES')
        
    #State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of tuples that has exactly `t` tuples, `results` is a list that contains `t` elements, each of which is either 'NO' or 'YES' based on the conditions evaluated for each corresponding tuple in `test_cases`. For each tuple `(n, password)` in `test_cases`, the string `letters` contains all alphabetic characters from `password` in the order they appear, and the string `digits` contains all digit characters from `password` in the order they appear. If either the list of `letters` is not sorted in ascending order or the list of `digits` is not sorted in ascending order, the corresponding element in `results` is 'NO'. If `letters` and `digits` are both non-empty and the last character in `letters` appears after the first character in `digits` in the `password`, the corresponding element in `results` is 'NO'. Otherwise, the corresponding element in `results` is 'YES'.
    return results
    #The program returns a list `results` containing `t` elements, each of which is either 'NO' or 'YES'. Each element in `results` corresponds to a tuple `(n, password)` in `test_cases` and indicates whether the conditions for the letters and digits in `password` are met. If the letters or digits are not sorted in ascending order, or if the last letter appears before the first digit in `password`, the element is 'NO'. Otherwise, the element is 'YES'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `t`, a positive integer indicating the number of test cases, and `test_cases`, a list of tuples. Each tuple contains an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n`, where `s` consists only of lowercase Latin letters and digits. The function evaluates each `password` in `test_cases` to determine if the letters and digits within it meet specific conditions. It returns a list `results` with `t` elements, each being 'NO' or 'YES'. For each tuple `(n, password)` in `test_cases`, the corresponding element in `results` is 'NO' if the letters or digits in `password` are not sorted in ascending order, or if the last letter appears before the first digit in `password`. Otherwise, the element is 'YES'.
