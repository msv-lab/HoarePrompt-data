You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp is working on his new site, and the current challenge is to make the
users pick strong passwords.

Monocarp decided that strong passwords should satisfy the following
conditions:

  * password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits; 
  * there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends); 
  * all digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order; 
  * all letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order. 

Note that it's allowed for the password to have only letters or only digits.

Monocarp managed to implement the first condition, but he struggles with the
remaining ones. Can you help him to verify the passwords?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 20 )
— the length of the password.

The second line contains a string, consisting of exactly n characters. Each
character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if the given password is strong and "NO"
otherwise.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    12ac
    
    5
    
    123wa
    
    9
    
    allllmost
    
    5
    
    ac123
    
    6
    
    011679

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the second testcase, the letters are not sorted in the non-decreasing
order.

In the fourth testcase, there is a digit that comes after a letter — digit '1'
after a letter 'c'.

            continue
        if letters and digits and (password.index(letters[-1]) > password.index(digits[0])):
            results.append('NO')
        else:
            results.append('YES')
    return results



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input('Number of test cases, t = '))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, representing the number of test cases. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 20) and a string s of length n, consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, password) in test_cases:
        letters = ''
        
        digits = ''
        
        for ch in password:
            if ch.isalpha():
                letters += ch
            elif ch.isdigit():

    #State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of tuples that has exactly `t` tuples, `results` is a list that contains `t` elements, each of which is either 'NO' or 'YES' based on the conditions evaluated for each corresponding tuple in `test_cases`. For each tuple `(n, password)` in `test_cases`, the string `letters` contains all alphabetic characters from `password` in the order they appear, and the string `digits` contains all digit characters from `password` in the order they appear. If either the list of `letters` is not sorted in ascending order or the list of `digits` is not sorted in ascending order, the corresponding element in `results` is 'NO'. If `letters` and `digits` are both non-empty and the last character in `letters` appears after the first character in `digits` in the `password`, the corresponding element in `results` is 'NO'. Otherwise, the corresponding element in `results` is 'YES'.
    return results
    #The program returns a list `results` containing `t` elements, each of which is either 'NO' or 'YES'. Each element in `results` corresponds to a tuple `(n, password)` in `test_cases` and indicates whether the conditions for the letters and digits in `password` are met. If the letters or digits are not sorted in ascending order, or if the last letter appears before the first digit in `password`, the element is 'NO'. Otherwise, the element is 'YES'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `t`, a positive integer indicating the number of test cases, and `test_cases`, a list of tuples. Each tuple contains an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n`, where `s` consists only of lowercase Latin letters and digits. The function evaluates each `password` in `test_cases` to determine if the letters and digits within it meet specific conditions. It returns a list `results` with `t` elements, each being 'NO' or 'YES'. For each tuple `(n, password)` in `test_cases`, the corresponding element in `results` is 'NO' if the letters or digits in `password` are not sorted in ascending order, or if the last letter appears before the first digit in `password`. Otherwise, the element is 'YES'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly handle all the conditions specified in the problem description. It checks for the following:

1. **Sorting of Letters and Digits**: The program ensures that both the letters and digits in the password are sorted in non-decreasing order.
2. **No Digit After Letter**: The program checks that no digit appears after a letter in the password.
3. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.

The program iterates through each character in the password, separating letters and digits, and then checks the sorting conditions and the condition that no digit should come after a letter. If any of these conditions fail, it appends "NO" to the results; otherwise, it appends "YES".

Given the constraints and the problem description, the program seems to handle all edge cases and potential inputs correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.
