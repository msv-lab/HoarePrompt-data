### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the password `n` and the password itself.
   - It stores these in a list `test_cases`.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `func_1` takes the number of test cases `t` and the list of test cases `test_cases` as arguments.
   - For each test case, it separates the letters and digits from the password into two separate strings.

3. **Condition Checking:**
   - **Sorted Order Check:**
     - It checks if the letters and digits are sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing the original lists with their sorted versions.
     - If either the letters or digits are not sorted, it appends 'NO' to the results and continues to the next test case.
   - **Digit After Letter Check:**
     - It checks if there is any digit that comes after a letter by comparing the indices of the last letter and the first digit.
     - If such a condition is found, it appends 'NO' to the results.
   - If both conditions are satisfied, it appends 'YES' to the results.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the results for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the input and output format.
- It correctly separates letters and digits and checks the sorting conditions.
- It also correctly checks the condition where a digit should not come after a letter.

However, there is a minor issue in the code that needs to be addressed:
- In the line `if letters and digits and password.index(letters[-1]) > password.index(digits[0]):`, the condition should be `password.index(letters[-1]) < password.index(digits[0])` because we want to ensure that the last letter appears before the first digit, not after.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, password) in test_cases:
        letters = ''
        digits = ''
        for ch in password:
            if ch.isalpha():
                letters += ch
            elif ch.isdigit():
                digits += ch
        if list(letters) != sorted(letters) or list(digits) != sorted(digits):
            results.append('NO')
            continue
        if letters and digits and password.index(letters[-1]) < password.index(digits[0]):
            results.append('NO')
        else:
            results.append('YES')
    return results
```

### Conclusion:
The original assessment was mostly correct, but there was a logical error in the condition checking for the digit after letter rule. The corrected condition ensures that the program behaves as expected.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False** (due to the logical error in the condition check)
