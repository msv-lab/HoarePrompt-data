### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the password `n` and the password itself.
   - It stores these in a list `test_cases`.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `func_1` takes the number of test cases `t` and the list of test cases `test_cases` as arguments.
   - For each test case, it separates the letters and digits from the password into two separate strings.

3. **Condition Checking:**
   - **Sorted Order Check:**
     - It checks if the letters and digits are sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing the original lists with their sorted versions.
     - If either the letters or digits are not sorted, it appends 'NO' to the results and continues to the next test case.
   - **Digit After Letter Check:**
     - It checks if there is any digit that comes after a letter by comparing the indices of the last letter and the first digit.
     - If such a condition is found, it appends 'NO' to the results.
   - If both conditions are satisfied, it appends 'YES' to the results.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the results for each test case.

### Detailed Analysis:
- **Input Handling:**
  - The input handling is correct and follows the problem description.
  - The program reads the number of test cases and then reads each test case's length and password.

- **Function Definition:**
  - The function `func_1` is well-defined and takes the appropriate parameters.
  - It correctly separates the letters and digits from the password.

- **Condition Checking:**
  - **Sorted Order Check:**
    - The program correctly checks if the letters and digits are sorted in non-decreasing order.
    - This is done by comparing the original lists with their sorted versions.
  - **Digit After Letter Check:**
    - The program correctly checks if there is any digit that comes after a letter.
    - It does this by comparing the index of the last letter with the index of the first digit.
    - However, there is a potential issue in the logic: the check `if letters and digits and (password.index(letters[-1]) > password.index(digits[0]))` might not cover all edge cases. Specifically, if the password contains only letters or only digits, the conditions `letters and digits` will fail, which is correct according to the problem statement. However, the logic should be robust enough to handle such cases without unnecessary checks.

- **Output:**
  - The program correctly prints the results for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the provided problem description and constraints. The logic for checking the conditions is sound and covers all the required cases.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**
