Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and k are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 100, representing the number of cards and the number of cards exchanged in each operation, respectively. Additionally, c_1, c_2, ..., c_n are integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100, representing the numbers on the cards.**
