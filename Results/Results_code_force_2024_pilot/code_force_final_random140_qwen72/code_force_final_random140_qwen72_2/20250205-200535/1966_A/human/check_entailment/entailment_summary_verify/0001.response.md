### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the list of card values `a`.

2. **Frequency Count**: The function uses a dictionary `h` to count the frequency of each card value in the list `a`. This is done correctly using a loop and the `if-else` statement to update the dictionary.

3. **Minimum Cards Calculation**: The function initializes `ans` to `n`, which is the initial number of cards. However, the logic to reduce the number of cards is incomplete. The variable `ams` is set to `k - 1` when the frequency of a card value reaches `k`, but this value is not used to update `ans`.

4. **Output**: The function prints `ans` for each test case, but since `ans` is never updated, it always prints the initial number of cards `n`.

### Issues:
- The variable `ams` is set to `k - 1` but is not used to update `ans`.
- The logic to reduce the number of cards is missing. Specifically, when a card value reaches a frequency of `k`, the function should reduce the total number of cards by `1` (since `k` cards are exchanged for `k - 1` cards).

### Corrected Logic:
To correctly implement the logic, we need to reduce `ans` by `1` every time a card value reaches a frequency of `k`. Additionally, we need to reset the count for the current card value after performing the exchange.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        h = {}
        ans = n
        for i in a:
            if i in h:
                h[i] += 1
            else:
                h[i] = 1
            if h[i] >= k:
                ans -= 1  # Reduce the total number of cards by 1
                h[i] -= k  # Reset the count for the current card value
        print(ans)
```

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

The original program does not correctly update the number of cards after performing the exchange operation, leading to incorrect results. The corrected code provided above addresses these issues and should produce the correct output.
