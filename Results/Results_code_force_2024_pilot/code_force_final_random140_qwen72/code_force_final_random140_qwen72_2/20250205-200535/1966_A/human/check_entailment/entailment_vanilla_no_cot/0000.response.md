Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly compute the minimum number of cards that can be left in the hand after performing the allowed operations. Specifically, the logic inside the loop that updates `h[i]` and checks if `h[i] >= k` does not actually reduce the count of cards or update the answer accordingly. The variable `ams` is assigned but never used, and the final `print(ans)` always outputs the initial number of cards `n`, which is incorrect.

To solve this problem correctly, you need to:
1. Count the frequency of each card.
2. For each unique card, determine how many full exchanges can be made (`freq // k`), and then calculate the remaining cards after these exchanges.
3. Sum up the remaining cards for all unique cards to get the minimum number of cards left.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        h = {}
        
        # Count the frequency of each card
        for i in a:
            if i in h:
                h[i] += 1
            else:
                h[i] = 1
        
        # Calculate the minimum number of cards left
        ans = 0
        for freq in h.values():
            ans += freq % k + (k - 1 if freq % k > 0 else 0)
        
        print(ans)
```

This corrected version correctly calculates the minimum number of cards left after performing the allowed operations.
