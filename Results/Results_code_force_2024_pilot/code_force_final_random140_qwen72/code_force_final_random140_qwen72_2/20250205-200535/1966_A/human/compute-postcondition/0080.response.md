The code snippet `ams = k - 1` assigns the value of `k - 1` to the variable `ams`. This operation does not affect any other variables or the overall state of the program beyond changing the value of `ams`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500
- `n` is an input integer
- `k` is an input integer
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 3 elements
- `h` is a dictionary with the key `i` (the third element in the list `a`). If `i` was already a key in `h`, its value is incremented by 1; otherwise, its value is set to 1
- `ans` is equal to `n`
- `i` is the third element in the list `a`
- If `h[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ams` is set to `k - 1`. Otherwise, `ams` remains unchanged

After executing the code snippet `ams = k - 1`:
- `ams` is now set to `k - 1`
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `h`, `ans`, `i`) remain unchanged

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 3 elements, `h` is a dictionary with the key `i` (the third element in the list `a`). If `i` was already a key in `h`, its value is incremented by 1; otherwise, its value is set to 1, `ans` is equal to `n`, `i` is the third element in the list `a`, `ams` is `k - 1`.**
