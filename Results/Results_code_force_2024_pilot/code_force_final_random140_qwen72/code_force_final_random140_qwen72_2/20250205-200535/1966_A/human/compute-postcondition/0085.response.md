The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the context given, it appears to process multiple test cases, each defined by the number of cards (`n`), the number of cards exchanged in each operation (`k`), and the values on the cards (`c_1, c_2, ..., c_n`). The function likely processes these inputs for each test case and returns some result based on the operations performed.

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 100, representing the number of cards and the number of cards exchanged in each operation, respectively.
- `c_1, c_2, ..., c_n` are integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100, representing the numbers on the cards.

The function's output is not specified, but it is expected to return a result for each test case based on the operations involving `n`, `k`, and the card values.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by the number of cards (`n`), the number of cards exchanged in each operation (`k`), and the values on the cards (`c_1, c_2, ..., c_n`).
