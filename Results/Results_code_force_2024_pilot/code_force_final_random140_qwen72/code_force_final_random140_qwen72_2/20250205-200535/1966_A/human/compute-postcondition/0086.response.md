Functionality: ** The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of the number of cards (`n`), the number of cards exchanged in each operation (`k`), and the values on the cards (`c_1, c_2, ..., c_n`). For each test case, it counts the occurrences of each card value. If any card value appears at least `k` times, the function sets the result to `k - 1`; otherwise, the result remains `n`. The function prints the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value. **
