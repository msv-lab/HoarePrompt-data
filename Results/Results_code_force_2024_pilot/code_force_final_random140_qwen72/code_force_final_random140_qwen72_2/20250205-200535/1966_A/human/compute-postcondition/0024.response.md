Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer from the first part of the input, `k` is an integer from the second part of the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least three elements, `i` is the third element of the list `a`, `h` is a dictionary that may or may not contain the key `i` (if `i` is a key in `h`, then `h[i]` is incremented by 1; if `i` is not a key in `h`, then `h` is updated to include the key `i` with the value 1), `ans` remains equal to `n` or `k - 1` depending on the conditions described, `ams` is `k - 1`.**
