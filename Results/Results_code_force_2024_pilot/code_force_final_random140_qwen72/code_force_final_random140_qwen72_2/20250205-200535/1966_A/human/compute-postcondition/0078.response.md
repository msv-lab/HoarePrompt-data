Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 3 elements, `h` is a dictionary with the key `i` (the third element in the list `a`) and its value is 1, `ans` is equal to `n`, `i` is the third element in the list `a`, `ams` remains unchanged.** 

Explanation:
- The value of `h[i]` is set to 1, where `i` is the third element in the list `a`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `ans`, `i`, `ams`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
