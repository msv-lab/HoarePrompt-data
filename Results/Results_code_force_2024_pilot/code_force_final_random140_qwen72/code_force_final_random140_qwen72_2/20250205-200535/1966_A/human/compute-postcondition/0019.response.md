Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer from the first part of the input, `k` is an integer from the second part of the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least two elements, `ans` is equal to `n`, `i` is the second element of the list `a`. If `i` is a key in the dictionary `h` and `h[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ams` is set to `k - 1`. If `i` is not a key in `h`, then `h` is updated to include the key `i` with the value 1. If `i` is a key in `h` but `h[i]` is less than `k`, then `h[i]` is increased by 1.***
