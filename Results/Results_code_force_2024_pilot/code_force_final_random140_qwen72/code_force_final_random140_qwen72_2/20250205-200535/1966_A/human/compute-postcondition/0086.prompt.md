You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and k are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 100, representing the number of cards and the number of cards exchanged in each operation, respectively. Additionally, c_1, c_2, ..., c_n are integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100, representing the numbers on the cards.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        h = {}
        
        ans = n
        
        for i in a:
            if i in h:
                h[i] += 1
            else:
                h[i] = 1
            if h[i] >= k:
                ams = k - 1
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input for each test case, `a` is a list of integers read from the input for each test case, `h` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a` and its value is the count of occurrences of that integer in `a`, `ans` is set to `n` initially but is updated to `k - 1` if any integer in `a` appears at least `k` times. The final output for each test case is printed as `ans`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by the number of cards (`n`), the number of cards exchanged in each operation (`k`), and the values on the cards (`c_1, c_2, ..., c_n`). It returns a result for each test case based on the operations involving these parameters.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
