Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 3 elements, `h` is a dictionary with the key `i` (the third element in the list `a`). If `i` was already a key in `h`, its value is incremented by 1; otherwise, its value is set to 1, `ans` is equal to `n`, `i` is the third element in the list `a`. If `h[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ams` is set to `k - 1`. Otherwise, `ams` remains unchanged.***
