The value of `t` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `t` was an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 498, so after decrementing, `t` will be within the range 0 ≤ t ≤ 497. The values of `n`, `k`, `c`, `arrC`, `hashmap`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range 0 ≤ t ≤ 497, `n` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 100, `c` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100, `arrC` is a list of integers read from user input, `hashmap` is a dictionary containing the frequency counts of each integer in `arrC`, `ans` is set to `k - 1` if any integer in `arrC` appears `k` or more times, otherwise `ans` remains equal to `n`.**
