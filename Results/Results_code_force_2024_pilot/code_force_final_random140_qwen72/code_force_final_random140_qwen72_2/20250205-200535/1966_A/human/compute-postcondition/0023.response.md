Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer from the first part of the input, `k` is an integer from the second part of the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least three elements, `i` is the third element of the list `a`. If `i` is a key in the dictionary `h`, then `h[i]` is incremented by 1. If `i` is not a key in `h`, then `h` is updated to include the key `i` with the value 1. In both cases, `ans` remains equal to `n` or `k - 1` depending on the conditions described.***
