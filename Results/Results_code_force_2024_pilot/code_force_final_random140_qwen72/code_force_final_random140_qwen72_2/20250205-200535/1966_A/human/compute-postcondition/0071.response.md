Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 2 elements, `h` is a dictionary with the key `i` (the first element in the list `a`) and its value is 1 if `i` was not already a key in `h`, or incremented by 1 if `i` was already a key in `h`, `ans` is equal to `n`, `i` is the second element in the list `a`, `h[i]` is incremented by 1. If `h[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ams` is set to `k - 1`.** 

Explanation: The value of `h[i]` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. If the updated value of `h[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ams` is set to `k - 1`. The rest of the initial state remains valid.
