Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer input by the user within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 100, and `c` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100.
Code of the loop:
while t > 0:
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    arrC = list(map(int, input().split()))
    hashmap = {}
    ans = n
    for i in arrC:
        if i in hashmap:
            hashmap[i] += 1
        else:
            hashmap[i] = 1
        if hashmap[i] >= k:
            ans = k - 1
    print(ans)
    t -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer within the range 0 ≤ t ≤ 499, `n` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 100, `c` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100, `arrC` is a list of integers read from user input, `hashmap` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each element in `arrC`, `ans` is `k - 1` if any element in `arrC` appears `k` or more times, otherwise `ans` remains equal to `n`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an integer within the range 0 ≤ t ≤ 498, `n` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 100, `c` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100, `arrC` is a list of integers read from user input, `hashmap` is a dictionary containing the frequency count of each integer in `arrC`, and `ans` is either `k - 1` if any integer in `arrC` appears `k` or more times, or `n` if no integer in `arrC` appears `k` or more times.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an integer within the range 0 ≤ t ≤ 497, `n` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 100, `c` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100, `arrC` is a list of integers read from user input, `hashmap` is a dictionary containing the frequency counts of each integer in `arrC`, `ans` is set to `k - 1` if any integer in `arrC` appears `k` or more times, otherwise `ans` remains equal to `n`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
