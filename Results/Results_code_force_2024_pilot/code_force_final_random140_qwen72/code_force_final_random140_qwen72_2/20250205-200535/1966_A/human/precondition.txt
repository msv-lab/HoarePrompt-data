t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 2 <= k <= 100, representing the number of cards and the number of cards exchanged in each operation, respectively. c is a list of n integers such that 1 <= c_i <= 100, representing the numbers written on the cards.
