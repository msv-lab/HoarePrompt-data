Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is `t-1`, `n` is the first integer from the last input, `k` is the second integer from the last input. If `k` is even and half of `k` is odd, the program prints `k // 2 + 1`. Otherwise, the program prints `ceil(k / 2)`.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: The total number of test cases remains unchanged as it was initially provided.
- **`_`**: After all iterations, the loop variable `_` will be equal to `t-1` because the loop runs `t` times, and `_` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration.
- **`n` and `k`**: These are the inputs for the last test case. They are read from the input during the final iteration of the loop.
- **Condition Check**: The condition inside the loop checks if `k` is even and if `k // 2` is odd. If this condition is true, the program prints `k // 2 + 1`. Otherwise, it prints `ceil(k / 2)`. This check is performed for each test case, including the last one.

Thus, the final state of the loop after all iterations is as described above.
