Initial State: 
- `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `_` is 2.
- `n` is the first integer from the new input.
- `k` is the second integer from the new input.

Code Snippet:
```python
print(k // 2 + 1)
```

Explanation:
- The variable `k` is the second integer from the new input.
- The expression `k // 2` performs integer division of `k` by 2, which means it divides `k` by 2 and truncates the result to the nearest whole number towards zero.
- Adding 1 to the result of `k // 2` gives the final value to be printed.

Since the exact value of `k` is not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of `k`.

Output: **(k // 2 + 1) (where k is the second integer from the new input)**
