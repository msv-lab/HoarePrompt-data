The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the given parameter constraints, it is implied that the function should accept three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `k`. Here, `t` represents the number of test cases, `n` represents the size of the square grid, and `k` represents the minimum number of diagonals that must contain at least one colored cell. The function's output is not specified in the problem statement, but typically, such a function would return a result for each test case based on the values of `n` and `k`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `k`, where `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the size of the square grid, and `k` is the minimum number of diagonals that must contain at least one colored cell. For each test case, the function processes the values of `n` and `k` and returns a result based on these parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `k`. It processes `t` test cases, where for each test case, it takes the size of the square grid `n` and the minimum number of diagonals `k` that must contain at least one colored cell, and returns a result for each test case based on these parameters.**
