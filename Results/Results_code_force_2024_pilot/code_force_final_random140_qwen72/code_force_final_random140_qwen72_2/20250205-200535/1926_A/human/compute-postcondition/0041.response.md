The value of `h` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Since the initial state specifies that `h` is the number of non-'A' characters in the new `a` plus 1 if the second character of `a` is 'A', or the number of non-'A' characters in the new `a` plus 1 otherwise, incrementing `h` by 1 means `h` is now the number of non-'A' characters in the new `a` plus 2 if the second character of `a` is 'A', or the number of non-'A' characters in the new `a` plus 2 otherwise.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a non-empty input string with at least 2 characters, `j` is the second character of `a`, if the second character of `a` is 'A', `l` is the number of 'A' characters in the new `a` plus 1, and `h` is the number of non-'A' characters in the new `a` plus 2. Otherwise, `l` is the number of 'A' characters in the new `a`, and `h` is the number of non-'A' characters in the new `a` plus 2.**
