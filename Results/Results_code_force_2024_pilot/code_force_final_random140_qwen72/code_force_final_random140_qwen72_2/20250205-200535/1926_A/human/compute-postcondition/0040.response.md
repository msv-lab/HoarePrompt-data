The value of `l` is incremented by 1. The initial state specifies that `l` is the number of 'A' characters in the new `a` plus 1 if the second character of `a` is 'A', or the number of 'A' characters in the new `a` otherwise. After incrementing `l` by 1, the new value of `l` will be the number of 'A' characters in the new `a` plus 2 if the second character of `a` is 'A', or the number of 'A' characters in the new `a` plus 1 otherwise. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a non-empty input string with at least 2 characters, `j` is the second character of `a`, if the second character of `a` is 'A', `l` is the number of 'A' characters in the new `a` plus 2, and `h` is the number of non-'A' characters in the new `a`. Otherwise, `l` is the number of 'A' characters in the new `a` plus 1, and `h` is the number of non-'A' characters in the new `a` plus 1.**
