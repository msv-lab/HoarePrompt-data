Postcondition: ***`userString` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B', `list(userString)` is a list of 5 elements, each element being one of the letters from `userString`, `countA` is the number of 'A's in `userString`, and `countB` is the number of 'B's in `userString`. If `countA` is greater than `countB`, the condition `countA > countB` holds true. If `countA` is less than or equal to `countB`, the condition `countA <= countB` holds true. Specifically, if `countB` is greater than `countA`, the condition `countB > countA` holds true. If `countB` is equal to `countA`, the condition `countB == countA` holds true.***
