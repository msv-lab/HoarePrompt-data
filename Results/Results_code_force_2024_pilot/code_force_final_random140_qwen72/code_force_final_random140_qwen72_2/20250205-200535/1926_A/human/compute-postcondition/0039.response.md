The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the string `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `a`. If `a` has more characters, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `a` is a non-empty input string with at least 2 characters, and `j` is the first character of `a`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must still have at least 2 characters, and `j` will now be the second character of `a`.

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a non-empty input string with at least 2 characters. If the second character of `a` is 'A', `l` is the number of 'A' characters in the new `a` plus 1, and `h` is the number of non-'A' characters in the new `a`. Otherwise, `l` is the number of 'A' characters in the new `a`, and `h` is the number of non-'A' characters in the new `a` plus 1. `j` is the second character of `a`.**
