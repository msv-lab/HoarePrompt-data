Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer input by the user such that 1 <= t <= 32, representing the number of test cases. Each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B'. All t strings in a test are distinct, l is 0, h is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    a = str(input())
    for j in a:
        if j in 'A':
            l += 1
        else:
            h += 1
    if l > h:
        print('A')
    elif l < h:
        print('B')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is the input string, `l` is the number of 'A' characters in `a`, and `h` is the number of non-'A' characters in `a`. If `l` is greater than `h`, the conditions remain unchanged. If `l` is less than or equal to `h`, the conditions also remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is the original input string, `l` is the total number of 'A' characters in `a`, and `h` is the total number of non-'A' characters in `a`. If `l` is greater than `h`, the condition `l > h` holds true. Otherwise, the condition `l <= h` holds true.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is the new input string, `l` is the total number of 'A' characters in the new input string, and `h` is the total number of non-'A' characters in the new input string. If the total number of 'A' characters (`l`) is greater than the total number of non-'A' characters (`h`), then `l` is greater than `h`. Otherwise, `l` is less than or equal to `h`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
