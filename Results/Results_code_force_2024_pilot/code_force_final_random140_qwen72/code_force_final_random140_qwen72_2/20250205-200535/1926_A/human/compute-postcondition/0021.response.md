The value of `countB` is incremented by 1. Initially, if `letter` is 'A', `countB` is 0, and if `letter` is 'B', `countB` is 2. After the increment, if `letter` is 'A', `countB` becomes 1, and if `letter` is 'B', `countB` becomes 3. The values of `userString`, `list(userString)`, `letter`, and `countA` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`userString` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B', `list(userString)` is a list of 5 elements, each element being one of the letters from `userString`, `letter` is the third character of `userString`. If `letter` is 'A', `countA` is 2 and `countB` is 1. If `letter` is 'B', `countB` is 3 and `countA` is 0. If `letter` is neither 'A' nor 'B', `countA` and `countB` remain 0.**
