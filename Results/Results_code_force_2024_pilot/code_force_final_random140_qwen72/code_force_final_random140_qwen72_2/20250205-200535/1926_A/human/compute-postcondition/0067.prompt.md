Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is the new input string, `l` is the total number of 'A' characters in the new input string, and `h` is the total number of non-'A' characters in the new input string. If `l` is greater than `h`, the condition `l > h` holds true. Otherwise, the condition `l <= h` holds true.
Code of the loop:
for j in a:
    if j in 'A':
        l += 1
    else:
        h += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is the new input string that must have at least one character, `l` is the total number of 'A' characters in the new input string (increased by 1 if the first character `j` is 'A'), `h` is the total number of non-'A' characters in the new input string (increased by 1 if the first character `j` is not 'A'), and `j` is the first character in `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is the new input string that must have at least two characters, `l` is the total number of 'A' characters in the new input string (increased by 2 if the first character `j` is 'A', or increased by 1 if the first character `j` is not 'A'), `h` is the total number of non-'A' characters in the new input string (increased by 1 if the first character `j` is not 'A', or unchanged if the first character `j` is 'A'), and `j` is the second character in `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is the new input string that must have at least three characters, and `j` is the third character in `a`. If `j` is 'A', `l` is the total number of 'A' characters in the new input string (increased by 3 if the first character `j` is 'A', or increased by 2 if the first character `j` is not 'A'), and `h` is the total number of non-'A' characters in the new input string (unchanged if the first character `j` is 'A', or increased by 1 if the first character `j` is not 'A'). If `j` is not 'A', `l` is the total number of 'A' characters in the new input string (increased by 2 if the first character `j` is 'A', or increased by 1 if the first character `j` is not 'A'), and `h` is the total number of non-'A' characters in the new input string (increased by 2 if the first character `j` is not 'A', or increased by 1 if the first character `j` is 'A').




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
