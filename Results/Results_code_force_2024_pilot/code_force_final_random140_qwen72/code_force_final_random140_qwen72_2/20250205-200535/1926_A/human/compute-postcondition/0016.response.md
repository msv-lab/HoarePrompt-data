The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since there is no loop explicitly mentioned in the context, the `continue` statement would typically be used within a loop structure. However, since we are only considering the immediate effect of the `continue` statement without the context of a loop, the values of the variables do not change.

Output State: **`userString` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B', `list(userString)` is a list of 5 elements, each element being one of the letters from `userString`, `letter` is the second character of `userString`. If `letter` is 'A', `countA` is 1 and `countB` is 0. If `letter` is 'B', `countB` is 1 and `countA` is 0. If `letter` is neither 'A' nor 'B', `countA` and `countB` remain 0.**
