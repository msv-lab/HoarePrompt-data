Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is the original input string, `l` is the total number of 'A' characters in `a`, and `h` is the total number of non-'A' characters in `a`. If `l` is less than `h`, the condition `l < h` holds true. Otherwise, the condition `l <= h` holds true.***
