Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is the new input string that must have at least three characters, and `j` is the third character in `a`. If `j` is 'A', `l` is the total number of 'A' characters in the new input string (increased by 3 if the first character `j` is 'A', or increased by 2 if the first character `j` is not 'A'), and `h` is the total number of non-'A' characters in the new input string (unchanged if the first character `j` is 'A', or increased by 1 if the first character `j` is not 'A'). If `j` is not 'A', `l` is the total number of 'A' characters in the new input string (increased by 2 if the first character `j` is 'A', or increased by 1 if the first character `j` is not 'A'), and `h` is the total number of non-'A' characters in the new input string (increased by 2 if the first character `j` is not 'A', or increased by 1 if the first character `j` is 'A').***
