Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes a string `userString` of length 5, which consists only of the characters 'A' and 'B'. It counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in `userString`. If there are more 'A's than 'B's, it prints 'A'. If there are more 'B's than 'A's, it prints 'B'. If the counts of 'A' and 'B' are equal, it does nothing. The function does not return any value. After the function completes, `userString` remains unchanged, and the counts of 'A' and 'B' are stored in `countA` and `countB` respectively. **
