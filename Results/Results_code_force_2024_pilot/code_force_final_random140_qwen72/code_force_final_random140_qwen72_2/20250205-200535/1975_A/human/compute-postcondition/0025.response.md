To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `n` is greater than 2.
   - `a` is a list of integers from user input.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `new` is a list containing elements from index 2 to the end of `a`.
   - `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than the first element of `a`, otherwise `False`.
   - `new_all` is `True` if `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('YES')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement simply prints the string `'YES'`.
   - The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `new`, `check_all`, and `new_all` do not directly influence the output of this specific `print` statement.
   - The conditions and variables mentioned in the initial state are not used within the `print` statement itself.

Given the above analysis, the output of the `print` statement is straightforward:

Output: **YES**
