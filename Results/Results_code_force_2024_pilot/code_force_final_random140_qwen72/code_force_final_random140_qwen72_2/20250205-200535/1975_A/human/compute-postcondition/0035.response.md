To determine what will be printed by the `print('YES')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `n` is greater than 3.
   - `a` is a list of integers from user input.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `new` is a list containing elements from index 3 to the end of `a`.
   - `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than the first element of `a`, otherwise `False`.
   - `new_all` is `True` if `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print('YES')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement simply prints the string `'YES'`.
   - The conditions and variables described in the initial state do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the statement does not reference any of these variables or conditions.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is straightforward and independent of the initial state conditions.

Output: **YES**
