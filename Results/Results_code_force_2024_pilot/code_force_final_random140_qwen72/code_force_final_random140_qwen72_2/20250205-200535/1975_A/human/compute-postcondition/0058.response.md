Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers from the new user input, `i` is 1, `new` is a list containing elements from index `i` to the end of `a`, `check_all` is `False`, `new_all` is `False`, and either `check_all` is `False` or `new_all` is `False`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
