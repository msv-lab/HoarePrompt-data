The function `func` does not explicitly define its parameters within the function signature. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function should accept the following parameters:

- `t`: An integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - `n`: An integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, representing the length of the array `a`.
  - `a`: A list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, representing the elements of the array `a`.

The function's output is not specified in the problem statement, but typically, such a function would process each test case and return some result based on the input arrays.

Functionality: **The function accepts a number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it accepts an integer `n` and a list of integers `a` of length `n`. The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the input arrays.**
