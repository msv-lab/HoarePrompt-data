Let's analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

- `t` is greater than 0.
- `n` is greater than 2.
- `a` is a list of integers from the new user input.
- `i` is 2.
- `new` is a list containing elements from index 2 to the end of `a`.
- `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than `a[0]`, otherwise `check_all` is `False`.
- `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `new_all` is `False`.
- If `a[1] > a[2]`, then either `check_all` is `False` or `new_all` is `False`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Given these conditions, let's determine what will be printed by the `print('NO')` statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **List `a` and Sublist `new`:**
   - `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index 2 to the end of `a`.

2. **Conditions for `check_all` and `new_all`:**
   - `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than `a[0]`.
   - `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order.

3. **Condition for Breaking Out:**
   - If `a[1] > a[2]`, then either `check_all` is `False` or `new_all` is `False`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

4. **Execution of the `print('NO')` Statement:**
   - The `print('NO')` statement is executed unconditionally in the given code snippet.
   - This means that regardless of the values of `check_all` and `new_all`, the statement `print('NO')` will always execute.

### Conclusion:
The `print('NO')` statement will always print "NO" because it is not conditional and will execute regardless of the values of `check_all` and `new_all`.

Output: **NO**
