To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop head:

### Given Information:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `a` is a list of integers from the input.
- `check_all` is `True` if `a` is strictly increasing, otherwise `False`.
- `i` is 1.
- If `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, `new` is the sublist of `a` starting from index 1 to the end.
- `new_all` is `True` if `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`.
- If `check_all` is `True` and `new_all` is `True`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
- If either `check_all` is `False` or `new_all` is `False` or both, we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop head involves the variable `i` and the upper limit `n`.
- The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

### Current State:
- `i` is 1.
- `n` must be greater than 1.

### Adjustments Needed:
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
- `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

### New State:
- `i` is incremented from 1 to 2.
- `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `check_all` is `True` if `a` is strictly increasing, otherwise `False`, `i` is 2, `new` is the sublist of `a` starting from index 1 to the end, `new_all` is `True` if `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`.**
