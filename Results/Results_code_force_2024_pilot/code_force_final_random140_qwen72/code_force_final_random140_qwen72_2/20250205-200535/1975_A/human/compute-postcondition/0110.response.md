Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `check_all` is `True` if `a[0]` is greater than every element in `new`, otherwise `False`, `i` is 2, `new` is the sublist of `a` starting from index 2 to the end, `new_all` is `True` if `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`. Regardless of whether `check_all` and `new_all` are both `True` or not, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
