Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 0.
- `n` must be greater than 3.
- `a` is a list of integers from the input.
- `i` is 3.
- `new` is the sublist of `a` starting from index 3 to the end.
- `check_all` is `True` if `a[0]` is greater than every element in `new`, otherwise `check_all` is `False`.
- `new_all` is `True` if every element in `new` is less than or equal to the next element, otherwise `new_all` is `False`.

The print statement is:
```python
print('NO')
```

This statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
