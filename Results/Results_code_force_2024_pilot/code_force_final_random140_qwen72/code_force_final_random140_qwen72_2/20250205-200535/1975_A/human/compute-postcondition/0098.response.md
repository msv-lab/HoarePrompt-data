Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 0.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `a` is a list of integers from the input.
- `check_all` is `True` if `a[0]` is greater than all elements in `new`, otherwise `False`.
- `i` is 1.
- `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`.
- `new` is the sublist of `a` starting from index 1 to the end.
- `new_all` is `True` if `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`.
- Either `check_all` is `False` or `new_all` is `False` or both.

Given these conditions, the `print` statement is:

```python
print('NO')
```

### Explanation:
- The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'NO'`.
- The conditions provided do not affect the output of the `print` statement directly. They only describe the state of the program before the `print` statement is executed.
- Since the `print` statement is a simple string literal, it will always print `'NO'` regardless of the values of the variables described in the initial state.

### Final Output:
Output: **NO**
