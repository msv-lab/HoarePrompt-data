To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `n` is greater than 3.
   - `a` is a list of integers from new user input.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `new` is a list containing elements from index 3 to the end of `a`.
   - `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than `a[0]`, otherwise `check_all` is `False`.
   - `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `new_all` is `False`.

2. **Conditions:**
   - If `a[1] > a[2]`, then either `check_all` is `False` or `new_all` is `False`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
   - If `a[1] <= a[2]`, the program continues as expected, maintaining the same conditions and values for the variables.

Given these conditions, let's analyze the scenario:

- If `a[1] > a[2]`, the program will break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and it is stated that either `check_all` is `False` or `new_all` is `False`. This means that the program will not reach the `print('YES')` statement under this condition.
- If `a[1] <= a[2]`, the program continues, and the conditions for `check_all` and `new_all` are maintained. Since the program continues, it will reach the `print('YES')` statement.

Therefore, the `print('YES')` statement will only be executed if `a[1] <= a[2]`.

Output: **YES (if a[1] <= a[2])**
