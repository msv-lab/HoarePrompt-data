Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 3, `a` is a list of integers from user input, `i` is 3, `new` is a list containing elements from index 3 to the end of `a`, `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than the first element of `a`, otherwise `False`, `new_all` is `True` if `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`. If `check_all` and `new_all` are both `True`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
