Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `check_all` is `True` if `a` is strictly increasing, otherwise `False`, `i` is 1. If `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, `new` is the sublist of `a` starting from index 1 to the end, `new_all` is `True` if `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`. If `check_all` is `True` and `new_all` is `True`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If either `check_all` is `False` or `new_all` is `False` or both, we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
