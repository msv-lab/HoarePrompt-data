The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and stores the resulting list in the variable `a`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers from the input.**
