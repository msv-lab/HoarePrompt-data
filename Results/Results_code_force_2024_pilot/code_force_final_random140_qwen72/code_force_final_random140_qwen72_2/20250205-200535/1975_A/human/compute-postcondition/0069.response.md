Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers from the new user input, `i` is 2, `new` is a list containing elements from index 2 to the end of `a`, `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than `a[0]`, otherwise `check_all` is `False`, `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `new_all` is `False`. If `a[1] > a[2]`, then either `check_all` is `False` or `new_all` is `False`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `check_all` and `new_all` are both `True`, the program continues as expected. Otherwise, the program also continues as expected, maintaining the same conditions and values for the variables.**
