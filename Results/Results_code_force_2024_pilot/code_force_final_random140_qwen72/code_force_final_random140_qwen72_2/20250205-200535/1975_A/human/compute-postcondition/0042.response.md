Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers from user input, and `check_all` indicates whether all elements in `a` from index 0 to `n-1` are in strictly increasing order. If `check_all` is `True`, the condition remains unchanged. If `check_all` is `False`, `n` is greater than or equal to the length of `a`, `i` is `n-1`, and if the element at index `i-1` of `a` is greater than the element at index `i` of `a`, `new` is a list containing elements from index `i` to the end of `a`. `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than the first element of `a`, otherwise `False`. `new_all` is `True` if `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`. Regardless of the values of `check_all` and `new_all`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
