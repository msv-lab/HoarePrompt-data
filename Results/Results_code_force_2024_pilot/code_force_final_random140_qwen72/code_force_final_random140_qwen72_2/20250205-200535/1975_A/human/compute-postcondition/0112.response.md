The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` must be greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3, and `n` must still be greater than `i` (which is now 3).

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 3, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is 3, `new` is the sublist of `a` starting from index 3 to the end. The values of `check_all` and `new_all` remain unchanged based on their conditions from the previous iteration.**
