Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 3, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is 3, `new` is the sublist of `a` starting from index 3 to the end, `check_all` is `True` if `a[0]` is greater than every element in `new`, otherwise `check_all` is `False`, `new_all` is `True` if every element in `new` is less than or equal to the next element, otherwise `new_all` is `False`.**
