Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 3, `a` is a list of integers from the new user input, `i` is 3, `new` is a list containing elements from index 3 to the end of `a`. If `a[2] > a[3]`, then either `check_all` is `False` or `new_all` is `False`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[2] <= a[3]`, the program continues as expected, maintaining the same conditions and values for the variables. If `check_all` and `new_all` are both `True`, the program continues as expected. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
