Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers from user input, `check_all` is `False` because not all elements in `a` from index 0 to `n-1` are in strictly increasing order
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
        new = a[i:]
        check_all = all([(a[0] > new[i]) for i in range(len(new))])
        new_all = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])
        if check_all and new_all:
            print('YES')
            break
        else:
            print('NO')
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers from user input, `i` is 1. If the element at index 0 of `a` is greater than the element at index 1 of `a`, `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` (a list containing elements from index 1 to the end of `a`) are less than the first element of `a`, otherwise `False`. `new_all` is `True` if `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`. If `check_all` is `True` and `new_all` is `True`, or if either `check_all` is `False` or `new_all` is `False`, or both, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers from user input, `i` is 2. If the element at index 0 of `a` is greater than the element at index 1 of `a`, `new` is a list containing elements from index 2 to the end of `a`. `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than the first element of `a`, otherwise `False`. `new_all` is `True` if `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`. Regardless of the values of `check_all` and `new_all`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 3, `a` is a list of integers from user input, `i` is 3. If the element at index 2 of `a` is greater than the element at index 3 of `a`, `new` is a list containing elements from index 3 to the end of `a`. `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than the first element of `a`, otherwise `False`. `new_all` is `True` if `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`. Regardless of the values of `check_all` and `new_all`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
