To determine what will be printed by the `print('YES')` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `n` is greater than 2.
   - `a` is a list of integers from the new user input.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `new` is a list containing elements from index 2 to the end of `a`.
   - `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than `a[0]`, otherwise `check_all` is `False`.
   - `new_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `new_all` is `False`.
   - If `a[1] > a[2]`, then either `check_all` is `False` or `new_all` is `False`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

2. **Analysis:**
   - The `print('YES')` statement is unconditional and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state.
   - The conditions provided (like `check_all`, `new_all`, and the relationship between `a[1]` and `a[2]`) do not affect the execution of the `print` statement directly.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - Since the `print('YES')` statement is unconditional and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions, it will always print 'YES' regardless of the values of `a`, `check_all`, `new_all`, or any other variables.

Output: **YES**
