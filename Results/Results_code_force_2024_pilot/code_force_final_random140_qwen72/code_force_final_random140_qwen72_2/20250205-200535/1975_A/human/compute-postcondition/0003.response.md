The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into parts based on spaces, converts each part to an integer, and stores the resulting list in the variable `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` must be greater than 0
- `_` is a placeholder
- `n` is an input integer

After executing the code, the variable `a` will contain a list of integers derived from the user's input.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers from user input.**
