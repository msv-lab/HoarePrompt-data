Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers from user input, `i` is 2, `new` is a list containing elements from index 2 to the end of `a`, `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `new` are less than the first element of `a`, otherwise `False`, `new_all` is `True` if `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
