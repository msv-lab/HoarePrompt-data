Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 0 and is decremented by 1.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of integers from the input.
- `check_all` is `True` if `a` is strictly increasing, otherwise `False`.

The code snippet contains a `print` statement that simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Since the `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state, it will always print the same string regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, or `check_all`.

Output: **YES**
