The code snippet updates the value of `new_all` based on whether the list `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order. It does this by checking if each element in `new` (from the second element onwards) is greater than or equal to the previous element.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `n` is greater than 1
- `a` is a list of integers from the new user input
- `i` is 1
- `new` is a list containing elements from index `i` to the end of `a`
- `check_all` is `False`
- `new_all` is `True` if `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`
- The current value of `a[i - 1]` is greater than the current value of `a[i]`

The code snippet:
```python
new_all = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])
```

Impact of the code:
- The value of `new_all` is updated based on the condition that checks if `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
- The rest of the variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `check_all`) remain unchanged.

Since the current value of `a[i - 1]` is greater than the current value of `a[i]`, and `new` starts from index `i` of `a`, the first element of `new` will be `a[i]`. This means that the first element of `new` is less than the element before it in `a`, which implies that `new` is not sorted in non-decreasing order.

Therefore, `new_all` will be `False`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers from the new user input, `i` is 1, `new` is a list containing elements from index `i` to the end of `a`, `check_all` is `False`, `new_all` is `False`**.
