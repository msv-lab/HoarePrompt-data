Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is 2, `new` is the sublist of `a` starting from index 2 to the end. If `a[i - 1]` (which is `a[1]`) is greater than `a[i]` (which is `a[2]`), `check_all` is `True` if `a[0]` is greater than every element in `new`, otherwise `False`, and `new_all` is `True` if `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`. Regardless of the values of `check_all` and `new_all`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[1]` is not greater than `a[2]`, the values of `check_all` and `new_all` remain unchanged.***
