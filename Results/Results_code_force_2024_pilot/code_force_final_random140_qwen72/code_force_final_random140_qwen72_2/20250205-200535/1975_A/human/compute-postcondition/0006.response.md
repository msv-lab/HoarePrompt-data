Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `_` is a placeholder and does not affect the execution.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of integers from user input.
- `check_all` is `True` if all elements in `a` from index 0 to `n-1` are in strictly increasing order; otherwise, `check_all` is `False`.
- The current value of `check_all` is `True`.

Given that `check_all` is `True`, it means that the elements in the list `a` from index 0 to `n-1` are in strictly increasing order. The print statement simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
