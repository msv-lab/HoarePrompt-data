Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers from the last user input, `check_all` is `True` if `a` is strictly increasing, otherwise `False`. If `check_all` is `False`, `i` is set to `n-1`, and if any `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]` during the loop, `new` is the sublist of `a` starting from that index to the end, and `new_all` is `True` if `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`. The loop will break if `check_all` and `new_all` are both `True` or if either is `False`. If no such condition is met, the loop completes all iterations.**

### Explanation:
- **`t` is 0**: After all iterations of the loop, the value of `t` is decremented to 0 because the loop runs `t` times.
- **`n` is an input integer**: This variable is re-assigned in each iteration of the loop based on user input.
- **`a` is a list of integers from the last user input**: This variable is also re-assigned in each iteration based on user input.
- **`check_all` is `True` if `a` is strictly increasing, otherwise `False`**: This variable is determined based on whether the list `a` is strictly increasing.
- **If `check_all` is `False`, `i` is set to `n-1`**: If the list `a` is not strictly increasing, the loop checks for the first pair of elements where `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`.
- **`new` is the sublist of `a` starting from that index to the end**: If such a pair is found, `new` is assigned the sublist starting from that index.
- **`new_all` is `True` if `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`**: This variable is determined based on whether the sublist `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
- **The loop will break if `check_all` and `new_all` are both `True` or if either is `False`**: The loop breaks as soon as it determines whether the conditions for printing 'YES' or 'NO' are met.
- **If no such condition is met, the loop completes all iterations**: If the conditions are not met, the loop continues until it has completed all iterations.
