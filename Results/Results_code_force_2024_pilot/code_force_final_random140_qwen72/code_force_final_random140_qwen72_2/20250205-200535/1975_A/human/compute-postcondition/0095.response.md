Let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `a` is a list of integers from the input.
   - `check_all` is `True` if `a[0]` is greater than all elements in `new`, otherwise `False`.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`.
   - `new` is the sublist of `a` starting from index 1 to the end.
   - `new_all` is `True` if `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise `False`.
   - Additionally, `check_all` is `True` and `new_all` is `True`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('YES')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement simply prints the string `'YES'`.
   - The conditions and variables described in the initial state do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the statement does not reference any of these variables or conditions directly.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will always print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the variables and conditions described in the initial state.

Output: **YES**
