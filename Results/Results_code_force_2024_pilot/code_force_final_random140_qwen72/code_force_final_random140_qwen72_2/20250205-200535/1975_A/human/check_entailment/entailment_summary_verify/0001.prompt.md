You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Bazoka gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Now Mocha wants to know whether array a could become sorted in non-decreasing
order after performing the following operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  * Split the array into two parts — a prefix and a suffix, then swap these two parts. In other words, let a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y+x . Here + denotes the array concatenation operation. 

For example, if a=[3,1,4,1,5] , we can choose x=[3,1] and y=[4,1,5] ,
satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y + x = [4,1,5,3,1] . We can also
choose x=[3,1,4,1,5] and y=[\,] , satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a := y+x
= [3,1,4,1,5] . Note that we are not allowed to choose x=[3,1,1] and y=[4,5] ,
neither are we allowed to choose x=[1,3] and y=[5,1,4] , as both these choices
do not satisfy a=x+y .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 1000 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 50 )
— the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if a could become non-decreasing after
performing the operation any number of times, and output "No" if not.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive response).

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1 1 4 5 1 4
    
    5
    
    7 9 2 2 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    No
    Yes
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, it can be proven that a cannot become non-decreasing
after performing the operation any number of times.

In the second test case, we can perform the following operations to make a
sorted in non-decreasing order:

  * Split the array into two parts: x=[7] and y=[9,2,2,3] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x = [9,2,2,3,7] . 
  * Split the array into two parts: x=[9] and y=[2,2,3,7] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x=[2,2,3,7,9] , which is non-decreasing.

- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`. For each test case, it checks if the list `a` is strictly increasing. If so, it prints 'YES'. If not, it further checks if there exists a point in the list where, after this point, the remaining elements form a non-decreasing sequence and all elements before this point are greater than all elements after this point. If such a point exists, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function ends.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Check for Sorted Array:**
   - The function starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a`.
   - It first checks if the array `a` is already sorted in non-decreasing order using the `all` function with a list comprehension. If the array is already sorted, it prints 'YES' and moves to the next test case.

2. **Finding the First Out-of-Order Element:**
   - If the array is not already sorted, it iterates through the array to find the first position `i` where `a[i-1] > a[i]`. This indicates the point where the array is no longer in non-decreasing order.

3. **Splitting and Checking the Suffix:**
   - Once the first out-of-order element is found, it splits the array into two parts: `a[:i]` and `a[i:]`.
   - It then checks if the suffix `a[i:]` is sorted in non-decreasing order using another `all` function with a list comprehension.
   - Additionally, it checks if all elements in the suffix `a[i:]` are less than or equal to the first element of the prefix `a[0]`.

4. **Final Decision:**
   - If both conditions are met (the suffix is sorted and all elements in the suffix are less than or equal to the first element of the prefix), it prints 'YES'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

### Issues and Corrections:
- **Logical Error in Suffix Check:**
  - The condition `check_all = all([a[0] > new[i] for i in range(len(new))])` should be `check_all = all([a[0] <= new[0]])` because we need to ensure that the first element of the suffix is greater than or equal to the last element of the prefix.
  - The condition `new_all = all([new[i - 1] <= new[i] for i in range(1, len(new))])` is correct for checking if the suffix is sorted.

- **Breaking the Loop:**
  - The loop breaks immediately after finding the first out-of-order element and making the decision. This is correct because once we find the first out-of-order element, we can make the decision based on the conditions.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        check_all = all(a[i - 1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n))
        if check_all:
            print('YES')
        else:
            for i in range(1, n):
                if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
                    new = a[i:]
                    check_all = a[0] <= new[0]
                    new_all = all(new[i - 1] <= new[i] for i in range(1, len(new)))
                    if check_all and new_all:
                        print('YES')
                    else:
                        print('NO')
                    break
```
