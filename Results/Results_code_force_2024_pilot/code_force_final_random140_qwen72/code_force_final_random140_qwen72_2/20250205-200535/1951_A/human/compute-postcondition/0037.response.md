Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `results` is a list containing two additional elements, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a new input string, and `count_ones` is the number of '1's in the new `arr`. If `count_ones` == 0, the new element in `results` is 'yes'. Otherwise, if `count_ones` % 2 != 0 or `count_ones` == 2 and '11' is in `arr`, the new element in `results` is 'no'. If `count_ones` is 2 and '11' is not in `arr`, or `count_ones` is not 2, the new element in `results` is 'yes'.**
