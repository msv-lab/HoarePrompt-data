Postcondition: ***`start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `results` is a list containing one additional element ('no' if '11' is in `arr`, otherwise 'yes'), `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a new input string, and `count_ones` is the number of '1's in the new `arr`.***
