Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `results` is a list containing three elements, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a new input string, `count_ones` is the number of '1's in the new `arr`.**

Explanation:
- The code `results.append('no')` adds the string `'no'` to the end of the list `results`.
- The list `results` initially contained two elements, and now it contains three elements.
- All other variables (`start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `arr`, `count_ones`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
