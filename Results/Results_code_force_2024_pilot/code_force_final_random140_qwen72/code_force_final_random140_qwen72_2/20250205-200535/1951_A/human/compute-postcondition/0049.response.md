Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`, `t` is 0, `results` is a list containing `t` elements, each element is either 'yes' or 'no' based on the conditions evaluated during each iteration of the loop.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The variables `start` and `end` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- The variable `t` is decremented by 1 with each iteration of the loop. After all iterations, `t` will be 0.
- The list `results` will contain `t` elements, where each element is determined by the conditions checked within the loop:
  - If the number of '1's (`count_ones`) in the input string `arr` is 0, the element is 'yes'.
  - If `count_ones` is odd, the element is 'no'.
  - If `count_ones` is 2 and the substring '11' is present in `arr`, the element is 'no'.
  - If `count_ones` is 2 and the substring '11' is not present in `arr`, or if `count_ones` is any other even number, the element is 'yes'.
- The final state of `results` will reflect the outcomes of all iterations of the loop.
