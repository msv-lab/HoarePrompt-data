Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `results` is a list, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is an input string, and `count_ones` is the number of '1's in `arr`. If `count_ones` is 0, `results` contains the string 'yes'. If `count_ones` is greater than 0 and odd, `results` contains the string 'no'. If `count_ones` is even and greater than 0, `results` contains 'no' if the substring '11' is present in `arr`, or 'yes' if the substring '11' is not present in `arr`.**

Explanation:
- The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `n`.
- All other variables (`start`, `end`, `t`, `results`, `arr`, and `count_ones`) remain unchanged.
- The conditions and values associated with these variables remain the same as in the initial state.
