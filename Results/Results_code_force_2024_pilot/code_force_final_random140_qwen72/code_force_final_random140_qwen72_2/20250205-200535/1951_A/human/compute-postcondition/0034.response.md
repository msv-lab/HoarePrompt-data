Postcondition: ***`start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `results` is a list containing one additional element, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a new input string, and `count_ones` is the number of '1's in the new `arr`. If `count_ones` % 2 != 0, the new element in `results` is 'no'. Otherwise, if `count_ones` == 2, the new element in `results` is 'no' if '11' is in `arr`, otherwise 'yes'. If `count_ones` is not 2, the new element in `results` is 'yes'.***
