The only objects in the loop head are the variable `r` and the list `results`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `results`. If there are more elements in `results`, the loop will continue to the next element.

At the end of the last iteration, `results` is a list containing at least 2 elements, each element is either 'yes' or 'no', and `r` is the second element in the list. For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must have at least 3 elements, and `r` will be the third element in the list.

State: **`start` and `end` are integers where `start` <= `end`, `t` is 0, `results` is a list containing at least 3 elements, each element is either 'yes' or 'no', `r` is the third element in the list**
