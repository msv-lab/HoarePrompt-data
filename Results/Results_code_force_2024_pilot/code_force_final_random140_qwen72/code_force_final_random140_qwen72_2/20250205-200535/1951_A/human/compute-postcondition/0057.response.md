The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the given parameter constraints, it can be inferred that the function accepts two parameters, `start` and `end`, which are integers where `start <= end`. These parameters represent the range of folder names to be processed. The function's output is not specified, so it is assumed that the function processes the folders within the given range but does not return any specific value.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `start` and `end`, which are integers where `start <= end`. It processes the folders within the range defined by `start` and `end`.**
