The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by parameters `n`, `k`, `q`, `a`, and `b`. For each test case, it calculates and prints the travel time for each of the `q` queries. The travel times are determined based on the positions and arrival times specified in the lists `a` and `b`. The function reads input values from standard input and prints the results to standard output. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value. The state of the program remains unchanged except for the printed output.
