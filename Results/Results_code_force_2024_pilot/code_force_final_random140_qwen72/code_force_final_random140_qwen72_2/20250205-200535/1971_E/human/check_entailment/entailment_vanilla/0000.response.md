### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The function `func` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `q` which represent the final destination, the number of known points, and the number of queries, respectively.
   - It then reads the lists `a` and `b` which contain the positions and times of the known points, respectively.
   - It initializes `ad` and `bd` to store the differences in positions and times between consecutive known points.
   - It calculates the speeds `v` between consecutive known points.

2. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, it reads the distance `ql` and uses `bisect_left` to find the index `s` where `ql` would fit in the list `a`.
   - If `a[s]` equals `ql`, it prints the corresponding time `b[s]` and continues to the next query.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the remaining distance `ql` after subtracting the position of the previous known point `a[s-1]`.
   - It adds the time taken to reach the previous known point `b[s-1]` to `m`.
   - It then calculates the additional time required to travel the remaining distance `ql` using the speed `bd[s] / ad[s]` and adds this to `m`.
   - Finally, it prints the total time `m`.

### Analysis:
- The use of `bisect_left` ensures that the correct segment of the journey is identified efficiently.
- The calculation of the remaining distance and the additional time is done correctly using the speed between the known points.
- The rounding down to the nearest integer is achieved by using integer division `//`.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly handle the problem as described, including the constraints and the need to round down the results. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
