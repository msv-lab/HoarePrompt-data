Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `q` as well as the lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Preprocessing**:
   - The program prepends a 0 to both `a` and `b` to handle the starting point (0, 0).
   - It calculates the differences `ad` and `bd` between consecutive elements in `a` and `b`, respectively. This step is necessary to determine the speed of the car between each pair of signs.
   - It calculates the speeds `v` between each pair of signs using the formula `ad[i] / bd[i]`.

3. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query `ql`, the program uses `bisect_left` to find the index `s` where `ql` would fit in the list `a`.
   - If `a[s]` is exactly equal to `ql`, it directly prints the corresponding time `b[s]`.
   - Otherwise, it adjusts `ql` to be relative to the previous sign `a[s - 1]` and calculates the time `m` by adding the time taken to reach the previous sign `b[s - 1]` and the time taken to travel the remaining distance at the speed `v[s]`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the calculated time for each query, ensuring the result is rounded down to the nearest integer.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as `ql` being exactly at a known point or between known points correctly.
   - The use of `bisect_left` ensures efficient handling of the queries.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
