### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The function `func` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `q` which represent the final destination, the number of known points, and the number of queries, respectively.
   - It reads the lists `a` and `b` which contain the positions and times of the known points, respectively.
   - It initializes `ad` and `bd` to store the differences in positions and times between consecutive known points.
   - It calculates the speeds `v` between consecutive known points.

2. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, it reads the distance `ql` and uses `bisect_left` to find the index `s` where `ql` would fit in the list `a`.
   - If `a[s]` equals `ql`, it prints the corresponding time `b[s]` and continues to the next query.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the remaining distance `ql` after subtracting the position of the previous known point `a[s-1]`.
   - It adds the time taken to reach the previous known point `b[s-1]` to `m`.
   - It then calculates the additional time required to travel the remaining distance `ql` using the speed `bd[s] / ad[s]` and adds this to `m`.
   - Finally, it prints the total time `m`.

### Analysis:
- **Use of `bisect_left`:** The use of `bisect_left` is appropriate for finding the correct segment of the journey efficiently. This ensures that the correct segment is identified in logarithmic time.
- **Calculation of Remaining Distance and Time:**
  - The remaining distance `ql` is calculated correctly by subtracting the position of the previous known point `a[s-1]`.
  - The additional time required to travel the remaining distance is calculated using the speed `bd[s] / ad[s]` and added to the time taken to reach the previous known point `b[s-1]`.
  - The rounding down to the nearest integer is achieved by using integer division `//`.

### Potential Issues:
- **Edge Cases:** The function handles edge cases such as when `ql` is exactly at a known point or when `ql` is at the start or end of the journey.
- **Speed Calculation:** The speed `v` is not used in the final calculation, but the calculation of additional time using `bd[s] * ql // ad[s]` is correct and equivalent to using the speed.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the problem as described, including the constraints and the need to round down the results. The logic and calculations are sound, and the use of `bisect_left` ensures efficient segment identification. Therefore, the program is correct.

Final: **True**
