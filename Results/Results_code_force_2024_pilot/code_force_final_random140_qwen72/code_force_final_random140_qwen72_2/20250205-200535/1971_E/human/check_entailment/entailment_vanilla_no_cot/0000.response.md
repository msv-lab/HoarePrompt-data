Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. It uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the segment in which the query point lies, calculates the time taken to reach that point within the segment, and prints the result rounded down to the nearest integer. The program handles multiple test cases and queries as specified in the problem statement. The logic for calculating the time based on the speed between known points and handling the edge cases (like when the query point exactly matches a known point) seems to be implemented correctly.
