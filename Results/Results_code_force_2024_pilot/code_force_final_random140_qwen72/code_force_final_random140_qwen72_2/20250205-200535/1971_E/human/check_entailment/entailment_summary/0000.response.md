Reasoning:  
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It reads the number of test cases and processes each one individually. For each test case, it initializes the necessary arrays and calculates the differences in positions (`ad`) and times (`bd`) between consecutive signs. It also calculates the speeds (`v`) between these signs, although the speed calculation seems unnecessary for the solution since the travel time is directly calculated using the differences in positions and times.

The program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the appropriate segment for each query. If the query point matches a sign position exactly, it directly prints the corresponding time. Otherwise, it calculates the travel time by adding the time taken to reach the previous sign and the additional time to reach the query point within the current segment.

The only potential issue I noticed is in the calculation of the additional time for the query point within the current segment:
```python
m += bd[s] * ql // ad[s]
```
This line should correctly calculate the additional time, but it's important to ensure that the division and floor operation are handled correctly. Given the problem constraints and the need to round down, this line seems to be implemented correctly.

Overall, the program follows the logic required by the problem statement and handles edge cases appropriately. Therefore, based on the provided problem description and the execution summary, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
