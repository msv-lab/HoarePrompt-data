Precondition: **t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n, k, and q are integers where k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k, q ≤ 10^5, representing the final destination, the number of known time points, and the number of queries, respectively. a is a list of k integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, a_i < a_{i+1}, a_k = n), representing the positions of the signs. b is a list of k integers (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, b_i < b_{i+1}), representing the times when the car arrives at the corresponding positions in a. Each of the q queries is an integer d (0 ≤ d ≤ n), representing the distance for which Timur wants to know the travel time. The sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.**
