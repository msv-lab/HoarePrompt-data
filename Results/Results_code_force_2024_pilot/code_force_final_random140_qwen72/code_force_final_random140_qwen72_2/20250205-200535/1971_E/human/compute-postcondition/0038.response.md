Output State: **`a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the input integers and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `ad` is a list containing the differences between each consecutive pair of elements in `a`, `b` is a list with at least 2 elements, `bd` is a list containing the differences between each consecutive pair of elements in `b`, `v` is a list containing 0 followed by the results of dividing each element in `ad[1:]` by the corresponding element in `bd`, `l` is 0, `q` is greater than 0, `m` is 0, `ql` is updated to `ql - a[s - 1]`, `s` is the index where `ql` would fit in the list `a` to maintain the order. If `a[s]` is equal to `ql`, the program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration.**
