Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the input integers, `i` is `len(b)`, `ad` is a list containing the differences between each consecutive pair of elements in `a`, `b` is a list with at least 2 elements, `bd` is a list containing the differences between each consecutive pair of elements in `b`, `v` is a list containing only the integer 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(a)):
    v.append(ad[i] / bd[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the input integers and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is `len(b)`, `ad` is a list containing the differences between each consecutive pair of elements in `a`, `b` is a list with at least 2 elements, `bd` is a list containing the differences between each consecutive pair of elements in `b`, `v` is a list containing 0 and the value of `ad[i] / bd[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the input integers and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is `len(b) + 1`, `ad` is a list containing the differences between each consecutive pair of elements in `a`, `b` is a list with at least 2 elements, `bd` is a list containing the differences between each consecutive pair of elements in `b`, `v` is a list containing 0, the value of `ad[i] / bd[i]`, and the new value of `ad[i] / bd[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the input integers and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is `len(b) + 2`, `ad` is a list containing the differences between each consecutive pair of elements in `a`, `b` is a list with at least 2 elements, `bd` is a list containing the differences between each consecutive pair of elements in `b`, `v` is a list containing 0, the value of `ad[i] / bd[i]`, the new value of `ad[i] / bd[i]`, and the latest value of `ad[i] / bd[i]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
