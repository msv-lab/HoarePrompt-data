Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, representing the number of test cases. n, k, q are integers where k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k, q ≤ 10^5. a is a list of k integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, a_i < a_{i+1}, a_k = n). b is a list of k integers (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, b_i < b_{i+1}). Each of the q queries is an integer d (0 ≤ d ≤ n). The sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    ad = [0]
    bd = [0]
    for i in range(1, len(a)):
        ad.append(a[i] - a[i - 1])
    for i in range(1, len(b)):
        bd.append(b[i] - b[i - 1])
    v = [0]
    for i in range(1, len(a)):
        v.append(ad[i] / bd[i])
    for l in range(q):
        m = 0
        i = 1
        ql = int(input())
        s = bisect_left(a, ql)
        if a[s] == ql:
            print(b[s], end=' ')
            continue
        ql -= a[s - 1]
        m += b[s - 1]
        m += bd[s] * ql // ad[s]
        print(m, end=' ')
    print()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After all iterations of the loop, `l` will be equal to `q - 1`, `m` will be updated to `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) // ad[s]` for each iteration, `ql` will be updated to `ql - a[s - 1]` for each iteration, and `s` will be the index where `ql` would fit in the list `a` to maintain the order for each iteration. The variables `a`, `i`, `ad`, `b`, `bd`, and `v` will retain their initial values as they are not modified within the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the loop executes all iterations, `l` will be equal to `q`, `m` will have been updated in each iteration based on the calculations involving `b`, `a`, `ad`, and `bd`, and `ql` will have been adjusted in each iteration to `ql - a[s - 1]` if `a[s]` does not equal `ql`. The index `s` will be the position where the current `ql` fits in the list `a` to maintain the order. The variable `i` will still be 1, and the lists `a`, `b`, `ad`, and `bd` will remain unchanged from their initial states.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After all iterations of the loop, `l` is equal to `q - 1`, `m` has been updated to `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql // ad[s]` for each iteration where `a[s] != ql`, and `ql` has been updated to `input integer - a[s - 1]` for each iteration. The values of `a`, `ad`, `b`, `bd`, and `v` remain unchanged as they were initialized or modified before the loop started. The variable `s` holds the index of the first element in `a` that is not less than the most recent `ql` for each iteration.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
