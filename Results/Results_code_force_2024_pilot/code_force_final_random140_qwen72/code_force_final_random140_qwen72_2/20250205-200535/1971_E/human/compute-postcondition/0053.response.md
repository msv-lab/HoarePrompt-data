To determine what will be printed by the `print(m, end=' ')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

### Initial State:
- `i` is 1.
- `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the input integers and must have at least 2 elements.
- `ad` is a list containing the differences between each consecutive pair of elements in `a`.
- `b` is a list with at least 2 elements.
- `bd` is a list containing the differences between each consecutive pair of elements in `b`.
- `v` is a list containing 0 followed by the results of dividing each element in `ad[1:]` by the corresponding element in `bd`.
- `l` is 1.
- `q` is greater than 1.
- `m` is updated to `b[s - 1] + (bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) // ad[s])`.
- `ql` is `ql - a[s - 1]`.
- `s` is the index where `ql` would fit in the list `a` to maintain the order. If `a[s]` is equal to `ql`, the program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration. Otherwise, the program continues with the current iteration.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `s`**:
   - `s` is the index where `ql` would fit in the list `a` to maintain the order.
   - If `a[s]` is equal to `ql`, the program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration.
   - Otherwise, the program continues with the current iteration.

2. **Update `ql`**:
   - `ql` is updated to `ql - a[s - 1]`.

3. **Calculate `m`**:
   - `m` is updated to `b[s - 1] + (bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) // ad[s])`.

4. **Print `m`**:
   - The `print(m, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `m` followed by a space.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume the following values for simplicity:
- `a = [0, 1, 3, 5]`
- `b = [0, 2, 4, 6]`
- `ql = 4`
- `q = 2`

1. **Determine `s`**:
   - `s` is the index where `4` would fit in the list `[0, 1, 3, 5]`.
   - `s = 3` (since `a[3] = 5` and `a[2] = 3`).

2. **Update `ql`**:
   - `ql = 4 - a[2] = 4 - 3 = 1`.

3. **Calculate `m`**:
   - `m = b[2] + (bd[3] * (1 - a[2]) // ad[3])`
   - `bd = [2, 2, 2]` (differences between consecutive elements in `b`)
   - `ad = [1, 2, 2]` (differences between consecutive elements in `a`)
   - `m = 4 + (2 * (1 - 3) // 2)`
   - `m = 4 + (2 * (-2) // 2)`
   - `m = 4 + (-4 // 2)`
   - `m = 4 + (-2)`
   - `m = 2`

### Final Output:
The `print(m, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `m` followed by a space.
Output: **2**
