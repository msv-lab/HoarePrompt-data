Output State: **`m` is 0, `ql` is an input integer, `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to `ql`, `i` is 1, if `a[s]` equals `ql`, then `ql` is updated to `ql - a[s - 1]`, `m` is increased by `b[s - 1]` and then further increased by `bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) // ad[s]`, `l` is `l + 1`, and `l` must be less than `q` for the loop to execute again.**
