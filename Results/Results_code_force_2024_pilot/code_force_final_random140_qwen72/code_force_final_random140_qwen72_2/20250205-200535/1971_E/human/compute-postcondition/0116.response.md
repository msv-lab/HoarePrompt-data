Postcondition: ***`m` is 0, `ql` is an input integer, `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to `ql`, `i` is 1. If `a[s]` equals `ql`, then `ql` is updated to `ql - a[s - 1]`, `m` is increased by `b[s - 1]` and then further increased by `bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) // ad[s]`, and `l` is incremented by 1. The loop continues to execute if `l` is less than `q`.***
