To determine what will be printed by the `print(b[s], end=' ')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relationships between the variables:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers entered by the user.
   - `len(a)` must be greater than 1.
   - `ad` is a list that includes the differences between consecutive elements of `a` from the second element to the last element.
   - `b` must have at least `len(a)` elements.
   - `bd` now includes the differences between consecutive elements of `b` from the second element to the last element.
   - `v` is a list containing the integer 0 followed by the results of dividing each element in `ad` (from index 1 to `len(a)-1`) by the corresponding element in `bd`.
   - `l` is 1.
   - `q` must be greater than 1.
   - `m` is 0.
   - `ql` is an input integer.
   - `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not less than `ql`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `a` is a list where the first element is 0, and the rest are user-provided integers.
   - `ad` is a list of differences between consecutive elements of `a` starting from the second element.
   - `b` is a list with at least as many elements as `a`.
   - `bd` is a list of differences between consecutive elements of `b` starting from the second element.
   - `v` is a list where the first element is 0, and the subsequent elements are the results of dividing elements of `ad` by the corresponding elements of `bd`.
   - `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not less than `ql`.

3. **Determine the Value of `s`:**
   - `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not less than `ql`. This means `a[s] >= ql` and `a[s-1] < ql` (if `s > 0`).

4. **Determine the Value of `b[s]`:**
   - `b[s]` is the element in the list `b` at the index `s`.

5. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print(b[s], end=' ')` statement will print the value of `b[s]` followed by a space.

Given the initial state and the relationships between the variables, the output will be the value of `b[s]` followed by a space.

Output: **b[s] (where b[s] is the element in the list b at the index s, and s is the index of the first element in a that is not less than ql)**
