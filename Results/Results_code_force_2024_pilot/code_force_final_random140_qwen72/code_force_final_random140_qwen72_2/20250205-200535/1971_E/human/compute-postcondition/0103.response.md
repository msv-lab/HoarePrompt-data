Output State: **All initial conditions remain unchanged, and the program continues executing from the next line of code.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by this statement, all the initial conditions and variable values remain the same. The program simply moves on to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement outside the loop, depending on the context.
