Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each defined by the parameters `n`, `k`, `q`, `a`, and `b`. For each test case, `n` represents the final destination, `k` represents the number of known time points, and `q` represents the number of queries. `a` is a list of `k` integers indicating the positions of the signs, and `b` is a list of `k` integers indicating the times when the car arrives at the corresponding positions in `a`. Each of the `q` queries is an integer `d` representing the distance for which Timur wants to know the travel time. The function returns the travel time for each query `d` in the form of a list of integers.**
