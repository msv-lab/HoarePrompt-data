The code snippet appends the difference between the current element and the previous element of list `b` to the list `bd`. This operation only affects the list `bd` by adding a new element to it.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers entered by the user.
- `i` is `len(a) - 1`.
- `ad` is a list that now includes the differences between consecutive elements of `a` from the second element to the last element.
- `b` must have at least 2 elements.

The code `bd.append(b[i] - b[i - 1])` adds the difference between `b[i]` and `b[i - 1]` to the list `bd`.

Output State: **`a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers entered by the user, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `ad` is a list that now includes the differences between consecutive elements of `a` from the second element to the last element, `b` must have at least 2 elements, `bd` now includes the differences between consecutive elements of `b` up to the last element.**
