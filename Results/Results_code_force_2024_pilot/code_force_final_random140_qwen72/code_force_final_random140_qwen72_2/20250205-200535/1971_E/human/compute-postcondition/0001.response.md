The only variable in the loop head is `_`, and the loop's execution depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `q`, `a`, `b`, and the queries) are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to ensure the loop runs.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
