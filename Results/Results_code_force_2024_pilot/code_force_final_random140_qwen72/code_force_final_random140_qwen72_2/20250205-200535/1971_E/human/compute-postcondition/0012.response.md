Output State: **`a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the input integers, `i` is 3, `ad` is a list containing the differences between the first input integer and 0, the second input integer and the first input integer, and the third input integer and the second input integer, `len(a)` is greater than 3.**

Explanation: The code appends the difference between the element at index 3 (`a[3]`) and the element at index 2 (`a[2]`) to the list `ad`. Since `i` is 3, `a[i]` refers to the third input integer, and `a[i-1]` refers to the second input integer. This difference is added to the list `ad`, which already contains the differences between the first input integer and 0, and the second input integer and the first input integer. The other variables remain unchanged.
