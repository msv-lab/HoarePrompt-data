Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `q` must be greater than 0, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers input by the user and must have at least `len(b)` elements, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers input by the user and must have at least `len(b) + 1` elements, `i` is 1, `ad` is a list where each element is the difference between consecutive elements of `a` (starting with 0), `bd` is now `[0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[len(b)-1] - b[len(b)-2]]`, `v` is now `[0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[len(a)-1] / bd[len(a)-1]]`, `l` is 0, `m` is 0.**
