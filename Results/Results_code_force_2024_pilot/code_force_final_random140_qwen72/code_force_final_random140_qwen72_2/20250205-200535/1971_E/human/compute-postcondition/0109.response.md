The only variable in the loop head is `l`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `l` and the range defined by `q`. If `l` is less than `q`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `l` was incremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `l` must be less than `q`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `l` was incremented by 1. Therefore, for the next iteration, `l` is now `l + 1`.

State: **If `a[s]` equals `ql`, then `ql` is updated to `ql - a[s - 1]`. `m` is increased by `b[s - 1]` and then further increased by `bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) // ad[s]`. `l` is `l + 1`, and `l` must be less than `q` for the loop to execute again.**
