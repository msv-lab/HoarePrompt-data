Output State: **`a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the input integers and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `ad` is a list containing the differences between each consecutive pair of elements in `a`, `b` is a list with at least 2 elements, `bd` is a list containing the differences between each consecutive pair of elements in `b`, `v` is a list containing 0 followed by the results of dividing each element in `ad[1:]` by the corresponding element in `bd`, `l` is 0, `q` must be greater than 0, `m` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The variable `i` was originally set to `len(b) + len(a) - 1`, but the code snippet sets `i` to 1.
- All other variables (`a`, `ad`, `b`, `bd`, `v`, `l`, `q`, `m`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
