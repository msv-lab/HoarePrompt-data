The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of the list `a`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `a`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 3. Additionally, for the loop condition to still hold true, the length of `a` must be greater than 3.

State: **`a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the input integers, `i` is 3, `ad` is a list containing the differences between the first input integer and 0, and the second input integer and the first input integer, `len(a)` must be greater than 3**
