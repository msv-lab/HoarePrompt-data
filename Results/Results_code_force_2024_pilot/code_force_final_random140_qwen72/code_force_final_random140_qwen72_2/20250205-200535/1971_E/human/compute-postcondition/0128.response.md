Postcondition: ***`m` is 0, `ql` is the new input integer, `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the new `ql`, `i` is 1, `l` is `l + 1` and `l` must be less than `q`. If `a[s]` equals `ql`, the program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration.***
