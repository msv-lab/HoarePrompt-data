The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. This means that no changes are made to the variables within this specific code snippet, but the loop will proceed to the next iteration if the condition (`l < q`) is still met.

Output State: **`m` is 0, `ql` is an input integer, `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to `ql`, `i` is 1, if `a[s]` equals `ql`, then `ql` is updated to `ql - a[s - 1]`, `m` is increased by `b[s - 1]` and then further increased by `bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) // ad[s]`, `l` is `l + 1`, and `l` must be less than `q` for the loop to execute again.**
