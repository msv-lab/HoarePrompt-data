To determine what will be printed by the `print(m, end=' ')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the calculation of `m` step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `m` is calculated as `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) // ad[s]`.
   - `ql` is updated to `ql - a[s - 1]`.
   - `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the original `ql`.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `l` remains unchanged.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `a`, `b`, `bd`, and `ad` are lists.
   - `ql` is an integer.
   - `s` is an index into the list `a`.

3. **Calculation of `m`:**
   - `s` is determined as the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the original `ql`.
   - `ql` is then updated to `ql - a[s - 1]`.
   - `m` is calculated using the formula: `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) // ad[s]`.

4. **Step-by-Step Calculation:**
   - Identify `s` as the index where `a[s] >= original ql`.
   - Update `ql` to `ql - a[s - 1]`.
   - Calculate `m` using the updated `ql` and the formula provided.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The `print(m, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `m` followed by a space.

Since the exact values of the lists `a`, `b`, `bd`, `ad`, and the integer `ql` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **m (where m is calculated as b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) // ad[s], with s being the index of the first element in a that is greater than or equal to the original ql, and ql is updated to ql - a[s - 1])**
