Output State: **`i` is 1, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the input integers and must have at least 2 elements, `ad` is a list containing the differences between each consecutive pair of elements in `a`, `b` is a list with at least 2 elements, `bd` is a list containing the differences between each consecutive pair of elements in `b`, `v` is a list containing 0 followed by the results of dividing each element in `ad[1:]` by the corresponding element in `bd`, `l` is 2, `q` is greater than 1, `m` is 0, `ql` is an input integer, `s` is the index where `ql` would fit in the list `a` to maintain the order.**

Explanation:
- The `bisect_left` function from the `bisect` module is used to find the position `s` where `ql` should be inserted in the list `a` to keep it sorted.
- The value of `s` is determined based on the sorted order of the list `a`.
- All other variables (`i`, `a`, `ad`, `b`, `bd`, `v`, `l`, `q`, `m`, `ql`) remain unchanged.
- The condition about skipping the rest of the current iteration if `a[s]` is equal to `ql` is not part of the output state since it describes a potential future behavior, not the immediate state after executing the given line of code.
