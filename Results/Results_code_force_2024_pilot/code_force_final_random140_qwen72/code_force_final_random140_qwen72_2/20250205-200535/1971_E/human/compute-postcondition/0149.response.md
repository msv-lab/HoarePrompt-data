To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop head.

### Given Information:
- `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers entered by the user.
- `i` is `len(a) - 1`.
- `ad` is a list that now includes the differences between consecutive elements of `a` from the second element to the last element.
- The loop head is: `for i in range(1, len(b))`.

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and the length of the list `b`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if `len(b)` is greater than 1, because the range function `range(1, len(b))` will generate a sequence of numbers from 1 to `len(b) - 1`. If `len(b)` is less than or equal to 1, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`i`**: The value of `i` is not directly relevant to the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted.
- **`b`**: For the loop to execute, `b` must have at least 2 elements. Therefore, `len(b)` must be greater than 1.

### Final State:
The state before the loop starts should ensure that `b` has at least 2 elements. The other variables (`a` and `ad`) are not directly involved in the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers entered by the user, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `ad` is a list that now includes the differences between consecutive elements of `a` from the second element to the last element, `b` must have at least 2 elements**.
