Output State: **`a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers entered by the user, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `ad` is a list that now includes the differences between consecutive elements of `a` from the second element to the last element, `b` must have at least `len(a)` elements, `bd` now includes the differences between consecutive elements of `b` from the second element to the last element.**

Explanation:
- The variable `a` remains unchanged as it was initially defined.
- The variable `i` starts at `len(a) - 1` and does not change within the loop.
- The variable `ad` remains unchanged as it was initially defined.
- The variable `b` must have at least `len(a)` elements for the loop to complete all iterations without errors.
- The variable `bd` is updated to include the differences between consecutive elements of `b` from the second element to the last element, which means it will have `len(b) - 1` elements after the loop completes.
