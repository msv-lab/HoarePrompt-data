Output State: **`m` is updated to `m + bd[s] * (ql // ad[s])`, `ql` is `ql - a[s - 1]`, `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the new `ql`, `i` is 1, `l` is `l + 1` and `l` must be less than `q`. If `a[s]` equals `ql`, the program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration.**

Explanation:
- The value of `m` is updated by adding `bd[s] * (ql // ad[s])` to its current value.
- The value of `ql` remains `ql - a[s - 1]`.
- The value of `s` remains the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the new `ql`.
- The value of `i` remains 1.
- The value of `l` is incremented by 1, and it must still be less than `q`.
- If `a[s]` equals `ql`, the program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration.
