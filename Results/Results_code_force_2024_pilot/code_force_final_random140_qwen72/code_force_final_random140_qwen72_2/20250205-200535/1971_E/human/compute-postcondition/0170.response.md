To determine what will be printed by the `print(b[s], end=' ')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant parts of the code:

### Initial State:
- `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers entered by the user.
- `len(a)` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `ad` is a list that includes the differences between consecutive elements of `a` from the second element to the last element.
- `b` must have at least `len(a)` elements.
- `bd` now includes the differences between consecutive elements of `b` from the second element to the last element.
- `v` is a list containing the integer 0 followed by the results of dividing each element in `ad` (from index 1 to `len(a)-1`) by the corresponding element in `bd`.
- `l` is 0.
- `q` must be greater than 0.
- `m` is 0.
- `ql` is an input integer.
- `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not less than `ql`, and the element at index `s` in `a` is equal to `ql`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **List `a`**: This list starts with 0 and is followed by user-entered integers. For example, if the user enters 1, 3, 5, then `a` would be `[0, 1, 3, 5]`.

2. **List `ad`**: This list contains the differences between consecutive elements of `a` starting from the second element. For the example `a = [0, 1, 3, 5]`, `ad` would be `[1, 2, 2]`.

3. **List `b`**: This list must have at least as many elements as `a`. The specific values of `b` are not provided, but it must have at least the same length as `a`.

4. **List `bd`**: This list contains the differences between consecutive elements of `b` starting from the second element. For example, if `b = [10, 20, 30, 40]`, then `bd` would be `[10, 10, 10]`.

5. **List `v`**: This list contains the integer 0 followed by the results of dividing each element in `ad` by the corresponding element in `bd`. For the example `ad = [1, 2, 2]` and `bd = [10, 10, 10]`, `v` would be `[0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.2]`.

6. **Variable `ql`**: This is an input integer.

7. **Variable `s`**: This is the index of the first element in `a` that is not less than `ql`. For example, if `ql = 3` and `a = [0, 1, 3, 5]`, then `s` would be 2 because `a[2] = 3`.

8. **Print Statement**: The statement `print(b[s], end=' ')` will print the element at index `s` in the list `b`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume:
- `a = [0, 1, 3, 5]`
- `b = [10, 20, 30, 40]`
- `ql = 3`

Then:
- `s` is 2 because `a[2] = 3` is the first element in `a` that is not less than `ql = 3`.
- The element at index `s` in `b` is `b[2] = 30`.

Therefore, the `print(b[s], end=' ')` statement will print `30`.

### Final Output:
Output: **30** (where 30 is the element at index `s` in the list `b`, and `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not less than `ql`).
