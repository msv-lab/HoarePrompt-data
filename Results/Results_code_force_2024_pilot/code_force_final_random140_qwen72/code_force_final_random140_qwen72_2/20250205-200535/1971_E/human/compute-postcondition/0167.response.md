Output State: **`a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers entered by the user, `len(a)` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `ad` is a list that now includes the differences between consecutive elements of `a` from the second element to the last element, `b` must have at least `len(a)` elements, `bd` now includes the differences between consecutive elements of `b` from the second element to the last element, `v` is a list containing the integer 0 followed by the results of dividing each element in `ad` (from index 1 to `len(a)-1`) by the corresponding element in `bd`, `l` is 0, `q` must be greater than 0, `m` is 0, `ql` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ql = int(input())` assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `ql`. This means `ql` is now an integer input by the user. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
