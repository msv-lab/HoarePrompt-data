To determine what will be printed by the `print(m, end=' ')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the steps involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers entered by the user.
   - `len(a)` must be greater than 1.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `ad` is a list that includes the differences between consecutive elements of `a` from the second element to the last element.
   - `b` must have at least `len(a)` elements.
   - `bd` now includes the differences between consecutive elements of `b` from the second element to the last element.
   - `v` is a list containing the integer 0 followed by the results of dividing each element in `ad` (from index 1 to `len(a)-1`) by the corresponding element in `bd`.
   - `l` is 0.
   - `q` must be greater than 0.
   - `m` is calculated as `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql // ad[s]`.
   - `ql` is an input integer minus `a[s-1]`.
   - `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not less than the original `ql`.

2. **Step-by-Step Calculation:**
   - `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by user inputs. For example, if the user inputs are `[1, 3, 5]`, then `a = [0, 1, 3, 5]`.
   - `ad` is the list of differences between consecutive elements of `a` starting from the second element. For `a = [0, 1, 3, 5]`, `ad = [1, 2, 2]`.
   - `b` is another list with at least as many elements as `a`. For example, `b = [10, 20, 30, 40]`.
   - `bd` is the list of differences between consecutive elements of `b` starting from the second element. For `b = [10, 20, 30, 40]`, `bd = [10, 10, 10]`.
   - `v` is a list containing 0 followed by the results of dividing each element in `ad` by the corresponding element in `bd`. For `ad = [1, 2, 2]` and `bd = [10, 10, 10]`, `v = [0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.2]`.
   - `ql` is an input integer minus `a[s-1]`. Suppose the input integer is 4 and `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not less than 4, which is 3 (since `a[3] = 5`). Therefore, `ql = 4 - a[2] = 4 - 3 = 1`.
   - `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not less than the original `ql`. In this case, `s = 3`.
   - `m` is calculated as `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql // ad[s]`. Substituting the values, `m = b[2] + bd[3] * 1 // ad[3] = 30 + 10 * 1 // 2 = 30 + 5 = 35`.

3. **Final Output:**
   - The `print(m, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `m` followed by a space.

Output: **35**
