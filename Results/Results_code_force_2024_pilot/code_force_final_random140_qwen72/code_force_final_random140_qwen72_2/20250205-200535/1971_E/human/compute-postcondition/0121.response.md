The only variable in the loop head is `l`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `l` relative to `q`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` was some value, and for the loop to execute again, `l` must be incremented by 1 and still be less than `q`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `m` is `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) // ad[s]`
- `ql` is `ql - a[s - 1]`
- `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the original `ql`
- `i` is 1
- `l` remains unchanged

For the loop to execute one more time, `l` must be incremented by 1, and it must still be less than `q`.

State: **`m` is `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) // ad[s]`, `ql` is `ql - a[s - 1]`, `s` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the original `ql`, `i` is 1, `l` is `l + 1` and `l` must be less than `q`**
