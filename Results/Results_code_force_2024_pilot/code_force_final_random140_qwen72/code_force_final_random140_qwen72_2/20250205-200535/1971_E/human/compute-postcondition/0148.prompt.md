Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers entered by the user, `l` is equal to `q`, `m` is updated based on the calculations involving `b`, `a`, `ad`, and `bd`, `ql` is adjusted to `ql - a[s - 1]` if `a[s]` does not equal `ql`, `s` is the position where the current `ql` fits in the list `a` to maintain the order, `i` is 1, `ad` is now `[0]`, `bd` is now `[0]`, `t` must be greater than the number of iterations already completed for the loop to execute one more time, `n`, `k`, and `q` are assigned the values from the input split by spaces and converted to integers, `b` is updated to `[0] + list(map(int, input().split()))`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(a)):
    ad.append(a[i] - a[i - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers entered by the user and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `ad` is a list that now includes the difference between the second element of `a` and the first element of `a` (which is 0).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers entered by the user and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `ad` is a list that now includes the difference between the second element of `a` and the first element of `a` (which is 0), and the difference between the third element of `a` and the second element of `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by the integers entered by the user and must have at least 4 elements, `i` is 3, `ad` is a list that now includes the difference between the second element of `a` and the first element of `a` (which is 0), the difference between the third element of `a` and the second element of `a`, the difference between the fourth element of `a` and the third element of `a`, and the difference between the fifth element of `a` and the fourth element of `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
