You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha gave Anna a list a of n integers for Valentine's Day. Anna doesn't need
this list, so she suggests destroying it by playing a game.

Players take turns. Sasha is a gentleman, so he gives Anna the right to make
the first move.

  * On her turn, Anna must choose an element a_i from the list and reverse the sequence of its digits. For example, if Anna chose the element with a value of 42 , it would become 24 ; if Anna chose the element with a value of 1580 , it would become 851 . Note that leading zeros are removed. After such a turn, the number of elements in the list does not change.
  * On his turn, Sasha must extract two elements a_i and a_j (i \ne j ) from the list, concatenate them in any order and insert the result back into the list. For example, if Sasha chose the elements equal to 2007 and 19 , he would remove these two elements from the list and add the integer 200719 or 192007 . After such a turn, the number of elements in the list decreases by 1 .

Players can't skip turns. The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, i.e.
after Anna's move there is exactly one number left in the list. If this
integer is not less than 10^m (i.e., \ge 10^m ), Sasha wins. Otherwise, Anna
wins.

It can be shown that the game will always end. Determine who will win if both
players play optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Then follows the description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains integers n , m (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 , 0 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^6 ) — the number of integers in the list and the
parameter determining when Sasha wins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the list that Sasha gave to Anna.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output:

  * "Sasha", if Sasha wins with optimal play; 
  * "Anna", if Anna wins with optimal play.

Note

Consider the first test case.

Anna can reverse the integer 2 , then Sasha can concatenate the integers 2 and
14 , obtaining the integer 214 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . If Anna
had reversed the integer 14 , Sasha would have concatenated the integers 41
and 2 , obtaining the integer 412 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . Anna
has no other possible moves, so she loses.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains two integers n and m where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 0 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^6, representing the number of integers in the list and the parameter determining when Sasha wins, respectively.

    #State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `y` is `t - 1`, `list_len` is a positive integer, `max_power` is the second part of the input, `operational_list` is a sorted list of strings from the input, `x` is `list_len - 1`. `rev_res` is the concatenation of all elements in `operational_list` where elements at even indices (0-based) have trailing zeros removed, and elements at odd indices are concatenated as they are. If the length of `rev_res` is greater than or equal to the integer value of `max_power` plus one, the condition is met, and "Sasha" is printed. Otherwise, the length of `rev_res` is less than `int(max_power) + 1`, and "Anna" is printed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` using `int(input())`.
   - For each test case, it reads two values: `list_len` (number of integers in the list) and `max_power` (the threshold for Sasha's win).
   - It then reads the list of integers and sorts them based on the length of their digits after removing trailing zeros.

2. **Game Simulation:**
   - The function simulates the game by constructing a string `rev_res` where Anna's moves (reversing digits) and Sasha's moves (concatenating numbers) are alternated.
   - Anna's moves are simulated by appending the reversed digits of the current number to `rev_res` if the index is even.
   - Sasha's moves are simulated by appending the original number to `rev_res` if the index is odd.

3. **Winning Condition:**
   - After constructing the string `rev_res`, the function checks if the length of `rev_res` is greater than or equal to `max_power + 1`.
   - If it is, Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Simulation of Moves:**
  - The function does not correctly simulate the game as described. Anna should reverse the digits of a single number on her turn, and Sasha should concatenate two numbers on his turn.
  - The current implementation constructs a single string by alternating between reversing and not reversing the digits of the numbers, which does not match the game rules.

- **Sorting Logic:**
  - The sorting logic `sorted(input().split(), key=lambda x: len(x.rstrip('0')) - len(x))` is incorrect. It sorts the numbers based on the difference in length before and after removing trailing zeros, which does not align with the game's requirements.

- **Concatenation and Reversal:**
  - The function does not handle the concatenation and reversal operations as specified in the problem statement. It simply appends the numbers to a string, which is not how the game is played.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the game as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
