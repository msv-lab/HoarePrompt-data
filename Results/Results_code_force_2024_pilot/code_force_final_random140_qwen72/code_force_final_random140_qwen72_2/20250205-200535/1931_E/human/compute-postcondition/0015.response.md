Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `y` is 0, `list_len` is a positive integer, `max_power` is the second part of the input, `operational_list` is a sorted list of strings from the input, sorted by the difference between the length of each string without trailing zeros and the original length of the string, `x` is `x_prev + 2`, `rev_res` is updated by appending the value of `operational_list[x].rstrip('0')`.** 

Explanation:
- The value of `rev_res` is updated by appending the string obtained from `operational_list[x]` after removing trailing zeros.
- All other variables (`t`, `y`, `list_len`, `max_power`, `operational_list`, and `x`) remain unchanged.
- The value of `x` is still `x_prev + 2`.
- The condition that `list_len` must be greater than `x_prev + 2` remains valid.
