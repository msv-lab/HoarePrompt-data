Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `y` is 1, `list_len` is a positive integer, `max_power` is the second part of the input, `operational_list` is a sorted list of strings from the input, sorted by the difference between the length of each string without trailing zeros and the original length of the string, `rev_res` is an empty string (`''`), `list_len` is the first part of the input, `max_power` is the second part of the input.
Code of the loop:
for x in range(int(list_len)):
    if x % 2 == 0:
        rev_res += operational_list[x].rstrip('0')
    else:
        rev_res += operational_list[x]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `y` is 1, `list_len` is a positive integer, `max_power` is the second part of the input, `operational_list` is a sorted list of strings from the input, `x` is 0. If `x` is even, `rev_res` is the string obtained by removing trailing zeros from the first element of `operational_list`. If `x` is odd, `rev_res` is the first string in `operational_list`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `y` is 1, `list_len` is a positive integer, `max_power` is the second part of the input, `operational_list` is a sorted list of strings from the input, `x` is 1. If `x` is even, `rev_res` is the concatenation of the first string in `operational_list` and the second string in `operational_list` with trailing zeros removed. If `x` is odd, `rev_res` is the concatenation of the first string in `operational_list` and the second string in `operational_list`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `y` is 1, `list_len` is a positive integer, `max_power` is the second part of the input, `operational_list` is a sorted list of strings from the input, `x` is 2. If `x` is even, `rev_res` is the concatenation of the first string in `operational_list`, the second string in `operational_list`, and the third string in `operational_list` with trailing zeros removed. If `x` is odd, `rev_res` is the concatenation of the first string in `operational_list`, the second string in `operational_list` with trailing zeros removed, and the third string in `operational_list`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
