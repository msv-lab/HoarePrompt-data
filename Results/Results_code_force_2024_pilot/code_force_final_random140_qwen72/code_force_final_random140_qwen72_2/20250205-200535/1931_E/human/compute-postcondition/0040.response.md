The code snippet `rev_res += operational_list[x]` appends the string located at index `x` in the `operational_list` to the existing value of `rev_res`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `y` is 1
- `list_len` is a positive integer
- `max_power` is the second part of the input
- `operational_list` is a sorted list of strings from the input
- `x` is 2
- If `x` is even, `rev_res` is the concatenation of the first string in `operational_list` and the second string in `operational_list` with trailing zeros removed. If `x` is odd, `rev_res` is the concatenation of the first string in `operational_list` and the second string in `operational_list`.

Since `x` is 2 (which is even), `rev_res` is initially the concatenation of the first string in `operational_list` and the second string in `operational_list` with trailing zeros removed. After executing the code snippet, `rev_res` will be updated by appending the string at index 2 of `operational_list`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `y` is 1, `list_len` is a positive integer, `max_power` is the second part of the input, `operational_list` is a sorted list of strings from the input, `x` is 2, `rev_res` is the concatenation of the first string in `operational_list`, the second string in `operational_list` with trailing zeros removed, and the third string in `operational_list`.**
