Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `y` is 0, `rev_res` is an empty string, `list_len` is the first part of the input, `max_power` is the second part of the input, `operational_list` is a sorted list of strings from the input, sorted by the difference between the length of each string without trailing zeros and the original length of the string.**

Explanation:
- The code `operational_list = sorted(input().split(), key=lambda x: len(x.rstrip('0')) - len(x))` reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings, and sorts this list.
- The sorting key is defined as the difference between the length of each string after removing trailing zeros (`len(x.rstrip('0'))`) and the original length of the string (`len(x)`).
- This means that strings with more trailing zeros will come first in the sorted list because their difference will be more negative.
- The variables `t`, `y`, `rev_res`, `list_len`, and `max_power` remain unchanged from their initial state.
