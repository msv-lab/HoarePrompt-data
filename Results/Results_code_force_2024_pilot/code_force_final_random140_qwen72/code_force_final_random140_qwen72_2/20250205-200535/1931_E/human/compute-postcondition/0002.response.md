The code snippet takes input from the user and splits it into two parts, assigning the first part to `list_len` and the second part to `max_power`. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `y`, or `rev_res`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `y` is 0, `rev_res` is an empty string, `list_len` is the first part of the input, `max_power` is the second part of the input.**
