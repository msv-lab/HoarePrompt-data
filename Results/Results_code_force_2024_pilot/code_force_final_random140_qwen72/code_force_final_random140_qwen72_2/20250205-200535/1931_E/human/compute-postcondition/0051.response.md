The code snippet updates the `operational_list` by sorting it based on a custom key. The key is defined as the difference between the length of the string with trailing zeros removed (`len(x.rstrip('0'))`) and the original length of the string (`len(x)`). This means the list will be sorted such that strings with more trailing zeros come first.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `y` is 2
- `list_len` is a string
- `max_power` is a string
- `x` is `list_len - 1`
- `operational_list` is a sorted list of strings from the input
- `rev_res` is an empty string

After executing the code:
- `operational_list` is now sorted based on the custom key described above.
- The values of `t`, `y`, `list_len`, `max_power`, `x`, and `rev_res` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `y` is 2, `list_len` is a string, `max_power` is a string, `x` is `list_len - 1`, `operational_list` is a sorted list of strings from the input based on the difference between the length of each string with trailing zeros removed and the original length of the string, `rev_res` is an empty string.**
