Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains two integers n and m where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 0 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^6, representing the number of integers in the list and the parameter determining when Sasha wins, respectively. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the list of integers. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for y in range(int(input())):
    rev_res = ''
    list_len, max_power = input().split()
    operational_list = sorted(input().split(), key=lambda x: len(x.rstrip(
        '0')) - len(x))
    for x in range(int(list_len)):
        if x % 2 == 0:
            rev_res += operational_list[x].rstrip('0')
        else:
            rev_res += operational_list[x]
    if len(rev_res) >= int(max_power) + 1:
        print('Sasha')
    else:
        print('Anna')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `y` is 0, `list_len` is a positive integer, `max_power` is the second part of the input, `operational_list` is a sorted list of strings from the input, sorted by the difference between the length of each string without trailing zeros and the original length of the string, and `rev_res` is the concatenated result of processing each string in `operational_list` according to the loop's rules: for even indices, trailing zeros are stripped before appending, and for odd indices, the string is appended as-is. If the length of `rev_res` is greater than or equal to `int(max_power) + 1`, the condition is met. Otherwise, the length of `rev_res` is less than `int(max_power) + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `y` is 1, `list_len` is a positive integer, `max_power` is the second part of the input, `operational_list` is a sorted list of strings from the input, `x` is `list_len - 1`. `rev_res` is the concatenation of the elements from `operational_list` where the elements at even indices have had their trailing zeros removed, and the elements at odd indices are concatenated as they are. If the length of `rev_res` is greater than or equal to `int(max_power) + 1`, the condition is true. Otherwise, the length of `rev_res` is less than `int(max_power) + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `y` is 2, `list_len` is a string that, when converted to an integer, represents the number of iterations the loop has completed, `max_power` is a string, `x` is `int(list_len) - 1`, `operational_list` is a sorted list of strings from the input based on the difference between the length of each string with trailing zeros removed and the original length of the string. `rev_res` is the concatenation of all elements in `operational_list` where elements at even indices (0-based) have trailing zeros removed, and elements at odd indices are concatenated as they are. If the length of `rev_res` is greater than or equal to the integer value of `max_power` plus one, this condition is met. Otherwise, the length of `rev_res` is less than `int(max_power) + 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
