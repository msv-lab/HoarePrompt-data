To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `y` and the result of `int(input())`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.

The loop head is:
```python
for y in range(int(input())):
```

For the loop to execute, the following conditions must be met:
- The input provided to `int(input())` must be a positive integer because the loop will run from 0 up to (but not including) this value.
- The variable `y` should start at 0.

Since `t` represents the number of test cases and the input is expected to be the same as `t`, we can assume that the input will be `t`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the input is a positive integer and `y` starts at 0.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `y` is 0, and the input to `int(input())` must be a positive integer equal to `t`**
