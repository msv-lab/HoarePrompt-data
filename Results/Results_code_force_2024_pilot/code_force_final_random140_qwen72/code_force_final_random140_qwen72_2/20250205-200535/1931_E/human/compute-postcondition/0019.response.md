Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `y` is 0, `list_len` is a positive integer, `max_power` is the second part of the input, `operational_list` is a sorted list of strings from the input, sorted by the difference between the length of each string without trailing zeros and the original length of the string, and `rev_res` is the concatenated result of processing each string in `operational_list` according to the loop's rules: for even indices, trailing zeros are stripped before appending, and for odd indices, the string is appended as-is. Additionally, the length of `rev_res` is greater than or equal to `int(max_power) + 1`.**
