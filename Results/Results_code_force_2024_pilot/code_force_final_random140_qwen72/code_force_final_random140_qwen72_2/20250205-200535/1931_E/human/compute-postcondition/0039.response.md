The code snippet updates the value of `rev_res` by appending the value of `operational_list[x]` with trailing zeros removed. Given that `x` is 2, the third element of `operational_list` (index 2) is appended to `rev_res` after removing trailing zeros.

- `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `y` remains 1.
- `list_len` remains a positive integer.
- `max_power` remains the second part of the input.
- `operational_list` remains a sorted list of strings from the input.
- `x` remains 2.
- `rev_res` is updated to include the third string in `operational_list` with trailing zeros removed.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `y` is 1, `list_len` is a positive integer, `max_power` is the second part of the input, `operational_list` is a sorted list of strings from the input, `x` is 2, `rev_res` is the concatenation of the first string in `operational_list`, the second string in `operational_list`, and the third string in `operational_list` with trailing zeros removed.**
