Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `y` is 0, `list_len` is a positive integer, `max_power` is the second part of the input, `operational_list` is a sorted list of strings from the input, sorted by the difference between the length of each string without trailing zeros and the original length of the string, `x` is `x_prev + 2`, and `list_len` must be greater than `x_prev + 2`. If `x` is even, `rev_res` is updated by appending the value of `operational_list[x].rstrip('0')`. Otherwise, `rev_res` is updated by appending the string at index `x` in `operational_list`.***
