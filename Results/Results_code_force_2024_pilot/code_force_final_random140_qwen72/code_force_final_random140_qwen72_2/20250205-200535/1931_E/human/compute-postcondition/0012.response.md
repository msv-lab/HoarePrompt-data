Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `y` is 0, `list_len` is a positive integer, `max_power` is the second part of the input, `operational_list` is a sorted list of strings from the input, sorted by the difference between the length of each string without trailing zeros and the original length of the string, `x` is `x_prev + 1`, and `rev_res` is the concatenation of the previous `rev_res` and `operational_list[x]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `rev_res += operational_list[x]` appends the string at index `x` in `operational_list` to the existing value of `rev_res`.
- All other variables (`t`, `y`, `list_len`, `max_power`, `operational_list`, `x`) remain unchanged.
- The new value of `rev_res` is the concatenation of its previous value and the string at index `x` in `operational_list`.
