Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `y` is 1, `list_len` is a positive integer, `max_power` is the second part of the input, `operational_list` is a sorted list of strings from the input, sorted by the difference between the length of each string without trailing zeros and the original length of the string, `rev_res` is an empty string (`''`), `list_len` is the first part of the input, `max_power` is the second part of the input.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet sorts the list of strings from the input based on the difference between the length of each string without trailing zeros and the original length of the string.
- The `operational_list` is updated to this sorted list.
- All other variables (`t`, `y`, `list_len`, `max_power`, `rev_res`) remain unchanged.
- The `list_len` and `max_power` are still the first and second parts of the input, respectively.
