Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `y` is 2, `list_len` is a positive integer, `max_power` is the second part of the input, `operational_list` is a sorted list of strings from the input, `x` is `list_len - 1`, `rev_res` is an empty string. The condition about the length of `rev_res` being greater than or equal to `int(max_power) + 1` is no longer relevant since `rev_res` is now an empty string.**
