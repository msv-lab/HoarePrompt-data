Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `strr` is the second-to-last character of `s`, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `s` minus 1, `r` is `n - 1` minus the number of 'R' characters in `s`, `p` is updated to `p * arr[l] % m`, `t`, `n`, `m`, and `arr` remain unchanged, and `ans` now contains the value of `p`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `p` is updated to `p * arr[l] % m`.
- All other variables (`s`, `strr`, `l`, `r`, `t`, `n`, `m`, and `arr`) remain unchanged.
- The value of `ans` is now the updated value of `p`.
