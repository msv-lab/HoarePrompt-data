Output State: **`l` is now 1 or 2, `s` is a non-empty string provided by the user input with at least one character remaining, `k` is the next character of `s`, `t`, `n`, `m`, and `arr` are updated, `p` is the final computed value based on the operations within the loop, `ans` is a list containing the values of `p` after each iteration of the loop, `r` is now `n - 1` if `k` is 'L' and `n - 2` otherwise, `n` and `m` are updated to the values provided by the user input, and `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user input.**

Explanation: The value of `l` is incremented by 1, so if `l` was initially 0, it becomes 1, and if it was initially 1, it becomes 2. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
