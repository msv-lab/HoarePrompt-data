Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `strr` is the last character of `s`, `t`, `n`, `m`, and `arr` remain unchanged, `ans` now contains the value of `p` appended to its previous contents, `l` is decremented by 1, `p` is updated to `p * arr[l] % m`. If `strr` is 'R', `r` is incremented by 1, and `p` is updated to `p * arr[r] % m`. Otherwise, `p` is updated to `p * arr[l] % m`.** 

Explanation:
- The value of `p` is updated to `p * arr[l] % m`.
- The value of `l` is decremented by 1.
- The value of `ans` now contains the new value of `p` appended to its previous contents.
- The values of `s`, `strr`, `t`, `n`, `m`, and `arr` remain unchanged.
- If `strr` is 'R', `r` is incremented by 1, and `p` is updated to `p * arr[r] % m`.
- If `strr` is not 'R', `p` remains updated to `p * arr[l] % m`.
