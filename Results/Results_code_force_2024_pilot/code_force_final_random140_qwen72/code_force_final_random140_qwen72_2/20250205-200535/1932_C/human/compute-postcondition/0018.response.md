The value of `r` is decreased by 1. The value of `k` remains the third character of `s`, and if `k` is 'L', `l` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `r` was already decreased by 1 before this operation. The string `s` remains a non-empty string with at least 3 characters.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string with at least 3 characters, `k` is the third character of `s`, `r` is decreased by 1, if `k` is 'L', `l` is increased by 1.**
