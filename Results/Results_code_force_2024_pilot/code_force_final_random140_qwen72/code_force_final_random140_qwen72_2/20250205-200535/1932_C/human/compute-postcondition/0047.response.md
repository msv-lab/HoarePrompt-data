To determine what will be printed by the `print(*ans[::-1])` statement, let's break down the initial state and the implications of the variables involved:

### Initial State:
- `s` is a non-empty string.
- `t`, `n`, `m`, and `arr` remain unchanged.
- `p` is the final computed value based on the operations within the loop.
- `ans` is a list containing the values of `p` after each iteration of the loop.
- `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `s` minus the number of 'L' characters processed.
- `r` is `n - 1` minus the number of 'R' characters in `s` plus the number of 'R' characters processed.

### Analysis:
- The `ans` list contains the values of `p` after each iteration of the loop.
- The `print(*ans[::-1])` statement will print the elements of the `ans` list in reverse order, separated by spaces.

### Explanation:
- Since `ans` is a list of values of `p` after each iteration, the `print(*ans[::-1])` statement will print these values in reverse order.
- The exact values of `p` depend on the operations performed in the loop, but the important part is that they are stored in `ans`.

### Final Output:
The `print(*ans[::-1])` statement will print the elements of the `ans` list in reverse order, separated by spaces.

Output: **[values of p in reverse order]** (where the values of `p` are the values stored in the `ans` list after each iteration of the loop)
