Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `strr` is the last character of `s`, `t`, `n`, `m`, and `arr` remain unchanged, `ans` now contains the value of `p` appended to its previous contents. If `strr` is 'R', `r` is incremented by 1, and `p` is updated to `p * arr[r] % m`. Otherwise, `l` is decremented by 1, and `p` is updated to `p * arr[l] % m`. Additionally, `r` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `r` is incremented by 1.
- The values of `s`, `strr`, `t`, `n`, `m`, and `arr` remain unchanged.
- The value of `ans` remains as it was after the previous operation (containing the value of `p` appended to its previous contents).
- The conditions for updating `p` and `l` or `r` based on `strr` being 'R' or not remain as they were before the execution of the code. However, since `r` is incremented by 1, if `strr` is 'R', the next time the condition is checked, `r` will already be incremented.
