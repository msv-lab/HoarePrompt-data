The value of `r` is incremented by 1. The values of `l`, `s`, `k`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `arr`, and `strr` remain unchanged. The list `ans` also remains unchanged, with its second element still being the updated value of `p`.

Output State: **`ans` is a list containing two elements, where the second element is the updated value of `p`. The values of `l`, `r` is `r + 1`, `s`, `k`, `t`, `n`, `m`, and `arr` remain unchanged. `strr` is the next character in the reversed string `s`.**
