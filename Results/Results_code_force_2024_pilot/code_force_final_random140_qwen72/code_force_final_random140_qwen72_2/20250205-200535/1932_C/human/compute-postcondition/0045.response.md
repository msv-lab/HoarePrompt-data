Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `strr` is the last character of `s`, `t`, `n`, `m`, and `arr` remain unchanged, `ans` now contains the value of `p` appended to its previous contents. If `strr` is 'R', `r` is incremented by 1, and `p` is updated to `p * arr[r] % m`. Otherwise, `l` is decremented by 1, and `p` is updated to `p * arr[l] % m`.** 

Explanation:
- The value of `p` is appended to the list `ans`.
- If `strr` (the last character of `s`) is 'R':
  - `r` is incremented by 1.
  - `p` is updated to `p * arr[r] % m`.
- Otherwise:
  - `l` is decremented by 1.
  - `p` is updated to `p * arr[l] % m`.
- All other variables (`s`, `strr`, `t`, `n`, `m`, and `arr`) remain unchanged.
