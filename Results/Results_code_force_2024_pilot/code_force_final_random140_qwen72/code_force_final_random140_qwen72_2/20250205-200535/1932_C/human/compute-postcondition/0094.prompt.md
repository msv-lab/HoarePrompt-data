Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans` is an empty list, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `s`, `r` is `n - (number of 'R' characters in `s` + number of 'L' characters in `s`), `s` remains the original non-empty string provided by the user input, `k` is the last character processed from `s`, `t`, `n`, `m`, and `arr` are updated as per the user input, `p` is now 1, `n`, `m`, and `arr` remain as provided by the user input, and `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user input.
Code of the loop:
for strr in s[::-1]:
    if strr == 'R':
        r += 1
        p = p * arr[r] % m
    else:
        l -= 1
        p = p * arr[l] % m
    ans.append(p)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ans` is a list containing one element which is the value of `p`, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `s` (decremented by 1 if `strr` was not 'R'), `r` is `n - (number of 'R' characters in `s` + number of 'L' characters in `s`)` (incremented by 1 if `strr` was 'R'), `s` is a non-empty string provided by the user input, `k` is the last character processed from `s` (set to 'R' if `strr` was 'R'), `t`, `n`, `m`, and `arr` remain as provided by the user input.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ans` is a list containing two elements, where the second element is the updated value of `p`. The values of `l`, `r`, `s`, `k`, `t`, `n`, `m`, and `arr` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ans` is a list containing three elements, where the third element is the updated value of `p`. The values of `s`, `k`, `t`, `n`, `m`, and `arr` remain unchanged. `strr` is the next character in the reversed string `s`. If `strr` is 'R', `r` is incremented by 1, and `p` is updated to `(p * arr[r]) % m`. Otherwise, `l` is decremented by 1, and `p` is updated to `p * arr[l] % m`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
