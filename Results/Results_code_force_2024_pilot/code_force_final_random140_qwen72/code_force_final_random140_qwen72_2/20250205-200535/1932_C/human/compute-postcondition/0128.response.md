The only objects in the loop head are the variable `strr` and the string `s`. The loop iterates over the reversed string `s`, so each iteration changes the value of `strr` to the next character from the end of `s`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `strr` was the last character of `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `strr` must be the second-to-last character of `s`.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `strr` is the second-to-last character of `s` when the loop starts. `arr`, `s`, `k`, `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.**
