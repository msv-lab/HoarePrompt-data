The value of `p` is updated to `p * arr[r] % m`. Since `r` was previously increased by 1, the new value of `r` is used to access the element in `arr`. The other variables (`s`, `strr`, `arr`, `k`, `t`, `n`, and `m`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `strr` is the last character of `s` when the loop starts, `arr`, `s`, `k`, `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged, `r` is increased by 1, `p` is now `p * arr[r] % m`.**
