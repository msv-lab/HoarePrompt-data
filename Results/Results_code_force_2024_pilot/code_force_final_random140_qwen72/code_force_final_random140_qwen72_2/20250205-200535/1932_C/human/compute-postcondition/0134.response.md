Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `strr` is the second-to-last character of `s` when the loop starts, `arr`, `s`, `k`, `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. If `strr` is 'R', `r` is increased by 1 and `p` is updated to `p * arr[r] % m`. Otherwise, `l` is decreased by 1 and `p` is updated to `p * arr[l] % m`. `ans` now includes the new value of `p`.**
