To determine what will be printed by the `print(*ans[::-1])` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

### Initial State:
- `ans` is a list containing the final values of `p` for each iteration of the loop.
- The length of `ans` is equal to the length of the string `s`.
- The values of `l`, `r`, `s`, `k`, `t`, `n`, `m`, and `arr` remain unchanged.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*ans[::-1])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `ans`**:
   - `ans` is a list where each element is the final value of `p` after each iteration of the loop.
   - The length of `ans` is the same as the length of the string `s`.

2. **Reversing `ans`**:
   - `ans[::-1]` creates a reversed version of the list `ans`.
   - This means the elements of `ans` are printed in reverse order.

3. **Unpacking and Printing**:
   - The `*` operator unpacks the list `ans[::-1]`, so each element of the reversed list is passed as a separate argument to the `print` function.
   - The `print` function will print these elements separated by spaces by default.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will print the elements of the list `ans` in reverse order, separated by spaces.

Output: **[reversed elements of ans separated by spaces]**

For example, if `ans` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the output will be:
Output: **5 4 3 2 1**

If `ans` is `[10, 20, 30]`, the output will be:
Output: **30 20 10**

Without the specific values of `ans`, the most precise description is:
Output: **[reversed elements of ans separated by spaces]**
