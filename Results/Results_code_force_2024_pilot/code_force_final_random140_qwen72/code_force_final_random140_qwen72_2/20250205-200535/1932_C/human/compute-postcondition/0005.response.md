Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `s` is a string read from the input, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`.**

Explanation: The variable `r` is assigned the value of `n - 1`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `arr`, `s`, and `l`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
