Output State: **`ans` is a list containing the final values of `p` for each iteration of the loop, with the length of `ans` equal to the length of the string `s`. The values of `l`, `r`, `s`, `k`, `t`, `n`, `m`, and `arr` remain unchanged.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- After the loop has completed all its iterations, the list `ans` will contain the final values of `p` computed during each iteration of the loop. The length of `ans` will be equal to the length of the string `s`.
- The variable `l` will be the number of 'L' characters in `s` minus the number of times the loop encountered an 'L'.
- The variable `r` will be the initial value of `r` plus the number of times the loop encountered an 'R'.
- The variables `s`, `k`, `t`, `n`, `m`, and `arr` will remain unchanged from their initial values.
