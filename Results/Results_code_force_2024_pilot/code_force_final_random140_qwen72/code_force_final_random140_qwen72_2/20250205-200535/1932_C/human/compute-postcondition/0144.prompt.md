Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4; a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4; s is a string of length n consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for k in s:
        if k == 'L':
            l += 1
        else:
            r -= 1
    p = 1
    ans = []
    for strr in s[::-1]:
        if strr == 'R':
            r += 1
            p = p * arr[r] % m
        else:
            l -= 1
            p = p * arr[l] % m
        ans.append(p)
    print(*ans[::-1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After all iterations of the loop, `s` remains a non-empty string, `t`, `n`, `m`, and `arr` remain unchanged, `p` is the final computed value based on the operations within the loop, and `ans` is a list containing the values of `p` after each iteration of the loop. `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `s` minus the number of 'L' characters processed, and `r` is `n - 1` minus the number of 'R' characters in `s` plus the number of 'R' characters processed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ans` is a list containing the final values of `p` for each iteration of the loop, with the length of `ans` equal to the length of the string `s`. The values of `l`, `r`, `s`, `k`, `t`, `n`, `m`, and `arr` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After all iterations of the loop, `l` is the total number of 'L' characters in the string `s` minus the number of 'L' characters processed, and `r` is `n - 1 - (number of 'R' characters in `s)` plus the number of 'R' characters processed. `p` is the final product of the elements in `arr` indexed by the positions of 'R' and 'L' characters in `s` (from the end to the beginning), modulo `m`. `ans` is a list containing the values of `p` after each iteration of the loop. The values of `arr`, `s`, `k`, `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
