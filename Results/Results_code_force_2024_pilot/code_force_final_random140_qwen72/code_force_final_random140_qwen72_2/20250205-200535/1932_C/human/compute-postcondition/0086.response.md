Output State: **`ans` is a list containing two elements, where the second element is the updated value of `p`. The values of `l`, `r`, `s`, `k`, `t`, `n`, `m`, and `arr` remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans.append(p)` appends the current value of `p` to the list `ans`.
- Initially, `ans` contains one element which is the updated value of `p`.
- After executing the code, `ans` now contains two elements: the original element and the current value of `p`.
- The values of `l`, `r`, `s`, `k`, `t`, `n`, `m`, and `arr` are not affected by this operation.
