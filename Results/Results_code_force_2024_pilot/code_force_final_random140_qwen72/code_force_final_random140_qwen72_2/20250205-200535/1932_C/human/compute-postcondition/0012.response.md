The only objects in the loop head are the variable `k` and the string `s`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If there are more characters in `s`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a non-empty string, and `k` is the first character of `s`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `s` must still be a non-empty string, and `k` will now be the next character in `s`.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `k` is the second character of `s`**
