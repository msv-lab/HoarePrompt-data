The code `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in a list called `arr`.

- The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `n` and `m` are integers read from the input.
- After executing the code, `arr` will contain a list of integers derived from the input.
- The values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input.**
