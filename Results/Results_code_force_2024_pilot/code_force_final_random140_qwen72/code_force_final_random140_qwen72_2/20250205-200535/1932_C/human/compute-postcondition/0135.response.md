The only object in the loop head is the variable `strr`, and it is derived from the reversed string `s`. Therefore, we can only adjust `strr` based on the current state of `s`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `strr` was the second-to-last character of `s` (since the loop iterates over `s` in reverse). For the loop to execute one more time, `strr` must now be the last character of `s`.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `strr` is the last character of `s` when the loop starts, `arr`, `s`, `k`, `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.**
