Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `ans` is a list containing the final values of `p` for each iteration of the loop, with the length of `ans` equal to the length of the string `s`. The values of `l`, `r`, `s`, `k`, `t`, `n`, `m`, and `arr` remain unchanged. `s` is now a string provided by the user input. The loop will execute again if the number of iterations specified by `int(input())` has not been reached. `n` and `m` are updated to the values provided by the user input.**
