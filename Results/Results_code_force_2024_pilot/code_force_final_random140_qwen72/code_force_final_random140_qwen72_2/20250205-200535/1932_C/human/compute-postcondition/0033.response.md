Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `strr` is the second-to-last character of `s`, `l` is the number of 'L' characters in `s`, `r` is `n - 1` minus the number of 'R' characters in `s` plus 1, `t`, `n`, `m`, and `arr` remain unchanged, and `ans` now contains the value of `p`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `r` is incremented by 1.
- All other variables (`s`, `strr`, `l`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `arr`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.
- The value of `p` is not recalculated, so `ans` still holds the value of `p` from the previous state.
