Output State: **`s` must be a non-empty string, `strr` is the last character of `s` and is 'R', `l` will be the number of 'L' characters in `s`, `r` will be `n - 1` minus the number of 'R' characters in `s` plus 1, `t`, `n`, `m`, and `arr` remain unchanged, `p` is now `arr[r] % m`, `ans` is an empty list.**

Explanation:
- The value of `p` is updated to `p * arr[r] % m`. Given that `p` was initially 1, the new value of `p` is simply `arr[r] % m`.
- All other variables (`s`, `strr`, `l`, `r`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `arr`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
