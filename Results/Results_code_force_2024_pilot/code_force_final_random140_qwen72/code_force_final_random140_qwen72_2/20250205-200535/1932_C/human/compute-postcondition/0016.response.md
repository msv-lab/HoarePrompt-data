The only object in the loop head is the variable `k` and the string `s`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` has more characters, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a non-empty string, and `k` is the second character of `s`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `s` must have at least 3 characters (since the second character has already been processed). The next character to be processed will be the third character of `s`, and `k` will be set to this third character.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string with at least 3 characters, `k` is the third character of `s`. If `k` is 'L', `l` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `r` is decreased by 1.**
