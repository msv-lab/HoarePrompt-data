Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem by processing a series of commands ('L' or 'R') on an array `a` and calculating the product of the remaining elements modulo `m` before each command is executed. Here's a detailed breakdown of the program's logic and its correctness:

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, the array `arr`, and the command string `s`.

2. **Initial Setup**: It initializes two pointers, `l` and `r`, to represent the current bounds of the array. Initially, `l` is set to 0 and `r` is set to `n-1`.

3. **Processing Commands**: The program iterates over the command string `s` in reverse order. This is a key part of the solution because it allows the program to keep track of which elements should be included in the product calculation as the array shrinks.

4. **Product Calculation**: For each command, it updates the product `p` by multiplying it with the appropriate element from the array (either `arr[r]` or `arr[l]`), and takes the result modulo `m`. This ensures that the product remains manageable and avoids overflow issues.

5. **Appending Results**: The result of each product calculation is appended to the list `ans`.

6. **Reversing and Printing Results**: After processing all commands, the results are reversed (to match the order of the original commands) and printed.

### Potential Issues and Verification:
- **Order of Processing**: The program processes the commands in reverse order, which is necessary to correctly update the product as elements are removed from the array.
- **Modulo Operation**: The modulo operation is applied correctly to ensure the product does not overflow.
- **Boundary Conditions**: The program correctly handles the boundaries of the array by updating the pointers `l` and `r` appropriately.

### Example Verification:
Let's verify the program with the provided example:

#### Test Case 1:
- Input: `n = 4`, `m = 6`, `arr = [3, 1, 4, 2]`, `s = "LRRL"`
- Initial product: `3 * 1 * 4 * 2 % 6 = 24 % 6 = 0`
- Command 'L': Remove 3, new array `[1, 4, 2]`, product `1 * 4 * 2 % 6 = 8 % 6 = 2`
- Command 'R': Remove 2, new array `[1, 4]`, product `1 * 4 % 6 = 4 % 6 = 4`
- Command 'R': Remove 4, new array `[1]`, product `1 % 6 = 1`
- Command 'L': Remove 1, new array `[]`, product `0`

Output: `0 2 4 1`

This matches the expected output.

#### Test Case 2:
- Input: `n = 5`, `m = 1`, `arr = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`, `s = "LLLLL"`
- Initial product: `1 * 1 * 1 * 1 * 1 % 1 = 1 % 1 = 0`
- Command 'L': Remove 1, new array `[1, 1, 1, 1]`, product `1 * 1 * 1 * 1 % 1 = 1 % 1 = 0`
- Command 'L': Remove 1, new array `[1, 1, 1]`, product `1 * 1 * 1 % 1 = 1 % 1 = 0`
- Command 'L': Remove 1, new array `[1, 1]`, product `1 * 1 % 1 = 1 % 1 = 0`
- Command 'L': Remove 1, new array `[1]`, product `1 % 1 = 1 % 1 = 0`
- Command 'L': Remove 1, new array `[]`, product `0`

Output: `0 0 0 0 0`

This matches the expected output.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and produces the expected output for the given examples. Therefore, the program is correct.
