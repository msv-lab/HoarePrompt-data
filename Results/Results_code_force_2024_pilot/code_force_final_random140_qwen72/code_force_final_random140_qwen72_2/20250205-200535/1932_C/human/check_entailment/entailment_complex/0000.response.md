Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly handles the input format, reading the number of test cases and then processing each test case individually. This is consistent with the problem description.

2. **Initialization**: The variables `l` and `r` are initialized to 0 and `n-1` respectively, which represent the left and right indices of the array `arr`.

3. **First Loop (Adjusting Indices)**: The first loop iterates through the string `s` and adjusts the indices `l` and `r` based on the commands 'L' and 'R'. This step is necessary to determine the positions of the elements that will be removed in the subsequent steps.

4. **Second Loop (Calculating Products and Modulo)**: The second loop iterates through the string `s` in reverse order. For each command:
   - If the command is 'R', it increments `r` and multiplies the current product `p` by the element at index `r`, taking the modulo `m`.
   - If the command is 'L', it decrements `l` and multiplies the current product `p` by the element at index `l`, taking the modulo `m`.
   - The result is appended to the list `ans`.

5. **Output**: The function prints the results in the correct order by reversing the list `ans` before printing.

6. **Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases correctly, such as when the array has only one element or when all commands are the same.

7. **Efficiency**: The function processes each test case in O(n) time, which is efficient given the constraints.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement and handles all edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
