Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program has a few issues that prevent it from being correct in every potential case:

1. **Scope Issue**: The variable `n` used in `func_1()` is not defined within the scope of this function. It is defined in the outer loop but not passed to `func_1()`. This will cause a `NameError` when `func_1()` tries to access `n`.

2. **Incorrect Return Value**: If no tandem repeat is found, the function should return 0, but the current implementation does not handle this case correctly. The function returns `None` instead of 0, which is not the expected output.

3. **Edge Case Handling**: The program does not handle the case where the string is entirely composed of question marks (`'?'`). For example, for the input `"?????"`, the program should return 4, but it may not correctly identify this.

Here is a corrected version of the program for reference:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    s = list(input())
    n = len(s)
    result = func_1(s, n)
    print(result)

def func_1(s, n):
    for j in range(n // 2, 0, -1):
        count = 0
        for k in range(0, n - j):
            if s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]:
                count += 1
            else:
                count = 0
            if count == j:
                return count * 2
    return 0
```

This corrected version ensures that `n` is passed to `func_1()` and handles the case where no tandem repeat is found by explicitly returning 0.
