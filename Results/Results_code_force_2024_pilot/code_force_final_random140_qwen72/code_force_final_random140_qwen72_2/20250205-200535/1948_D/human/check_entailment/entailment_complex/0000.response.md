Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Call**: The function `func_1` should indeed take a string `s` as an argument, as noted in the state description. However, the function is currently defined without parameters. This is a critical issue because the function needs to operate on the string `s` which is passed to it in the main loop.

2. **Loop Structure**: The outer loop iterates over possible lengths of tandem repeats from `n // 2` down to 1. This is correct because the maximum possible length of a tandem repeat is half the length of the string.

3. **Inner Loop**: The inner loop checks for tandem repeats by comparing characters at positions `k` and `k + j`. If both characters are either the same or one of them is a question mark, it increments the `count`. This logic is correct for identifying potential tandem repeats.

4. **Count Check**: When `count` reaches `j`, it means a valid tandem repeat of length `j` has been found, and the function prints `count * 2` (the length of the tandem repeat) and returns. This is the correct behavior.

5. **Return Statement**: If no valid tandem repeat is found after all iterations, the function returns 0. This is also correct according to the problem statement.

6. **State After Function Call**: The state description indicates that the function should return 0 if no valid tandem repeat is found, which aligns with the expected behavior.

However, the main issue is that the function `func_1` is not correctly defined to accept the string `s` as an argument. This will cause a runtime error when the function is called.

### Corrected Program:
```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    s = list(input())
    n = len(s)
    func_1(s)

def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    for j in range(n // 2, 0, -1):
        count = 0
        
        for k in range(0, n - j):
            if s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]:
                count += 1
            else:
                count = 0
            if count == j:
                print(count * 2)
                return
        
    return 0
```

### Conclusion:
Given the current state of the program, the function `func_1` is not correctly defined to accept the string `s` as an argument, which will cause a runtime error. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
