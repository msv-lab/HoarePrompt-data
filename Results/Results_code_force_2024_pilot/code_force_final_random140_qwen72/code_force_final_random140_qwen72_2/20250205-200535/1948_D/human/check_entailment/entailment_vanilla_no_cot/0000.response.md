Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program has a few issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Scope Issue**: The variable `n` used inside `func_1()` is not defined within the scope of this function. It should be passed as a parameter or defined globally.

2. **Return Value Handling**: The function `func_1()` does not handle the case where no tandem repeat is found. It should return 0 in such cases, but the current implementation does not ensure this.

3. **Incorrect Tandem Repeat Check**: The logic for checking tandem repeats is flawed. The current implementation checks if the characters at positions `k` and `k + j` are equal or one of them is a '?'. However, this does not correctly account for the requirement that the first half must be equal to the second half of the substring.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    s = input()
    n = len(s)
    max_tandem_length = 0
    
    # Function to check if a substring is a tandem repeat
    def is_tandem_repeat(sub):
        return sub[:len(sub)//2] == sub[len(sub)//2:]
    
    # Replace '?' with 'a' to maximize the possibility of forming a tandem repeat
    s = s.replace('?', 'a')
    
    # Check all possible substrings
    for length in range(2, n + 1, 2):  # Only even lengths
        for start in range(n - length + 1):
            sub = s[start:start + length]
            if is_tandem_repeat(sub):
                max_tandem_length = max(max_tandem_length, length)
    
    print(max_tandem_length)
```

This corrected version ensures that:
- The variable `n` is correctly scoped.
- The function `is_tandem_repeat` correctly checks if a substring is a tandem repeat.
- All possible substrings are checked to find the maximum length of a tandem repeat.
- The '?' characters are replaced with 'a' to maximize the possibility of forming a tandem repeat.
