Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` as a parameter, where `s` consists of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks. Depending on the internal logic, the function may return the value of `count` (which is derived from `j`), an error message, or no value at all. Specifically, in some cases, it returns a value that is at least 1, in other cases it returns the value of `n // 2 - 2`, and in another case it returns 0. In several other scenarios, the function does not return any value.**
