The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` relative to `n`. The loop iterates from `n // 2` down to `1` (exclusive), decrementing by `1` each time.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `n // 2 - 1`, and `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be decremented by 1, making it `n // 2 - 2`. However, the loop condition is `j > 0`, so `j` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue executing.

Given that `j` is `n // 2 - 1` at the end of the last iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be such that `n // 2 - 2` is still greater than 0. This means `n` must be at least 5 (since `5 // 2 - 2 = 0.5`, which rounds down to 0, and `6 // 2 - 2 = 1`, which is greater than 0).

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`n` is at least 5, `j` is `n // 2 - 2`, `k` is `n - (n // 2 - 2)`**
