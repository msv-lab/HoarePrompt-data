Let's break down the initial state and the conditions to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is at least 2.
   - `j` is `n // 2 - 1`.
   - `k` is 0.
   - If `s[k]` is '?', `s[k + j]` is '?', or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`, then `count` is 1.
   - Otherwise, `count` is 0.
   - `s[k]` is not '?', `s[k + j]` is not '?', and `s[k]` is not equal to `s[k + j]`.
   - The current value of `count` is equal to `j`.

2. **Determine the value of `j`:**
   - Since `n` is at least 2, let's consider the smallest possible value for `n`, which is 2.
   - For `n = 2`, `j` would be `2 // 2 - 1 = 0`.
   - For `n = 3`, `j` would be `3 // 2 - 1 = 0`.
   - For `n = 4`, `j` would be `4 // 2 - 1 = 1`.
   - For `n = 5`, `j` would be `5 // 2 - 1 = 1`.
   - For `n = 6`, `j` would be `6 // 2 - 1 = 2`.
   - And so on...

3. **Determine the value of `count`:**
   - According to the initial state, `count` is equal to `j`.
   - Therefore, `count` will be the same as the value of `j`.

4. **Calculate the output of `print(count * 2)`:**
   - Since `count` is equal to `j`, the expression `count * 2` will be `j * 2`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The value of `j` depends on the value of `n`, but since `count` is equal to `j`, the output will be `j * 2`.

Given the initial state and the conditions, the output will be:
Output: **j * 2 (where j is n // 2 - 1)**
