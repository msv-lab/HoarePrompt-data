Let's break down the initial state and the conditions to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `n` is at least 5.
   - `j` is calculated as `n // 2 - 2`.
   - `k` is calculated as `n - (n // 2 - 2) + 1`.

2. **Conditions for `count`:**
   - If `s[k]` is '?' or `s[k + j]` is '?' or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`, then `count` is 2.
   - Otherwise, `count` is 0.
   - Additionally, `count` is not equal to `j`.

3. **Calculating `j` and `k`:**
   - Let's assume `n = 5` (the minimum value for `n`).
     - `j = n // 2 - 2 = 5 // 2 - 2 = 2 - 2 = 0`.
     - `k = n - (n // 2 - 2) + 1 = 5 - (2 - 2) + 1 = 5 - 0 + 1 = 6`.

4. **Checking the Conditions:**
   - Since `j = 0`, the condition `count != j` means `count` cannot be 0.
   - Therefore, `count` must be 2 because it is the only other option given the conditions.

5. **Final Calculation:**
   - The print statement is `print(count * 2)`.
   - Since `count` is 2, `count * 2` is `2 * 2 = 4`.

Thus, the output will be:
Output: **4**
