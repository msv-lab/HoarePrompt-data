Let's break down the initial state and the conditions to determine the value of `count`:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is at least 2.
   - `j` is `n // 2`.
   - `k` is 1.
   - If `s[k]` is '?', `s[k + j]` is '?', or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`, then `count` is 2.
   - Otherwise, `count` is 0.
   - `s[k]` is not '?', `s[k + j]` is not '?', and `s[k]` is not equal to `s[k + j]`.
   - Additionally, `count` is not equal to `j`.

2. **Determine `count`:**
   - According to the conditions, if `s[k]` is not '?', `s[k + j]` is not '?', and `s[k]` is not equal to `s[k + j]`, then `count` is 0.
   - Since `count` is not equal to `j`, and the only other possible value for `count` is 2, it must be that `count` is 0.

3. **Calculate `count * 2`:**
   - Since `count` is 0, `count * 2` is `0 * 2`, which is 0.

Therefore, the output of the `print(count * 2)` statement will be:

Output: **0**
