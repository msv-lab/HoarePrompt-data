Let's break down the initial state and the conditions to determine the value of `count` and what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `n` is at least 5.
- `j` is `n // 2 - 2`.
- `k` is `n - (n // 2 - 2) + 2`.
- `s[k]` is not '?'.
- `s[k + j]` is not '?'.
- `s[k]` is not equal to `s[k + j]`.
- `count` is not equal to `j`.

### Conditions:
- If `s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]`, then `count` is 1.
- Otherwise, `count` remains 0.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `j` and `k`:**
   - `j = n // 2 - 2`
   - `k = n - (n // 2 - 2) + 2`

2. **Evaluate the conditions for `s[k]` and `s[k + j]`:**
   - `s[k]` is not '?'.
   - `s[k + j]` is not '?'.
   - `s[k]` is not equal to `s[k + j]`.

3. **Check the condition for `count`:**
   - Since `s[k]` is not '?', `s[k + j]` is not '?', and `s[k]` is not equal to `s[k + j]`, the condition `s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]` is false.
   - Therefore, `count` remains 0.

4. **Calculate the output of the print statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(count * 2)`.
   - Since `count` is 0, `count * 2` is 0.

### Final Output:
Output: **0**
