The value of `count` is incremented by 1, while the other variables remain unchanged. The conditions regarding `n`, `j`, `k`, and the elements of `s` remain valid.

Output State: **`n` is at least 5, `j` is `n // 2 - 2`, `k` is `n - (n // 2 - 2)`, `count` is 1, and either `s[k]` is '?', or `s[k + j]` is '?', or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`.**
