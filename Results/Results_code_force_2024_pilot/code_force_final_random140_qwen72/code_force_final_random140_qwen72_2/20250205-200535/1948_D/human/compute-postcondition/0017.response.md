Output State: **The program returns nothing.**

Explanation: The given code snippet is a return statement without any expression. This means that the function or block of code from which this return statement is executed does not return any value. In Python, if a function ends without encountering a return statement, or if a return statement is encountered without an expression, the function implicitly returns `None`. However, since the return statement here explicitly does not specify a value, the program simply ends the current function or block without returning any value.
