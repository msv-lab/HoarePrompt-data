Functionality: ** The function `func_1` is designed to process a string `s` that consists of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks. It searches for repeating patterns within the string, specifically looking for sequences where characters match or are question marks. If a valid repeating pattern of length `j` (where `j` is at least 1 and up to half the length of the string) is found, the function prints the length of this pattern multiplied by 2 and then returns. If no such pattern is found after checking all possible lengths, the function returns 0. The function does not modify the input string `s` and does not have side effects beyond printing and returning values. **
