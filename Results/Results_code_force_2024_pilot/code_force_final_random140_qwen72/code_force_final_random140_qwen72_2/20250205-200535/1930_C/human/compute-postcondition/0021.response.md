Functionality: ** The function `func_1` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and an array `a` of `n` integers. It then constructs a new array where each element is the sum of its index (starting from 1) and the corresponding element from `a`. This new array is sorted in descending order. The function generates a result array `ans` such that each element is either the corresponding element from the sorted array or one less than the previous element in `ans`, ensuring that no element in `ans` is greater than the previous element. Finally, the function prints the elements of `ans` separated by spaces. The function handles multiple test cases, with the total number of test cases `t` ranging from 1 to 10^4, and the sum of `n` over all test cases not exceeding 3 Â· 10^5. **
