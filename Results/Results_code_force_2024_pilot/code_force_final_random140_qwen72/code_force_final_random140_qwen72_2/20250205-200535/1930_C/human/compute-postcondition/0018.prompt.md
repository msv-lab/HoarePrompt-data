Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, the array `a` consists of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the sum of its index (starting from 1) and the corresponding integer from the input, sorted in descending order, `ans` is a list containing the first element of `arr`.
Code of the loop:
for x in arr[1:]:
    if x >= ans[-1]:
        ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)
    else:
        ans.append(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, the array `a` consists of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the sum of its index (starting from 1) and the corresponding integer from the input, sorted in descending order, and `arr` must have at least 2 elements. If `x` is greater than or equal to the last element of `ans`, `ans` is a list containing the first element of `arr` and the first element of `arr` minus 1. Otherwise, `ans` is a list containing the first element of `arr` and `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, the array `a` consists of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the sum of its index (starting from 1) and the corresponding integer from the input, sorted in descending order, and `arr` must have at least 3 elements. `x` is the third element of `arr`. If `x` is greater than or equal to the last element of `ans`, `ans` is a list containing the first element of `arr` and the first element of `arr` minus 1. Otherwise, `ans` is a list containing the first element of `arr` and `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, the array `a` consists of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the sum of its index (starting from 1) and the corresponding integer from the input, sorted in descending order, and `arr` must have at least 3 elements. `x` is the fourth element of `arr`. If `x >= ans[-1]`, then `ans` is a list containing the first element of `arr`, the first element of `arr` minus 1, and the first element of `arr` minus 2. Otherwise, `ans` is a list containing the first element of `arr`, `x`, and `x - 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
