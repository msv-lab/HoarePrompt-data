You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, representing the length of the array a. The array a consists of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(sum, enumerate(map(int, input().split()), start=1)))
    arr.sort(reverse=True)
    ans = [arr[0]]
    for x in arr[1:]:
        if x >= ans[-1]:
            ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)
        else:
            ans.append(x)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, the array `a` consists of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the sum of its index (starting from 1) and the corresponding integer from the input, sorted in descending order, and `ans` is a list where each element is either the corresponding element from `arr` or one less than the previous element in `ans`, ensuring that no element in `ans` is greater than the previous element.
    print(*ans)
    #This is printed: - The `print(*ans)` statement will print the elements of `ans` separated by spaces.
    #
    #Given the above steps, the output will be the elements of `ans` in the order they are constructed, which is the same as the sorted `arr` in descending order.
    #
    #Output:
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) representing the length of an array `a`, which contains `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The function returns results for each test case, considering the constraints that the number of test cases `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
