Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `arr` is a list of integers read from input, `st` contains the values `arr[i] + i + 1` for each `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains an integer within the specified range (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
- **`n`**: Remains an integer within the specified range (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5).
- **`a`**: Remains a list of `n` integers where each element is within the specified range (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).
- **`arr`**: Remains the list of integers read from input.
- **`st`**: After the loop completes, the set `st` will contain the values `arr[i] + i + 1` for each index `i` from 0 to `n-1`. This means that for each element in the array `arr`, the corresponding value `arr[i] + i + 1` has been added to the set `st`.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, the loop variable `i` will be equal to `n-1`, which is the last index of the array `arr`.

This output state reflects the final state of the variables after the loop has executed all its iterations.
