The function `func_1` is described with certain parameter constraints but lacks explicit parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided constraints, we can infer that the function likely processes multiple test cases, each involving an array of integers. Here's the inferred functionality:

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) representing the length of an array `a`, which contains `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The function returns results for each test case, considering the constraints that the number of test cases `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**
