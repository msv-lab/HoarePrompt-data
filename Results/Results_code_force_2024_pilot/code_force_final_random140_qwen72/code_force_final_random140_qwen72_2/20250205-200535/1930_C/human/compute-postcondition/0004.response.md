The code adds the value of `arr[i] + i + 1` to the set `st`. Given the initial state, `i` is 0, so the value added to `st` is `arr[0] + 0 + 1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `arr` is a list of integers read from input, `st` contains the value `arr[0] + 1`, `i` is 0**.
