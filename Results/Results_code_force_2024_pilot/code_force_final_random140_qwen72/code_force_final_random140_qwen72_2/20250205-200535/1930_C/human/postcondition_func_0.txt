The function reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers from the input. It then computes a set `st` containing the values `arr[i] + i + 1` for each index `i` from 0 to `n-1`. Finally, it prints the elements of `st` sorted in descending order. The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and a list of integers, and prints the results for each test case.
