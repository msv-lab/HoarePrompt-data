Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to perform a series of operations on an array `a` and construct a set `S` by inserting values `a[i] + i + 1` into the set. After `n` operations, the array `a` will be empty. We then need to construct an array `b` from the set `S` sorted in decreasing order and output the lexicographically largest possible `b`.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `arr`.
   - It initializes an empty set `st`.
   - It iterates over the array `arr` and inserts `arr[i] + i + 1` into the set `st`.
   - Finally, it prints the elements of the set `st` sorted in decreasing order.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Set Operations**: The program correctly uses a set to ensure that only unique elements are stored. This aligns with the problem's requirement that `S` is a set and not a multiset.
   - **Insertion Logic**: The insertion logic `st.add(arr[i] + i + 1)` is correct. It adds the value `arr[i] + i + 1` to the set, which is the required operation according to the problem statement.
   - **Sorting and Output**: The program sorts the set in decreasing order and prints the elements. This is correct because the problem requires the elements of `S` to be sorted in decreasing order to form the array `b`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the constraints well, including the maximum values for `n` and the elements of `arr`.
   - The program correctly processes multiple test cases as specified in the input format.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the required logic and handle the problem constraints.

Correctness: **True**
