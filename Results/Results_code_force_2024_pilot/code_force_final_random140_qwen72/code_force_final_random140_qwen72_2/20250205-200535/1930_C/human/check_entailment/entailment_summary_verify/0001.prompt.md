You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Stack has an array a of length n . He also has an empty set S . Note that S is
not a multiset.

He will do the following three-step operation exactly n times:

  1. Select an index i such that 1 \leq i \leq |a| . 
  2. Insert^\dagger a_i + i into S . 
  3. Delete a_i from a . Note that the indices of all elements to the right of a_i will decrease by 1 . 

Note that after n operations, a will be empty.

Stack will now construct a new array b which is S sorted in decreasing order.
Formally, b is an array of size |S| where b_i is the i -th largest element of
S for all 1 \leq i \leq |S| .

Find the lexicographically largest^\ddagger b that Stack can make.

^\dagger A set can only contain unique elements. Inserting an element that is
already present in a set will not change the elements of the set.

^\ddagger An array p is lexicographically larger than a sequence q if and only
if one of the following holds:

  * q is a prefix of p , but p \ne q ; or 
  * in the first position where p and q differ, the array p has a larger element than the corresponding element in q . 

Note that [3,1,4,1,5] is lexicographically larger than [3,1,3] , [\,] , and
[3,1,4,1] but not [3,1,4,1,5,9] , [3,1,4,1,5] , and [4] .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 3
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{n} (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of array a .

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically largest b .

    2 1
    
    5
    
    1 100 1000 1000000 1000000000
    
    3
    
    6 4 8

Output

    3 2 
    1000000005 1000004 1003 102 2 
    11 7 6 
    
Note

In the first test case, select i=1 in the first operation, insert a_1 + 1 = 3
in S , and delete a_1 from a . After the first operation, a becomes a=[1] . In
the second operation, we select i=1 again and insert a_1 + 1 = 2 in S . Thus
S=\\{2, 3\\} , and b = [3, 2] .

Note that if you select i=2 in the first operation, and i=1 in the second
operation, S=\\{3\\} as 3 will be inserted twice, resulting in b=[3] .

As [3,2] is lexicographically larger than [3] , we should select i=1 in the
first operation.

In the second test case, in each operation, select the last element.

- Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1() -> None:
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    st = set()
    for i in range(n):
        st.add(arr[i] + i + 1)
    print(*sorted(st, reverse=True))



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers from the input. It then computes a set `st` containing the values `arr[i] + i + 1` for each index `i` from 0 to `n-1`. Finally, it prints the elements of `st` sorted in descending order. The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and a list of integers, and prints the results for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to perform a series of operations on an array `a` and construct a set `S` by inserting values `a[i] + i + 1` into the set. After `n` operations, the array `a` will be empty. We then need to construct an array `b` from the set `S` sorted in decreasing order and output the lexicographically largest possible `b`.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `arr`.
   - It initializes an empty set `st`.
   - It iterates over the array `arr` and inserts `arr[i] + i + 1` into the set `st`.
   - Finally, it prints the elements of the set `st` sorted in decreasing order.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Set Operations**: The program correctly uses a set to ensure that only unique elements are stored. This aligns with the problem's requirement that `S` is a set and not a multiset.
   - **Insertion Logic**: The insertion logic `st.add(arr[i] + i + 1)` is correct. It adds the value `arr[i] + i + 1` to the set, which is the required operation according to the problem statement.
   - **Sorting and Output**: The program sorts the set in decreasing order and prints the elements. This is correct because the problem requires the elements of `S` to be sorted in decreasing order to form the array `b`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the constraints well, including the maximum values for `n` and the elements of `arr`.
   - The program correctly processes multiple test cases as specified in the input format.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the required logic and handle the problem constraints.
