### Reasoning:

1. **Graph Construction**:
   - The function `func_1` constructs an adjacency list representation of the tree using the given edges. This is done correctly by iterating over the edges and appending each vertex to the adjacency list of the other vertex.
   - **Annotation Verification**: The state of the program after constructing the graph is accurately described. The adjacency list `g` is correctly built, and the variables `n`, `k`, and `edges` retain their initial values.

2. **Binary Search Initialization**:
   - The binary search is initialized with `l = 1` and `r = n // k + 1`. This is a reasonable initialization because the maximum possible value for `x` is `n // (k + 1)` since we need to ensure that after removing `k` edges, each component has at least `x` vertices.
   - **Annotation Verification**: The state of the program after initialization is correctly described. The variables `l` and `r` are set appropriately, and the other variables retain their initial values.

3. **Binary Search Execution**:
   - The binary search is performed to find the maximum `x` such that it is possible to remove exactly `k` edges and have each remaining component with at least `x` vertices. The midpoint `mid` is calculated correctly, and the `check` function is used to validate if `mid` is a valid candidate.
   - **Annotation Verification**: The state of the program during the binary search loop is accurately described. The variables `l`, `r`, and `mid` are updated correctly based on the result of the `check` function.

4. **DFS Function**:
   - The `dfs` function is used to traverse the tree and count the number of vertices in each subtree. It also counts the number of subtrees (`r`) that can be formed by removing edges.
   - The function correctly updates the `visited` set to avoid revisiting nodes.
   - The function returns a tuple `(c, r)` where `c` is the number of vertices in the current subtree and `r` is the number of subtrees that can be formed by removing edges.
   - **Annotation Verification**: The state of the program during the DFS traversal is accurately described. The variables `c` and `r` are updated correctly, and the `visited` set is managed properly.

5. **Check Function**:
   - The `check` function uses the `dfs` function to determine if it is possible to form at least `k` subtrees, each with at least `x` vertices.
   - It clears the `visited` set before starting the DFS to ensure a fresh traversal for each call.
   - The function returns `True` if the conditions are met, otherwise `False`.
   - **Annotation Verification**: The state of the program during the `check` function is accurately described. The `visited` set is cleared, and the `dfs` function is called correctly. The conditions for returning `True` or `False` are correctly implemented.

6. **Output**:
   - After the binary search completes, the function prints the maximum value of `x` found.
   - **Annotation Verification**: The state of the program after the binary search is accurately described. The variable `r` is the maximum value of `x` for which the conditions are met, and it is printed correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The graph construction, binary search, DFS, and validation checks are all implemented correctly.
