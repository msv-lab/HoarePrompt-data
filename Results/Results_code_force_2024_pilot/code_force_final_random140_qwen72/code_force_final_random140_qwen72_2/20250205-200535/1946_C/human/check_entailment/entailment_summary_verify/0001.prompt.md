You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a tree with n vertices.

Your task is to find the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove
exactly k edges from this tree in such a way that the size of each remaining
connected component^{\dagger} is at least x .

^{\dagger} Two vertices v and u are in the same connected component if there
exists a sequence of numbers t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k of arbitrary length k ,
such that t_1 = v , t_k = u , and for each i from 1 to k - 1 , vertices t_i
and t_{i+1} are connected by an edge.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of sets of input data. This
is followed by a description of the sets of input data.

The first line of each set of input data contains two integers n and k (1 \le
k < n \le 10^5 ) — the number of vertices in the tree and the number of edges
to be removed.

Each of the next n - 1 lines of each set of input data contains two integers v
and u (1 \le v, u \le n ) — the next edge of the tree.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all sets of input data
does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each set of input data, output a single line containing the maximum number
x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree in such a
way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x .

Note

The tree in the first set of input data:

After removing the edge 1 — 3 , the tree will look as follows:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/a59ae10eeac1212e1e56fc7fe5f6a47764269104.png)

The tree has split into two connected components. The first component consists
of two vertices: 1 and 2 . The second connected component consists of three
vertices: 3, 4 and 5 . In both connected components, there are at least two
vertices. It can be shown that the answer 3 is not achievable, so the answer
is 2 .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, k, edges):
    g = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for (a, b) in edges:
        g[a].append(b)
        g[b].append(a)
    c = 0
    visited = set()


    l = 1
    r = n // k + 1
    while l <= r:
        mid = l + (r - l) // 2
        if check(mid):
            l = mid + 1
        else:
            r = mid - 1
    print(r)

#Function 2:
def dfs(x, y):
    c = 1
    r = 0
    visited.add(x)
    for node in g[x]:
        if node not in visited:
            (ans, rn) = dfs(node, y)
            r += rn
            if ans >= y:
                r += 1
            else:
                c += ans
    return (c, r)

#Function 3:
def check(x):
    visited.clear()
    (ans, r) = dfs(1, x)
    if ans >= x and r >= k:
        return True
    return False



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function `check` takes a positive integer `x` as input, which represents the minimum size of connected components after removing `k` edges from a graph. It uses a depth-first search (DFS) to explore the graph and determine if there exists a connected component of size at least `x` after removing `k` edges. If such a component exists, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. After the function executes, the `visited` set is cleared, and the function has no side effects on other variables.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Graph Construction**: 
   - The function `func_1` constructs an adjacency list representation of the tree using the given edges. This is done correctly by iterating over the edges and appending each vertex to the adjacency list of the other vertex.

2. **Binary Search Initialization**:
   - The binary search is initialized with `l = 1` and `r = n // k + 1`. This is a reasonable initialization because the maximum possible value for `x` is `n // (k + 1)` since we need to ensure that after removing `k` edges, each component has at least `x` vertices.

3. **Binary Search Execution**:
   - The binary search is performed to find the maximum `x` such that it is possible to remove exactly `k` edges and have each remaining component with at least `x` vertices. The midpoint `mid` is calculated correctly, and the `check` function is used to validate if `mid` is a valid candidate.

4. **DFS Function**:
   - The `dfs` function is used to traverse the tree and count the number of vertices in each subtree. It also counts the number of subtrees (`r`) that can be formed by removing edges.
   - The function correctly updates the `visited` set to avoid revisiting nodes.
   - The function returns a tuple `(c, r)` where `c` is the number of vertices in the current subtree and `r` is the number of subtrees that can be formed by removing edges.

5. **Check Function**:
   - The `check` function uses the `dfs` function to determine if it is possible to form at least `k` subtrees, each with at least `x` vertices.
   - It clears the `visited` set before starting the DFS to ensure a fresh traversal for each call.
   - The function returns `True` if the conditions are met, otherwise `False`.

6. **Output**:
   - After the binary search completes, the function prints the maximum value of `x` found.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The graph construction, binary search, DFS, and validation checks are all implemented correctly.

### Correctness:
**True**
