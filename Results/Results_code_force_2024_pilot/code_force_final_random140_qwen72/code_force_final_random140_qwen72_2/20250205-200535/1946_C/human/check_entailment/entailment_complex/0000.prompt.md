Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given a tree with n vertices.

Your task is to find the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove
exactly k edges from this tree in such a way that the size of each remaining
connected component^{\dagger} is at least x .

^{\dagger} Two vertices v and u are in the same connected component if there
exists a sequence of numbers t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k of arbitrary length k ,
such that t_1 = v , t_k = u , and for each i from 1 to k - 1 , vertices t_i
and t_{i+1} are connected by an edge.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of sets of input data. This
is followed by a description of the sets of input data.

The first line of each set of input data contains two integers n and k (1 \le
k < n \le 10^5 ) — the number of vertices in the tree and the number of edges
to be removed.

Each of the next n - 1 lines of each set of input data contains two integers v
and u (1 \le v, u \le n ) — the next edge of the tree.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all sets of input data
does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each set of input data, output a single line containing the maximum number
x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree in such a
way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x .

Note

The tree in the first set of input data:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/799bacd3be0dda357800fdfc3eadbf38ab259c51.png)

After removing the edge 1 — 3 , the tree will look as follows:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/a59ae10eeac1212e1e56fc7fe5f6a47764269104.png)

The tree has split into two connected components. The first component consists
of two vertices: 1 and 2 . The second connected component consists of three
vertices: 3, 4 and 5 . In both connected components, there are at least two
vertices. It can be shown that the answer 3 is not achievable, so the answer
is 2 .

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n representing the number of edges to be removed, and edges is a list of tuples where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge between vertices a and b, with 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n.
def func_1(n, k, edges):
    g = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for (a, b) in edges:
        g[a].append(b)
        
        g[b].append(a)
        
    #State: `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n, `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge between vertices a and b, with 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n, `g` is a list of lists with length `n + 1`, and for each tuple (a, b) in `edges`, `g[a]` contains `b` and `g[b]` contains `a`.
    c = 0
    visited = set()
    l = 1
    r = n // k + 1
    while l <= r:
        mid = l + (r - l) // 2
        
        if check(mid):
            l = mid + 1
        else:
            r = mid - 1
        
    #State: `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n, `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge between vertices a and b, with 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n, `g` is a list of lists with length `n + 1`, and for each tuple (a, b) in `edges`, `g[a]` contains `b` and `g[b]` contains `a`, `c` is 0, `visited` is an empty set, `l` is the smallest value for which `check(l)` is `True`, and `r` is `l - 1`.
    print(r)
    #This is printed: r (where r is l - 1, and l is the smallest value for which check(l) is True)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n` (an integer representing the number of vertices in a tree), `k` (an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n, representing the number of edges to be removed), and `edges` (a list of tuples where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge between vertices a and b, with 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n). The function constructs an adjacency list representation of the tree and then uses a binary search to find the maximum number of connected components that can be formed by removing `k` edges. It prints the number of connected components minus one, which is the largest value for which the `check` function returns `False`. The function does not return any value.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are non-negative integers, where x represents a vertex in the graph g, and y is a threshold value for the size of the connected components. g is a dictionary representing the adjacency list of the tree, and visited is a set of vertices that have already been visited during the depth-first search.
def dfs(x, y):
    c = 1
    r = 0
    visited.add(x)
    for node in g[x]:
        if node not in visited:
            ans, rn = dfs(node, y)
            r += rn
            if ans >= y:
                r += 1
            else:
                c += ans
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `x` and `y` remain non-negative integers, `x` still represents a vertex in the graph `g`, `y` is still the threshold value for the size of the connected components, `g` is still the dictionary representing the adjacency list of the tree, and `visited` is a set of vertices that have been visited during the depth-first search, now including `x` and all nodes that were processed in the loop. The variable `c` will have been incremented by the sum of all `ans` values that were less than `y` for each unvisited node in `g[x]`. The variable `r` will have been incremented by the sum of all `rn` values returned by the `dfs` function calls, plus the number of times `ans` was greater than or equal to `y` for each unvisited node in `g[x]`.
    return c, r
    #The program returns two values: `c` and `r`. `c` is the sum of all `ans` values that were less than `y` for each unvisited node in `g[x]`. `r` is the sum of all `rn` values returned by the `dfs` function calls, plus the number of times `ans` was greater than or equal to `y` for each unvisited node in `g[x]`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `dfs` performs a depth-first search starting from vertex `x` in a graph represented by `g`. It accepts non-negative integers `x` and `y`, a dictionary `g` representing the adjacency list of the graph, and a set `visited` of vertices that have already been visited. The function updates the `visited` set to include all vertices visited during the search. It returns two values: `c` and `r`. `c` represents the total count of vertices in the connected component rooted at `x` that do not form a sub-component of size at least `y`. `r` represents the total count of sub-components of size at least `y` found within the connected component rooted at `x`.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a positive integer representing the minimum size of the connected components after removing k edges.
def check(x):
    visited.clear()
    ans, r = dfs(1, x)
    if (ans >= x and r >= k) :
        return True
        #The program returns True.
    #State: *`x` is a positive integer representing the minimum size of the connected components after removing k edges, `visited` is an empty set, `ans` and `r` are the values returned by the `dfs` function called with arguments 1 and `x`. Additionally, either `ans` is less than `x` or `r` is less than `k` (or both).
    return False
    #The program returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `check` takes a positive integer `x` as input, which represents the minimum size of connected components after removing `k` edges from a graph. It uses a depth-first search (DFS) to explore the graph and determine if there exists a connected component of size at least `x` after removing `k` edges. If such a component exists, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. After the function executes, the `visited` set is cleared, and the function has no side effects on other variables.
