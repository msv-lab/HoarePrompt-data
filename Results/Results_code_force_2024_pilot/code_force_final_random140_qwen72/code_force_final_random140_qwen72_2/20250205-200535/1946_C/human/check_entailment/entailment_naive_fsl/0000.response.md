Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program has a few issues that prevent it from being correct in every potential case:

1. **Variable Scope and Initialization**: The `g` and `visited` variables are used in multiple functions but are not properly initialized or scoped. Specifically, `g` is defined in `func_1` but used in `dfs` and `check` without being passed as a parameter. Similarly, `visited` is used in `dfs` and `check` but is not properly reset or passed between functions.

2. **Binary Search Logic**: The binary search logic in `func_1` is not correctly implemented. The `check` function is called within the binary search loop, but the `l` and `r` variables are not updated correctly. The condition `if check(mid):` should update `l` to `mid + 1` if the condition is true, but the current implementation updates `l` to `mid`, which can lead to incorrect results.

3. **DFS Function**: The `dfs` function is supposed to traverse the tree and count the number of nodes in each component. However, the logic for counting the number of components (`r`) and the total number of nodes in each component (`c`) is not clear and may not handle all edge cases correctly.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases well, such as when `k` is very close to `n` or when the tree is a star graph (one central node connected to all other nodes).

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
- Input: `n = 5`, `k = 2`, `edges = [(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5)]`
- Expected Output: `1`
- Actual Output: The program may not correctly handle this case due to the issues mentioned above.

These issues indicate that the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
