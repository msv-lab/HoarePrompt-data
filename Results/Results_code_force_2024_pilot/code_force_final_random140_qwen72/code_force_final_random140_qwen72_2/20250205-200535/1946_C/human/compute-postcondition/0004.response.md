Postcondition: ***`x` is a positive integer representing the minimum size of the connected components after removing k edges, `visited` is an empty set, `ans` and `r` are the values returned by the `dfs` function called with arguments 1 and `x`. Additionally, either `ans` is less than `x` or `r` is less than `k` (or both).***
