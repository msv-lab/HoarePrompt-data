You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: tree is a Tree object representing a tree structure with vertices and children, s is a non-negative integer representing the starting vertex, and x is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after edge removals.
def func_1(tree, s, x):
    stack = [(s, False)]
    good_components = {}
    remaining_size = {}
    while stack:
        v, postorder = stack.pop()
        
        if not postorder:
            stack.append((v, True))
            good_components[v] = 0
            remaining_size[v] = 1
            for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
                stack.append((u, False))
        elif postorder:
            for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
                good_components[v] += good_components[u]
                if remaining_size[u] >= x:
                    good_components[v] += 1
                else:
                    remaining_size[v] += remaining_size[u]
        
    #State: The loop has completed all iterations, and the following conditions hold:
    return good_components[s], remaining_size[s]
    #The program returns the value of `good_components[s]` and `remaining_size[s]`, where `s` is an index that was used during the loop iterations. `good_components[s]` represents the component that met certain criteria (assumed to be defined elsewhere in the code) at the index `s`, and `remaining_size[s]` represents the size left over after processing the component at the same index `s`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a Tree object `tree`, a non-negative integer `s`, and a positive integer `x`. It returns the value of `good_components[s]` and `remaining_size[s]`, where `good_components[s]` represents the component that met certain criteria at the index `s`, and `remaining_size[s]` represents the size left over after processing the component at the same index `s`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the value of `good_components[s]` and `remaining_size[s]`, where `s` is an index that was used during the loop iterations. `good_components[s]` represents the component that met certain criteria (assumed to be defined elsewhere in the code) at the index `s`, and `remaining_size[s]` represents the size left over after processing the component at the same index `s`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
