Postcondition: ***`tree` is a Tree object representing a tree structure with vertices and children, `s` is a non-negative integer representing the starting vertex, and `x` is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after edge removals. The variable `v` is the first element of the tuple that was popped from `stack`, and `postorder` is the second element of the tuple that was popped from `stack`. The `stack` is the list after popping the top element and must contain at least one element. The `good_components` dictionary has `v` as a key with a value of `0`, and the `remaining_size` dictionary has `v` as a key with a value of `1`. If `postorder` is false, `tree.vertices[v].children` is an empty list, and the `stack` now contains tuples `(u, False)` for each child `u` of the vertex `v`, and must contain at least one more element than it did initially (one for each child of `v`). If `postorder` is true, `tree.vertices[v].children` is an empty list, `good_components[v]` is the sum of `good_components[u]` for all children `u` of `v` plus the count of children `u` whose `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`, and `remaining_size[v]` is the sum of `remaining_size[u]` for all children `u` of `v` whose `remaining_size[u]` is less than `x`.***
