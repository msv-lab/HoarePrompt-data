Postcondition: ***`tree.vertices[v].children` contains at least three elements, and `u` is the third child in `tree.vertices[v].children`. `good_components[v]` is now equal to its original value plus `good_components[u]` from the previous iteration plus the current `good_components[u]`. If `remaining_size[u]` was greater than or equal to `x` in the previous iteration, `good_components[v]` is further incremented by 1. Otherwise, `remaining_size[v]` is updated to its original value plus the current `remaining_size[u]`.***
