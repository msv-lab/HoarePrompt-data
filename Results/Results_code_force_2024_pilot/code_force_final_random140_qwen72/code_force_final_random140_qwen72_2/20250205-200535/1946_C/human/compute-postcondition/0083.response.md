Output State: **The `tree` remains a Tree object representing a tree structure with vertices and children. The variable `s` is still a non-negative integer representing the starting vertex, and `x` is still a positive integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after edge removals. The variable `v` is the first element of the tuple that was popped from `stack`, and `postorder` is the second element of the tuple that was popped from `stack`. The `stack` now contains tuples `(u, False)` for each child `u` of the vertex `v`, and must contain at least one more element than it did initially (one for each child of `v`). The `good_components` dictionary still has `v` as a key with a value of `0`, and the `remaining_size` dictionary still has `v` as a key with a value of `1`. The `tree.vertices[v].children` list is now empty, indicating that all children of `v` have been processed.**
