Postcondition: ***`x` and `y` are non-negative integers, `x` represents a vertex in the graph `g`, `y` is a threshold value for the size of the connected components, `g` is a dictionary representing the adjacency list of the tree, `visited` is a set of vertices that have already been visited during the depth-first search, now including `x`, `g[x]` must contain at least one element. If `x` is not in the `visited` set, `ans` is the value returned by the `dfs` function, and `rn` is the value returned by the `dfs` function. If `ans` is greater than or equal to `y`, then `r` is updated to `rn + 1` and `c` remains 1. Otherwise, `r` remains `rn` and `c` is updated to `1 + ans`. If `x` is in the `visited` set, `r` and `c` remain unchanged.***
