The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `tree`, `s`, and `x`. `tree` is a Tree object representing a tree structure with vertices and children, `s` is a non-negative integer representing the starting vertex, and `x` is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after edge removals. The function returns two values: `good_components[s]` and `remaining_size[s]`. `good_components[s]` represents the component that met certain criteria at the index `s`, and `remaining_size[s]` represents the size left over after processing the component at the same index `s`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a Tree object `tree`, a non-negative integer `s`, and a positive integer `x`. It returns the value of `good_components[s]` and `remaining_size[s]`, where `good_components[s]` represents the component that met certain criteria at the index `s`, and `remaining_size[s]` represents the size left over after processing the component at the same index `s`.**
