To determine what will be printed by the `print(r)` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree.
   - `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n.
   - `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge between vertices a and b, with 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n.
   - `g` is a list of lists with length `n + 1`, and for each tuple (a, b) in `edges`, `g[a]` contains `b` and `g[b]` contains `a`.
   - `c` is 0.
   - `visited` is an empty set.
   - `l` is the smallest value for which `check(l)` is `True`.
   - `r` is `l - 1`.

2. **Variables Involved in the Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(r)`.
   - `r` is defined as `l - 1`, where `l` is the smallest value for which `check(l)` is `True`.

3. **Understanding `check(l)`:**
   - The function `check(l)` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is implied that `check(l)` returns `True` for the smallest value of `l` that satisfies some condition related to the tree structure and the edges.

4. **Determine `l` and `r`:**
   - `l` is the smallest value for which `check(l)` is `True`.
   - `r` is `l - 1`.

Since the exact implementation of `check(l)` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `l`. However, we know that `r` is one less than the smallest value of `l` for which `check(l)` is `True`.

Therefore, the output of the `print(r)` statement will be:

Output: **r (where r is l - 1, and l is the smallest value for which check(l) is True)**
