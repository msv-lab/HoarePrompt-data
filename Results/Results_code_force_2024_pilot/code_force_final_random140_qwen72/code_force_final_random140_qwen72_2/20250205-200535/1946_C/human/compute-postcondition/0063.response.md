Postcondition: ***`tree.vertices[v].children` contains at least two elements, `u` is the second child in `tree.vertices[v].children`, `good_components[v]` is now equal to its original value plus `good_components[u]`. If `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`, `good_components[v]` is further incremented by 1. Otherwise, `remaining_size[v]` is updated to its original value plus `remaining_size[u]`.***
