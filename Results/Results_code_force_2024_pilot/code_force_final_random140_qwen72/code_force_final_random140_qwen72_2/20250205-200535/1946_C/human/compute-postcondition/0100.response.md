Output State: **`tree.vertices[v].children` is a non-empty list, `u` is the next element in `tree.vertices[v].children`, `good_components[v]` is increased by `good_components[u] + 1`.** 

Explanation: The code `good_components[v] += 1` increments the value of `good_components[v]` by 1. Since the initial state specifies that `good_components[v]` was already increased by `good_components[u]`, the final value of `good_components[v]` is now `good_components[u] + 1` more than its original value. The other parts of the initial state remain unchanged.
