Output State: **`x` and `y` are non-negative integers, `x` represents a vertex in the graph `g`, `y` is a threshold value for the size of the connected components, `g` is a dictionary representing the adjacency list of the tree, `visited` is a set of vertices that have already been visited during the depth-first search, now including `x`, `g[x]` must contain at least one element, `node` is the next element in `g[x]`, `ans` and `rn` are the results returned from the `dfs` function called with arguments `node` and `y`, `r` is increased by 1.**
