The value of `good_components[v]` is incremented by the value of `good_components[u]`. Since `u` is the first child in `tree.vertices[v].children`, the specific value of `good_components[u]` is added to `good_components[v]`. The other parts of the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`tree.vertices[v].children` must contain at least one element, `u` is the first child in `tree.vertices[v].children`, `good_components[v]` is increased by `good_components[u]`.**
