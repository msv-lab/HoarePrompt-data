Postcondition: ***`tree` is a Tree object representing a tree structure with vertices and children, `s` is a non-negative integer representing the starting vertex, `x` is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after edge removals, `v` is equal to `s`, `postorder` is either `True` or `False`. If `postorder` is `False`, `stack` is a list containing the tuple `(v, True)` followed by tuples `(u, False)` for each child `u` of `v`, `good_components` is a dictionary with `v` as a key and `0` as its value, `remaining_size` is a dictionary with `v` as a key and `1` as its value. If `postorder` is `True`, `good_components[v]` is the sum of `good_components[u]` for all children `u` of `v` plus the number of children `u` whose `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`, and `remaining_size[v]` is the sum of `remaining_size[u]` for all children `u` of `v` whose `remaining_size[u]` is less than `x`.***
