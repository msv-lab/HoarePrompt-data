Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tree` is a Tree object representing a tree structure with vertices and children, `s` is a non-negative integer representing the starting vertex, `x` is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after edge removals, `v` is the first element of the tuple that was popped from `stack`, `postorder` is the second element of the tuple that was popped from `stack`, `stack` is the list after appending `(v, True)` and must contain at least one element, `good_components` is a dictionary with `v` as a key and `0` as its value, `remaining_size` is a dictionary with `v` as a key and `1` as its value.
Code of the loop:
for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
    stack.append((u, False))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `tree` is a Tree object representing a tree structure with vertices and children, `s` is a non-negative integer representing the starting vertex, `x` is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after edge removals, `v` is the first element of the tuple that was popped from `stack`, `postorder` is the second element of the tuple that was popped from `stack`, `stack` now contains the tuple `(u, False)` appended to it and must contain at least one element, `good_components` is a dictionary with `v` as a key and `0` as its value, `remaining_size` is a dictionary with `v` as a key and `1` as its value, `tree.vertices[v].children` must be a non-empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `tree` is a Tree object representing a tree structure with vertices and children, `s` is a non-negative integer representing the starting vertex, `x` is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after edge removals, `v` is the first element of the tuple that was popped from `stack`, `postorder` is the second element of the tuple that was popped from `stack`, `stack` now contains the tuple `(u, False)` appended to it and must contain at least two elements (the original tuple and the new one), `good_components` is a dictionary with `v` as a key and `0` as its value, `remaining_size` is a dictionary with `v` as a key and `1` as its value, `tree.vertices[v].children` must be a non-empty list, `u` is the next child in `tree.vertices[v].children`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `tree` is a Tree object representing a tree structure with vertices and children, `s` is a non-negative integer representing the starting vertex, `x` is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after edge removals, `v` is the first element of the tuple that was popped from `stack`, `postorder` is the second element of the tuple that was popped from `stack`, `stack` now contains the tuple `(u, False)` appended to it and must contain at least three elements (the original tuple, the new one, and the tuple `(u, False)` just added), `good_components` is a dictionary with `v` as a key and `0` as its value, `remaining_size` is a dictionary with `v` as a key and `1` as its value, `tree.vertices[v].children` must be a non-empty list with at least one element, `u` is the next child in `tree.vertices[v].children`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
