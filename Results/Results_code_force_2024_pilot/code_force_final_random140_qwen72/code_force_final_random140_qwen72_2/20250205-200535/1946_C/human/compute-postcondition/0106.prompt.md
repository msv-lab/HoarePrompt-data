Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: tree is a Tree object representing a tree structure with vertices and children, s is a non-negative integer representing the starting vertex, x is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after edge removals, stack is a list containing a single tuple (s, False), good_components is an empty dictionary, remaining_size is an empty dictionary.
Code of the loop:
while stack:
    v, postorder = stack.pop()
    if not postorder:
        stack.append((v, True))
        good_components[v] = 0
        remaining_size[v] = 1
        for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
            stack.append((u, False))
    elif postorder:
        for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
            good_components[v] += good_components[u]
            if remaining_size[u] >= x:
                good_components[v] += 1
            else:
                remaining_size[v] += remaining_size[u]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`tree` is a Tree object representing a tree structure with vertices and children, `s` is a non-negative integer representing the starting vertex, `x` is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after edge removals, `v` is equal to `s`, `postorder` is either `True` or `False`. If `postorder` is `False`, `stack` is a list containing the tuple `(v, True)` followed by tuples `(u, False)` for each child `u` of `v`, `good_components` is a dictionary with `v` as a key and `0` as its value, `remaining_size` is a dictionary with `v` as a key and `1` as its value. If `postorder` is `True`, `good_components[v]` is the sum of `good_components[u]` for all children `u` of `v` plus the number of children `u` whose `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`, and `remaining_size[v]` is the sum of `remaining_size[u]` for all children `u` of `v` whose `remaining_size[u]` is less than `x`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`tree` is a Tree object representing a tree structure with vertices and children, `s` is a non-negative integer representing the starting vertex, `x` is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after edge removals, `v` is the first element of the tuple popped from `stack`, `postorder` is the second element of the tuple popped from `stack`, `stack` is the list after popping the top element, `good_components` is a dictionary with `v` as a key and `0` as its value, `remaining_size` is a dictionary with `v` as a key and `1` as its value. If `postorder` is `False`, `v` has all its children processed, and `stack` contains tuples `(u, False)` for each child `u` of `v` in `tree.vertices[v].children` appended to its previous contents, while `good_components` and `remaining_size` remain unchanged, and `postorder` remains `True`. If `postorder` is `True`, `tree.vertices[v].children` will have been fully processed. For each child `u` in `tree.vertices[v].children`, `good_components[v]` will be increased by `good_components[u]`. Additionally, for each child `u` where `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`, `good_components[v]` will be further incremented by 1. For each child `u` where `remaining_size[u]` is less than `x`, `remaining_size[v]` will be increased by `remaining_size[u]`. The final values of `good_components[v]` and `remaining_size[v]` will reflect these updates based on all the children of `v`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`tree` is a Tree object representing a tree structure with vertices and children, `s` is a non-negative integer representing the starting vertex, and `x` is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after edge removals. The variable `v` is the first element of the tuple that was popped from `stack`, and `postorder` is the second element of the tuple that was popped from `stack`. The `stack` is the list after popping the top element and must contain at least one element. The `good_components` dictionary has `v` as a key with a value of `0`, and the `remaining_size` dictionary has `v` as a key with a value of `1`. If `postorder` is false, `tree.vertices[v].children` is an empty list, and the `stack` now contains tuples `(u, False)` for each child `u` of the vertex `v`, and must contain at least one more element than it did initially (one for each child of `v`). If `postorder` is true, `tree.vertices[v].children` is an empty list, `good_components[v]` is the sum of `good_components[u]` for all children `u` of `v` plus the count of children `u` whose `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`, and `remaining_size[v]` is the sum of `remaining_size[u]` for all children `u` of `v` whose `remaining_size[u]` is less than `x`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
