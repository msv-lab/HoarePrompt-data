The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `edges`. 

- `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree.
- `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n, representing the number of edges to be removed.
- `edges` is a list of tuples, where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge between vertices a and b, with 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n.

The function returns the number of connected components in the graph after removing `k` edges from the original tree.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer representing the number of vertices), `k` (an integer representing the number of edges to remove, where 1 ≤ k < n), and `edges` (a list of tuples representing the edges between vertices). It returns the number of connected components in the graph after removing `k` edges.**
