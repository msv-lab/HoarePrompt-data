Output State: **`tree.vertices[v].children` is a non-empty list, `good_components[v]` is incremented by `good_components[u]` + 1, and `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`.** 

Explanation: The value of `good_components[v]` is incremented by 1, in addition to the increment by `good_components[u]` already mentioned in the initial state. The other conditions remain unchanged.
