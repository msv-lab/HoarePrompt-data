Postcondition: ***`tree` is a Tree object, `s` is a non-negative integer, `x` is a positive integer, `v` is the first element of the tuple that was popped from `stack`, `postorder` is the second element of the tuple that was popped from `stack`, `stack` is the list after popping the top element and must contain at least one element, `good_components` is a dictionary with `v` as a key and `0` as its value, `remaining_size` is a dictionary with `v` as a key and `1` as its value, and `postorder` is true. If `postorder` is true, `tree.vertices[v].children` is an empty list, `good_components[v]` is the sum of `good_components[u]` for all children `u` of `v` plus the count of children `u` whose `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`, and `remaining_size[v]` is the sum of `remaining_size[u]` for all children `u` of `v` whose `remaining_size[u]` is less than `x`.***
