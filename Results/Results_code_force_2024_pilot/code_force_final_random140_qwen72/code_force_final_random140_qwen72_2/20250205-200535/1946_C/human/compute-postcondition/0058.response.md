Postcondition: ***`tree.vertices[v].children` contains at least one element, `u` is the first child in `tree.vertices[v].children`, and `good_components[v]` is increased by `good_components[u]`. If `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`, `good_components[v]` is further increased by 1. If `remaining_size[u]` is less than `x`, `remaining_size[v]` is increased by `remaining_size[u]`.***
