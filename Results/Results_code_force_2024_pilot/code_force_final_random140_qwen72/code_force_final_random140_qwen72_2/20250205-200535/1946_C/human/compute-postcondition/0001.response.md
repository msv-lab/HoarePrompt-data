Output State: **`x` is a positive integer representing the minimum size of the connected components after removing k edges, `visited` is an empty set, `ans` and `r` are the values returned by the `dfs` function called with arguments 1 and `x`.** 

Explanation: The `dfs` function is called with the arguments `1` and `x`. The function returns two values, which are assigned to `ans` and `r`. The values of `ans` and `r` depend on the implementation of the `dfs` function, which is not provided here. The `visited` set remains unchanged and is still an empty set. The value of `x` also remains unchanged.
