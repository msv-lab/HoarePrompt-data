    #This is printed: r (where r is l - 1, and l is the smallest value for which check(l) is True)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n` (an integer representing the number of vertices in a tree), `k` (an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n, representing the number of edges to be removed), and `edges` (a list of tuples where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge between vertices a and b, with 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n). The function constructs an adjacency list representation of the tree and then uses a binary search to find the maximum number of connected components that can be formed by removing `k` edges. It prints the number of connected components minus one, which is the largest value for which the `check` function returns `False`. The function does not return any value.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are non-negative integers, where x represents a vertex in the graph g, and y is a threshold value for the size of the connected components. g is a dictionary representing the adjacency list of the tree, and visited is a set of vertices that have already been visited during the depth-first search.

        if node not in visited:
            ans, rn = dfs(node, y)
            r += rn
            if ans >= y:
                r += 1
            else:
                c += ans
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `x` and `y` remain non-negative integers, `x` still represents a vertex in the graph `g`, `y` is still the threshold value for the size of the connected components, `g` is still the dictionary representing the adjacency list of the tree, and `visited` is a set of vertices that have been visited during the depth-first search, now including `x` and all nodes that were processed in the loop. The variable `c` will have been incremented by the sum of all `ans` values that were less than `y` for each unvisited node in `g[x]`. The variable `r` will have been incremented by the sum of all `rn` values returned by the `dfs` function calls, plus the number of times `ans` was greater than or equal to `y` for each unvisited node in `g[x]`.
    return c, r
    #The program returns two values: `c` and `r`. `c` is the sum of all `ans` values that were less than `y` for each unvisited node in `g[x]`. `r` is the sum of all `rn` values returned by the `dfs` function calls, plus the number of times `ans` was greater than or equal to `y` for each unvisited node in `g[x]`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `dfs` performs a depth-first search starting from vertex `x` in a graph represented by `g`. It accepts non-negative integers `x` and `y`, a dictionary `g` representing the adjacency list of the graph, and a set `visited` of vertices that have already been visited. The function updates the `visited` set to include all vertices visited during the search. It returns two values: `c` and `r`. `c` represents the total count of vertices in the connected component rooted at `x` that do not form a sub-component of size at least `y`. `r` represents the total count of sub-components of size at least `y` found within the connected component rooted at `x`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a positive integer representing the minimum size of the connected components after removing k edges.
def check(x):
    visited.clear()
    ans, r = dfs(1, x)
    if (ans >= x and r >= k) :
        return True
        #The program returns True.
    #State: *`x` is a positive integer representing the minimum size of the connected components after removing k edges, `visited` is an empty set, `ans` and `r` are the values returned by the `dfs` function called with arguments 1 and `x`. Additionally, either `ans` is less than `x` or `r` is less than `k` (or both).
    return False
    #The program returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `check` takes a positive integer `x` as input, which represents the minimum size of connected components after removing `k` edges from a graph. It uses a depth-first search (DFS) to explore the graph and determine if there exists a connected component of size at least `x` after removing `k` edges. If such a component exists, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. After the function executes, the `visited` set is cleared, and the function has no side effects on other variables.
