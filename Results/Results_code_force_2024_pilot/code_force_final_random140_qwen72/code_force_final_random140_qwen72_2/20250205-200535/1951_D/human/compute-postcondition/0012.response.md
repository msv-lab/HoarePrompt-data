Given the initial state:

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases.
- `n` and `k` are specific positive integers read from the input, where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18.
- `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `n` is not equal to `k`.
- The condition `(k - 1 < n - k + 1)` is true, meaning that `k - 1` is less than `n - k + 1`.

The print statement is:
```
print(n - k + 1, 1)
```

Let's break down the values being printed:

1. **`n - k + 1`**: This expression calculates the difference between `n` and `k`, adds 1 to the result. Given the condition `(k - 1 < n - k + 1)`, we know that `n - k + 1` is a positive integer and is greater than `k - 1`.

2. **`1`**: This is a constant integer value.

Therefore, the print statement will output the value of `n - k + 1` followed by the integer `1`.

Output: **(n - k + 1, 1) (where n - k + 1 is the result of the expression n - k + 1 and 1 is the constant integer value)**
