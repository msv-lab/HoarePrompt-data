Postcondition: **t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases. `n` and `k` are specific positive integers read from the input, where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, representing the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy, respectively. Additionally, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `n` is not equal to `k`. Furthermore, `k - 1` is greater than or equal to `n - k + 1`.**
