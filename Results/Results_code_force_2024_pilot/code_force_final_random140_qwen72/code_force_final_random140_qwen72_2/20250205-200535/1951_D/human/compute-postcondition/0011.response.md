The given Python code snippet is:

```python
print(2)
```

This code simply prints the integer `2`. The initial state provides context about variables such as `t`, `n`, and `k`, but these variables do not influence the execution of the `print` statement. The `print` statement is independent of the initial state and will always print the integer `2`.

Output: **2**
