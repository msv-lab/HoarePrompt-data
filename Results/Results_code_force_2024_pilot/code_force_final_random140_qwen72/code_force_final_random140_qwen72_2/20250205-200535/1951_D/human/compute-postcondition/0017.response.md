Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases. `n` and `k` are specific positive integers read from the input, where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, representing the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy, respectively. If `n` is less than `k`, the condition holds as is. Otherwise, if `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, the condition holds as is. Additionally, if `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `k - 1` is less than `n - k + 1`, the condition `(k - 1 < n - k + 1)` is true. If `k - 1` is greater than or equal to `n - k + 1`, the condition `(k - 1 >= n - k + 1)` is true.***
