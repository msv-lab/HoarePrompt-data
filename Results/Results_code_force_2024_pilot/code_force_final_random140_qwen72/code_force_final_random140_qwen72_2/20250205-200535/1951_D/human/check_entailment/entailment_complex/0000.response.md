Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem of determining whether Bob can set up his store in such a way that Alice buys exactly \( k \) jewels with \( n \) coins. The logic in the program is as follows:

1. **Initial Check**: If \( n < k \), it's impossible for Alice to buy \( k \) jewels because she doesn't have enough coins. The program correctly prints "NO" in this case.

2. **Exact Match**: If \( n == k \), Alice can buy exactly \( k \) jewels by setting up a single stall with a price of 1 coin per jewel. The program correctly prints "YES" followed by 1 and 1, which is a valid solution.

3. **General Case**: If \( n > k \), the program checks if \( k - 1 < n - k + 1 \). This condition ensures that Bob can set up two stalls such that Alice buys \( k \) jewels:
   - The first stall has a price of \( n - k + 1 \) coins per jewel, allowing Alice to buy exactly one jewel.
   - The second stall has a price of 1 coin per jewel, allowing Alice to buy the remaining \( k - 1 \) jewels.

   If \( k - 1 \geq n - k + 1 \), it means that Alice cannot buy \( k \) jewels with the given constraints, and the program correctly prints "NO".

Let's verify the correctness of the logic with the provided examples:

- **Example 1**: \( n = 7 \), \( k = 3 \)
  - \( n > k \)
  - \( k - 1 = 2 \)
  - \( n - k + 1 = 5 \)
  - Since \( 2 < 5 \), the program prints "YES", 2, and "5 1". This is correct because Alice buys 1 jewel from the first stall (spending 5 coins) and 2 jewels from the second stall (spending 2 coins).

- **Example 2**: \( n = 6 \), \( k = 4 \)
  - \( n < k \)
  - The program prints "NO". This is correct because Alice cannot buy 4 jewels with only 6 coins.

- **Example 3**: \( n = 255 \), \( k = 8 \)
  - \( n > k \)
  - \( k - 1 = 7 \)
  - \( n - k + 1 = 248 \)
  - Since \( 7 < 248 \), the program prints "YES", 2, and "248 1". This is correct because Alice buys 1 jewel from the first stall (spending 248 coins) and 7 jewels from the second stall (spending 7 coins).

The program handles all the cases correctly and provides valid solutions where possible. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
