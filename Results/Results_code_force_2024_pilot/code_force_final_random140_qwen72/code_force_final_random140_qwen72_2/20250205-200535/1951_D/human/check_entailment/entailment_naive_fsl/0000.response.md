Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program fails to provide a valid solution when `n` is much larger than `k` and `k` is greater than 1. For example, consider the input `n = 1000` and `k = 3`. According to the problem description, Bob should be able to set up stalls such that Alice buys exactly 3 jewels. However, the program incorrectly prints "NO" for this case.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the issue:

- When `n = 1000` and `k = 3`, the program checks the following conditions:
  - `n < k`: This is false (`1000 < 3` is false).
  - `n == k`: This is false (`1000 == 3` is false).
  - `k - 1 < n - k + 1`: This is true (`2 < 998` is true).

Since the condition `k - 1 < n - k + 1` is true, the program prints "YES" and sets up 2 stalls with prices `n - k + 1` and `1`. This means the stalls will have prices `998` and `1`.

- At the first stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with `1000 - 998 = 2` coins.
- At the second stall, Alice buys 2 jewels and is left with `2 - 2 = 0` coins.

However, this setup only allows Alice to buy 3 jewels, but the problem requires that Alice buys exactly 3 jewels. The program should be able to handle this case by setting up more stalls with appropriate prices to ensure Alice buys exactly 3 jewels. For example, setting up 3 stalls with prices `334`, `333`, and `333` would allow Alice to buy exactly 3 jewels.

Thus, the program is incorrect because it does not handle all potential cases correctly.
