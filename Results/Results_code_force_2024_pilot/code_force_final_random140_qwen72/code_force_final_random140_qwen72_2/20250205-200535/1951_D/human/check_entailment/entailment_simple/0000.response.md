Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem of setting up stalls with specific prices so that Alice buys exactly \( k \) jewels using her \( n \) coins. Let's break down the logic and check if it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then processes each test case individually by calling `func_1()`.

2. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - It reads \( n \) and \( k \) from the input.
   - **Case 1: \( n < k \)**:
     - If Alice has fewer coins than the number of jewels Bob wants her to buy, it's impossible to fulfill the requirement. The program correctly prints "NO".
   - **Case 2: \( n == k \)**:
     - If Alice has exactly \( k \) coins, she can buy \( k \) jewels by setting up one stall with a price of 1 coin per jewel. The program correctly prints "YES", followed by 1 and 1.
   - **Case 3: \( n > k \)**:
     - The program checks if \( k - 1 < n - k + 1 \).
       - If true, it sets up two stalls: one with a price of \( n - k + 1 \) coins and another with a price of 1 coin. This ensures Alice buys \( k - 1 \) jewels from the first stall and 1 jewel from the second stall, totaling \( k \) jewels. The program correctly prints "YES", followed by 2 and the prices \( n - k + 1 \) and 1.
       - If false, it prints "NO". This condition means \( k - 1 \geq n - k + 1 \), which implies that it's not possible to set up stalls such that Alice buys exactly \( k \) jewels without exceeding the constraints.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where \( n == k \) correctly.
   - It also handles the case where \( n < k \) correctly.
   - For \( n > k \), the logic ensures that the number of stalls is at most 2, which is within the limit of 60 stalls.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The program adheres to the required output format for both "YES" and "NO" cases.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly handle all the specified conditions and constraints.

Correctness: **True**
