The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` being less than `p`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `p` is an input integer and must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 1, and `p` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `p` is an input integer and must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `S` is the integer value of the third element in the input split by spaces, `i` is 1, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `den` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `2 * C * C // g` under modulo `MOD`, `g` is the GCD of `num` and `2 * C * C`, `num` is `(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S) // g`, `ans` is `num * den % MOD`**
