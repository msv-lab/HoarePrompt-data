The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `p`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` being less than `p`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `p` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1 to 2, and `p` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`T` is greater than 0 but will be `T - 1` at the start of the next iteration, `n` is an input integer, `p` must be greater than 2, `k` is an input integer, `S` is the integer value of the third element of the input line plus the integer value of the third element of the new input line, `i` is 2, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `den` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `2 * C * C // g` modulo `MOD`, `g` is the GCD of `num` and `2 * C * C`, `num` is `num // g`, `ans` is `num * den % MOD`.**
