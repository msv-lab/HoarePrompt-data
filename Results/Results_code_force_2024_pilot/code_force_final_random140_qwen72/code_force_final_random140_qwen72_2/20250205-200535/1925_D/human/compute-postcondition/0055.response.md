The code snippet `num = num // g` performs integer division of `num` by `g` and assigns the result back to `num`. This operation updates the value of `num` to the quotient of `num` divided by `g`.

Given the initial state:
- `T` is `T - 1`
- `n` is an input integer
- `p` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 0
- `k` is an input integer
- `S` is the sum of the integer values of the third elements in all `p` inputs
- `i` is `p - 1`
- `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`
- `den` is `2 * C * C`
- `g` is the GCD of `num` and `den`
- `num` is `p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S`
- `ans` is `num * den % MOD`

After executing the code snippet `num = num // g`, the value of `num` is updated to the result of the integer division of `num` by `g`.

Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `p` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an input integer, `S` is the sum of the integer values of the third elements in all `p` inputs, `i` is `p - 1`, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `den` is `2 * C * C`, `g` is the GCD of `num` and `den`, `num` is `(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S) // g`, `ans` is `num * den % MOD`.**
