The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `p`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` being less than `p`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `p` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `p` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`T` is greater than 0, `n`, `p`, and `k` are input integers, `S` is the original `S` plus the integer value from the third part of the new input, `p` is greater than 1, `i` is 2**
