The code snippet `S += int(input().split()[2])` reads a line of input, splits it into parts, and adds the third part (converted to an integer) to the current value of `S`.

Given the initial state:
- `T` is `T - 1`
- `n` is an input integer
- `p` is an input integer and must be greater than 0
- `k` is an input integer
- `S` is 0
- `i` is 0
- `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`
- `den` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `2 * C * C // g` under modulo `MOD`
- `g` is the GCD of `num` and `2 * C * C`
- `num` is `(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S) // g`
- `ans` is `num * den % MOD`

After executing the code snippet:
- `S` is updated to `S + int(input().split()[2])`. Since `S` was initially 0, the new value of `S` will be the integer value of the third element in the input split by spaces.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `p` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `S` is the integer value of the third element in the input split by spaces, `i` is 0, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `den` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `2 * C * C // g` under modulo `MOD`, `g` is the GCD of `num` and `2 * C * C`, `num` is `(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S) // g`, `ans` is `num * den % MOD`**
