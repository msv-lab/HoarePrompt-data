The code snippet `S += int(input().split()[2])` reads a new input line, splits it into parts, and adds the integer value of the third part to the current value of `S`.

Given the initial state:
- `T` is greater than 0 but will be `T - 1` at the start of the next iteration.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `p` must be greater than 2.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `S` is the integer value of the third element of the input line plus the integer value of the third element of the new input line.
- `i` is 2.
- `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`.
- `den` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `2 * C * C // g` modulo `MOD`.
- `g` is the GCD of `num` and `2 * C * C`.
- `num` is `num // g`.
- `ans` is `num * den % MOD`.

After executing the code snippet:
- `S` is updated to its current value plus the integer value of the third element of the new input line.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`T` is greater than 0 but will be `T - 1` at the start of the next iteration, `n` is an input integer, `p` must be greater than 2, `k` is an input integer, `S` is the integer value of the third element of the input line plus the integer value of the third element of the new input line plus the integer value of the third element of another new input line, `i` is 2, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `den` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `2 * C * C // g` modulo `MOD`, `g` is the GCD of `num` and `2 * C * C`, `num` is `num // g`, `ans` is `num * den % MOD`.**
