The code snippet `den = pow(den, -1, MOD)` computes the modular multiplicative inverse of `den` modulo `MOD`. This means that `den` is updated to the value that, when multiplied by the original `den`, gives a result of 1 modulo `MOD`.

Let's break down the impact of this code:

- The value of `den` is updated to its modular multiplicative inverse modulo `MOD`.
- All other variables (`T`, `n`, `p`, `k`, `S`, `i`, `C`, `g`, `num`, `ans`) remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `T` is `T - 1`
- `n` is an input integer
- `p` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 0
- `k` is an input integer
- `S` is the sum of the integer values of the third elements in all `p` inputs
- `i` is `p - 1`
- `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`
- `den` is `2 * C * C // g`
- `g` is the GCD of `num` and `den`
- `num` is `(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S) // g`
- `ans` is `num * den % MOD`

After executing the code snippet, the output state is:
- `T` is `T - 1`
- `n` is an input integer
- `p` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 0
- `k` is an input integer
- `S` is the sum of the integer values of the third elements in all `p` inputs
- `i` is `p - 1`
- `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`
- `den` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `2 * C * C // g` modulo `MOD`
- `g` is the GCD of `num` and `den`
- `num` is `(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S) // g`
- `ans` is `num * den % MOD`

Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `p` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an input integer, `S` is the sum of the integer values of the third elements in all `p` inputs, `i` is `p - 1`, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `den` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `2 * C * C // g` modulo `MOD`, `g` is the GCD of `num` and `den`, `num` is `(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S) // g`, `ans` is `num * den % MOD`.**
