Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `n`, `p`, and `k` are input integers, `S` is the sum of the integer values from the third part of the inputs provided during each iteration of the loop, `p` is the same as the initial `p`, `i` is `p-1`, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `C` is calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2`, which is the number of ways to choose 2 items from `n` items without regard to order.
- All other variables (`T`, `n`, `p`, `k`, `S`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
