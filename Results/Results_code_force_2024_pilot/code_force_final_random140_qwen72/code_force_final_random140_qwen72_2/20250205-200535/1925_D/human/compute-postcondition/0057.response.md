Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `p` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an input integer, `S` is the sum of the integer values of the third elements in all `p` inputs, `i` is `p - 1`, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `den` is `2 * C * C // g`, `g` is the GCD of `num` and `den`, `num` is `(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S) // g`, `ans` is `num * den % MOD`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `den` is updated to `den // g`, which means `den` is now the result of dividing the original `den` by `g`.
- All other variables (`T`, `n`, `p`, `k`, `S`, `i`, `C`, `g`, `num`, `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
