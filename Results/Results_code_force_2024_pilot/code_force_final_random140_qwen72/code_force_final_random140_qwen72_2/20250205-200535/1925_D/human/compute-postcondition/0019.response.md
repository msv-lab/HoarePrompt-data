The code snippet `ans = num * den % MOD` calculates the value of `ans` based on the values of `num`, `den`, and `MOD`. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `T` is greater than 0.
   - `n`, `p`, and `k` are input integers.
   - `S` is the sum of the integer values from the third part of the inputs provided during each iteration of the loop.
   - `p` is the same as the initial `p`.
   - `i` is `p-1`.
   - `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`.
   - `den` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `2 * C * C // g` modulo `MOD`.
   - `g` is the GCD of `num` and `2 * C * C`.
   - `num` is `num // g`.

2. **Impact of the Code**:
   - The variable `ans` is calculated as `num * den % MOD`.
   - The values of `num`, `den`, and `MOD` are used in this calculation.

3. **Calculation**:
   - `ans` is set to the result of `num * den % MOD`.

4. **Output State**:
   - All other variables (`T`, `n`, `p`, `k`, `S`, `i`, `C`, `den`, `g`, `num`) remain unchanged.
   - `ans` is now equal to `num * den % MOD`.

Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `n`, `p`, and `k` are input integers, `S` is the sum of the integer values from the third part of the inputs provided during each iteration of the loop, `p` is the same as the initial `p`, `i` is `p-1`, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `den` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `2 * C * C // g` modulo `MOD`, `g` is the GCD of `num` and `2 * C * C`, `num` is `num // g`, `ans` is `num * den % MOD`.**
