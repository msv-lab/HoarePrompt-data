The code snippet `num = num // g` performs integer division of `num` by `g` and assigns the result back to `num`. Let's analyze the impact of this operation:

- `num` was initially defined as `p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S`.
- `g` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `num` and `den`.
- After executing `num = num // g`, `num` is updated to the result of the integer division of the original `num` by `g`.

All other variables (`T`, `n`, `p`, `k`, `S`, `i`, `C`, `den`, `ans`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`T` is `T - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `p` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an input integer, `S` is the sum of the integer values of the third elements in all `p` inputs, `i` is `p - 1`, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `den` is `2 * C * C`, `g` is the GCD of `num` and `den`, `num` is `(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S) // g`, `ans` is `num * den % MOD`.**
