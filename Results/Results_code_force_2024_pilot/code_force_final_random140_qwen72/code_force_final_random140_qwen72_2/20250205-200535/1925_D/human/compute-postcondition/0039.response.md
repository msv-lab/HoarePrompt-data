To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the calculations involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `T` is greater than 0 but will be `T - 1` at the start of the next iteration.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `p` is an input integer.
   - `k` is an input integer.
   - `S` is the sum of the integer values of the third elements from `p` input lines.
   - `i` is `p - 1`.
   - `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`.
   - `den` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `2 * C * C // g` under modulo `MOD`.
   - `g` is the GCD of `num` and `2 * C * C`.
   - `num` is `(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S) // g`.
   - `ans` is `num * den % MOD`.

2. **Calculations:**
   - `C` is calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2`, which is the number of ways to choose 2 items from `n` items.
   - `S` is the sum of the third elements from `p` input lines.
   - `num` is calculated as `(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S) // g`, where `g` is the GCD of `num` and `2 * C * C`.
   - `den` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `2 * C * C // g` under modulo `MOD`.
   - `ans` is the result of `num * den % MOD`.

3. **Output:**
   - The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is the result of the modular arithmetic operation `num * den % MOD`.

Given the complexity of the calculations and the dependencies on the input values (`n`, `p`, `k`, and the third elements from `p` input lines), the exact numerical value of `ans` cannot be determined without specific input values. However, the structure of the problem and the calculations ensure that `ans` will be a valid integer result of the modular arithmetic operation.

Output: **ans (where ans is the result of the modular arithmetic operation num * den % MOD, with num and den calculated as described in the initial state)**
