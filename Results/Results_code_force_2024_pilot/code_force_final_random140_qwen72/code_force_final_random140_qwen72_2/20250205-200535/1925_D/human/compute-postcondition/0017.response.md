The value of `den` is updated to `den // g`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `n`, `p`, and `k` are input integers, `S` is the sum of the integer values from the third part of the inputs provided during each iteration of the loop, `p` is the same as the initial `p`, `i` is `p-1`, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `den` is `2 * C * C // g`, `g` is the GCD of `num` and `2 * C * C`, `num` is `num // g`.**
