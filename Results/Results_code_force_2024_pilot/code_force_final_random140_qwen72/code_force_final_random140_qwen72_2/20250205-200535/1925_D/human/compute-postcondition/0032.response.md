Output State: **`T` is greater than 0 but will be `T - 1` at the start of the next iteration, `n` is an input integer, `p` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `S` is the sum of the integer values of the third elements from `p` input lines, `i` is `p-1`, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `den` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `2 * C * C // g` modulo `MOD`, `g` is the GCD of `num` and `2 * C * C`, `num` is `p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S`, `ans` is `num * den % MOD`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `num` is updated to `p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S`.
- All other variables (`T`, `n`, `p`, `k`, `S`, `i`, `C`, `den`, `g`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.
- The new value of `num` is used in the calculation of `ans` as `num * den % MOD`.
