The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. It accepts several parameters for each test case:

- `t`: An integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4.
- For each test case:
  - `n`: An integer representing the number of nodes, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.
  - `m`: An integer representing the number of edges, where 0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2).
  - `k`: An integer representing a specific condition or query, where 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^5.
  - `edges`: A list of m tuples, each containing three integers (a_i, b_i, f_i) where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, a_i ≠ b_i, and 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9.

The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case. The exact nature of the result is not specified in the constraints, but it is implied that the function performs some computation based on the graph defined by `n`, `m`, and the `edges`, and the condition `k`.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each defined by the number of nodes `n`, the number of edges `m`, a condition `k`, and a list of edges. It processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case.**
