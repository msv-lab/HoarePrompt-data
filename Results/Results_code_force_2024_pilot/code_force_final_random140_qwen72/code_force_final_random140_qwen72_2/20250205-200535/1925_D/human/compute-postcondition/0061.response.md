Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `T` is 0, `n`, `p`, and `k` are the input integers for the last iteration, `S` is the sum of the integer values of the third elements from the `p` input lines for the last iteration, `i` is `p-1`, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2` for the last iteration, `den` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `2 * C * C // g` modulo `MOD` for the last iteration, `g` is the GCD of `num` and `2 * C * C` for the last iteration, `num` is `(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S) // g` for the last iteration, `ans` is `num * den % MOD` for the last iteration.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop runs `T` times, and after all iterations, `T` becomes 0.
- For the final iteration, `n`, `p`, and `k` are the input integers read during that iteration.
- `S` is the sum of the third elements from the `p` input lines read during the final iteration.
- `i` reaches `p-1` after the inner loop completes.
- `C` is calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2` using the `n` value from the final iteration.
- `den` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `2 * C * C // g` modulo `MOD`, where `g` is the greatest common divisor of `num` and `2 * C * C`.
- `num` is computed as `(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S) // g` using the values from the final iteration.
- `ans` is the result of `num * den % MOD` for the final iteration.
