The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `p`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `p`. If `i` is less than `p`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `p` must be greater than 0. At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 1, and for the loop to execute again, `p` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`T` is greater than 0 but will be `T - 1` at the start of the next iteration, `n` is an input integer, `p` must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `S` is the integer value of the third element of the input line, `i` is 1, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `den` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `2 * C * C // g` modulo `MOD`, `g` is the GCD of `num` and `2 * C * C`, `num` is `num // g`, `ans` is `num * den % MOD`**
