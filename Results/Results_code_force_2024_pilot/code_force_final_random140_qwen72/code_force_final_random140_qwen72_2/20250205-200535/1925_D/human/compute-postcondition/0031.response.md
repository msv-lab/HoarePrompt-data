Output State: **`T` is greater than 0 but will be `T - 1` at the start of the next iteration, `n` is an input integer, `p` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `S` is the sum of the integer values of the third elements from `p` input lines, `i` is `p-1`, `C` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `den` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `2 * C * C // g` modulo `MOD`, `g` is the GCD of `num` and `2 * C * C`, `num` is `num // g`, `ans` is `num * den % MOD`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `C = n * (n - 1) // 2` recalculates the value of `C` based on the current value of `n`.
- Since `C` was already defined as `n * (n - 1) // 2` in the initial state, the value of `C` remains the same after the code execution.
- All other variables (`T`, `n`, `p`, `k`, `S`, `i`, `den`, `g`, `num`, `ans`) remain unchanged.
- Therefore, the output state reflects the same values for all variables, with `C` being explicitly stated as `n * (n - 1) // 2`.
