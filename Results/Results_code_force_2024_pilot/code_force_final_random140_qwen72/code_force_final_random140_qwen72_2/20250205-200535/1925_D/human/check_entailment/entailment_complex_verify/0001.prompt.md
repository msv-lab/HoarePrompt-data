You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n children in a class, m pairs among them are friends. The i -th
pair who are friends have a friendship value of f_i .

The teacher has to go for k excursions, and for each of the excursions she
chooses a pair of children randomly, equiprobably and independently. If a pair
of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1
for all subsequent excursions (the teacher can choose a pair of children more
than once). The friendship value of a pair who are not friends is considered 0
, and it does not change for subsequent excursions.

Find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen
for the excursions (at the time of being chosen). It can be shown that this
answer can always be expressed as a fraction \dfrac{p}{q} where p and q are
coprime integers. Calculate p\cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4 ). Description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n , m and k (2 \le n \le
10^5 , 0 \le m \le \min \Big(10^5 , \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \Big) , 1 \le k \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of children, pairs of friends and excursions
respectively.

The next m lines contain three integers each — a_i , b_i , f_i — the indices
of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value. (a_i \neq
b_i , 1 \le a_i,b_i \le n , 1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ). It is guaranteed that all
pairs of friends are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and sum m over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the answer to the problem.

Example

Input

    4
    
    100 0 24
    
    2 1 10
    
    1 2 1
    
    3 1 2
    
    2 1 1
    
    5 2 4
    
    1 2 25
    
    3 2 24

Output

    0
    55
    777777784
    40000020
    
Note

For the first test case, there are no pairs of friends, so the friendship
value of all pairs is 0 and stays 0 for subsequent rounds, hence the
friendship value for all excursions is 0 .

For the second test case, there is only one pair possible (1, 2) and its
friendship value is initially 1 , so each turn they are picked and their
friendship value increases by 1 . Therefore, the total sum is 1+2+3+\ldots+10
= 55 .

For the third test case, the final answer is \frac{7}{9} = 777\,777\,784\bmod
(10^9+7) .

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of nodes `n`, a parameter `p`, and a condition `k`. It then reads `p` lines of input, each containing three integers, and sums the third integer from each line. Using this sum and other derived values, it calculates a result based on a specific formula involving modular arithmetic and prints the result. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes its execution.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m` (number of pairs of friends), and `k` (number of excursions).

2. **Summing Friendship Values:**
   - The program initializes `S` to 0, which will store the sum of the initial friendship values of all pairs.
   - It then reads the `m` pairs and sums up their friendship values.

3. **Calculating Total Pairs:**
   - The program calculates the total number of possible pairs `C` using the combination formula \( C = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \).

4. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the numerator `num` and the denominator `den` for the expected value.
   - The numerator `num` is calculated as \( p \cdot k \cdot k - p \cdot k + 2 \cdot k \cdot C \cdot S \).
   - The denominator `den` is calculated as \( 2 \cdot C \cdot C \).

5. **Simplifying the Fraction:**
   - The program uses the greatest common divisor (GCD) to simplify the fraction.
   - It then computes the modular inverse of the simplified denominator using `pow(den, -1, MOD)`.

6. **Final Answer Calculation:**
   - The program multiplies the simplified numerator by the modular inverse of the simplified denominator and takes the result modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

### Analysis:
- The program follows the correct logic for calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values.
- The use of GCD to simplify the fraction and the modular inverse to handle division under modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) is appropriate.
- The program handles the input and output correctly for multiple test cases.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description and the steps taken to solve it.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
