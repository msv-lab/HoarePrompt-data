You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n children in a class, m pairs among them are friends. The i -th
pair who are friends have a friendship value of f_i .

The teacher has to go for k excursions, and for each of the excursions she
chooses a pair of children randomly, equiprobably and independently. If a pair
of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1
for all subsequent excursions (the teacher can choose a pair of children more
than once). The friendship value of a pair who are not friends is considered 0
, and it does not change for subsequent excursions.

Find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen
for the excursions (at the time of being chosen). It can be shown that this
answer can always be expressed as a fraction \dfrac{p}{q} where p and q are
coprime integers. Calculate p\cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4 ). Description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n , m and k (2 \le n \le
10^5 , 0 \le m \le \min \Big(10^5 , \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \Big) , 1 \le k \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of children, pairs of friends and excursions
respectively.

The next m lines contain three integers each — a_i , b_i , f_i — the indices
of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value. (a_i \neq
b_i , 1 \le a_i,b_i \le n , 1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ). It is guaranteed that all
pairs of friends are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and sum m over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the answer to the problem.

Example

Input

    4
    
    100 0 24
    
    2 1 10
    
    1 2 1
    
    3 1 2
    
    2 1 1
    
    5 2 4
    
    1 2 25
    
    3 2 24

Output

    0
    55
    777777784
    40000020
    
Note

For the first test case, there are no pairs of friends, so the friendship
value of all pairs is 0 and stays 0 for subsequent rounds, hence the
friendship value for all excursions is 0 .

For the second test case, there is only one pair possible (1, 2) and its
friendship value is initially 1 , so each turn they are picked and their
friendship value increases by 1 . Therefore, the total sum is 1+2+3+\ldots+10
= 55 .

For the third test case, the final answer is \frac{7}{9} = 777\,777\,784\bmod
(10^9+7) .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical error in how it calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values. Specifically, the formula used to calculate `num` and `den` is incorrect. The program incorrectly multiplies the number of pairs `C` and the sum of friendship values `S` in a way that does not align with the problem's requirements.

### Issue Explanation:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Expected Value:**
   - The program attempts to calculate the expected value using a formula that does not correctly account for the probability of selecting a friend pair and the subsequent increase in friendship value.
   - The correct approach involves calculating the expected increase in friendship value for each excursion and summing these expected values over all excursions.

2. **Incorrect Formula:**
   - The formula used in the program:
     ```python
     num = p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S
     den = 2 * C * C
     ```
   - This formula does not correctly represent the expected value calculation. The expected value should be calculated based on the probability of selecting a friend pair and the initial friendship values.

### Correct Approach:
- For each excursion, the expected increase in the sum of friendship values is the sum of the initial friendship values of all friend pairs divided by the total number of possible pairs, plus the number of friend pairs (since each friend pair's value increases by 1 if selected).
- The expected value for `k` excursions can be calculated as:
  ```python
  expected_value = (S + p) * k / C
  ```
- This needs to be adjusted for modular arithmetic to handle large numbers and ensure the result is within the required modulo.

### Example Case:
- Consider the input:
  ```
  1
  3 1 2
  1 2 1
  ```
  - Here, `n = 3`, `m = 1`, `k = 2`, and the only friend pair is `(1, 2)` with an initial friendship value of `1`.
  - The total number of possible pairs `C` is `3 * (3 - 1) // 2 = 3`.
  - The expected value for each excursion is `(1 + 1) / 3 = 2 / 3`.
  - Over 2 excursions, the expected value is `2 * (2 / 3) = 4 / 3`.
  - The program's current formula does not correctly compute this expected value.

Therefore, the program is incorrect due to the flawed formula used to calculate the expected value.
