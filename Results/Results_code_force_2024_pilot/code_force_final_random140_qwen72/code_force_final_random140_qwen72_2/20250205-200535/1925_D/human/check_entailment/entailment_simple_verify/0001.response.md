### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m` (number of pairs of friends), and `k` (number of excursions).

2. **Summing Friendship Values:**
   - The program initializes `S` to 0, which will store the sum of the initial friendship values of all pairs.
   - It then reads the `m` pairs and sums up their friendship values. This is done correctly.

3. **Calculating Total Pairs:**
   - The program calculates the total number of possible pairs `C` using the combination formula \( C = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \). This is correct.

4. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the numerator `num` and the denominator `den` for the expected value.
   - The numerator `num` is calculated as \( p \cdot k \cdot k - p \cdot k + 2 \cdot k \cdot C \cdot S \).
     - This formula seems to be derived from the expected value calculation, but let's verify it step-by-step:
       - The term \( p \cdot k \cdot k \) represents the contribution of the initial friendship values increasing over `k` excursions.
       - The term \( - p \cdot k \) adjusts for the initial values.
       - The term \( 2 \cdot k \cdot C \cdot S \) accounts for the total possible pairs and their initial friendship values.
   - The denominator `den` is calculated as \( 2 \cdot C \cdot C \).
     - This is the total number of possible pairs squared, which is used to normalize the expected value.

5. **Simplifying the Fraction:**
   - The program uses the greatest common divisor (GCD) to simplify the fraction.
   - It then computes the modular inverse of the simplified denominator using `pow(den, -1, MOD)`.

6. **Final Answer Calculation:**
   - The program multiplies the simplified numerator by the modular inverse of the simplified denominator and takes the result modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

### Verification of the Formula:
- The formula for the expected value of the sum of friendship values is derived from the problem statement. Let's break it down:
  - Each pair of friends has a probability of being chosen in any excursion, which is \( \frac{1}{C} \).
  - If a pair is chosen, its friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.
  - The expected increase in the friendship value for a single pair over `k` excursions is \( \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{C} \).
  - Summing this over all pairs gives the total expected increase.
  - The initial friendship values also contribute to the total expected value.

### Correctness of the Formula:
- The formula \( p \cdot k \cdot k - p \cdot k + 2 \cdot k \cdot C \cdot S \) needs to be verified:
  - The term \( p \cdot k \cdot k \) should be \( p \cdot \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \) to account for the sum of the first `k` natural numbers.
  - The term \( - p \cdot k \) is correct as it adjusts for the initial values.
  - The term \( 2 \cdot k \cdot C \cdot S \) is correct as it accounts for the total possible pairs and their initial friendship values.

### Conclusion:
- The original assessment is mostly correct, but the formula for the numerator needs to be adjusted to \( p \cdot \frac{k(k+1)}{2} - p \cdot k + 2 \cdot k \cdot C \cdot S \).

### Final Answer:
- The program is incorrect due to the incorrect formula for the numerator.
- Final: **False**
