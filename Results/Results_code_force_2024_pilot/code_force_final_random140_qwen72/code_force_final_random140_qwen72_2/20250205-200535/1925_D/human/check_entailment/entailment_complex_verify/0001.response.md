### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m` (number of pairs of friends), and `k` (number of excursions).

2. **Summing Friendship Values:**
   - The program initializes `S` to 0, which will store the sum of the initial friendship values of all pairs.
   - It then reads the `m` pairs and sums up their friendship values. This is done correctly with the loop:
     ```python
     for i in range(p):
         S += int(input().split()[2])
     ```

3. **Calculating Total Pairs:**
   - The program calculates the total number of possible pairs `C` using the combination formula \( C = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \). This is correct:
     ```python
     C = n * (n - 1) // 2
     ```

4. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the numerator `num` and the denominator `den` for the expected value.
   - The numerator `num` is calculated as \( p \cdot k \cdot k - p \cdot k + 2 \cdot k \cdot C \cdot S \). This formula seems to be derived from the problem statement, but let's verify it:
     - The term \( p \cdot k \cdot k \) represents the contribution of the pairs being chosen multiple times.
     - The term \( - p \cdot k \) adjusts for the initial count.
     - The term \( 2 \cdot k \cdot C \cdot S \) accounts for the initial friendship values and their contributions over `k` excursions.
   - The denominator `den` is calculated as \( 2 \cdot C \cdot C \). This is correct for the expected value calculation.

5. **Simplifying the Fraction:**
   - The program uses the greatest common divisor (GCD) to simplify the fraction:
     ```python
     g = math.gcd(num, den)
     num = num // g
     den = den // g
     ```
   - It then computes the modular inverse of the simplified denominator using `pow(den, -1, MOD)`:
     ```python
     den = pow(den, -1, MOD)
     ```

6. **Final Answer Calculation:**
   - The program multiplies the simplified numerator by the modular inverse of the simplified denominator and takes the result modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \):
     ```python
     ans = num * den % MOD
     print(ans)
     ```

### Analysis:
- The program follows the correct logic for calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values.
- The use of GCD to simplify the fraction and the modular inverse to handle division under modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) is appropriate.
- The program handles the input and output correctly for multiple test cases.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description and the steps taken to solve it.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
