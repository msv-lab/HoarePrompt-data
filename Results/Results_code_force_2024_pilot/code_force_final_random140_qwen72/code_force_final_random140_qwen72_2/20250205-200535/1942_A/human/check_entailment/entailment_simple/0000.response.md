Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually by reading `n` and `k`.

2. **Case 1: \( n = k \)**:
   - If \( n = k \), the program prints a sequence of `1`s repeated `n` times. This is correct because every cyclic shift of an array of identical elements is sorted.

3. **Case 2: \( k = 1 \)**:
   - If \( k = 1 \), the program prints a sequence of integers from 1 to `n`. This is correct because only one cyclic shift (the original array) will be sorted, and the rest will not be sorted due to the increasing order of the elements.

4. **Case 3: \( n \neq k \) and \( k \neq 1 \)**:
   - If neither \( n = k \) nor \( k = 1 \), the program prints `-1`. This is correct because it is impossible to construct an array that meets the given conditions when \( k \) is neither 1 nor equal to \( n \).

5. **Output Format**: The program outputs the results in the correct format for each test case, either a sequence of integers or `-1`.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to handle all specified cases correctly and adheres to the problem constraints.

Correctness: **True**
