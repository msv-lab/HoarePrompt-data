Reasoning:  
The program correctly handles the three main cases specified in the problem statement:
1. When `n == k`, it prints a sequence of `1`s repeated `n` times. This is correct because every cyclic shift of an array filled with the same number will be sorted.
2. When `k == 1`, it prints a sequence of integers from `1` to `n`. This is correct because only one cyclic shift (the original array) will be sorted, and the rest will not be sorted due to the increasing order of elements.
3. For any other combination of `n` and `k`, it prints `-1`. This is correct because the problem specifies that the array must have exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts, and the only valid cases are when `n == k` or `k == 1`.

The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case accordingly. It uses the correct logic to determine the output based on the values of `n` and `k` for each test case.

Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description and the provided constraints.

Correctness: **True**
