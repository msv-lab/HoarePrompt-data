Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution is partially correct but fails to handle all cases as specified in the problem statement. Specifically, the solution only handles two cases correctly:

1. When \( n = k \), it prints an array where all elements are 1, which ensures that all cyclic shifts are sorted.
2. When \( k = 1 \), it prints an array where the elements are in strictly increasing order, ensuring that only one cyclic shift is sorted.

However, the solution incorrectly outputs `-1` for all other cases, which is not always correct. For example, consider the case where \( n = 4 \) and \( k = 2 \). A valid array could be `[1, 2, 3, 1]`, which has exactly 2 sorted cyclic shifts: `[1, 2, 3, 1]` and `[1, 1, 2, 3]`.

To fix this, the solution needs to handle more general cases where \( 1 < k < n \). One possible approach is to construct an array with a pattern that ensures exactly \( k \) cyclic shifts are sorted. For example, you can create an array with the first \( k \) elements in increasing order and the remaining elements set to a value that ensures the array remains unsorted when shifted beyond the first \( k \) elements.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if n == k:
            print(('1 ' * n)[:-1])
        elif k == 1:
            print(' '.join([str(x + 1) for x in range(n)]))
        elif k > 1:
            # Construct an array with the first k elements in increasing order
            # and the rest set to a large value to ensure only k cyclic shifts are sorted
            print(' '.join([str(i + 1) for i in range(k)] + ['1000000000'] * (n - k)))
        else:
            print(-1)
```

This corrected version will handle all cases as specified in the problem statement.
