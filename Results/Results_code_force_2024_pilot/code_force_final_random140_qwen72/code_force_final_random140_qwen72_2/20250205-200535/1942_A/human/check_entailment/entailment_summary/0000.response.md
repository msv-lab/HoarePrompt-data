Reasoning:  
The program correctly handles the specified conditions for generating arrays based on the values of `n` and `k`. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Case when `n == k`:**
   - If `n` equals `k`, the program prints a sequence of `1`s repeated `n` times. This is correct because every cyclic shift of an array filled with `1`s will be sorted, satisfying the condition that all `n` cyclic shifts are sorted.

2. **Case when `k == 1`:**
   - If `k` is 1, the program prints a sequence of integers from `1` to `n`. This is correct because only one cyclic shift (the original array) will be sorted, and all other cyclic shifts will not be sorted due to the increasing order of the elements.

3. **Case when neither `n == k` nor `k == 1`:**
   - If neither condition is met, the program prints `-1`. This is correct because there is no known general method to construct an array that has exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts for arbitrary `k` and `n` beyond the special cases handled above.

Given the constraints and the problem requirements, the program correctly identifies and handles the valid cases and outputs `-1` for invalid cases. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
