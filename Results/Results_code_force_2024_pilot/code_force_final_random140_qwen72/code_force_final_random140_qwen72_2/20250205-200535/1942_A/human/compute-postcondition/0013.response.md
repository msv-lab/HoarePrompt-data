Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n` and `k` are integers read from input where \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^3\).
- `_` is 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(('1 ' * n)[:-1])
```

### Explanation:
1. **String Multiplication**: 
   - The expression `'1 ' * n` creates a string where the character sequence `"1 "` is repeated `n` times.
   - For example, if `n` is 3, the result would be `"1 1 1 "`.

2. **Slicing**:
   - The expression `[:-1]` removes the last character from the resulting string.
   - Continuing the example, if the string is `"1 1 1 "`, removing the last character results in `"1 1 1"`.

### Final Output:
- The `print` statement will output a string consisting of the character sequence `"1 "` repeated `n` times, with the trailing space removed.

### Example:
- If `n` is 3, the output will be `"1 1 1"`.
- If `n` is 5, the output will be `"1 1 1 1 1"`.

### General Case:
- For any valid `n` (where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^3\)), the output will be a string of `n` repetitions of `"1 "`, with the trailing space removed.

### Final Answer:
Output: **"1 1 1 ... 1" (where there are n repetitions of "1 ", with the trailing space removed)**
