The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop's execution depends on the value of `int(input())`, which determines how many times the loop will run. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, and the input must be a positive integer (1 ≤ int(input()) ≤ t).

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `_` needs to be incremented by 1, and the input must still be a positive integer within the specified range. Since the input is taken once before the loop starts and does not change during the loop, the only state that changes is `_`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `_` is incremented by 1, so it becomes 1.
- The input remains the same, and it must be a positive integer (1 ≤ int(input()) ≤ t).

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3, `_` is 1, and the input must be a positive integer (1 ≤ int(input()) ≤ t).**
