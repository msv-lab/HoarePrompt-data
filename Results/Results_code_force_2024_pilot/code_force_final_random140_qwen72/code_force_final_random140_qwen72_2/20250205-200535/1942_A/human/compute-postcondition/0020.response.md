Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n` and `k` are integers read from input where \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^3\).
- `_` is 2.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(('1 ' * n)[:-1])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **String Multiplication**: 
   - The expression `'1 ' * n` creates a string where the character sequence `"1 "` is repeated `n` times.
   - For example, if `n` is 3, the result would be `"1 1 1 "`.

2. **String Slicing**:
   - The expression `[:-1]` removes the last character from the resulting string.
   - Continuing the example, if the string is `"1 1 1 "`, removing the last character results in `"1 1 1"`.

3. **Final Output**:
   - The `print` statement will output the string `"1 "` repeated `n` times, but without the trailing space.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output a string consisting of `n` occurrences of the number `1`, separated by spaces, but without a trailing space.

Output: **1 1 1 ... 1 (where there are n occurrences of 1, separated by spaces, and no trailing space)**
