Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, n and k are integers where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    if n == k:
        print(('1 ' * n)[:-1])
    elif k == 1:
        print(' '.join([str(x + 1) for x in range(n)]))
    else:
        print(-1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3, `_` is 0, and the input must be a positive integer (1 ≤ int(input()) ≤ t). If `n` is equal to `k`, the condition holds as is. If `n` is not equal to `k`, then `k` is either 1 or not equal to 1, but the values of `t`, `n`, and `_` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` and `k` are integers read from input where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3, and `_` is 1. If `n` equals `k`, the program behaves as specified in the if part. Otherwise, the program behaves as specified in the else part, which in this case is identical to the if part. Therefore, regardless of the value of `k`, the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, and `_` retain their initial values and constraints.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` and `k` are integers read from input where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3, `_` is 2. If `n` equals `k`, the program behaves as specified in the if part. If `k` is 1, the program also behaves as specified in the if part. Otherwise, the program behaves as specified in the else part.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
