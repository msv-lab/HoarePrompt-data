The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships described, it is implied that the function should accept parameters related to `t`, `n`, and `k`. Given the context, let's assume the function should accept these parameters.

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3.

Since the output is not specified, we can infer that the function likely processes these parameters and returns some result based on them. Without more specific information about the output, we can only describe the parameters and the general expectation that the function will return a result for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `k`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3. For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3. The function returns a result for each test case based on the values of `n` and `k`.**
