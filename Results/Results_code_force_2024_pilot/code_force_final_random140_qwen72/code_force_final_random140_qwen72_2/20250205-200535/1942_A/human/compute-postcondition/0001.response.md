The code snippet reads two integers from the input, splits them by a space, and assigns them to `n` and `k`. Given the initial state, `n` and `k` will now hold the values provided by the user, where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3. The variable `_` remains unchanged, and `t` also remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3, `_` is 0, and the input must be a positive integer (1 ≤ int(input()) ≤ t).**
