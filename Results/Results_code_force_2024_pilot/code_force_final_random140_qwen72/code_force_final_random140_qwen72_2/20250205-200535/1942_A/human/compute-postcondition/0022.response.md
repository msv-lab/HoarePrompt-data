The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs `-1`. The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, and `_`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the value printed is independent of the initial state.

Here's the breakdown:
- `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^3.
- `n` and `k` are integers read from input, with the constraints 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3.
- `_` is set to 2.

However, none of these variables are referenced in the `print` statement. The statement simply prints the integer `-1`.

Output: **-1**
