Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3, `_` is 0, and the input must be a positive integer (1 ≤ int(input()) ≤ t). If `n` is equal to `k`, the condition holds as is. If `n` is not equal to `k`, then `k` is either 1 or not equal to 1, but the values of `t`, `n`, and `_` remain unchanged.***
