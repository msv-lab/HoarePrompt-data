Reasoning:  
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. The game involves strategic decisions about swapping wallets and removing coins, but the solution simply compares the initial number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets (`n` and `k`) and decides the winner based on this comparison alone. This approach fails to account for the actual gameplay mechanics, such as the turn-based nature of the game and the rules for removing coins.

For example, the solution incorrectly determines that Bob wins if `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, and Alice wins if `n` is less than `k`. This is not always correct. Consider the case where `n = 1` and `k = 4` (as in the second test case of the example). According to the solution, Bob would win because `1 < 4`, but the correct outcome is that Alice wins, as shown in the example.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should simulate the game according to the rules provided, taking into account the optimal moves that Alice and Bob can make. The current solution does not do this, and thus it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
