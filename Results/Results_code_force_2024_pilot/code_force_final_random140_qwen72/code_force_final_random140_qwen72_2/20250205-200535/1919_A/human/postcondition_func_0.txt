The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^9. It then compares `n` and `k` and prints 'Bob' if `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, and 'Alice' if `n` is less than `k`. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the state of the program remains unchanged except for the printed output.
