The only variables in the loop head are `_rep` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `_rep` being less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `_rep` is 0 and `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `_rep` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1, and `t` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`_rep` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, `a` and `b` remain as integers where 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9, `n` and `k` are input integers. If `n` is greater than `k`, the condition `n > k` holds true. If `n` is less than or equal to `k`, the condition `n ≤ k` holds true.**
