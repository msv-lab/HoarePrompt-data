The code snippet `n, k = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. The initial values of `_rep`, `t`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. The new values of `n` and `k` are determined by the input.

Output State: **`_rep` is 2, `t` is greater than 2, `a` and `b` remain as integers where 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9, `n` and `k` are updated to the input integers. If the new n is greater than the new k, the condition n > k holds true. If the new n is less than or equal to the new k, the condition n ≤ k holds true.**
