The only variable in the loop head is `_rep` and the loop control variable `t`. The loop can execute again if `_rep` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `_rep` is 1 and `t` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `_rep` needs to be incremented by 1 to 2, and `t` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`_rep` is 2, `t` is greater than 2, `a` and `b` remain as integers where 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9, `n` and `k` are updated to the input integers. If the new n is greater than the new k, the condition n > k holds true. If the new n is less than or equal to the new k, the condition n ≤ k holds true.**
