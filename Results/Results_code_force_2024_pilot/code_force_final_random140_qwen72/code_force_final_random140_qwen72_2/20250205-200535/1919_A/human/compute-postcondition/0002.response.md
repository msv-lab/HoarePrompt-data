The code snippet reads two integers from the input, splits them, and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The variables `t`, `_rep`, `a`, and `b` are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_rep` is 0, `a` and `b` remain as integers where 1 â‰¤ a, b â‰¤ 10^9, `n` and `k` are input integers.**
