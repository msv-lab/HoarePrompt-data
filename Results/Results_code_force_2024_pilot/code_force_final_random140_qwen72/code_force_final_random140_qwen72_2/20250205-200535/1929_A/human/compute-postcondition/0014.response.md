Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases. Each test case involves reading an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It sorts the list and then calculates the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list. This sum is printed for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value. The final state of the program is that the input has been processed and the results have been printed for each test case. **
