Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.
- `_` is 2 (though this variable is not used in the code snippet).
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `ar` is a sorted list of integers input by the user.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(sum([(ar[i] - ar[i - 1]) for i in range(1, n)]))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding the List Comprehension**:
   - The list comprehension `[(ar[i] - ar[i - 1]) for i in range(1, n)]` generates a list of differences between consecutive elements in the list `ar`.
   - For each `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1` (since `range(1, n)` includes indices from 1 to `n-1`), it calculates `ar[i] - ar[i - 1]`.

2. **Summing the Differences**:
   - The `sum` function then adds up all the differences calculated in the list comprehension.

3. **Interpreting the Result**:
   - The sum of the differences between consecutive elements in a sorted list `ar` is equivalent to the difference between the last element and the first element of the list.
   - This is because the sum of the differences telescopes, canceling out intermediate terms:
     \[
     (ar[1] - ar[0]) + (ar[2] - ar[1]) + \ldots + (ar[n-1] - ar[n-2]) = ar[n-1] - ar[0]
     \]

### Final Output:
The code will print the difference between the last element and the first element of the list `ar`.

Output: **ar[n-1] - ar[0]** (where `ar[n-1]` is the last element of the list `ar` and `ar[0]` is the first element of the list `ar`)
