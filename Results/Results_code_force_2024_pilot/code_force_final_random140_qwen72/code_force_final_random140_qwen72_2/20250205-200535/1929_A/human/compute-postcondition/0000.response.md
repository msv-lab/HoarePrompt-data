The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder for the loop counter. The loop's execution depends on the input value provided to `range(int(input()))`. For the loop to execute, the input must be a positive integer.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, representing the length of the array `a`.
- The array `a` consists of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.

To ensure the loop executes, the input to `range(int(input()))` must be at least 1. Since `t` represents the number of test cases, it should be the input to the loop, and it must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `_` is 0 (as the loop counter starts from 0)**
