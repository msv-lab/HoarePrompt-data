Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 500, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `ar` is a sorted list of integers input by the user.**

Explanation: The code snippet `n = int(input())` updates the value of `n` to an integer input by the user, which is specified to be greater than 0. The other variables (`t`, `_`, and `ar`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
