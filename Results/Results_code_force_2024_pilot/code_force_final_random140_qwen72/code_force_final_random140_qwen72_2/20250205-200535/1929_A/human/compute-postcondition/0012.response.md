Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `_` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `ar` is a sorted list of integers input by the user.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: This variable remains unchanged throughout the loop because it represents the total number of test cases, which is determined before the loop starts.
- **`_`**: This variable increments with each iteration of the loop. After all iterations, it will be equal to `t-1` because the loop runs from `_ = 0` to `_ = t-1`.
- **`n`**: This variable is re-assigned in each iteration of the loop to the next input integer, which represents the length of the array for the current test case. It will always be an integer greater than 0.
- **`ar`**: This variable is re-assigned in each iteration to a sorted list of integers provided by the user for the current test case. Each `ar` will be a sorted list of integers.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop, the state of the variables will be as described above.
