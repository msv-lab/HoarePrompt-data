Correctness: **True**

The provided solution correctly calculates the maximum beauty of the array as described in the problem statement. By sorting the array, the differences between consecutive elements are minimized, which maximizes the sum of the differences \( (a_i - a_{i-1}) \) for \( i \) from 2 to \( n \). This approach ensures that the beauty of the array is maximized. The solution handles multiple test cases as required and outputs the correct result for each case.
