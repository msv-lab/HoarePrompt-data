Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the "beauty" of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array. Mathematically, this is expressed as:
   \[
   \text{Beauty} = \sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1})
   \]
   To maximize this sum, we should try to maximize the positive differences and minimize the negative differences.

2. **Optimal Rearrangement**: The optimal way to achieve this is to sort the array in ascending order. This ensures that the differences \(a_i - a_{i-1}\) are minimized for the smallest elements and maximized for the largest elements, leading to the highest possible sum.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array itself.
   - It sorts the array.
   - It calculates the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.
   - It prints the result.

4. **Verification**:
   - The sorting step ensures that the array is in ascending order, which is the optimal arrangement for maximizing the beauty.
   - The calculation of the sum of differences is done correctly using a list comprehension and the `sum` function.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
