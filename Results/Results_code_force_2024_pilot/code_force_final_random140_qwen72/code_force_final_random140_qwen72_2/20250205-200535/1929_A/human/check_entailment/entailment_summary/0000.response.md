Reasoning:  
The problem requires calculating the maximum beauty of an array, defined as the sum of the values \( (a_i - a_{i-1}) \) for all integers \( i \) from 2 to \( n \). To maximize this sum, the array should be sorted in ascending order because the differences between consecutive elements will be minimized, leading to the largest possible sum of these differences.

The provided program does exactly this:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array itself.
3. It sorts the array.
4. It calculates the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.
5. It prints the result for each test case.

This approach is correct because sorting the array ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized, which aligns with the problem's requirement to find the maximum beauty of the array.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
