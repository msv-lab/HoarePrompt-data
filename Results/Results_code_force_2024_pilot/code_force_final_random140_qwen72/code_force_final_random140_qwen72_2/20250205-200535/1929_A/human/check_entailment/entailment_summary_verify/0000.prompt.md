You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(sorted(list(map(int, input().split()))))
        print(sum([ar[i] - ar[i - 1] for i in range(1, n)]))



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes a series of test cases. Each test case involves reading an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It sorts the list and then calculates the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list. This sum is printed for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value. The final state of the program is that the input has been processed and the results have been printed for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not always produce the correct result for maximizing the beauty of the array. The issue lies in the approach used to calculate the maximum beauty. The current implementation sorts the array and calculates the sum of differences between consecutive elements. However, this does not necessarily maximize the beauty of the array as defined by the problem statement.

To maximize the beauty, the array should be rearranged such that the difference between consecutive elements is maximized. This can be achieved by alternating the largest and smallest remaining elements in the sorted array. For example, if the sorted array is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the optimal arrangement would be `[1, 5, 2, 4, 3]` or `[5, 1, 4, 2, 3]`, which would yield a higher beauty value.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the input:
```
1
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
The current program will sort the array to `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and calculate the beauty as:
```
(2-1) + (3-2) + (4-3) + (5-4) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4
```
However, the optimal arrangement is `[1, 5, 2, 4, 3]` or `[5, 1, 4, 2, 3]`, which gives:
```
(5-1) + (2-5) + (4-2) + (3-4) = 4 + (-3) + 2 + (-1) = 2
```
But the correct maximum beauty is actually:
```
(5-1) + (4-2) + (3-2) + (4-3) = 4 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 8
```
Thus, the program does not always produce the correct result, making it incorrect.
