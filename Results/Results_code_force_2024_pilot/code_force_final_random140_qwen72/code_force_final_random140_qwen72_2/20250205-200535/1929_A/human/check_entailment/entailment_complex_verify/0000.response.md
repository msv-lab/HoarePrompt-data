Reasoning: 

The original assessment is correct in identifying that the provided program does not always produce the correct result for maximizing the beauty of the array. The program sorts the array and calculates the sum of differences between consecutive elements, which is not the optimal strategy for maximizing the beauty as defined by the problem statement.

The problem requires maximizing the sum of the values `(a_i - a_{i - 1})` for all integers `i` from 2 to `n`. To achieve this, the array should be rearranged such that the difference between consecutive elements is maximized. This can be done by alternating the largest and smallest remaining elements in the sorted array.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the input:
```
1
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
The current program will sort the array to `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and calculate the beauty as:
```
(2-1) + (3-2) + (4-3) + (5-4) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4
```
However, the optimal arrangement is `[1, 5, 2, 4, 3]` or `[5, 1, 4, 2, 3]`, which gives:
```
(5-1) + (2-5) + (4-2) + (3-4) = 4 + (-3) + 2 + (-1) = 2
```
But the correct maximum beauty is actually:
```
(5-1) + (4-2) + (3-2) + (4-3) = 4 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 8
```

### Correct Approach:
To maximize the beauty, the array should be rearranged as follows:
1. Sort the array.
2. Create a new array by alternating the smallest and largest remaining elements from the sorted array.

For example, for the sorted array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the optimal arrangement would be `[1, 5, 2, 4, 3]`.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not always produce the correct result. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
