The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is `t - 1`, meaning it has been decremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `median` is the value of `a[median_index]` in the sorted list, `i` is `n-1`, `operations` is the sum of `(median - a[j])` for all `j` where `a[j] < median` and `0 <= j < n`**
