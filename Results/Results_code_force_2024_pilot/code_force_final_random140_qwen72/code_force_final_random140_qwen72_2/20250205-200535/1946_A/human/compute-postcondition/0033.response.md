The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the input `n`. The loop's execution depends on `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is an input integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 1, and `n` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `median` is the value of `a[median_index]` in the sorted list, `i` is 1. If `a[i]` is less than `median`, `operations` is set to `median - a[i]`. Otherwise, `operations` remains 0.**
