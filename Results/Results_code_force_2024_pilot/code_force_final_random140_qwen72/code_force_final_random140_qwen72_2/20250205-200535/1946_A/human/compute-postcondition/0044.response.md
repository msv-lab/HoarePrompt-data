Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is a new input integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `median` is the value of `a[median_index]` in the sorted list, `i` is `n-1`, `operations` is the sum of `(median - a[j])` for all `j` where `a[j] < median` and `0 <= j < n`.**

Explanation:
- The list `a` is now sorted in ascending order.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `median_index`, `median`, `i`, and `operations` remain unchanged, but `median` is now calculated based on the sorted list `a`.
