Postcondition: ***`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `median` is the value of `a[median_index]` in the sorted list, and `i` is 1. If `a[1]` is less than `median`, `operations` is set to `2 * (median - a[1])`. Otherwise, `operations` remains 0.***
