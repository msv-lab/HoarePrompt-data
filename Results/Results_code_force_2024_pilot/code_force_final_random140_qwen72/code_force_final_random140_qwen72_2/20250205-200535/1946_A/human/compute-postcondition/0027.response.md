The code snippet sets `operations` to 0. This overrides the previous value of `operations`, which was the sum of `(median - a[j])` for all `j` in the range `[0, n-1]` where `a[j] < median` in the sorted list.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `median` is the value of `a[median_index]` in the sorted list, `i` is `n-1`, `operations` is 0.**
