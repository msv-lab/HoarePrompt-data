The code snippet `operations += median - a[i]` updates the value of `operations` by adding the difference between `median` and `a[i]` to its current value. Given the initial state:

- `t` is `t - 1`
- `n` is an input integer greater than 2
- `a` is a sorted list of integers
- `median_index` is `n // 2`
- `median` is the value of `a[median_index]` in the sorted list
- `i` is 2
- If `a[1]` is less than `median`, `operations` is set to `2 * (median - a[1])`. Otherwise, `operations` remains 0.

Let's calculate the new value of `operations`:

1. `i` is 2, so `a[i]` refers to `a[2]`.
2. The difference between `median` and `a[2]` is `median - a[2]`.
3. This difference is added to the current value of `operations`.

If `a[1]` is less than `median`, `operations` was initially set to `2 * (median - a[1])`. Otherwise, `operations` was initially 0.

Therefore, the new value of `operations` is:
- If `a[1] < median`: `operations = 2 * (median - a[1]) + (median - a[2])`
- If `a[1] >= median`: `operations = 0 + (median - a[2])`

The updated state is:
- `t` is `t - 1`
- `n` is an input integer greater than 2
- `a` is a sorted list of integers
- `median_index` is `n // 2`
- `median` is the value of `a[median_index]` in the sorted list
- `i` is 2
- `operations` is `2 * (median - a[1]) + (median - a[2])` if `a[1] < median`, otherwise `operations` is `median - a[2]`

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `median` is the value of `a[median_index]` in the sorted list, `i` is 2, `operations` is `2 * (median - a[1]) + (median - a[2])` if `a[1] < median`, otherwise `operations` is `median - a[2]`.**
