The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. It accepts no direct parameters but reads from an input where the first line contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, the function reads another line containing an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), which represents the length of an array `a`. The next line contains `n` space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) that form the array `a`. The function processes each test case and returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to the processing of one test case. The sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and an array `a` of `n` integers. It returns a list of results, one for each test case.**
