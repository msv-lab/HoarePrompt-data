Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 (specifically, `t` is now `t - 1` from its value at the start of the previous iteration), `n` is a new input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers derived from the user's input, `p` is `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`, `res` is the number of times the element at index `p` appears in the sublist `a[p:]`. The new value of `a` is a list of integers derived from the user's input.**
