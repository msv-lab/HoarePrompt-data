Postcondition: ***`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `median` is the value of `a[median_index]` in the sorted list, and `i` is 2. If `a[1] < median`, `operations` is `2 * (median - a[1]) + (median - a[2])`. Otherwise, `operations` is `median - a[2]`.***
