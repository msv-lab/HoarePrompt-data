Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is a new input integer greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `median` is the value of `a[n // 2]` in the sorted list, `i` is `n-1`, `operations` is the sum of `(median - a[j])` for all `j` in the range `[0, n-1]` where `a[j] < median`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates `n` times, from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`.
- For each iteration, if the current element `a[i]` is less than the `median`, the difference `median - a[i]` is added to the `operations` variable.
- After all iterations, `i` will be `n-1` (the last index of the list).
- The `operations` variable will hold the total sum of the differences between the `median` and each element in the list that is less than the `median`.
