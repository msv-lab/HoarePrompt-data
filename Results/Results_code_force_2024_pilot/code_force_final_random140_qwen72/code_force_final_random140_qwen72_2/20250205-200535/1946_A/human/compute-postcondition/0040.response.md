Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is `t - 1`: This indicates that `t` is being decremented by 1, but it doesn't affect the other variables directly.
2. `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
3. `a` is a sorted list of integers.
4. `median_index` is `n // 2`: This is the index of the median element in the sorted list `a`.
5. `median` is the value of `a[median_index]` in the sorted list.
6. `i` is `n-1`: This is the last index of the list `a`.
7. `operations` is the sum of `(median - a[j])` for all `j` where `a[j] < median` and `0 <= j < n`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(operations)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the Median:**
   - `median_index` is calculated as `n // 2`.
   - `median` is the value at the `median_index` in the sorted list `a`.

2. **Calculate `operations`:**
   - `operations` is the sum of the differences between `median` and each element `a[j]` where `a[j] < median`.
   - This means we need to iterate through the list `a` and sum up the differences for all elements that are less than the median.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume `a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `n = 5`.

1. **Median Calculation:**
   - `median_index = 5 // 2 = 2`
   - `median = a[2] = 3`

2. **Operations Calculation:**
   - We need to sum `(median - a[j])` for all `j` where `a[j] < median`.
   - Elements less than `median` are `1` and `2`.
   - `operations = (3 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 + 1 = 3`

### General Case:
For any sorted list `a` and integer `n > 0`:
- `median_index` is `n // 2`.
- `median` is `a[median_index]`.
- `operations` is the sum of `(median - a[j])` for all `j` where `a[j] < median`.

### Final Output:
The `print(operations)` statement will print the sum of the differences between the median and each element in the list that is less than the median.

Output: **operations (where operations is the sum of (median - a[j]) for all j where a[j] < median and 0 <= j < n)**
