Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 (specifically, `t` is now `t - 1` from its value at the start of the previous iteration), `n` is a new input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers derived from the user's input, `p` is `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`, `res` is the number of times the element at index `p` appears in the sublist `a[p:]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `p` is updated to `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `res` remain unchanged from their initial state.
