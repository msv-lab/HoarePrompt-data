Reasoning:  
The provided program aims to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of an array. However, the current implementation only counts the occurrences of the median value from the median position onwards in the sorted array. This approach does not correctly address the problem because it does not consider the necessary operations to actually increase the median value.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Sort the array.
2. Identify the median position.
3. Determine the smallest value greater than the current median.
4. Calculate the number of operations needed to make the current median equal to this smallest value greater than the current median.

The current implementation simply counts the number of times the median value appears from the median position onwards, which does not align with the problem's requirement to find the minimum number of operations to increase the median.

Therefore, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
