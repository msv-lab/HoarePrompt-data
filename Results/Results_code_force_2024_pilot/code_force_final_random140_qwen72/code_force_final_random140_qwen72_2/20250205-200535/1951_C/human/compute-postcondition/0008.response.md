The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. This operation overwrites the previous values of these variables. The other variables (`t`, `_`, `prices`, and `result`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `prices` is a list of integers input by the user, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, m, k, prices)`**
