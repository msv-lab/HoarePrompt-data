Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `prices` is a list of integers input by the user, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, m, k, prices)`**. 

The function `func_1` is called with the arguments `n`, `m`, `k`, and `prices`. The return value of `func_1` is assigned to the variable `result`. The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `prices` remain unchanged.
