Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `prices` is a list of integers input by the user, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, m, k, prices)`**. 

The value of `result` is now the value returned by the function `func_1` when called with the arguments `n`, `m`, `k`, and `prices`. All other variables remain unchanged.
