Output State: **`t` is 0 or less, `_` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `prices` is a list of integers input by the user, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, m, k, prices)` for the last iteration.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` is now 0 or less, indicating that there are no more iterations left to execute.
- The variable `_` is equal to `t-1`, which represents the index of the last iteration that was executed.
- The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers that were provided during the last iteration.
- The variable `prices` is a list of integers that was input by the user during the last iteration.
- The variable `result` holds the value returned by the function `func_1(n, m, k, prices)` for the last iteration.
