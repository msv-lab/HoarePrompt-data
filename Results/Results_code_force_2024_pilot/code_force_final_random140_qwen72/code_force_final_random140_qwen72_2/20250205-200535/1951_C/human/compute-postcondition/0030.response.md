Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n` (the number of sale days), `m` (the maximum number of tickets purchasable each day), `k` (the total number of tickets to buy), and `prices` (a list of prices per ticket for each day). It calculates and returns the minimum amount of money needed to purchase `k` tickets by buying them at the lowest available prices over the given days. After the function executes, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged, while `prices` is sorted in non-decreasing order. The function ensures that the total cost reflects the optimal strategy of purchasing tickets at the lowest prices first. **
