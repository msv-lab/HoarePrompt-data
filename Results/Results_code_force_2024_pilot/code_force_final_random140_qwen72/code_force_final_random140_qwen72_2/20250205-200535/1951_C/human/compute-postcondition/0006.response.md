Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `_` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `prices` is a list of integers input by the user.
- `result` is the value returned by the function `func_1(n, m, k, prices)`.

The `print(result)` statement will print the value of `result`, which is the result of the function `func_1` when called with the arguments `n`, `m`, `k`, and `prices`.

Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the precise numerical value of `result`. However, based on the information given, we can describe the output as follows:

Output: **result (where result is the value returned by the function `func_1(n, m, k, prices)`)**
