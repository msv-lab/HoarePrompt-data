The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 0, and `_` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` will be incremented by 1 (so `_` is 1), and `t` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `prices` is a list of integers input by the user, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, m, k, prices)`**
