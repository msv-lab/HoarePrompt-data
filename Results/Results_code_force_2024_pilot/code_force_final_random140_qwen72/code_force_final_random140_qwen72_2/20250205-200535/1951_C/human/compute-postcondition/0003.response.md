The code snippet reads a line of input and splits it into three parts, which are then converted to integers and assigned to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. The initial state specifies that `t` must be greater than 0 and `_` is 0. These values are not affected by the code.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.**
