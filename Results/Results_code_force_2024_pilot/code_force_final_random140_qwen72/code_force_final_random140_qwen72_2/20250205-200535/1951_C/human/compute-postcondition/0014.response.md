Output State: **`t` must be greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `prices` is a list of integers input by the user, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, m, k, prices)`**

Explanation:
- The code `prices = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `prices`.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `result` remain unchanged.
- The new value of `prices` is a list of integers provided by the user.
