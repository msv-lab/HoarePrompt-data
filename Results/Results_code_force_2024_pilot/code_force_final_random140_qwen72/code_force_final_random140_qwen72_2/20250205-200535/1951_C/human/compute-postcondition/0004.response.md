Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `prices` is a list of integers input by the user.** 

The code `prices = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into substrings based on spaces, converts each substring to an integer, and stores these integers in a list called `prices`. The other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `m`, `k`) remain unchanged.
