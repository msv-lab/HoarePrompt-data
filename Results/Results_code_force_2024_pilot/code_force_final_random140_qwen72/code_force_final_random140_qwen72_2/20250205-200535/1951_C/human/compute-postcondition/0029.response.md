- `n` is a positive integer representing the number of sale days.
- `m` is a positive integer representing the maximum number of tickets purchasable each day.
- `k` is a positive integer representing the total number of tickets to buy.
- `prices` is a list of `n` positive integers where each element represents the price per ticket for each of the upcoming `n` days.

The function returns the total cost, which is the sum of the costs of buying `k` tickets at the lowest possible prices from the sorted list `prices`.
