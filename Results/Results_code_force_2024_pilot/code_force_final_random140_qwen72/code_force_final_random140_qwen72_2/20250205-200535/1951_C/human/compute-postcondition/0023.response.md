Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `prices` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers, `total_cost` is `tickets_to_buy * (prices[0] + prices[1]) + tickets_to_buy * prices[2]`, `tickets_bought` is the minimum value between `m` and `k` plus the minimum value between `m` and `k - tickets_bought`, `tickets_to_buy` is the minimum value between `m` and `k - tickets_bought`, `cost` is `tickets_to_buy * prices[2]`.**

Explanation:
- The code updates the `total_cost` by adding the value of `cost` to it.
- `total_cost` was initially `tickets_to_buy * (prices[0] + prices[1])`.
- `cost` is `tickets_to_buy * prices[2]`.
- After the addition, `total_cost` becomes `tickets_to_buy * (prices[0] + prices[1]) + tickets_to_buy * prices[2]`.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `prices`, `tickets_bought`, `tickets_to_buy`, and `cost`) remain unchanged.
