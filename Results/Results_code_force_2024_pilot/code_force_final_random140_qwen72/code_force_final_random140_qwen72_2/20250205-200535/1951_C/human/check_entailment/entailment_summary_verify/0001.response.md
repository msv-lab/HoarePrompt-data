### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires purchasing `k` tickets over `n` days with the constraint that no more than `m` tickets can be bought per day. The price of tickets increases after each purchase, but the goal is to minimize the total cost.

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - **Sorting Prices**: The function `func_1` sorts the prices in ascending order. This ensures that we always buy tickets at the lowest available price first, which is a key strategy for minimizing the total cost.
   - **Iterative Purchase**: The loop iterates through the sorted prices, buying the minimum of `m` tickets or the remaining tickets needed (`k - tickets_bought`). This approach ensures that we do not exceed the daily limit and that we buy tickets in the most cost-effective manner.
   - **Cost Calculation**: The cost for each purchase is calculated as `tickets_to_buy * prices[i]` and added to the total cost. This correctly reflects the cost of buying tickets at the current price.
   - **Early Termination**: The loop breaks once the required number of tickets (`k`) is purchased, ensuring that we do not perform unnecessary operations.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Single Day Purchase**: If `k` is less than or equal to `m`, the function will purchase all tickets in one day, which is the most efficient way.
   - **Multiple Days**: If `k` is greater than `m`, the function distributes the purchases over multiple days, ensuring that the daily limit is respected.

4. **Input/Output Handling**:
   - **Test Case Handling**: `func_2` reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually. It reads the necessary parameters and calls `func_1` with the appropriate arguments.
   - **Result Printing**: The result for each test case is printed, ensuring that the output format matches the problem requirements.

5. **Correctness Verification**:
   - **Example Test Cases**: The provided examples are correctly handled by the program. For instance, in the first test case, the program correctly calculates the minimum cost as 10.
   - **General Logic**: The logic of sorting the prices and buying tickets in the cheapest order ensures that the total cost is minimized, which aligns with the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum spending to purchase `k` tickets under the given constraints. The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
