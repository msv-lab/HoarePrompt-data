Reasoning:  
The provided program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum cost to purchase `k` tickets over `n` days, given the constraints on daily ticket purchases and the dynamic pricing model. Let's break down the correctness of each function and the overall program:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Input Handling**: The function takes `n`, `m`, `k`, and `prices` as inputs, which are correctly defined and within the specified ranges.
   - **Sorting Prices**: The function sorts the `prices` list in ascending order. This is a crucial step because it allows the program to always buy tickets at the lowest available price first, which is essential for minimizing the total cost.
   - **Ticket Purchase Logic**: The function iterates through the sorted prices and buys tickets in batches of up to `m` tickets per day until `k` tickets are purchased. This logic ensures that the program adheres to the constraint of not buying more than `m` tickets per day.
   - **Cost Calculation**: The cost for each batch of tickets is calculated correctly by multiplying the number of tickets bought by the current price.
   - **Early Termination**: The function breaks out of the loop once `k` tickets are purchased, ensuring that the program does not continue to buy unnecessary tickets.
   - **Return Value**: The function returns the total cost, which is the sum of the costs of buying `k` tickets at the lowest possible prices.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Input Handling**: The function reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - **Test Case Processing**: For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by the list of prices. It then calls `func_1` with these parameters and prints the result.
   - **Output**: The function prints the result for each test case, which is the minimum cost to purchase `k` tickets.

3. **Overall Program**:
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases and processes each test case independently.
   - The logic in `func_1` ensures that the minimum cost is calculated by always buying tickets at the lowest available price first.
   - The program adheres to the constraints and requirements specified in the problem statement.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correct and meets the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
