### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires purchasing `k` tickets over `n` days with the constraint that no more than `m` tickets can be bought per day.
   - The price of tickets increases after each purchase, but the goal is to minimize the total cost.

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - **Sorting**: The function `func_1` sorts the prices in ascending order. This ensures that we always buy tickets at the lowest available price first, which is a key part of minimizing the total cost.
   - **Loop Iteration**: The loop iterates through the sorted prices, buying the minimum of `m` tickets or the remaining tickets needed (`k - tickets_bought`).
   - **Cost Calculation**: The cost for each purchase is calculated and added to the total cost.
   - **Early Termination**: The loop breaks once the required number of tickets (`k`) is purchased, ensuring that we do not perform unnecessary iterations.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Single Day Purchase**: If `k` is less than or equal to `m`, the function will purchase all tickets in one day, which is correctly handled.
   - **Multiple Days Purchase**: If `k` is greater than `m`, the function distributes the purchases over multiple days, ensuring that the total cost is minimized by always buying at the lowest available price.

4. **Input/Output Handling**:
   - **Test Cases**: `func_2` reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - **Parameter Passing**: It correctly passes the parameters to `func_1` and prints the result for each test case.

5. **Correctness Verification**:
   - **Example Test Cases**: The provided examples are correctly handled by the program.
   - **Logic Validation**: The logic of sorting the prices and buying tickets in the cheapest order ensures the minimum cost. The annotations confirm that the state of the program is maintained correctly throughout the execution.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum spending to purchase `k` tickets under the given constraints. The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
