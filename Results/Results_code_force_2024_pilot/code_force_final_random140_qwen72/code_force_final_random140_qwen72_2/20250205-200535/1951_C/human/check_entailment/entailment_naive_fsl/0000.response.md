Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Sorting Prices**: The program sorts the `prices` list in ascending order. This ensures that the cheapest tickets are bought first, which is a key strategy to minimize the total cost.

2. **Ticket Purchase Logic**: The program iterates through the sorted prices and buys the maximum number of tickets possible each day (`min(m, k - tickets_bought)`). This ensures that the program adheres to the constraint of buying no more than `m` tickets per day and stops once the required number of tickets (`k`) is reached.

3. **Cost Calculation**: The program calculates the cost of tickets bought each day and accumulates this cost in `total_cost`.

4. **Early Termination**: The program breaks out of the loop once the required number of tickets (`k`) is purchased, ensuring that the program does not continue to iterate unnecessarily.

5. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The `func_2` function correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases (`t`) and processing each test case individually.

Given these points, the program seems to handle all edge cases and constraints mentioned in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
