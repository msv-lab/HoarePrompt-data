Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum spending required to purchase `k` tickets under the given constraints. Here's a breakdown of why it works:

1. **Sorting Prices**: The function `func_1` sorts the `prices` list in ascending order. This ensures that the cheapest tickets are bought first, which is a key part of minimizing the total cost.

2. **Ticket Purchase Logic**: The function iterates through the sorted prices and buys the maximum number of tickets allowed per day (`min(m, k - tickets_bought)`) until the required number of tickets (`k`) is purchased. This approach ensures that the tickets are bought at the lowest possible prices.

3. **Cost Calculation**: For each day, the function calculates the cost of buying the tickets and adds this cost to the total cost. It also keeps track of the number of tickets bought so far.

4. **Early Termination**: The loop breaks once the required number of tickets is reached, ensuring that the function does not perform unnecessary operations.

5. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The function `func_2` handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases `t` and then processing each test case individually. It reads the input for each test case, calls `func_1` to compute the result, and prints the result.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for valid inputs.
