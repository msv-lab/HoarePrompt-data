### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires purchasing `k` tickets over `n` days with a daily limit of `m` tickets. The price of tickets increases after each purchase, and the goal is to minimize the total cost.

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` sorts the prices in ascending order, ensuring that tickets are bought at the lowest available price first.
   - The loop iterates through the sorted prices, buying the minimum of `m` tickets or the remaining tickets needed (`k - tickets_bought`).
   - The cost for each purchase is calculated and added to the total cost.
   - The loop breaks once the required number of tickets (`k`) is purchased.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the case where `k` is less than or equal to `m` by purchasing all tickets in one day.
   - It also handles the case where `k` is greater than `m` by distributing the purchases over multiple days.

4. **Input/Output Handling**:
   - `func_2` reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - It calls `func_1` with the appropriate parameters and prints the result for each test case.

5. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The provided examples are correctly handled by the program.
   - The logic of sorting the prices and buying tickets in the cheapest order ensures the minimum cost.

6. **Annotated Code Evaluation**:
   - The annotations confirm that the program maintains the correct state throughout its execution.
   - The final state of the program is consistent with the expected behavior, where `total_cost` is the sum of the costs of buying `k` tickets at the lowest possible prices.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum spending to purchase `k` tickets under the given constraints. The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
