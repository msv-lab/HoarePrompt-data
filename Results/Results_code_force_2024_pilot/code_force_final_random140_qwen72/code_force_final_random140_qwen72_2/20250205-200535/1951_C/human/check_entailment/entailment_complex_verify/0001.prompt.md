You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[Maître Gims - Est-ce que tu m'aimes ?](https://youtu.be/6TpyRE_juyA)

ඞ

As the CEO of a startup company, you want to reward each of your k employees
with a ticket to the upcoming concert. The tickets will be on sale for n days,
and by some time travelling, you have predicted that the price per ticket at
day i will be a_i . However, to prevent ticket hoarding, the concert
organizers have implemented the following measures:

  * A person may purchase no more than m tickets per day. 
  * If a person purchases x tickets on day i , all subsequent days (i.e. from day i+1 onwards) will have their prices per ticket increased by x . 

For example, if a = [1, 3, 8, 4, 5] and you purchase 2 tickets on day 1 , they
will cost 2 in total, and the prices from day 2 onwards will become [5, 10, 6,
7] . If you then purchase 3 more tickets on day 2 , they will cost in total an
additional 15 , and the prices from day 3 onwards will become [13, 9, 10] .

Find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
n \le 3 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le m \le 10^9, 1 \le k \le \min(nm, 10^9) ) — the
number of sale days, the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, and
the number of tickets to be bought at the end.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the minimum amount of money needed to
purchase exactly k tickets.

Note

In the first test case, one optimal way to buy 3 tickets is as follows:

  * Buy 0 tickets on the first day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [6, 4, 2] . 
  * Buy 0 tickets on the second day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [4, 2] . 
  * Buy 1 ticket on the third day with cost 4 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [3] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 6 . 

In the second test case, there is only one way to buy 8 tickets:

  * Buy 2 tickets on the first day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6, 4] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the second day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the third day with cost 16 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [8] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 16 .

It calculates and returns the minimum amount of money needed to purchase `k` tickets by buying them at the lowest available prices over the given days. After the function executes, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged, while `prices` is sorted in non-decreasing order. The function ensures that the total cost reflects the optimal strategy of purchasing tickets at the lowest prices first.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` handles multiple test cases. It reads the number of test cases `t` from the input, and for each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by a list of `n` integers `prices`. It then calls another function `func_1` with these parameters and prints the result. After processing all test cases, the function completes its execution. The final state of the program is that `t` test cases have been processed, and the results for each test case have been printed.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to purchase `k` tickets over `n` days with the constraint that we can buy up to `m` tickets per day.
   - The price of tickets increases after each purchase, but we need to minimize the total cost.

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` sorts the prices in ascending order, which ensures that we always buy tickets at the lowest available price first.
   - The loop iterates through the sorted prices, buying the minimum of `m` tickets or the remaining tickets needed (`k - tickets_bought`).
   - The cost for each purchase is calculated and added to the total cost.
   - The loop breaks once the required number of tickets (`k`) is purchased.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where `k` is less than or equal to `m` by purchasing all tickets in one day.
   - It also handles the case where `k` is greater than `m` by distributing the purchases over multiple days.

4. **Input/Output Handling**:
   - `func_2` reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - It calls `func_1` with the appropriate parameters and prints the result for each test case.

5. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The provided examples are correctly handled by the program.
   - The logic of sorting the prices and buying tickets in the cheapest order ensures the minimum cost.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum spending to purchase `k` tickets under the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
