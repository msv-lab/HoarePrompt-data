### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice paints the ribbon with `n` parts using `m` colors.
   - Bob can repaint up to `k` parts to try to make all parts the same color.
   - We need to determine if Alice can paint the ribbon such that Bob cannot achieve this goal.

2. **Conditions for Bob to Succeed:**
   - If `n <= k`, Bob can repaint all parts to the same color, so Alice cannot prevent this.
   - If `n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k`, Bob can repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color. This condition checks if the number of distinct colors Alice can use is such that Bob can still repaint enough parts to make them all the same.

3. **Conditions for Alice to Succeed:**
   - If neither of the above conditions hold, Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color.

4. **Code Analysis:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It checks if `n <= k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k`.
   - If either condition is true, it prints 'NO'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'Yes'.

5. **Verification:**
   - The logic in the code correctly implements the conditions derived from the problem statement.
   - The use of `math.ceil(n / m)` ensures that we are considering the minimum number of distinct colors Alice can use.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if Alice can paint the ribbon such that Bob cannot make all parts the same color. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
