Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program appears to handle all the specified conditions and edge cases correctly according to the problem description. The logic checks if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color by evaluating two main conditions:

1. If the total number of parts `n` is less than or equal to the number of parts Bob can repaint `k`, then Bob can always repaint all parts to the same color, so the answer is 'NO'.
2. If the number of parts that need to be different to prevent Bob from making all parts the same color (`n - math.ceil(n / m)`) is less than or equal to `k`, then Bob can also achieve his goal, so the answer is 'NO'.

Otherwise, the answer is 'Yes', indicating that Alice can indeed paint the ribbon in a way that prevents Bob from making all parts the same color. This logic aligns with the problem's constraints and requirements, and no counterexample has been found where the program fails to produce the correct output.
