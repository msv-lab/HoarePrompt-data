Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to verify if it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. The key points to check are:

1. **Reading Input**: The program should read the number of test cases `t` and then, for each test case, read the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
2. **Logic for Determining Output**: The program should correctly determine whether Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.
3. **Output Format**: The program should print "YES" or "NO" for each test case, matching the expected output format.

Let's break down the logic:

- **Condition 1**: `if n <= k`
  - If `n` is less than or equal to `k`, Bob can always repaint all parts to the same color, regardless of how Alice paints them. Therefore, the output should be "NO".
- **Condition 2**: `if n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k`
  - This condition checks if the number of parts that are not forced to be the same color by Alice's initial painting is less than or equal to `k`. If this is true, Bob can still repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color. Therefore, the output should be "NO".
- **Else**: If neither of the above conditions is true, Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color. Therefore, the output should be "Yes".

Now, let's verify the program against these points:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads `t` and then, for each test case, reads `n`, `m`, and `k` using `map(int, input().split())`. This is correct.

2. **Logic for Determining Output**:
   - The conditions `if n <= k` and `if n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k` are correctly implemented.
   - The logic ensures that if either condition is true, "NO" is printed; otherwise, "Yes" is printed. This matches the problem requirements.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The program prints "NO" or "Yes" for each test case, which is correct according to the problem statement.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the required logic and meets the problem's specifications.

Correctness: **True**
