The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the parameter constraints given, it is implied that the function should accept parameters related to the constraints mentioned. The parameters include `t`, which represents the number of test cases, and for each test case, it should accept `n`, `m`, and `k`, where `1 ≤ m, k ≤ n ≤ 50`. However, since the output is not specified, I will assume that the function processes these parameters and returns some form of result for each test case.

Given the lack of specific output details, I'll generalize the functionality based on common practices for functions dealing with such parameters:

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k`, where `t` is the number of test cases, and for each test case, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers with the constraints 1 ≤ m, k ≤ n ≤ 50. The function processes these parameters and returns a result for each test case.**
