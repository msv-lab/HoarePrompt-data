Output State: **`t` is 0, `itest` is `t-1`, and for each iteration, `n`, `m`, and `k` were input integers. For each test case, if `n` was less than or equal to `k` or the result of `n - math.ceil(n / m)` was less than or equal to `k`, "NO" was printed. Otherwise, "Yes" was printed.**

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have completed, the value of `t` will be 0 (since the loop has run `t` times, and `t` is decremented implicitly by the loop's termination condition). The variable `itest` will be `t-1` because it increments from 0 to `t-1`. For each iteration, the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` were taken as input, and the loop checked the conditions specified. Depending on these conditions, either "NO" or "Yes" was printed for each test case.
