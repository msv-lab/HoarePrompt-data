Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `letter` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `i` is 0, `res` is 'AA'.**

Explanation: The code `res += letter[i % 26] * 2` appends the character at index `i % 26` of the string `letter` twice to the string `res`. Since `i` is 0, `i % 26` is 0, and the character at index 0 of `letter` is 'A'. Therefore, `res` becomes 'AA'. The other variables remain unchanged.
