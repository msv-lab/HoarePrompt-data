Output State: **`s` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, the console screen is cleared, `n` must be at least 2, `ans` is the first `(n // 2)` characters of `s`, each repeated twice, `x` is `(n // 2)`, `j` is `(n // 2) - 1`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop runs `n // 2` times.
- Each iteration, the character at index `x` in the string `s` is appended to `ans` twice, and then `x` is incremented by 1.
- After all iterations, `ans` will contain the first `(n // 2)` characters of `s`, each repeated twice.
- The variable `x` will be equal to `(n // 2)` after the loop completes.
- The variable `j` will be `(n // 2) - 1` after the loop completes, as it starts from 0 and increments up to but not including `n // 2`.

For example, if `n` is 6:
- The loop runs 3 times (`6 // 2 = 3`).
- `ans` becomes 'AABBCC'.
- `x` becomes 3.
- `j` becomes 2.
