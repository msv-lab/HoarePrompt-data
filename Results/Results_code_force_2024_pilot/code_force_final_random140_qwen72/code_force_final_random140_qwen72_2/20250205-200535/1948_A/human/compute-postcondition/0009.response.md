Functionality: ** The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `t` from the user input, where `t` is expected to be a positive integer between 1 and 50, inclusive. The function then calls `func_1` exactly `t` times. After the function concludes, `t` remains unchanged, and `func_1` has been executed `t` times. The function does not return any value. **
