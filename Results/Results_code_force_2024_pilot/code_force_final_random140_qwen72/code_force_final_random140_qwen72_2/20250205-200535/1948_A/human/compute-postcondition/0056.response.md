Based on the initial state provided:

- `s` is the string `'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'`.
- `t` is greater than 1 (though it's not used in the print statement).
- `i` is 2 (though it's not used in the print statement).
- The console screen is cleared (this does not affect the print statement).
- `n` must be at least 2.
- `ans` is the first `(n // 2)` characters of `s`, each repeated twice.
- `x` is `(n // 2)`.
- `j` is `(n // 2) - 1`.

The print statement is:
```python
print('YES')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'YES'` to the console. The values of the variables and objects mentioned in the initial state do not influence the output of this specific print statement.

Output: **YES**
