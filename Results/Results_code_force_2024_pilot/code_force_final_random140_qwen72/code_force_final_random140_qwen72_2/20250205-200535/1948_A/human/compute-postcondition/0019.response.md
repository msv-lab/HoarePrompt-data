Output State: **`n` is an integer between -1 and 48 (inclusive), `letter` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `i` is 1, `res` is 'AAAABB' if `n` >= 0, otherwise `res` is 'AABB'.**

Explanation:
- `n` is decremented by 2, so its new value is `n - 2`. Since `n` was initially between 1 and 50, the new value of `n` is now between -1 and 48.
- The value of `letter` remains unchanged as 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'.
- The value of `i` remains unchanged as 1.
- The value of `res` is updated based on the new value of `n`. If `n` is now greater than or equal to 0, `res` is 'AAAABB'. Otherwise, if `n` is less than 0, `res` is 'AABB'.
