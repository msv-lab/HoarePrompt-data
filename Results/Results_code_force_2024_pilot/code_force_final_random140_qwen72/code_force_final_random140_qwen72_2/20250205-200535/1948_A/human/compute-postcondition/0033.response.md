Postcondition: ***No input parameters are required for this function. The variable `n` is an integer read from the standard input, where 1 <= n <= 50. If `n` is 1 or less, no further changes are made. Otherwise, `n` is greater than 1, `letter` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `i` is the smallest integer such that `i` = `initial_n` / 2 (rounded up), and `res` is a string where each character from 'A' onwards is repeated twice until the total length of the string equals `initial_n`, with the last character possibly being repeated once if `initial_n` is odd.***
