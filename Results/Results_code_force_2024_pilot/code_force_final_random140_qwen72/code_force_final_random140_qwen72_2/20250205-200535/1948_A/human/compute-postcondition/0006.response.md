The code snippet `func_1()` is called again, which means the function `func_1()` is executed once more. Since the initial state indicates that `func_1()` has already been called, calling it again does not change the state of any variables directly mentioned in the initial state. However, the initial state also specifies that `t` must be greater than 0 after being decremented by 1. This condition implies that `t` was originally at least 1 before the first call to `func_1()`. After the second call, if `t` is decremented again, it would now be at least 0 (assuming no other changes to `t`).

Since the initial state does not specify what `func_1()` does internally, we cannot determine if `t` is actually decremented by this function call. However, the condition that `t` must be greater than 0 after being decremented by 1 suggests that `t` is indeed decremented by `func_1()`. Therefore, after the second call, `t` would be 0 or greater.

Output State: **`t` is 0 or greater, `func_1()` has been called twice.**
