Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive) and greater than 1, `letter` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `i` is 1, `res` is 'AA' if `n` >= 2, otherwise `res` is 'A', `res` is updated to 'AAAABB' if `n` >= 2, otherwise `res` is updated to 'AABB'.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` is 1.
- The expression `i % 26` evaluates to `1 % 26`, which is 1.
- The character at index 1 in the string `letter` is 'B'.
- The expression `letter[i % 26] * 2` results in 'BB'.
- The value of `res` is initially 'AA' if `n` >= 2, otherwise it is 'A'.
- After executing `res += letter[i % 26] * 2`, `res` becomes 'AA' + 'BB' = 'AAAABB' if `n` >= 2, otherwise it becomes 'A' + 'BB' = 'AABB'.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
