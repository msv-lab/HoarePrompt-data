The code snippet `res += letter[i % 26]` appends the character at the index `i % 26` of the string `letter` to the string `res`. Given the initial state:

- `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive) and greater than 1.
- `letter` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'.
- `i` is 0.
- `res` is an empty string.
- `n` is less than 2 (which contradicts the first condition, so we assume `n` is greater than 1).

Let's calculate the new state:

- `i % 26` evaluates to `0 % 26`, which is 0.
- The character at index 0 of `letter` is 'A'.
- `res` is initially an empty string, so appending 'A' to it results in `res` being 'A'.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive) and greater than 1, `letter` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `i` is 0, `res` is 'A'.**
