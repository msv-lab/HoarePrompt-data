The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 0. Since the loop uses an underscore `_` as the iterator variable, it means the actual value of `_` is not used within the loop, and the loop simply runs `t` times.

At the start of the next iteration, `t` is decreased by 1 because the loop has already run once. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0 after being decremented.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0 (after being decremented by 1), `func_1()` has been called.**
