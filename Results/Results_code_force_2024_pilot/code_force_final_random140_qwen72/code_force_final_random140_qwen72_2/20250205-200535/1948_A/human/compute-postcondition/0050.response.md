The code snippet `ans += s[x] * 2` appends the character at index `x` of the string `s` repeated twice to the string `ans`.

- Initial value of `ans` is 'AA'.
- The value of `x` is 1.
- The string `s` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'.
- The character at index 1 of `s` is 'B'.

Therefore, `s[x] * 2` results in 'BB'. This is appended to `ans`, making `ans` equal to 'AABB'.

The other variables (`s`, `t`, `i`, `console screen`, `n`, `x`, `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, the console screen is cleared, `n` must be at least 4, `ans` is 'AABB', `x` is 1, `j` is 1**
