Output State: **`t` is an input integer.** 

Explanation: The value of `t` is updated to the integer value provided by the user input. The previous constraint that `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 50 is no longer explicitly enforced, but the new value of `t` will depend on the user's input.
