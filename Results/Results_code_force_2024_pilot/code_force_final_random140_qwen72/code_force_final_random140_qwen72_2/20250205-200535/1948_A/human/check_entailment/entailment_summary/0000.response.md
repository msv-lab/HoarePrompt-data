### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to generate a string of uppercase Latin letters with exactly `n` special characters, where a special character is defined as one that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
   - The string should be of length at most 200.
   - If no such string can be generated, we should output "NO".

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1`**:
     - Reads an integer `n` from input.
     - If `n` is 1 or less, it prints "NO" because a string with exactly 1 special character cannot be formed (a special character needs at least one neighbor).
     - If `n` is greater than 1, it prints "YES" and constructs a string by repeating each character from 'A' onwards twice until the total length of the string equals `n`, with the last character possibly being repeated once if `n` is odd.
     - This approach ensures that every character in the string is a special character, as each character is repeated at least once, and the string is constructed to have exactly `n` special characters.
   - **`func_2`**:
     - Reads an integer `t` from input, which represents the number of test cases.
     - Calls `func_1` exactly `t` times, handling each test case independently.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Handling of Edge Cases**:
     - For `n = 1`, the function correctly outputs "NO" because a string with exactly 1 special character is impossible.
     - For `n > 1`, the function constructs a valid string with exactly `n` special characters by repeating characters as needed.
   - **String Length**:
     - The constructed string will always be of length at most `200` because the maximum value of `n` is 50, and the function constructs the string by repeating characters up to twice.
   - **Multiple Test Cases**:
     - `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each test case.

Given the above analysis, the program meets the problem requirements and handles all edge cases correctly.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
