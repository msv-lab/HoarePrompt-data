Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input and Handling Test Cases:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case using a loop.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1()` to handle the specific case.

2. **Handling Each Test Case:**
   - In `func_1()`, the program reads the integer `n` from the input.
   - It checks if `n` is less than or equal to 1. If so, it prints "NO" because it is impossible to form a string with exactly 1 special character (a special character must have at least one neighbor).
   - If `n` is greater than 1, it prints "YES" and proceeds to construct the string.

3. **Constructing the String:**
   - The program uses a loop to construct the string `res` by repeating characters from the alphabet.
   - It ensures that each character is repeated twice to create special characters (since a special character is one that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors).
   - If `n` is odd, the last character is added only once to ensure the total number of special characters matches `n`.

4. **Output:**
   - The constructed string is printed, which will have exactly `n` special characters.
   - The length of the string is managed to ensure it does not exceed 200 characters, as required by the problem constraints.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where `n` is 1 by printing "NO".
   - It also handles larger values of `n` by constructing the appropriate string.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to meet all the requirements of the problem statement and handles all edge cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
