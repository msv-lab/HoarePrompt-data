### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The task is to generate a string with exactly `n` special characters, where a special character is defined as a character that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
   - The string should be of length at most 200.
   - If no such string exists, the output should be "NO".

2. **Function 1 Analysis**:
   - The function reads an integer `n` from input.
   - If `n` is less than or equal to 1, it prints "NO" because it's impossible to have a special character if `n` is 1 or 0.
   - Otherwise, it prints "YES".
   - It then constructs a string `res` by appending pairs of the same character (from the alphabet) until `n` is reduced to 0.
   - The loop ensures that the string is constructed using different letters from the alphabet to avoid creating more than one special character per pair.

3. **Function 2 Analysis**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1()` to handle the input and output for that specific `n`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - For `n = 1`, the function correctly outputs "NO" because it's impossible to have a single special character.
   - For `n = 2`, the function outputs "YES" followed by a string like "AA" which has exactly 2 special characters.
   - For larger values of `n`, the function continues to construct the string by adding pairs of the same character, ensuring that the number of special characters matches `n`.

5. **String Length**:
   - The maximum length of the string generated by the function is `2 * n` because it adds pairs of characters.
   - Since `n` is at most 50, the maximum length of the string is `100`, which is within the limit of 200.

6. **Correctness of Special Character Count**:
   - The function correctly ensures that each pair of characters added to the string contributes exactly 2 special characters.
   - The use of different letters from the alphabet ensures that no additional special characters are created beyond the intended count.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all edge cases and generates the required string for valid inputs. The logic is sound and the constraints are respected.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
