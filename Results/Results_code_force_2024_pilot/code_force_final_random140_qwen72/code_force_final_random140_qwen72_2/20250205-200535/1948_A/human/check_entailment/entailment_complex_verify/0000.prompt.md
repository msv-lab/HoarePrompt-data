You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

            i += 1
        print(res)

MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No input parameters are required for this function. The function reads an integer n from the standard input, where 1 <= n <= 50.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    if (n <= 1) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    else :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
        letter = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
        i = 0
        res = ''
        while n > 0:
            if n >= 2:
                res += letter[i % 26] * 2
                n -= 2
            else:
                res += letter[i % 26]
                n -= 1
            
            i += 1
            
        #State: `n` is 0, `letter` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `i` is the smallest integer such that `i` = `initial_n` / 2 (rounded up), `res` is a string where each character from 'A' onwards is repeated twice until the total length of the string equals `initial_n`, with the last character possibly being repeated once if `initial_n` is odd.
        print(res)
        #This is printed: (an empty string)
    #State: *No input parameters are required for this function. The variable `n` is an integer read from the standard input, where 1 <= n <= 50. If `n` is 1 or less, no further changes are made. Otherwise, `n` is greater than 1, `letter` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `i` is the smallest integer such that `i` = `initial_n` / 2 (rounded up), and `res` is a string where each character from 'A' onwards is repeated twice until the total length of the string equals `initial_n`, with the last character possibly being repeated once if `initial_n` is odd.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` from the standard input, where `1 <= n <= 50`. If `n` is 1 or less, it prints "NO" and exits. If `n` is greater than 1, it prints "YES" and constructs a string `res` by repeating each character from 'A' onwards twice until the total length of the string equals `n`, with the last character possibly being repeated once if `n` is odd. Finally, it prints the constructed string `res`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 50.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
        
    #State: `t` is 0 or greater, `func_1()` has been called `t` times.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `t` from the user input, where `t` is expected to be a positive integer between 1 and 50, inclusive. The function then calls `func_1` exactly `t` times. After the function concludes, `t` remains unchanged, and `func_1` has been executed `t` times. The function does not return any value.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program fails to handle the case when `n = 1`. According to the problem description, if `n = 1`, the output should be `NO` because it is impossible to construct a string where exactly one character is special (a special character must be equal to exactly one of its neighbors). However, the current implementation of `func_1` incorrectly prints `YES` and attempts to construct a string, which is not valid according to the problem description.

Example Input:
```
1
1
```

Expected Output:
```
NO
```

Actual Output:
```
YES
A
```

This clearly shows that the program does not meet the requirements for the case when `n = 1`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
