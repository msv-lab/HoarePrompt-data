Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
- The function `func_1` does not handle the case where `n == 1` correctly. According to the problem statement, a string with exactly one special character is impossible because a special character must be equal to exactly one of its neighbors, which requires at least two consecutive identical characters.
- The function `func_1` prints 'NO' for `n <= 1`, but it should specifically handle `n == 1` as a special case and print 'NO' for it.
- The function `func_1` does not ensure that the output string is of length at most 200, although the logic seems to generate strings that meet the criteria for the given constraints.

To fix these issues, the function `func_1` should be modified to explicitly handle the case where `n == 1` and ensure the output string length is within the specified limit. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    if n == 1:
        print('NO')
    elif n <= 0 or n > 50:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        letter = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
        i = 0
        res = ''
        while n > 0:
            if n >= 2:
                res += letter[i % 26] * 2
                n -= 2
            else:
                res += letter[i % 26]
                n -= 1
            i += 1
        print(res[:200])  # Ensure the string length is at most 200

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
```

With these changes, the program should correctly handle all edge cases and produce valid outputs.
