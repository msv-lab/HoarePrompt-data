The function reads an integer `n` from the standard input, where `1 <= n <= 50`. If `n` is 1 or less, it prints "NO" and exits. If `n` is greater than 1, it prints "YES" and constructs a string `res` by repeating each character from 'A' onwards twice until the total length of the string equals `n`, with the last character possibly being repeated once if `n` is odd. Finally, it prints the constructed string `res`.
