Precondition: **t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000), representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^4, 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋), and a list a of 2n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 · 10^4.**
