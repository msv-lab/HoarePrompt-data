The code `a = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` reads a line of input, splits it into parts separated by spaces, converts each part to an integer, and stores these integers in a list called `a`.

- The initial state includes `t` as an input integer between 1 and 5000, `q` as 0, `n` as an input integer, and `k` as an input integer.
- After executing the code, the variable `a` is now a list of integers derived from the input.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `q` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers from the input.**
