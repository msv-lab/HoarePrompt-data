The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `n` is greater than 1.
- The loop has just finished an iteration where `i` was some value.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be incremented by 1.
- `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

Given that `i` was previously less than `n`, and `i` is incremented by 1, the new state is:

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`**
