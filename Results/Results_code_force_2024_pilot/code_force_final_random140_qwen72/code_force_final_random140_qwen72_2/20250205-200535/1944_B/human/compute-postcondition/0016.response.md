Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `q` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is 0, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`, `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` starting from index `n` to the end of the list, `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is 0, `l` is an empty list, `i` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `k` was initially 0. Otherwise, `k` remains 2 times its original value, and `req` remains 2 times the original value of `k`.***
