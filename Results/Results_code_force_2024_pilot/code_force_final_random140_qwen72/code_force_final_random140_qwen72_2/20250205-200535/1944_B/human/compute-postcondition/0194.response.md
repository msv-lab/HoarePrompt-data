Output State: **`i` is `len(l) - 1`, `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `k` is `2 * (initial k - 2 * number_of_consecutive_equal_pairs_found_in_l)`, `q` is `t`, `t` is `t`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `b` is the first `n` elements of `a` sorted in ascending order, `c` is the elements of `a` starting from index `n` to the end, and `c` is now sorted in ascending order.**

Explanation:
- The value of `k` is updated to `2 * k`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The specific value of `k` after the update is `2 * (initial k - 2 * number_of_consecutive_equal_pairs_found_in_l)`.
