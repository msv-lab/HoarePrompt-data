The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was incremented to 2, and `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1 to 3, and `n` must still be greater than 3 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3**
