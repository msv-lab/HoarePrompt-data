Postcondition: ***`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, `ans1` contains elements, `k` is decreased, and `l` includes elements. If `b[i] == b[i - 1]`, `ans1` now includes elements including `b[3]` and `b[3]`, and `k` is decreased by 2. If `b[2]` is not in `ans1`, `l` also includes the element `b[2]`. If `k` is 0 at any point, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
