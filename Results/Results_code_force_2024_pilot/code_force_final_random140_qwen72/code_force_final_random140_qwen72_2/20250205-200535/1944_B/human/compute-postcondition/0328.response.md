The only object in the loop head is the variable `elem` and the list `rdb`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `rdb`. If `rdb` has at least one element, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 1`, and `rdb` contains at least zero elements. For the loop to execute one more time, `rdb` must have at least one element remaining. The variable `elem` will be set to the next element in `rdb`.

State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` contains at least one element, `T`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `ldb`, and `sng` remain unchanged. If `2 * k - sz >= 2`, `sz` is incremented by 2. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
