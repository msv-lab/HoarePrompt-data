Postcondition: ***`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` contains at least one element (all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their previous element), `T`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, and `rgt` remain unchanged, `ldb` has been fully iterated over, `sng` has been iterated over up to the point where `sz` reaches `2 * k` or the end of `sng` is reached. If `2 * k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, then `sz` is 2. Otherwise, if `2 * k - sz` is less than 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
