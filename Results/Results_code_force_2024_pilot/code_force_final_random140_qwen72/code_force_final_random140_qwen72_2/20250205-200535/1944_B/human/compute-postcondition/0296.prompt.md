Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After all iterations of the loop, `i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their previous element, `sz` is 0, and `sz` is increased by the number of iterations until it is greater than or equal to `2 * k` or until there are no more elements in `sng` to iterate over. The values of `T`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, and `rgt` remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for elem in ldb:
    if 2 * k - sz >= 2:
        print(elem, elem, end=' ')
        sz += 2
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their previous element, `T`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, and `rgt` remain unchanged, `ldb` must have at least one element, and `elem` is the first element in `ldb`. If `2 * k - sz >= 2`, then `sz` is updated to 2, and the current value of `2 * k - sz` is now `2 * k - 2`. If `2 * k - sz < 2`, then `sz` remains 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their previous element, `T`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, and `rgt` remain unchanged, `ldb` must have at least two elements, and `elem` is the second element in `ldb`. If `2 * k - sz >= 2`, then `sz` is updated to 2, and the current value of `2 * k - sz` is now `2 * k - 2`. If `2 * k - sz < 2`, then `sz` remains 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their previous element, `T`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, and `rgt` remain unchanged, `ldb` must have at least three elements, and `elem` is the third element in `ldb`. If `2 * k - sz >= 2`, then `sz` is updated to 2, and the current value of `2 * k - sz` is now `2 * k - 2`. If `2 * k - sz < 2`, then `sz` remains 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
