Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their previous element, `T`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, and `rgt` remain unchanged, `sz` is the minimum of `2 * k` or twice the number of elements in `ldb` plus 2, `ldb` has been fully iterated over, `sng` must be an iterable containing at least 3 elements, `elem` is the third element of `sng`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
