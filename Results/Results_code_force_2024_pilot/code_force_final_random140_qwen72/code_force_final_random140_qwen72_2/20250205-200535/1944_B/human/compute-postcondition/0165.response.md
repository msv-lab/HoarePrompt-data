To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects that are part of the loop head. In this case, the loop head involves the variable `i` and the list `l`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Head Variables:**
   - `i`: This is the loop variable that will iterate over the range of `len(l)`.
   - `l`: This is the list that the loop will iterate over.

2. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if `len(l)` is greater than 0. If `l` is an empty list, the loop will not run at all.

3. **Initial State Adjustments:**
   - `i` should start at 0, as it is the initial value for the loop variable.
   - `l` must have at least one element for the loop to execute at least once.

4. **Other Variables:**
   - `n`, `k`, and `ans2` are mentioned in the state but are not part of the loop head. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` should be 0.
- `l` must have at least one element.

### Final State:
State: **`i` is 0, `l` must have at least one element**
