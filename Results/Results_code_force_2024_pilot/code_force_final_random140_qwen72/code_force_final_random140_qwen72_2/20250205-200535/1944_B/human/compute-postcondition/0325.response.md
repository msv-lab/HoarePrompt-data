Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` contains at least zero elements, `T`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `ldb`, `sng`, and `sz` remain unchanged, `sz` is now `sz + 2`.** 

Explanation: The value of `sz` is incremented by 2, while all other variables (`i`, `rdb`, `T`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `ldb`, `sng`) remain unchanged. The initial state of `i` being `n - 1` and `rdb` containing at least zero elements also remains valid.
