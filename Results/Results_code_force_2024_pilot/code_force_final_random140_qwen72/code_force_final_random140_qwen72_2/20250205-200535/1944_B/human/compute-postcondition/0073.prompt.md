Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `q` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is 0, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`, `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` starting from index `n` to the end of the list, `ans1` contains pairs of elements from `b` where consecutive elements were equal, up to the point where `k` reached 0 or less, `ans2` is an empty list, `l` contains elements from `b` that were not added to `ans1` and are unique in the sequence. If `b[n - 1]` is not in `ans1`, then `l` also includes the last element of `b` (i.e., `b[n - 1]`).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if k == 0:
        break
    if c[i] == c[i - 1]:
        ans2.append(c[i])
        ans2.append(c[i])
        k -= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `q` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is -2, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`, `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` starting from index `n` to the end of the list, `ans1` contains pairs of elements from `b` where consecutive elements were equal, up to the point where `k` reached 0 or less, `ans2` may contain the current element `c[i]` and the next element `c[i]` if `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, `l` contains elements from `b` that were not added to `ans1` and are unique in the sequence. If `b[n - 1]` is not in `ans1`, then `l` also includes the last element of `b` (i.e., `b[n - 1]`). If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `q` is 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `k` is -2, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`, `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` starting from index `n` to the end of the list, `ans1` contains pairs of elements from `b` where consecutive elements were equal, up to the point where `k` reached 0 or less, `ans2` may contain the current element `c[i]` and the next element `c[i]` if `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, `l` contains elements from `b` that were not added to `ans1` and are unique in the sequence. If `b[n - 1]` is not in `ans1`, then `l` also includes the last element of `b` (i.e., `b[n - 1]`). If `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, `ans2` includes the element `c[2]` and `c[2]` again, and `i` remains 2. Otherwise, `ans2` does not change and `i` remains 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `q` is 0, `n` is greater than 3, `k` is -4, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`, `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` starting from index `n` to the end of the list, `ans1` contains pairs of elements from `b` where consecutive elements were equal, up to the point where `k` reached 0 or less, `l` contains elements from `b` that were not added to `ans1` and are unique in the sequence. If `b[n - 1]` is not in `ans1`, then `l` also includes the last element of `b` (i.e., `b[n - 1]`). If `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, `ans2` includes the element `c[3]` appended to its previous contents, and `i` is 3. If `c[i]` is not equal to `c[i - 1]`, `ans2` remains unchanged and `i` is 3. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
