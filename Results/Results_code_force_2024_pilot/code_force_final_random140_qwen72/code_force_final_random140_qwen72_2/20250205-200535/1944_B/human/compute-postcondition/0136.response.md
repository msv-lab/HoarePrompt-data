Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n - 1`, `k` will be reduced by 2 for each pair of consecutive equal elements found in `b`, and `ans1` will contain these pairs of equal elements. The list `l` will contain elements from `b` that were not added to `ans1` and are unique up to the last index `i` processed. If `k` reaches 0 at any point, the loop will terminate early.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n - 1`, so after all iterations, `i` will be `n - 1`.
- For each pair of consecutive equal elements in `b`, `k` is decreased by 2, and these elements are appended to `ans1` twice.
- If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]` and `b[i - 1]` is not already in `ans1`, `b[i - 1]` is appended to `l`.
- The loop terminates early if `k` reaches 0, meaning no further iterations are performed.
