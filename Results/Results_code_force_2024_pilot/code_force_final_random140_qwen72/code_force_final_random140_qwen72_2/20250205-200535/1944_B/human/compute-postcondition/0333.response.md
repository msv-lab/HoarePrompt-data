Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their previous element, `T`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, and `rgt` remain unchanged, `sz` is `min(2 * k, len(rdb) * 2)`, `ldb` has been fully iterated over, `sng` has been iterated over up to the point where `sz` reaches `2 * k` or the end of `sng` is reached.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each element in `rdb`.
- For each iteration, if `2 * k - sz >= 2`, it prints the element twice and increments `sz` by 2.
- The loop stops either when `2 * k - sz < 2` or when `rdb` is fully iterated over.
- Therefore, the final value of `sz` will be the minimum of `2 * k` and `len(rdb) * 2`, because each iteration increments `sz` by 2.
- All other variables (`i`, `rdb`, `T`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `ldb`, and `sng`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
