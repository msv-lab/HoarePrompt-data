Output State: **`i` is `len(l) - 1`, `ans1` contains all elements of `l`, `ans2` contains all elements of `l`, `k` is reduced by 2 for each pair of consecutive equal elements found in `l`, `q` is `t`, `t` is `t`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `b` is the first `n` elements of `a`.** 

Explanation: The code `b = a[:n]` creates a new list `b` that contains the first `n` elements of the list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
