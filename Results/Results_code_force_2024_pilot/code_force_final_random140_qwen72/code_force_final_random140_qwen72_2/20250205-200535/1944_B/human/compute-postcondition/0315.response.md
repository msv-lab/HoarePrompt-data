Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their previous element, `T`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, and `rgt` remain unchanged, `sz` is 0, `ldb` has been fully iterated over, `sng` has been iterated over up to the point where `sz` reaches `2 * k` or the end of `sng` is reached.**

Explanation: The code snippet sets `sz` to 0, overriding its previous value which was the minimum of `2 * k` or twice the number of elements in `ldb` plus the number of elements printed from `sng`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
