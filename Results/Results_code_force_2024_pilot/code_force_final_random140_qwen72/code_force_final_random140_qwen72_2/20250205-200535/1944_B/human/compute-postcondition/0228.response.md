Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `ans1` contains pairs of consecutive equal elements from `b` up to the point where `k` becomes 0 or there are no more consecutive equal elements, `k` is reduced by 2 for each pair of consecutive equal elements found, and `l` contains elements from `b` that are not in `ans1` and are not part of any consecutive equal pairs.**

### Explanation:
- **`i` is `n-1`:** The loop iterates from `1` to `n-1`, so after all iterations, `i` will be `n-1`.
- **`ans1` contains pairs of consecutive equal elements from `b`:** For each pair of consecutive equal elements in `b`, `ans1` will contain both elements, and `k` will be reduced by 2.
- **`k` is reduced by 2 for each pair of consecutive equal elements found:** The variable `k` is decremented by 2 each time a pair of consecutive equal elements is found and added to `ans1`.
- **`l` contains elements from `b` that are not in `ans1` and are not part of any consecutive equal pairs:** If an element in `b` is not part of a consecutive equal pair and is not already in `ans1`, it is added to `l`.

This output state reflects the final state of the variables after the loop has completed all its iterations.
