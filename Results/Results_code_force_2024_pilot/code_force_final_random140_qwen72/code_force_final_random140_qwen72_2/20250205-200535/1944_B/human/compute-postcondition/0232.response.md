Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `ans1` contains pairs of consecutive equal elements from `b` up to the point where `k` becomes 0 or there are no more consecutive equal elements, `k` is now `req`, `l` contains elements from `b` that are not in `ans1` and are not part of any consecutive equal pairs. If `b[n-1]` is not in `ans1`, the last element of `b` (i.e., `b[n-1]`) is included in `l`.**
