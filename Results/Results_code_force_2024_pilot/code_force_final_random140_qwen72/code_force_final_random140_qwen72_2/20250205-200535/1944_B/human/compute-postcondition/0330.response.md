Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` contains at least one element, `T`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `ldb`, and `sng` remain unchanged, `sz` is incremented by 2.**

Explanation: The code snippet `sz += 2` increments the value of `sz` by 2. All other variables (`i`, `rdb`, `T`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `ldb`, and `sng`) remain unchanged from their initial state. The condition `2 * k - sz >= 2` is not checked in the provided code snippet, so it does not affect the output state.
