To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the state of the object `rdb` since it is the only object in the loop head.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their previous element
- `T`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, and `rgt` remain unchanged
- `sz` is 0
- `ldb` has been fully iterated over
- `sng` has been iterated over up to the point where `sz` reaches `2 * k` or the end of `sng` is reached

For the loop to execute, `rdb` must contain at least one element. The other variables and conditions do not directly affect the loop's ability to execute based on the loop head.

Therefore, the adjusted state should ensure that `rdb` is not empty.

State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` contains at least one element (all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their previous element), `T`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, and `rgt` remain unchanged, `sz` is 0, `ldb` has been fully iterated over, `sng` has been iterated over up to the point where `sz` reaches `2 * k` or the end of `sng` is reached**
