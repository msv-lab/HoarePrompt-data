Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `q` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is 2 times the original value of `k`, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`, `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` starting from index `n` to the end of the list, `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is 2 times the original value of `k`, `l` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if k == 0:
        break
    if b[i] == b[i - 1]:
        ans1.append(b[i])
        ans1.append(b[i])
        k -= 2
    elif b[i - 1] not in ans1:
        l.append(b[i - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `q` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is either -2 or 0 depending on whether `b[i]` equals `b[i - 1]`, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`, `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` starting from index `n` to the end of the list, `ans1` contains the elements `b[1]` and `b[1]` if `b[i]` equals `b[i - 1]`, otherwise `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is 0, `l` may contain the element `b[i - 1]` if `b[i]` does not equal `b[i - 1]` and `b[i - 1]` is not in `ans1`, `i` is 1, and `b[i]` is either equal to or not equal to `b[i - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `q` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`, `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` starting from index `n` to the end of the list, `ans1` contains the elements `b[1]` and `b[1]` if `b[i]` equals `b[i - 1]`, otherwise `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is 0, `i` is 2, and `b[i]` is either equal to or not equal to `b[i - 1]`. If `b[i]` equals `b[i - 1]`, `k` is -2 and `ans1` contains `b[1]`, `b[1]`, and `b[2]`. If `b[i]` does not equal `b[i - 1]`, `k` is 0, and if `b[i - 1]` is not in `ans1`, `l` contains `b[1]`; otherwise, `l` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `q` is 0, `n` is greater than 3, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`, `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` starting from index `n` to the end of the list, `ans1` contains `b[1]`, `b[1]`, and `b[3]` if `b[i]` equals `b[i - 1]`, otherwise `ans1` contains `b[1]` and `b[3]` if `b[i]` does not equal `b[i - 1]`. `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is 0, `i` is 3, `b[i]` is either equal to or not equal to `b[i - 1]`. If `b[i]` equals `b[i - 1]`, `k` is -4 and `ans1` contains `b[1]`, `b[1]`, and `b[2]`. If `b[i]` does not equal `b[i - 1]`, `k` is -2, and if `b[i - 1]` is not in `ans1`, `l` contains `b[1]` and `b[2]`; otherwise, `l` remains unchanged. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
