To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `rdb` contains at least one element
- `T`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `ldb`, and `sng` remain unchanged
- If `2 * k - sz >= 2`, `sz` is incremented by 2. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(elem, elem, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variables and Objects:**
   - `elem` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. This means `elem` must be a variable that is defined somewhere in the code before this `print` statement is executed.
   - Since `elem` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value from the given information alone.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print` statement will print the value of `elem` twice, followed by a space (`end=' '`).

### Conclusion:
Given the lack of explicit information about the value of `elem`, we can only describe the output in general terms. The `print` statement will print the value of `elem` twice, separated by a space.

Output: **[elem] [elem] (where [elem] is the value of the variable `elem`)**
