To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the relevant variables:

1. **`i` is `n - 1`**: This indicates that `i` is set to the last index of some list or array of length `n`.

2. **`rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their previous element**: This means `rdb` is a list derived from `rgt` where each element is the same as the element immediately before it in `rgt`.

3. **`T`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, and `rgt` remain unchanged**: These variables are not modified and retain their initial values.

4. **`sz` is the minimum of `2 * k` or twice the number of elements in `ldb`**: This means `sz` is calculated as the smaller of `2 * k` and `2 * len(ldb)`.

5. **`ldb` has been fully iterated over**: This indicates that all elements in `ldb` have been processed.

6. **`sng` must be an iterable containing at least one element**: This ensures that `sng` is not empty and contains at least one element.

7. **`elem` is the first element of `sng`**: This means `elem` is the first element in the iterable `sng`.

8. **If `sz` is greater than or equal to `2 * k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement**: This condition affects the flow control but does not directly impact the `print` statement.

Given these conditions, the `print` statement is:
```python
print(elem, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- **`elem`**: Since `elem` is the first element of `sng`, and `sng` is guaranteed to contain at least one element, `elem` will be the first element of `sng`.

- **`end=' '`**: This parameter in the `print` function ensures that the output is followed by a space instead of a newline.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will print the first element of `sng` followed by a space.

Output: **[elem] (where elem is the first element of sng)**
