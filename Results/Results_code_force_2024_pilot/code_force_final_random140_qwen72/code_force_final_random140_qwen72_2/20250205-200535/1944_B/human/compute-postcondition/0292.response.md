To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the relevant variables:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n - 1`.
   - `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their previous element.
   - `T`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, and `rgt` remain unchanged.
   - `ldb` must have at least three elements.
   - `elem` is the third element in `ldb`.
   - If `2 * k - sz >= 2`, then `sz` is updated to 2, and the current value of `2 * k - sz` is now `2 * k - 2`.
   - If `2 * k - sz < 2`, then `sz` remains 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(elem, elem, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement prints the value of `elem` twice, followed by a space (`end=' '`).
   - `elem` is defined as the third element in the list `ldb`.

Given that `ldb` must have at least three elements, `elem` is the third element in `ldb`. Since the exact values of `ldb` are not provided, we can only describe `elem` in terms of its position in the list.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be:
Output: **elem elem (where elem is the third element in the list ldb)**
