Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their previous element
- `T`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, and `rgt` remain unchanged
- `sz` is the minimum of `2 * k` or twice the number of elements in `ldb` plus 1
- `ldb` has been fully iterated over
- `sng` must be an iterable containing at least two elements
- `elem` is the second element of `sng`
- If `sz` is greater than or equal to `2 * k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement

### Print Statement:
```python
print(elem, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- `sng` is an iterable containing at least two elements.
- `elem` is the second element of `sng`.

Given this information, the print statement will print the second element of `sng` followed by a space (since `end=' '`).

### Output:
Output: **[elem] (where elem is the second element of the iterable sng)**
