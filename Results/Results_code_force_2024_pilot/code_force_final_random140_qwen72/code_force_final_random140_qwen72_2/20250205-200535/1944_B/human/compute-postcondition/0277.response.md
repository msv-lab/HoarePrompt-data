The function `func` accepts no parameters directly but operates under the constraints provided for multiple test cases. For each test case, it considers two integers `n` and `k`, and a list `a` of 2n integers, where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. The function processes these inputs according to the given constraints and returns a result for each test case.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n` and `k`, and a list `a` of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. It returns a result for each test case based on the processing of these inputs.**
