Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their previous element, `T`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, and `rgt` remain unchanged, `sz` is `min(2 * k, len(rdb) * 2) + min(2 * k - min(2 * k, len(rdb) * 2), len(sng))`, `ldb` has been fully iterated over, `sng` has been iterated over up to the point where `sz` reaches `2 * k` or the end of `sng` is reached.**

### Explanation:
- **`i` is `n - 1`**: This value remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- **`rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their previous element**: This value also remains unchanged.
- **`T`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, and `rgt` remain unchanged**: These variables are not modified within the loop.
- **`sz` is `min(2 * k, len(rdb) * 2) + min(2 * k - min(2 * k, len(rdb) * 2), len(sng))`**: 
  - Initially, `sz` is set to `min(2 * k, len(rdb) * 2)`.
  - The loop increments `sz` by 1 for each iteration until `sz` reaches `2 * k` or the end of `sng` is reached.
  - The final value of `sz` is the initial value plus the number of iterations that occurred, which is the minimum of `2 * k - min(2 * k, len(rdb) * 2)` and the length of `sng`.
- **`ldb` has been fully iterated over**: This condition remains true as it was already stated in the initial state.
- **`sng` has been iterated over up to the point where `sz` reaches `2 * k` or the end of `sng` is reached**: The loop iterates over `sng` until either `sz` reaches `2 * k` or there are no more elements in `sng` to iterate over.
