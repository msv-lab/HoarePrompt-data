The code snippet `ans1.append(l[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `l` to the list `ans1`. Given that `i` is 3, the element `l[3]` is appended to `ans1`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `q` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is 0 or less, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`, `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` starting from index `n` to the end of the list, `ans1` now contains pairs of elements from `b` where consecutive elements were equal, up to the point where `k` reached 0 or less, plus the elements `l[0]`, `l[1]`, and `l[3]`, `ans2` now contains pairs of elements from `c` where consecutive elements were equal, up to the point where `k` reached 0 or less, plus the elements `l[0]` and `l[2]`, `l` must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 3. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
