Let's analyze the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n - 1`.
   - `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their previous element.
   - `T`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, and `rgt` remain unchanged.
   - `sz` is the minimum of `2 * k` or twice the number of elements in `ldb` plus 2.
   - `ldb` has been fully iterated over.
   - `sng` must be an iterable containing at least 3 elements.
   - `elem` is the third element of `sng`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(elem, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `elem` is explicitly defined as the third element of the iterable `sng`.
   - Since `sng` is guaranteed to contain at least 3 elements, `elem` will always be a valid reference to the third element of `sng`.

4. **Output:**
   - The print statement will print the third element of `sng` followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **[elem] (where elem is the third element of the iterable sng)**
