To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head, which in this case is `elem` and `ldb`.

### Analysis:
- **`elem`**: This variable will take on the value of each element in `ldb` during each iteration of the loop.
- **`ldb`**: This is the collection (list, array, etc.) that the loop iterates over.

For the loop to execute, `ldb` must contain at least one element. If `ldb` is empty, the loop will not run at all.

### Given State:
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their previous element
- `sz` is 0 and is increased by the number of iterations until it is greater than or equal to `2 * k` or until there are no more elements in `sng` to iterate over
- `T`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, and `rgt` remain unchanged

### Adjusted State:
- To ensure the loop executes, `ldb` must have at least one element.
- `elem` will be the first element in `ldb`.

### Final State:
State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their previous element, `sz` is 0, `T`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, and `rgt` remain unchanged, `ldb` must have at least one element, `elem` is the first element in `ldb`**
