Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, `ans2` contains the elements at index 3 and index `i` (which is 3) of `c`, if `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.** 

Explanation: The code appends the element at index `i` (which is 3) of the list `c` to the list `ans2`. Since `ans2` already contained the element at index 3 of `c`, it now contains two identical elements from index 3 of `c`. The other conditions (`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, and if `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement) remain unchanged.
