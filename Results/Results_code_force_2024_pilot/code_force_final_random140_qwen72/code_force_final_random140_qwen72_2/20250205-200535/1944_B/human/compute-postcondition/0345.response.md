The only object in the loop head is the variable `elem` and the iterable `sng`. The loop's ability to execute again depends on whether there are more elements in `sng` to iterate over.

At the end of the last iteration, `elem` was the next element in `sng`, and it is stated that `sng` must have at least one element remaining to iterate over. For the loop to execute one more time, `sng` must still have at least one element left, and `elem` will be the next element in `sng`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `sng` still has elements to iterate over, and `elem` will be set to the next element in `sng`.

State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their previous element, `T`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, and `rgt` remain unchanged, `sz` is `min(2 * k, len(rdb) * 2) + 2`, `ldb` has been fully iterated over, `sng` must have at least one element remaining to iterate over, `elem` is the next element in `sng`**
