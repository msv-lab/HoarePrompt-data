Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `q` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the input split by space, `k` is the second integer from the input split by space, `a` is now a list of integers from the new input, `b` is a list containing the first `n` elements of the updated `a`, `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of the updated `a` starting from index `n` to the end of the list, `ans1` contains pairs of elements from `b` where consecutive elements were equal, up to the point where `k` reached 0 or less, plus all elements from `l` that were processed before `k` became 0 or less, `ans2` contains pairs of elements from `c` where consecutive elements were equal, up to the point where `k` reached 0 or less, plus all elements from `l` that were processed before `k` became 0 or less, `l` has been fully iterated over, and `i` is the length of `l`.**
