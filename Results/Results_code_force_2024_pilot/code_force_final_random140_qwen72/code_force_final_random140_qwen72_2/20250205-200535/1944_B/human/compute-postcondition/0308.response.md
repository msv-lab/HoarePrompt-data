The only objects in the loop head are `elem` and `sng`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `sng` list. If `sng` has at least 3 elements, the loop can execute again for the third element. At the end of the last iteration, `sng` must be an iterable containing at least two elements, and `elem` is the second element of `sng`. For the loop to execute one more time, `sng` must have at least 3 elements, and `elem` will be the third element of `sng`.

State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their previous element, `T`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, and `rgt` remain unchanged, `sz` is the minimum of `2 * k` or twice the number of elements in `ldb` plus 2, `ldb` has been fully iterated over, `sng` must be an iterable containing at least 3 elements, `elem` is the third element of `sng`.**
