Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their previous element, `T`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, and `rgt` remain unchanged, `sz` is the minimum of `2 * k` or twice the number of elements in `ldb`, and `ldb` has been fully iterated over.**

### Explanation:
- **`i` is `n - 1`**: This remains unchanged as specified in the initial state.
- **`rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their previous element**: This also remains unchanged.
- **`T`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, and `rgt` remain unchanged**: These variables are not modified within the loop.
- **`sz` is the minimum of `2 * k` or twice the number of elements in `ldb`**: The loop increments `sz` by 2 for each iteration until either `sz` reaches `2 * k` or there are no more elements in `ldb` to process.
- **`ldb` has been fully iterated over**: The loop will continue to iterate over `ldb` until either `sz` reaches `2 * k` or all elements in `ldb` have been processed.
