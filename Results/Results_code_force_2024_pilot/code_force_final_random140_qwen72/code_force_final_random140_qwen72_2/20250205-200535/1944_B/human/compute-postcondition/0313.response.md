Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their previous element, `T`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, and `rgt` remain unchanged, `sz` is the minimum of `2 * k` or twice the number of elements in `ldb` plus the number of elements printed from `sng`, `ldb` has been fully iterated over, `sng` has been iterated over up to the point where `sz` reaches `2 * k` or the end of `sng` is reached.**

In natural language, this means:
- The variable `i` remains at `n - 1`.
- The list `rdb` still contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their previous element.
- The variables `T`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, and `rgt` are unchanged.
- The variable `sz` is updated to the minimum of `2 * k` or the sum of twice the number of elements in `ldb` plus the number of elements printed from `sng`.
- The list `ldb` has been fully iterated over.
- The iterable `sng` has been iterated over until either `sz` reaches `2 * k` or the end of `sng` is reached.
