Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their previous element.
- `T`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, and `rgt` remain unchanged.
- `sz` is `min(2 * k, len(rdb) * 2) + 2`.
- `ldb` has been fully iterated over.
- `sng` must have at least one element remaining to iterate over.
- `elem` is the next element in `sng`.
- If `sz` is greater than or equal to `2 * k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(elem, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `elem` is the next element in the iterator `sng`.
- The `end=' '` parameter in the `print` function ensures that the output is followed by a space instead of a newline.

### Determining the Output:
- Since `sng` must have at least one element remaining to iterate over, `elem` will be the next element in `sng`.
- The exact value of `elem` is not specified in the initial state, but it is the next element in the iterator `sng`.

### Final Output:
Output: **elem (where elem is the next element in the iterator sng)**
