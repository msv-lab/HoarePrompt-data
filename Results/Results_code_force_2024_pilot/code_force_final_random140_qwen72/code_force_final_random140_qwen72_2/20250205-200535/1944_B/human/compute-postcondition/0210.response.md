The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` is 1
- `n` is greater than 1

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 (since the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration), making `i` equal to 2. For the loop to continue executing, `n` must still be greater than `i`, which means `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2**
