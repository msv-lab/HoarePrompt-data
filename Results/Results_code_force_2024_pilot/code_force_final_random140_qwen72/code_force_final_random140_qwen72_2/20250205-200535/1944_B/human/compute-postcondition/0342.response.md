Postcondition: ***`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their previous element, `T`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, and `rgt` remain unchanged, `sz` is `min(2 * k, len(rdb) * 2) + 1`, `ldb` has been fully iterated over, `sng` must have at least one element remaining to iterate over, `elem` is the next element in `sng`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `2 * k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
