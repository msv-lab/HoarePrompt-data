Functionality: ** The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by a list `lst` of integers of length 2n, where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, and an integer `k` such that 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋. For each test case, it splits `lst` into two halves, sorts them, and then prints pairs of elements from these halves. Specifically, it prints pairs of duplicate elements from the sorted halves and single elements from the sorted halves, ensuring that the total number of elements printed is the largest even number less than or equal to `2 * k`. The function does not return any value; its primary action is to print the results to the console. After processing all test cases, the state of the program includes the printed results and the internal variables used for processing (such as `ldb`, `rdb`, and `sng`) being reset for each test case. **
