Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `q` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the input split by space, `k` is now 2 times the second integer from the input split by space, `a` is now a list of integers from the new input, `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of the updated `a`, `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of the updated `a` starting from index `n` to the end of the list, `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `l` is an empty list, `i` is the length of `l`, `req` is equal to `k`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if k == 0:
        break
    if b[i] == b[i - 1]:
        ans1.append(b[i])
        ans1.append(b[i])
        k -= 2
    elif b[i - 1] not in ans1:
        l.append(b[i - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is greater than 1. If `k` is 0 at any point, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, `k` is decreased by 2 and `ans1` now includes the value of `b[i]` twice. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, `b[i - 1]` is checked for presence in `ans1`; if not present, `l` now includes the element `b[i - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is greater than 1, `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`. If `b[i] == b[i - 1]`, `k` is -2, and `ans1` now includes the element `b[i]` at the current index `i`. If `b[i] != b[i - 1]` and `b[i - 1]` is not in `ans1`, `l` now includes the element `b[i - 1]`. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is greater than 1, `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`. If `b[i]` equals `b[i - 1]`, `ans1` is updated by appending the element `b[i]`, and `k` is decreased by 2. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `b[i]` does not equal `b[i - 1]` and `b[i - 1]` is not in `ans1`, `l` is updated by appending the element at index `i-1` of `b`. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
