Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n - 1`, `k` will be reduced by 2 for each pair of consecutive equal elements found in `b`, and `ans1` will contain these pairs of equal elements. The list `l` will contain elements from `b` that were not added to `ans1` and are unique up to the last index `i` processed, including the last element `b[n - 1]`. If `k` reaches 0 at any point, the loop will terminate early. The last element of `b` (i.e., `b[n - 1]`) is now included in `l`.**
