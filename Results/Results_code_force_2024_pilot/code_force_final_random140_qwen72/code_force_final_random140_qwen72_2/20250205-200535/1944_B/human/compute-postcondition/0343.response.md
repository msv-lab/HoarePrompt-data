Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their previous element.
- `T`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, and `rgt` remain unchanged.
- `sz` is `min(2 * k, len(rdb) * 2) + 1`.
- `ldb` has been fully iterated over.
- `sng` must have at least one element remaining to iterate over.
- `elem` is the next element in `sng`.
- If `sz` is greater than or equal to `2 * k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Given this context, the `print` statement is:

```python
print(elem, end=' ')
```

### Explanation:
- `elem` is the next element in the iterator `sng`. Since `sng` must have at least one element remaining to iterate over, `elem` will be the next available element from `sng`.
- The `end=' '` parameter in the `print` function ensures that the output is followed by a space rather than a newline.

### Output:
Output: **[elem] (where elem is the next element in the iterator sng)**

This means that the value of `elem` will be printed, followed by a space. The exact value of `elem` depends on the current state of the iterator `sng`.
