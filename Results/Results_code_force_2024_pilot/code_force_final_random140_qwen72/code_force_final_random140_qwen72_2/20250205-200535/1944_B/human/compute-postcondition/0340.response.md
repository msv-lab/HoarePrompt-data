The only object in the loop head is the variable `elem` and the iterable `sng`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the state of `sng`. For the loop to execute one more time, `sng` must have at least one more element to iterate over, and `elem` will be set to the next element in `sng`.

At the end of the last iteration, `sng` must have at least one element remaining to iterate over, and `elem` is the next element in `sng`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `sng` must still have at least one element remaining to iterate over, and `elem` will be updated to the next element in `sng`.

State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their previous element, `T`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, and `rgt` remain unchanged, `sz` is `min(2 * k, len(rdb) * 2) + 1`, `ldb` has been fully iterated over, `sng` must have at least one element remaining to iterate over, `elem` is the next element in `sng`**
