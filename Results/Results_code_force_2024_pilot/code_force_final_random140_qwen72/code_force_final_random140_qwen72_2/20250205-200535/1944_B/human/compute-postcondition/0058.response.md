Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `q` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is -2, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a`, `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` starting from index `n` to the end of the list, `ans1` contains pairs of elements from `b` where consecutive elements were equal, up to the point where `k` reached 0 or less, `ans2` may contain the current element `c[i]` and the next element `c[i]` if `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, `l` contains elements from `b` that were not added to `ans1` and are unique in the sequence. If `b[n - 1]` is not in `ans1`, then `l` also includes the last element of `b` (i.e., `b[n - 1]`). If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
