Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their previous element, `sz` is 0, `T`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, and `rgt` remain unchanged, `ldb` must have at least one element, `elem` is the first element in `ldb`, `2 * k - sz < 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
