Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their previous element
- `T`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, and `rgt` remain unchanged
- `ldb` must have at least two elements
- `elem` is the second element in `ldb`
- If `2 * k - sz >= 2`, then `sz` is updated to 2, and the current value of `2 * k - sz` is now `2 * k - 2`
- If `2 * k - sz < 2`, then `sz` remains 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement

### Print Statement:
```python
print(elem, elem, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement is printing the value of `elem` twice, followed by a space (`end=' '`).
- `elem` is defined as the second element in the list `ldb`.

### Output:
- Since `elem` is the second element in `ldb`, and it is printed twice with a space in between, the output will be:
  - `elem elem ` (where `elem` is the second element in `ldb`).

### Final Output:
Output: **elem elem ** (where `elem` is the second element in `ldb`)
