Output State: **`i` is `i_prev + 2`, `n` must be greater than `i_prev + 2`. If `c[i] == c[i - 1]`, `ans2` now includes the elements `c[i_prev + 1]`, `c[i_prev + 1]`, and `c[i]`, and `k` is `k - 2`. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `c[i] != c[i - 1]`, `ans2` now includes the element `c[i]`, and no changes are made to `k`. Regardless of the condition, if `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
