Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their previous element, `T`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, and `rgt` remain unchanged, `sz` is the minimum of `2 * k` or twice the number of elements in `ldb` plus 2, `ldb` has been fully iterated over, `sng` must be an iterable containing at least two elements, `elem` is the second element of `sng`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `2 * k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.** 

Explanation:
- The value of `sz` is incremented by 1, changing from the minimum of `2 * k` or twice the number of elements in `ldb` plus 1 to the minimum of `2 * k` or twice the number of elements in `ldb` plus 2.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
