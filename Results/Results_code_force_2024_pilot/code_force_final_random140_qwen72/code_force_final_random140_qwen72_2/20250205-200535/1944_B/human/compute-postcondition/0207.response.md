The code appends the value of `b[i - 1]` to the list `l`. Since `i` is 1, `b[i - 1]` refers to `b[0]`. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is 0, `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, `b[i - 1]` (which is `b[0]`) is not in the list `ans1`, and `l` now includes `b[0]`.**
