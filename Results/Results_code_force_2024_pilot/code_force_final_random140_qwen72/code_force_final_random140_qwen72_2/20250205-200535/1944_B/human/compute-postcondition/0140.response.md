Output State: **`k` is now equal to `req`, `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `k` will be reduced by 2 for each pair of consecutive equal elements found in `b`, and `ans1` will contain these pairs of equal elements. The list `l` will contain elements from `b` that were not added to `ans1` and are unique up to the last index `i` processed. If `k` reaches 0 at any point, the loop will terminate early. Additionally, if the last element `b[n - 1]` is not in `ans1`, it will be included in `l`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `k` is updated to the value of `req`.
- The values of `i`, `k`, `ans1`, and `l` remain as described in the initial state, with `k` being the only variable whose value has changed due to the assignment `k = req`.
