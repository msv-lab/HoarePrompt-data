Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is set to `len(l) - 1`, which means `i` is the last index of the list `l`.
- `ans1` is a list containing all elements of `l`.
- `ans2` is also a list containing all elements of `l`.
- `k` is 0 if the loop did not break early, but this variable is not used in the `print` statement.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(*ans1)
```

This statement will print all elements of the list `ans1`, separated by spaces. Since `ans1` contains all elements of `l`, the output will be the same as printing all elements of `l`.

Output: **all elements of l separated by spaces**
