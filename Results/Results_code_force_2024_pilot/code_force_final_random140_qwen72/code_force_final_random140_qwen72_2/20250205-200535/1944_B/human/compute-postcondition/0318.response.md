To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the context provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n - 1`.
   - `rdb` contains at least one element (all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their previous element).
   - `T`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, and `rgt` remain unchanged.
   - `sz` is 0.
   - `ldb` has been fully iterated over.
   - `sng` has been iterated over up to the point where `sz` reaches `2 * k` or the end of `sng` is reached.
   - The current value of `2 * k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(elem, elem, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement prints two instances of the variable `elem` followed by a space (`end=' '`).
   - The variable `elem` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it must be defined somewhere in the code before this `print` statement is executed.
   - Given the context, `elem` is likely an element from one of the lists or variables mentioned in the initial state. Since `rdb` contains elements from `rgt` that are equal to their previous element, and `rdb` is non-empty, `elem` could be an element from `rdb`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since `elem` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we can infer that `elem` is an element from `rdb`.
   - The `print` statement will print the value of `elem` twice followed by a space.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **elem elem (where elem is an element from the list rdb)**
