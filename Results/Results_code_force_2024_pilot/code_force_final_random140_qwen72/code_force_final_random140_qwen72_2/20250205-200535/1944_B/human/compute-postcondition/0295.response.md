Postcondition: ***`i` is `n - 1`, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are equal to their previous element, `T`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, and `rgt` remain unchanged, `ldb` must have at least three elements, and `elem` is the third element in `ldb`. If `2 * k - sz >= 2`, then `sz` is updated to 2, and the current value of `2 * k - sz` is now `2 * k - 2`. If `2 * k - sz < 2`, then `sz` remains 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
