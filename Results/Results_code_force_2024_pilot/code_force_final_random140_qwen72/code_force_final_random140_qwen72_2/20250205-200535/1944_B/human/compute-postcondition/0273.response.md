Output State: **`i` is `len(l) - 1`, `ans1` is a list containing all elements of `l`, `ans2` is a list containing all elements of `l`, and `k` is 0 if the loop did not break early.**

Explanation:
- `i` will be `len(l) - 1` because the loop iterates over all elements of `l`, and the last index accessed is `len(l) - 1`.
- `ans1` will contain all elements of `l` because each element of `l` is appended to `ans1` once per iteration.
- `ans2` will also contain all elements of `l` because each element of `l` is appended to `ans2` once per iteration.
- `k` will be 0 if the loop did not break early, meaning it completed all iterations without `k` reaching 0 before the end. If `k` did reach 0 before the end, the loop would have broken early, and `i` would be the index where `k` became 0. However, since the question specifies the loop completes all iterations, `k` must have been 0 at the end of the loop.
