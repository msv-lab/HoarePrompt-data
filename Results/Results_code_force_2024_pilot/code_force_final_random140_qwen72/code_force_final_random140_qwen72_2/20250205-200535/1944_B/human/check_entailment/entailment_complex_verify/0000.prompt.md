You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length 2n , consisting of each integer from 1 to n
exactly twice.

You are also given an integer k (1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

You need to find two arrays l and r each of length \mathbf{2k} such that:

  * l is a subset^\dagger of [a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n] 
  * r is a subset of [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \ldots a_{2n}] 
  * [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r ; in other words, l_1 \oplus l_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus l_{2k} = r_1 \oplus r_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus r_{2k} 

It can be proved that at least one pair of l and r always exists. If there are
multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subset of a sequence y if x can be obtained by
deleting several (possibly none or all) elements of y and rearranging the
elements in any order. For example, [3,1,2,1] , [1, 2, 3] , [1, 1] and [3, 2]
are subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3] but [4] and [2, 2] are not subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3]
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 2 integers n and k (2 \le n \le 5
\cdot 10^4 , 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} (1 \le a_i \le n
). It is guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^4 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line of output, output 2k integers l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_{2k} .

On the second line of output, output 2k integers r_1, r_2, \ldots r_{2k} .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Note

In the first test case, we choose l=[2,1] and r=[2,1] . [2, 1] is a subset of
[a_1, a_2] and [2, 1] is a subset of [a_3, a_4] , and 2 \oplus 1 = 2 \oplus 1
= 3 .

In the second test case, 6 \oplus 4 = 1 \oplus 3 = 2 .

    #State: After all iterations, `q` is `t - 1`, `n` is the last input integer for the final test case, `k` is 0 or less, `a` is the list of integers from the input for the final test case, `b` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `a` for the final test case, `c` is a sorted list containing the elements of `a` starting from index `n` to the end of the list for the final test case, `ans1` contains pairs of elements from `b` where consecutive elements were equal, up to the point where `k` reached 0 or less, plus all elements from `l` that were processed before `k` became 0 or less, `ans2` contains pairs of elements from `c` where consecutive elements were equal, up to the point where `k` reached 0 or less, plus all elements from `l` that were processed before `k` became 0 or less, `l` has been fully iterated over, and `i` is the length of `l`. If `k` is 0, the loop terminates early.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `k`, and a list `a` of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. For each test case, it splits the list `a` into two halves, sorts both halves, and then selects pairs of equal elements from these halves to form two lists `ans1` and `ans2`. The function ensures that each selected pair contributes to reducing the value of `k` by 2 until `k` reaches 0 or fewer. Any remaining elements that were not paired are also added to `ans1` and `ans2`. Finally, the function prints the contents of `ans1` and `ans2` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with the final state of the program reflecting the last test case processed.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has a few issues that prevent it from meeting the problem description for every potential case. Here are the specific issues:

1. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The program does not handle the case where the required number of pairs (2k) cannot be found in the sorted halves `b` and `c`. This can happen if the pairs are not available in the sorted halves, leading to an incorrect solution.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Pairing Elements**: The program attempts to pair elements by checking if consecutive elements in the sorted halves are equal. However, this approach may not always find the required number of pairs, especially when the elements are distributed differently in the two halves.

3. **Potential Missing Pairs**: The program uses a list `l` to store elements that are not paired in the first half. However, it does not ensure that these elements are correctly paired in the second half, which can lead to incorrect results.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
1
4 1
1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4
```
Expected Output:
```
1 2
1 2
```
or any other valid pair of subsets.

Actual Output:
The program might output:
```
1 2
3 4
```
which is incorrect because the XOR of `1 2` is `3`, and the XOR of `3 4` is `7`, and they are not equal.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle all potential cases correctly, leading to incorrect results in some scenarios. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
