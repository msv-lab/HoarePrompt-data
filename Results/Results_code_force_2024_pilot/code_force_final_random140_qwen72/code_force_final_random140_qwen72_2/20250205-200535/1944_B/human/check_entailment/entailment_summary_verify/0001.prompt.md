You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length 2n , consisting of each integer from 1 to n
exactly twice.

You are also given an integer k (1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

You need to find two arrays l and r each of length \mathbf{2k} such that:

  * l is a subset^\dagger of [a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n] 
  * r is a subset of [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \ldots a_{2n}] 
  * [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r ; in other words, l_1 \oplus l_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus l_{2k} = r_1 \oplus r_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus r_{2k} 

It can be proved that at least one pair of l and r always exists. If there are
multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subset of a sequence y if x can be obtained by
deleting several (possibly none or all) elements of y and rearranging the
elements in any order. For example, [3,1,2,1] , [1, 2, 3] , [1, 1] and [3, 2]
are subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3] but [4] and [2, 2] are not subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3]
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 2 integers n and k (2 \le n \le 5
\cdot 10^4 , 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} (1 \le a_i \le n
). It is guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^4 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line of output, output 2k integers l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_{2k} .

On the second line of output, output 2k integers r_1, r_2, \ldots r_{2k} .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Note

In the first test case, we choose l=[2,1] and r=[2,1] . [2, 1] is a subset of
[a_1, a_2] and [2, 1] is a subset of [a_3, a_4] , and 2 \oplus 1 = 2 \oplus 1
= 3 .

In the second test case, 6 \oplus 4 = 1 \oplus 3 = 2 .

- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `k`, and a list `a` of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. For each test case, it splits the list `a` into two halves, sorts both halves, and then selects pairs of equal elements from these halves to form two lists `ans1` and `ans2`. The function ensures that each selected pair contributes to reducing the value of `k` by 2 until `k` reaches 0 or fewer. Any remaining elements that were not paired are also added to `ans1` and `ans2`. Finally, the function prints the contents of `ans1` and `ans2` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with the final state of the program reflecting the last test case processed.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the array `a` of length `2n`.

2. **Splitting the Array:**
   - The array `a` is split into two halves: `b` (first half) and `c` (second half).

3. **Sorting the Halves:**
   - Both `b` and `c` are sorted. This ensures that identical elements are adjacent, which is useful for finding pairs.

4. **Finding Pairs in `b`:**
   - The function initializes `ans1` and `ans2` as empty lists.
   - It iterates through the sorted `b` array to find pairs of identical elements. Each pair is added to `ans1` and the count `k` is decremented by 2.
   - If a pair is found, it is added to `ans1` and the count `k` is reduced.
   - If no pair is found, the element is added to a temporary list `l`.

5. **Finding Pairs in `c`:**
   - The function resets `k` to its original value (`req`).
   - It iterates through the sorted `c` array to find pairs of identical elements. Each pair is added to `ans2` and the count `k` is decremented by 2.
   - If a pair is found, it is added to `ans2` and the count `k` is reduced.

6. **Filling Remaining Elements:**
   - If there are still elements needed to fill `ans1` and `ans2` to the required length `2k`, the function uses the elements from the temporary list `l` to fill both `ans1` and `ans2`.

7. **Output:**
   - The function prints the elements of `ans1` and `ans2`.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of Pair Finding:**
  - The function correctly identifies pairs of identical elements in both `b` and `c` and adds them to `ans1` and `ans2`.
  - If pairs are not found, it uses the remaining elements from `l` to ensure that both `ans1` and `ans2` have the required length `2k`.

- **XOR Condition:**
  - The function ensures that the XOR of elements in `ans1` is equal to the XOR of elements in `ans2` by using pairs of identical elements. The XOR of identical elements is 0, and adding the same elements to both lists maintains the balance.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The function handles edge cases where `k` is 1 or when there are no pairs in one of the halves by using the remaining elements from `l`.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It ensures that the subsets `l` and `r` meet the required conditions and outputs valid results for the given constraints.
