The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `k`, and `x`, and an array `a` of length `n`. It calculates the maximum possible sum of the array after performing two operations: removing up to `k` elements and multiplying up to `x` elements by -1. The function prints the maximum sum for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function leaves the variables `n`, `k`, and `x` with their values from the last test case, `a` as a sorted list in descending order from the last test case, and `sum1` as the sum of the elements in `a` from the last test case. The list `ans` contains the results of the calculations for the last test case, and the loop variable `i` and the sum `sums` hold their final values from the last iteration of the inner loop for the last test case.
