### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, and `x`, followed by the array `a`.

2. **Sorting and Reversing**: The array `a` is sorted in descending order using `a.sort()` followed by `a.reverse()`. This ensures that the largest elements are considered first, which is important for the subsequent operations.

3. **Initial Sum Calculation**: The initial sum of the array `sum1` is calculated using `sum(a)`.

4. **Optimal Strategy Calculation**:
   - The function iterates over possible values of `i` from 0 to `k` (inclusive). Each value of `i` represents the number of elements Alice removes.
   - For each `i`, the function calculates the sum after Bob multiplies at most `x` elements by -1.
   - If `i` is 0, the sum is calculated as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`. This means Bob multiplies the first `x + 1` elements by -1. However, this is incorrect because Bob should multiply the smallest `x` elements by -1, not the first `x + 1` elements.
   - For other values of `i`, the function updates the sum by adding the `i-1`-th element and subtracting twice the `i + x - 1`-th element. This logic is flawed because it does not correctly account for the changes in the array after Alice's removals and Bob's multiplications.

5. **Output**: The maximum value from the list `ans` is printed for each test case, representing the optimal sum after both players have played their moves.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Bob's Move Calculation**: The original code incorrectly assumes that Bob will multiply the first `x + 1` elements by -1 when `i` is 0. Instead, Bob should multiply the smallest `x` elements by -1.
- **Incorrect Update Logic**: The logic for updating the sum when `i > 0` is incorrect. It does not correctly handle the removal of elements by Alice and the subsequent multiplication by -1 by Bob.
- **Potential Index Out of Range**: The condition `elif i + x - 1 < n` should be checked before accessing `a[i + x - 1]` to avoid an index out of range error.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k, x) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort(reverse=True)
        sum1 = sum(a)
        ans = []
        for i in range(k + 1):
            if i == 0:
                # Bob multiplies the smallest x elements by -1
                sums = sum1 - 2 * sum(a[-x:])
                ans.append(sums)
            else:
                # Alice removes the smallest i elements
                remaining = a[i:]
                # Bob multiplies the smallest x elements in the remaining array by -1
                sums = sum(remaining) - 2 * sum(remaining[-x:])
                ans.append(sums)
        print(max(ans))
```

### Correctness:
The original code has significant issues with the way it handles Bob's moves and the potential index out of range errors. The corrected code addresses these issues and should provide the correct output.

Final: **False**
