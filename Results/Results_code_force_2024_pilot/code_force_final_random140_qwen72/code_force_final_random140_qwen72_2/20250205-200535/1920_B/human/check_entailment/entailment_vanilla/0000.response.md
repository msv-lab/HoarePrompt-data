### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, and `x`, followed by the array `a`.

2. **Sorting and Reversing**: The array `a` is sorted in descending order using `a.sort()` followed by `a.reverse()`. This ensures that the largest elements are considered first, which is important for the subsequent operations.

3. **Initial Sum Calculation**: The initial sum of the array `sum1` is calculated using `sum(a)`.

4. **Optimal Strategy Calculation**:
   - The function iterates over possible values of `i` from 0 to `k` (inclusive). Each value of `i` represents the number of elements Alice removes.
   - For each `i`, the function calculates the sum after Bob multiplies at most `x` elements by -1.
   - If `i` is 0, the sum is calculated as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`. This means Bob multiplies the first `x + 1` elements by -1.
   - For other values of `i`, the function updates the sum by adding the `i-1`-th element and subtracting twice the `i + x - 1`-th element. This accounts for the changes in the array after Alice's removals and Bob's multiplications.
   - The results are stored in the list `ans`.

5. **Output**: The maximum value from the list `ans` is printed for each test case, representing the optimal sum after both players have played their moves.

### Issues:
- **Index Out of Range**: The condition `elif i + x - 1 < n` should be checked before accessing `a[i + x - 1]` to avoid an index out of range error.
- **Sum Calculation for Bob**: The sum calculation for Bob's move should consider the smallest elements in the remaining array, not just the first `x + 1` elements. This is because Bob will try to minimize the sum by flipping the smallest elements.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k, x) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        a.reverse()
        sum1 = sum(a)
        ans = []
        for i in range(k + 1):
            if i == 0:
                # Bob multiplies the smallest x elements by -1
                sums = sum1 - 2 * sum(a[-x:])
                ans.append(sums)
            else:
                # Alice removes the smallest i elements
                remaining = a[i:]
                # Bob multiplies the smallest x elements in the remaining array by -1
                sums = sum(remaining) - 2 * sum(remaining[-x:])
                ans.append(sums)
        print(max(ans))
```

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The original code has issues with the way it handles Bob's moves and the potential index out of range errors. The corrected code addresses these issues and should provide the correct output.
