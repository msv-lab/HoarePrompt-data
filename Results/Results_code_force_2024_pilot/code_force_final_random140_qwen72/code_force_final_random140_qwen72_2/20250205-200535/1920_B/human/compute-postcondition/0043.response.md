The provided Python code snippet reads three values from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `x` respectively. These new values will overwrite the initial values of `n`, `k`, and `x`.

Given the Initial State:
- `_` is 1
- `n` is greater than 0
- `k` is greater than or equal to 0
- `x` is greater than 0
- `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input in descending order
- `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`
- `i` is `k + 1`
- `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements. Each element in `ans` represents the value of `sums` at each iteration of the loop. The first element in `ans` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`. For subsequent elements, if `i + x - 1 < n`, the value is updated as `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. If `i + x - 1 >= n`, the value is updated as `sums + a[i - 1]`.

After executing the code snippet:
- `n`, `k`, and `x` are reassigned to the values read from the input.

Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` is the input integer, `k` is the input integer, `x` is the input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `i` is `k + 1`, `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements. Each element in `ans` represents the value of `sums` at each iteration of the loop. The first element in `ans` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`. For subsequent elements, if `i + x - 1 < n`, the value is updated as `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. If `i + x - 1 >= n`, the value is updated as `sums + a[i - 1]`.**
