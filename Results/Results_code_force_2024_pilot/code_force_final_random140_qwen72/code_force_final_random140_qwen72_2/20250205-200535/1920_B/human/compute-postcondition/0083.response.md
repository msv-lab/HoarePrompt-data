The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `_` relative to the result of `int(input())`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2, and the input integer (which dictates the number of iterations) must be greater than 1.

State: **`_` is 2, `n` is the input integer, `k` is the input integer, `x` is the input integer, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements, where each element is the result of the calculations performed within the loop, `sums` holds the final value after the last iteration of the loop, the input integer must be greater than 1**
