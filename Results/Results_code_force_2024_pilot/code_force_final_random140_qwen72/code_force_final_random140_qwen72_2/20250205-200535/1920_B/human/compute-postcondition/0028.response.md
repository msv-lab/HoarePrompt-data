The code snippet `ans.append(sums)` adds the value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Let's break down the impact of this code on the program:

- `ans` was initially a list containing the value `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`.
- `sums` is defined as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]) + a[0]`.
- After executing the code, `ans` will contain two elements: the initial value `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])` and the new value `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]) + a[0]`.

All other variables (`_`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `x` is greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `i` is 1, `ans` is a list containing the values `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])` and `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]) + a[0]`, and `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]) + a[0]`.**
