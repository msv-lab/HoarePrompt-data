Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `x` is greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `i` is 1, `ans` is a list containing the value `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`, and `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`.** 

The code snippet does not change the values of any variables except for `sums`, which is recalculated to be `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`. All other variables retain their initial values.
