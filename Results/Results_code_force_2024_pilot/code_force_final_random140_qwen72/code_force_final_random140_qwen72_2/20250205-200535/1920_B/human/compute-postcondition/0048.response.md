Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` is the input integer, `k` is the input integer, `x` is the input integer, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `i` is `k + 1`, `ans` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans = []` reinitializes the list `ans` to an empty list, overriding its previous value. All other variables (`_`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`, `i`) remain unchanged.
