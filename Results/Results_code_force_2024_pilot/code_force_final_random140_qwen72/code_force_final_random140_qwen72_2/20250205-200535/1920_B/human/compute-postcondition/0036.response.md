The code snippet `sums = sums + a[i - 1]` updates the value of `sums` by adding the element at index `i - 1` of the list `a` to the current value of `sums`.

Given the initial state:
- `_` is 0
- `n` is greater than 0
- `k` is greater than or equal to 1
- `x` is greater than 0
- `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input in descending order
- `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`
- `i` is 2
- `ans` is a list containing the value `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`
- If `i == 0`, `ans` contains two elements, both equal to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`
- If `i + x - 1 < n`, `ans` also contains the value `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]) + a[0] - 2 * a[x]`, and `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]) + a[0] - 2 * a[x]`
- Otherwise, `ans` contains the value `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]) + a[0]`, and `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]) + a[0]`

Let's calculate the new value of `sums`:

1. The current value of `sums` is either:
   - `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]) + a[0] - 2 * a[x]` if `i + x - 1 < n`
   - `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]) + a[0]` otherwise

2. The value of `a[i - 1]` is `a[1]` because `i` is 2.

3. Therefore, the new value of `sums` is:
   - `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]) + a[0] - 2 * a[x] + a[1]` if `i + x - 1 < n`
   - `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]) + a[0] + a[1]` otherwise

Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `i` is 2, `ans` is a list containing the value `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`. If `i == 0`, `ans` contains two elements, both equal to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`. If `i + x - 1 < n`, `ans` also contains the value `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]) + a[0] - 2 * a[x]`, and `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]) + a[0] - 2 * a[x] + a[1]`. Otherwise, `ans` contains the value `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]) + a[0]`, and `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]) + a[0] + a[1]`.**
