Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `_` is 2, `n` is the new input integer, `k` is the new input integer, `x` is the new input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input but now in reverse order, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `ans` is an empty list, `sums` holds the final value after the last iteration of the loop, the input integer must be greater than 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k + 1):
    if i == 0:
        sums = sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])
        ans.append(sums)
    elif i + x - 1 < n:
        sums = sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]
        ans.append(sums)
    else:
        sums = sums + a[i - 1]
        ans.append(sums)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `_` is 2, `n` is the new input integer, `k` is the new input integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `x` is the new input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input but now in reverse order, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `ans` is a list containing a single value which is either `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])` if `i` is 0, or `sums` if `i` is not 0, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])` if `i` is 0, or `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]` if `(i + x - 1 < n)`, or the sum of all elements in the list `a` up to the index `i - 1` if `(i + x - 1 >= n)`, the input integer must be greater than 1, and `i` is either 0 or not 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: _ is 2, `n` is the new input integer, `k` is the new input integer and must be greater than or equal to 2, `x` is the new input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input but now in reverse order, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `ans` is a list containing two values: the first value is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])` if `i` is 0, otherwise it is `sums`, and the second value is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])` if `i` is 0, or `sums + a[2] - 2 * a[3 + x - 1]` if `i + x - 1 < n`, or `sums` if `i + x - 1 >= n`. `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])` if `i` is 0, or `sums + a[2] - 2 * a[3 + x - 1]` if `i + x - 1 < n`, or `sums + a[i - 1]` if `i + x - 1 >= n`. The input integer must be greater than 1, and `i` is 3.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: _ is 2, `n` is the new input integer (must be greater than 1), `k` is the new input integer (must be greater than or equal to 2), `x` is the new input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input but now in reverse order, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `ans` is a list containing three values: the first value is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])` if `i` is 0, otherwise it is `sums`, the second value is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])` if `i` is 0, or `sums + a[2] - 2 * a[3 + x - 1]` if `i + x - 1 < n`, or `sums` if `i + x - 1 ≥ n`, and the third value is `sums` if `i` is 0, or `sums + a[3] - 2 * a[3 + x]` if `i + x - 1 < n`, or `sums + a[3]` if `i + x - 1 ≥ n`. `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])` if `i` is 0, or `sums + a[2] - 2 * a[3 + x - 1]` if `i + x - 1 < n`, or `sums + a[3]` if `i + x - 1 ≥ n`. `i` is 4.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
