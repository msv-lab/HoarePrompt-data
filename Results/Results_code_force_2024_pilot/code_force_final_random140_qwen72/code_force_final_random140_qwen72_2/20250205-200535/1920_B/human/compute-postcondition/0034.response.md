The code snippet updates the value of `sums` by adding the value of `a[i - 1]` and subtracting twice the value of `a[i + x - 1]`.

Given the initial state:
- `_` is 0
- `n` is greater than 0
- `k` is greater than or equal to 1
- `x` is greater than 0
- `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input in descending order
- `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`
- `i` is 2
- `ans` is a list containing the value `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`
- If `i == 0`, `ans` contains two elements, both equal to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`
- If `i + x - 1 < n`, `ans` also contains the value `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]) + a[0] - 2 * a[x]`, and `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]) + a[0] - 2 * a[x]`
- Otherwise, `ans` contains the value `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]) + a[0]`, and `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]) + a[0]`

The code snippet modifies `sums` as follows:
- `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`

Since `i` is 2, `a[i - 1]` is `a[1]` and `a[i + x - 1]` is `a[2 + x - 1]` which simplifies to `a[x + 1]`.

Therefore, the new value of `sums` is:
- `sums` = `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]) + a[0] - 2 * a[x] + a[1] - 2 * a[x + 1]` (if `i + x - 1 < n`)
- `sums` = `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]) + a[0] + a[1] - 2 * a[x + 1]` (if `i + x - 1 >= n`)

Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `i` is 2, `ans` is a list containing the value `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`. If `i == 0`, `ans` contains two elements, both equal to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`. If `i + x - 1 < n`, `ans` also contains the value `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]) + a[0] - 2 * a[x]`, and `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]) + a[0] - 2 * a[x] + a[1] - 2 * a[x + 1]`. Otherwise, `ans` contains the value `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]) + a[0]`, and `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]) + a[0] + a[1] - 2 * a[x + 1]`.**
