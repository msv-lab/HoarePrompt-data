Output State: **`_` is 2, `n` is the new input integer, `k` is the new input integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `x` is the new input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input but now in reverse order, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `ans` is an empty list, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`, the input integer must be greater than 1, `i` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `sums` is updated to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
