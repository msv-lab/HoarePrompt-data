The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `x`. This operation overwrites the initial values of `n` and `k` (which were previously set as input integers) and `x` (which was also an input integer). The new values of `n`, `k`, and `x` are determined by the user's input.

Output State: **`_` is 2, `n` is the new input integer, `k` is the new input integer, `x` is the new input integer, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements, where each element is the result of the calculations performed within the loop, `sums` holds the final value after the last iteration of the loop, the input integer must be greater than 1.**
