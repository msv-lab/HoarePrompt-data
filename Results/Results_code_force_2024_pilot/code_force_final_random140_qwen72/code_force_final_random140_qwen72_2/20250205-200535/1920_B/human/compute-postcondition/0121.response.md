Output State: **_ is 2, `n` is the new input integer (must be greater than 1), `k` is the new input integer (must be greater than or equal to 0), `x` is the new input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input but now in reverse order, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` values where each value is calculated based on the loop conditions: the first value is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`, and subsequent values are updated as `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]` if `i + x - 1 < n`, or `sums + a[i - 1]` if `i + x - 1 ≥ n`. `sums` is the final value after the last iteration of the loop, which is the last element in the list `ans`. The input integer must be greater than 1, and `i` is `k + 1`.**

### Explanation:
- **_**: Remains 2.
- **n**: Remains the new input integer (must be greater than 1).
- **k**: Remains the new input integer (must be greater than or equal to 0).
- **x**: Remains the new input integer.
- **a**: Remains a sorted list of integers read from the input but now in reverse order.
- **sum1**: Remains the sum of all elements in the list `a`.
- **ans**: Contains `k + 1` values, where:
  - The first value is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`.
  - Subsequent values are updated based on the loop conditions:
    - If `i + x - 1 < n`, the value is `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.
    - If `i + x - 1 ≥ n`, the value is `sums + a[i - 1]`.
- **sums**: The final value after the last iteration of the loop, which is the last element in the list `ans`.
- **i**: After the loop completes, `i` is `k + 1`.
