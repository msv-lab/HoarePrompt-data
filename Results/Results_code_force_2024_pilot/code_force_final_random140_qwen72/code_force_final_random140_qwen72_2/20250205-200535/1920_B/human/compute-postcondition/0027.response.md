Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `x` is greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `i` is 1, `ans` is a list containing the value `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`, and `sums` is now `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]) + a[0]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `sums = sums + a[i - 1]` updates the value of `sums`.
- Initially, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`.
- Since `i` is 1, `a[i - 1]` is `a[0]`.
- Therefore, `sums` becomes `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]) + a[0]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
