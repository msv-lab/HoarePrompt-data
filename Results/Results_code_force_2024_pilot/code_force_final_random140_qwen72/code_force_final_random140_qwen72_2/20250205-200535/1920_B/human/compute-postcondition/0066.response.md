Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` is the input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `x` is the input integer, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `ans` is a list containing one element, `i` is incremented by 1, and `i` must be less than `k + 1` for the loop to execute again, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.** 

Explanation:
- The value of `sums` is updated by adding `a[i - 1]` and subtracting `2 * a[i + x - 1]`.
- All other variables (`_`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`, `ans`) remain unchanged.
- The condition for the loop to continue executing (`i` must be less than `k + 1`) remains valid.
