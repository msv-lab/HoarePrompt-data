Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `x` is greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`.**

Explanation: The variable `sums` is calculated as the difference between `sum1` (which is the sum of all elements in the list `a`) and twice the sum of the first `x + 1` elements of the list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
