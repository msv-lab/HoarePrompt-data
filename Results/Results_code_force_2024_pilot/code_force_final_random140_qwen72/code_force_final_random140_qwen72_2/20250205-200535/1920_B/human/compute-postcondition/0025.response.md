The code appends the value of `sums` to the list `ans`. The value of `sums` is calculated as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]) + a[0] - 2 * a[x]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `x` is greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `i` is 1, `ans` is a list containing the values `[sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]), sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]) + a[0] - 2 * a[x]]`, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]) + a[0] - 2 * a[x]`.**
