Output State: **`_` is 0, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers from the input (each greater than 0), `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`.** 

Explanation: The code calculates the sum of all elements in the list `a` and assigns this sum to the variable `sum1`. The other variables (`_`, `n`, `k`, and `x`) and the list `a` remain unchanged.
