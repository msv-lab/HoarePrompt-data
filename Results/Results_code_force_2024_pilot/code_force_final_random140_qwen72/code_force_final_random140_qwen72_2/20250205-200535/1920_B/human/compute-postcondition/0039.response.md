Postcondition: **`_` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `i` is 2, `ans` is a list containing the value `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`. If `i == 0`, `ans` also contains the value `sums`, which is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]) + a[0] - 2 * a[x]` if `i + x - 1 < n`, otherwise, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]) + a[0]`. If `i != 0`, `ans` also contains the value `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]) + a[0] - 2 * a[x] + a[1] - 2 * a[x + 1]` if `i + x - 1 < n`, otherwise, `ans` contains the value `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]) + a[0] - 2 * a[x] + a[1]`.**
