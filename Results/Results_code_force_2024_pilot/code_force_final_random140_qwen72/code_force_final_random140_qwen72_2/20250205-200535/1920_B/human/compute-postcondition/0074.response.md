Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` is the input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `x` is the input integer, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `ans` is a list containing three elements (the original element, `sums`, and the new `sums`), `i` is incremented by 1, `i` must be less than `k + 1` for the loop to execute again, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`.** 

Explanation: The code appends the value of `sums` to the list `ans`. The value of `sums` is calculated as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`. The list `ans` now contains three elements: the original two elements and the newly appended `sums`. All other variables remain unchanged.
