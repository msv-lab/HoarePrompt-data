The code snippet `sums = sums + a[i - 1]` updates the value of `sums` by adding the element at index `i - 1` of the list `a` to the current value of `sums`.

Given the initial state:
- `_` is 2
- `n` is the new input integer (greater than 1)
- `k` is the new input integer (≥ 2)
- `x` is the new input integer
- `a` is a sorted list of integers in reverse order
- `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`
- `ans` is a list containing two values:
  - The first value is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])` if `i` is 0, otherwise it is `sums`
  - The second value is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])` if `i` is 0, or `sums + a[2] - 2 * a[3 + x - 1]` if `i + x - 1 < n`, or `sums` if `i + x - 1 ≥ n`
- `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])` if `i` is 0, or `sums + a[2] - 2 * a[3 + x - 1]` if `i + x - 1 < n`, or `sums + a[i - 1]` if `i + x - 1 ≥ n`
- `i` is 4

Let's analyze the impact of the code:

1. `i` is 4, so `i - 1` is 3.
2. `a[i - 1]` is `a[3]`.
3. `sums` is updated to `sums + a[3]`.

Since `i` is 4, the condition `i + x - 1 ≥ n` is checked to determine the value of `sums`. However, the exact value of `n` and `x` is not specified, so we cannot definitively say whether `i + x - 1 ≥ n` holds true. For the purpose of this calculation, we assume the value of `sums` before the update is known.

Output State: **_ is 2, `n` is the new input integer, `k` is the new input integer and must be greater than or equal to 2, `x` is the new input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input but now in reverse order, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `ans` is a list containing two values: the first value is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])` if `i` is 0, otherwise it is `sums`, and the second value is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])` if `i` is 0, or `sums + a[2] - 2 * a[3 + x - 1]` if `i + x - 1 < n`, or `sums` if `i + x - 1 ≥ n`. `sums` is now `sums + a[3]`, `i` is 4.**
