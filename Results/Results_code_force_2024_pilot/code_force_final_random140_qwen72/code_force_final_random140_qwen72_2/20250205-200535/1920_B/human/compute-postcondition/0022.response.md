The code snippet `ans.append(sums)` adds the value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Given the initial state, `sums` is calculated as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`, and `ans` already contains the value `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`.

Therefore, after executing the code, the list `ans` will contain two identical elements, both equal to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`.

Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `x` is greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `i` is 1, `ans` is a list containing two elements, both equal to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`, and `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`.**
