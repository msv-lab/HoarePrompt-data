The code snippet `ans.append(sums)` appends the value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Based on the initial state, the value of `sums` is determined by the conditions provided:

- If `i + x - 1 < n`, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]) + a[0] - 2 * a[x] + a[1]`.
- Otherwise, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]) + a[0] + a[1]`.

Given that `i` is 2, the condition `i + x - 1 < n` simplifies to `2 + x - 1 < n`, which is `x + 1 < n`. Since `x` is greater than 0 and `n` is greater than 0, this condition is likely true (assuming `x + 1` is less than `n`).

Therefore, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]) + a[0] - 2 * a[x] + a[1]`.

The value of `sums` is appended to the list `ans`, which already contains one or more elements based on the initial state.

Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `i` is 2, `ans` is a list containing the value `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])` and the value `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]) + a[0] - 2 * a[x] + a[1]`, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]) + a[0] - 2 * a[x] + a[1]`.**
