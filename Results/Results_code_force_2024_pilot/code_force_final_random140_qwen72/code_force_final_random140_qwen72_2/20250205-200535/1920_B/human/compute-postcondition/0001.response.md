The code snippet `n, k, x = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into three parts, and assigns these parts to the variables `n`, `k`, and `x` after converting them to integers. The initial state specifies that `_` is 0 and the input value must be greater than 0. After executing the code, the values of `n`, `k`, and `x` are set based on the input, while `_` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is 0, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers from the input (each greater than 0)**
