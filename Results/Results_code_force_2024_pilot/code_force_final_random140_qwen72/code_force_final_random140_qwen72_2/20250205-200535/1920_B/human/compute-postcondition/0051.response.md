Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` is the input integer, `k` must be greater than or equal to 0, `x` is the input integer, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`.**

Explanation:
- The code calculates `sums` as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`.
- `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`.
- `a[:x + 1]` is a slice of the list `a` from the start up to (and including) the element at index `x`.
- `sum(a[:x + 1])` is the sum of these elements.
- `sums` is then calculated as `sum1` minus twice the sum of the sliced portion of `a`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
