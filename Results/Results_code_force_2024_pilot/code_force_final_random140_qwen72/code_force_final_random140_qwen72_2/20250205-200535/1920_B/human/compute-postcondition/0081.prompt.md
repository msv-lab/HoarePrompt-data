Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `_` is 1, `n` is the input integer, `k` is the input integer, `x` is the input integer, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `i` is `k + 1`, `ans` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k + 1):
    if i == 0:
        sums = sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])
        ans.append(sums)
    elif i + x - 1 < n:
        sums = sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]
        ans.append(sums)
    else:
        sums = sums + a[i - 1]
        ans.append(sums)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`_` is 1, `n` is the input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `x` is the input integer, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `ans` is a list containing one element. If `i` is 0, `ans` contains the value `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`, and `sums` is set to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`. If `i` is not 0, `ans` contains the value of `sums`. If `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. Otherwise, if `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `_` is 1, `n` is the input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `x` is the input integer, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `ans` is a list containing two elements (the original element and `sums`), `i` is incremented by 1, and `i` must be less than `k + 1` for the loop to execute again. If `i == 0`, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`. Otherwise, if `i + x - 1 < n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. If `i + x - 1 >= n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`_` is 1, `n` is the input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `x` is the input integer, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `ans` is a list containing three elements (the original element, `sums`, and the updated `sums` value), `i` is incremented by 1, and `i` must be less than `k + 1` for the loop to execute again. If `i == 0`, `sums` is set to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`. Otherwise, if `i + x - 1 < n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. If `i + x - 1 >= n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
