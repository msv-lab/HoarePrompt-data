Postcondition: **_ is 2, `n` is the new input integer (must be greater than 1), `k` is the new input integer (must be greater than or equal to 2), `x` is the new input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input but now in reverse order, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `ans` is a list containing three values: the first value is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])` if `i` is 0, otherwise it is `sums`, the second value is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])` if `i` is 0, or `sums + a[2] - 2 * a[3 + x - 1]` if `i + x - 1 < n`, or `sums` if `i + x - 1 ≥ n`, and the third value is `sums` if `i` is 0, or `sums + a[3] - 2 * a[3 + x]` if `i + x - 1 < n`, or `sums + a[3]` if `i + x - 1 ≥ n`. `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])` if `i` is 0, or `sums + a[2] - 2 * a[3 + x - 1]` if `i + x - 1 < n`, or `sums + a[3]` if `i + x - 1 ≥ n`. `i` is 4.**
