The code snippet updates the value of `sums` by adding the value of `a[i - 1]` and subtracting twice the value of `a[i + x - 1]`. Let's break down the changes:

- `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, the output state is:

Output State: **`_` is 2, `n` is the new input integer, `k` is the new input integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `x` is the new input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input but now in reverse order, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `ans` is an empty list, `sums` is `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`, the input integer must be greater than 1, `i` is not 0, and the condition `(i + x - 1 < n)` is true.**
