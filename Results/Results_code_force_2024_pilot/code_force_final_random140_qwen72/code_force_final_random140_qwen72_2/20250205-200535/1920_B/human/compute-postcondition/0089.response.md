Output State: **`_` is 2, `n` is the new input integer, `k` is the new input integer, `x` is the new input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input but now in reverse order, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `ans` is an empty list, `sums` holds the final value after the last iteration of the loop, the input integer must be greater than 1.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `ans = []` initializes the variable `ans` as an empty list.
- All other variables (`_`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`, and `sums`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The condition that the input integer must be greater than 1 remains valid.
