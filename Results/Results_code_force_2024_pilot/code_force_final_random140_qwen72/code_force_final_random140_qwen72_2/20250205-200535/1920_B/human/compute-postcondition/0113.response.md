Output State: **_ is 2, `n` is the new input integer, `k` is the new input integer and must be greater than or equal to 2, `x` is the new input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input but now in reverse order, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `ans` is a list containing two values: the first value is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])` if `i` is 0, otherwise it is `sums`, and the second value is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])` if `i` is 0, or `sums + a[2] - 2 * a[3 + x - 1]` if `i + x - 1 < n`, or `sums` if `i + x - 1 >= n`. `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])` if `i` is 0, or `sums + a[2] - 2 * a[3 + x - 1]` if `i + x - 1 < n`, or `sums + a[i - 1]` if `i + x - 1 >= n`. The input integer must be greater than 1, `i` is 4, and `sums` is now `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet updates the value of `sums` to be `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The value of `sums` is now specifically calculated as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`, which is the sum of all elements in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x + 1` elements of `a`.
