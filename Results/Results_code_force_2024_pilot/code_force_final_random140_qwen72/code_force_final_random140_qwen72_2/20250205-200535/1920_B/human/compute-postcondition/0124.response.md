Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but operates under the context of multiple test cases defined by an external loop or caller. For each test case, it receives integers n, k, x, and an array a of length n, where n is the number of elements in the array, k is the maximum number of elements Alice can remove, and x is the maximum number of elements Bob can multiply by -1. The function processes these inputs to determine the optimal outcome based on the rules for Alice and Bob's actions and returns the result for each test case.**
