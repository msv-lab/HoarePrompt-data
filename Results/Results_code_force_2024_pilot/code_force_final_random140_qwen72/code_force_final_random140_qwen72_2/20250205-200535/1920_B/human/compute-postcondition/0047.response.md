Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` is the input integer, `k` is the input integer, `x` is the input integer, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `i` is `k + 1`, `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements. The first element in `ans` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`. For subsequent elements, if `i + x - 1 < n`, the value is updated as `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. If `i + x - 1 >= n`, the value is updated as `sums + a[i - 1]`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `sum1` is updated to the sum of all elements in the list `a`.
- All other variables (`_`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `i`, `ans`) remain unchanged.
- The list `ans` contains `k + 1` elements, with the first element calculated as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`.
- Subsequent elements in `ans` are updated based on the conditions provided in the problem statement.
