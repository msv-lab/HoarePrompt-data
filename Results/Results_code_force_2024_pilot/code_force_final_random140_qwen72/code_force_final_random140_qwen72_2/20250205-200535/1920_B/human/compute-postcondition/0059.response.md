Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` is the input integer, `k` must be greater than or equal to 0, `x` is the input integer, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is not equal to 0, `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`, and `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet updates the variable `sums` by adding the value of `a[i - 1]` to it. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged. The new value of `sums` is now the original value of `sums` plus the element at index `i - 1` in the list `a`.
