The only objects in the loop head are variables `i`, `k`, and the implicit condition that `i` should be less than `k + 1` for the loop to continue executing. Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, we need to adjust `i` to ensure the loop progresses correctly.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `_` is 1 (this variable is not relevant to the loop head).
- `n` is the input integer (not directly relevant to the loop head).
- `k` is greater than or equal to 0 (relevant to the loop head).
- `x` is the input integer (not directly relevant to the loop head).
- `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input (not directly relevant to the loop head).
- `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a` (not directly relevant to the loop head).
- `ans` is a list containing one element (the content of `ans` is not directly relevant to the loop head, but its existence is).
- `sums` is set based on conditions involving `i` and `x` (not directly relevant to the loop head).

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be incremented by 1.
- The condition `i < k + 1` must still hold true.

Given that `i` was the value at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration:
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `k` remains the same.
- The loop will execute as long as `i < k + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`_` is 1, `n` is the input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `x` is the input integer, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `ans` is a list containing one element, `i` is incremented by 1, and `i` must be less than `k + 1` for the loop to execute again.**
