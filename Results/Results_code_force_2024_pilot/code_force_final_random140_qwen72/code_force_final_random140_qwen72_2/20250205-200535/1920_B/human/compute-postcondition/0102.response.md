Postcondition: **`_` is 2, `n` is the new input integer, `k` is the new input integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `x` is the new input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input but now in reverse order, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `ans` is a list containing a single value which is either `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])` if `i` is 0, or `sums` if `i` is not 0, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])` if `i` is 0, or `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]` if `(i + x - 1 < n)`, or the sum of all elements in the list `a` up to the index `i - 1` if `(i + x - 1 >= n)`, the input integer must be greater than 1, and `i` is either 0 or not 0.**
