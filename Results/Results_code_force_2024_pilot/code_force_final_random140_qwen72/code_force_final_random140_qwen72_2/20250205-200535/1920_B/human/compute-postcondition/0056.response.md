The code snippet updates the value of `sums` by adding the value of `a[i - 1]` and subtracting twice the value of `a[i + x - 1]`. Let's break down the changes:

- `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `_` is 1
- `n` is the input integer
- `k` must be greater than or equal to 0
- `x` is the input integer
- `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input
- `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`
- `ans` is an empty list
- `i` is not equal to 0
- The current value of `i + x - 1` is less than `n`

After executing the code snippet, the output state is:
Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` is the input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `x` is the input integer, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is not equal to 0, `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.**
