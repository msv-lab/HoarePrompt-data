The code snippet updates the value of `sums` by adding the value of `a[i - 1]` and subtracting twice the value of `a[i + x - 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `_` is 0
- `n` is greater than 0
- `k` is greater than or equal to 0
- `x` is greater than 0
- `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input in descending order
- `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`
- `ans` is an empty list
- `i` is not 0
- The current value of `i + x - 1` is less than `n`

After executing the code:
- `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`
- All other variables remain unchanged

Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `x` is greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is not 0, the current value of `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, and `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.**
