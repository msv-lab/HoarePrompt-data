Output State: **`_` is 2, `n` is the new input integer, `k` is the new input integer and must be greater than or equal to 2, `x` is the new input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input but now in reverse order, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `ans` is a list containing two values: the first value is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])` if `i` is 0, otherwise it is `sums`, and the second value is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`, the input integer must be greater than 1, and `i` is 3.** 

Explanation:
- The code `ans.append(sums)` adds the value of `sums` to the list `ans`.
- Since `i` is 3, the initial value in `ans` is `sums`.
- After appending `sums` again, `ans` now contains two values, both of which are `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
