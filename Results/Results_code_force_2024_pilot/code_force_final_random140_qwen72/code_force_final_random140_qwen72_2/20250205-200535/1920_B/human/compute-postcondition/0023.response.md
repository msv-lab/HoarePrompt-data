The code snippet updates the value of `sums` by adding `a[i - 1]` and subtracting `2 * a[i + x - 1]`. Let's break down the changes:

- `a[i - 1]` corresponds to the element at index `0` (since `i` is 1).
- `2 * a[i + x - 1]` corresponds to `2 * a[1 + x - 1]`, which simplifies to `2 * a[x]`.

Therefore, the new value of `sums` is calculated as:
\[ \text{sums} = \text{sums} + a[0] - 2 * a[x] \]

Given the initial state:
- `sums` was initially `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order.

The updated value of `sums` is:
\[ \text{sums} = (\text{sum1} - 2 * \text{sum}(a[:x + 1])) + a[0] - 2 * a[x] \]

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `x` is greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `i` is 1, `ans` is a list containing the value `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`, `sums` is now `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]) + a[0] - 2 * a[x]`.**
