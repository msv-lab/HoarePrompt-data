To determine what will be printed by the `print(max(ans))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the context:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `_` is 1 (This variable is not used in the code snippet).
   - `n` is the input integer.
   - `k` is the input integer.
   - `x` is the input integer.
   - `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input.
   - `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`.
   - `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements, where each element is the result of the calculations performed within the loop.
   - `i` has been incremented through the loop from 0 to `k`.
   - `sums` holds the final value after the last iteration of the loop.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers. This means the largest elements are at the beginning of the list.
   - `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`.
   - `ans` is a list of length `k + 1`, where each element is the result of some calculation performed in a loop. The exact nature of these calculations is not provided, but we know that `ans` contains `k + 1` elements.

3. **The Print Statement:**
   - The `print(max(ans))` statement will print the maximum value from the list `ans`.

Given the initial state and the context, the `max(ans)` function will find the maximum value among the `k + 1` elements in the list `ans`.

Since the exact calculations that populate the `ans` list are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `max(ans)`. However, we can describe it in terms of the given information.

Output: **max(ans) (where ans is a list of k + 1 elements resulting from the calculations performed within the loop)**
