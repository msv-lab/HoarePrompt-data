The code appends the value of `sums` to the list `ans`. The value of `sums` is updated based on the previous state, which includes the addition of `a[i - 1]` to the existing `sums`.

Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `x` is greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `ans` is a list containing one element which is the value of `sums`, `i` is not 0, `(i + x - 1)` is greater than or equal to `n`, `sums` is now `sums + a[i - 1]`.**
