Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` is the input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `x` is the input integer, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `ans` is a list containing one element, `i` is incremented by 1, `i` must be less than `k + 1` for the loop to execute again, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `sums` by subtracting twice the sum of the first `x + 1` elements of the list `a` from `sum1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
