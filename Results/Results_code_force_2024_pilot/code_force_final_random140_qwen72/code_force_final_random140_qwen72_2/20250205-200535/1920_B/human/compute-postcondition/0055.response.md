The code snippet modifies the variable `sums` by adding the value of `a[i - 1]` and subtracting twice the value of `a[i + x - 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Let's break down the changes:

- `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.
- The values of `_`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`, `ans`, and `i` remain the same.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`_` is 1, `n` is the input integer, `k` must be greater than or equal to 0, `x` is the input integer, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is not equal to 0, and the current value of `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.**
