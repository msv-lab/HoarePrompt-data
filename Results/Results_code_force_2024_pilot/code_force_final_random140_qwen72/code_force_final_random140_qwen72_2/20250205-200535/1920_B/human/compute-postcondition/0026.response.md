The code snippet updates the value of `sums` by adding the value of `a[i - 1]` to it. Given that `i` is 1, `a[i - 1]` refers to the first element of the list `a`. The initial value of `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`. After executing the code, `sums` becomes `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]) + a[0]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`_` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `x` is greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `i` is 1, `ans` is a list containing the value `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`, and `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]) + a[0]`.**
