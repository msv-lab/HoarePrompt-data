Postcondition: ***`_` is 2, `n` is the new input integer, `k` is the new input integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `x` is the new input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input but now in reverse order, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `ans` is a list containing the value `sums`, `sums` is either `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]` if `(i + x - 1 < n)`, or the sum of all elements in the list `a` up to the index `i - 1` if `(i + x - 1 >= n)`, the input integer must be greater than 1, and `i` is not 0.***
