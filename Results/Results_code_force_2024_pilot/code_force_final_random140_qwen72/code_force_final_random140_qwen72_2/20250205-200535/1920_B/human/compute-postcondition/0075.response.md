Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` is the input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `x` is the input integer, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers read from the input, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `ans` is a list containing two elements (the original element and `sums`), `i` is incremented by 1, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.** 

Explanation: The value of `sums` is updated by adding the value of `a[i - 1]` and subtracting twice the value of `a[i + x - 1]`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and the loop condition (`i < k + 1`) remains unchanged. All other variables retain their initial values.
