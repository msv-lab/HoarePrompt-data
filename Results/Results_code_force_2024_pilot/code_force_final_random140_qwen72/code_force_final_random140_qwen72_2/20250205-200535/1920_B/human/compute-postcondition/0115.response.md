Let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the program state:

### Initial State:
- `_` is 2
- `n` is the new input integer (must be greater than 1)
- `k` is the new input integer (must be greater than or equal to 2)
- `x` is the new input integer
- `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input but now in reverse order
- `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`
- `ans` is a list containing two values:
  - The first value is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])` if `i` is 0, otherwise it is `sums`.
  - The second value is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])` if `i` is 0, or `sums + a[2] - 2 * a[3 + x - 1]` if `i + x - 1 < n`, or `sums` if `i + x - 1 >= n`.
- `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])` if `i` is 0, or `sums + a[2] - 2 * a[3 + x - 1]` if `i + x - 1 < n`, or `sums + a[i - 1]` if `i + x - 1 >= n`.
- `i` is 4

### Code Snippet:
```python
sums = sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the Variables Involved:**
   - `sums` is being updated.
   - `a` is the list of integers in reverse order.
   - `i` is 4.
   - `x` is the new input integer.

2. **Calculate the New Value of `sums`:**
   - The current value of `sums` is not explicitly given, but it is derived from the initial conditions.
   - `a[i - 1]` is `a[3]` because `i` is 4.
   - `a[i + x - 1]` is `a[3 + x]`.

3. **Update `sums`:**
   - The new value of `sums` is `sums + a[3] - 2 * a[3 + x]`.

### Output State:
- `_` is 2
- `n` is the new input integer (must be greater than 1)
- `k` is the new input integer (must be greater than or equal to 2)
- `x` is the new input integer
- `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input but now in reverse order
- `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`
- `ans` is a list containing two values:
  - The first value is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])` if `i` is 0, otherwise it is `sums`.
  - The second value is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])` if `i` is 0, or `sums + a[2] - 2 * a[3 + x - 1]` if `i + x - 1 < n`, or `sums` if `i + x - 1 >= n`.
- `sums` is now `sums + a[3] - 2 * a[3 + x]`
- `i` is 4

Output State: **_ is 2, `n` is the new input integer (must be greater than 1), `k` is the new input integer (must be greater than or equal to 2), `x` is the new input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input but now in reverse order, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `ans` is a list containing two values: the first value is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])` if `i` is 0, otherwise it is `sums`, and the second value is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])` if `i` is 0, or `sums + a[2] - 2 * a[3 + x - 1]` if `i + x - 1 < n`, or `sums` if `i + x - 1 >= n`, `sums` is now `sums + a[3] - 2 * a[3 + x]`, `i` is 4.**
