The code snippet `ans.append(sums)` adds the value of `sums` to the list `ans`.

Given the initial state:
- `_` is 0
- `n` is greater than 0
- `k` is greater than or equal to 1
- `x` is greater than 0
- `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input in descending order
- `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`
- `i` is 2
- `ans` is a list containing the value `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`
- If `i == 0`, `ans` contains two elements, both equal to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`
- If `i + x - 1 < n`, `ans` also contains the value `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]) + a[0] - 2 * a[x]`, and `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]) + a[0] - 2 * a[x] + a[1] - 2 * a[x + 1]`
- Otherwise, `ans` contains the value `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]) + a[0]`, and `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]) + a[0] + a[1] - 2 * a[x + 1]`

Since `i` is 2, the condition `i + x - 1 < n` is checked. If this condition is true, `sums` is calculated as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]) + a[0] - 2 * a[x] + a[1] - 2 * a[x + 1]`. If the condition is false, `sums` is calculated as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]) + a[0] + a[1] - 2 * a[x + 1]`.

Regardless of the condition, `sums` is appended to `ans`.

Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `i` is 2, `ans` is a list containing the value `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])` and the value `sums`, where `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]) + a[0] - 2 * a[x] + a[1] - 2 * a[x + 1]` if `i + x - 1 < n` and `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]) + a[0] + a[1] - 2 * a[x + 1]` otherwise.**
