Output State: **`_` is 2, `n` is the new input integer, `k` is the new input integer and must be greater than or equal to 2, `x` is the new input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input but now in reverse order, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `ans` is a list containing a single value which is either `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])` if `i` is 0, or `sums` if `i` is not 0, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])` if `i` is 0, or `sums + a[i - 1]` if `i` is not 0, the input integer must be greater than 1, and `i` is 3.**

Explanation:
- The code `sums = sums + a[i - 1]` updates the value of `sums` by adding the value of `a[i - 1]` to it.
- Since `i` is 3, the value of `a[i - 1]` is `a[2]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
- The updated value of `sums` is `sums + a[2]`.
