Postcondition: **`_` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `x` is greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `i` is 1, `ans` is a list containing the value `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`. If `i == 0`, `ans` contains two elements, both equal to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`. If `i + x - 1 < n`, `ans` also contains the value `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]) + a[0] - 2 * a[x]`, and `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]) + a[0] - 2 * a[x]`. Otherwise, `ans` contains the value `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]) + a[0]`, and `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]) + a[0]`.**
