The code snippet `p, q, r = map(int, line.split())` reads the next line from the file, splits it into three parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns these integers to `p`, `q`, and `r` respectively.

Given the initial state:
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9
- `p` is the integer value from the second line of the input or file
- `q` is now `q + r`
- `r` is the integer value from the second line of the input or file
- `line` is the next line in the file after the current one

After executing the code snippet:
- `p`, `q`, and `r` are updated to the values read from the next line in the file.
- The previous values of `p` and `r` are overwritten.
- The value of `q` is no longer `q + r` because `q` is reassigned from the new line.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9, `p`, `q`, and `r` are the integers read from the next line in the file, and `line` is the next line in the file after the current one.**
