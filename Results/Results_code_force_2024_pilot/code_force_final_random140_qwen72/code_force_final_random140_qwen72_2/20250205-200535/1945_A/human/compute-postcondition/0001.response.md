The code snippet `p, q, r = map(int, line.split())` splits the second line of the input or file (`line`) into parts based on whitespace, converts each part to an integer, and assigns these integers to the variables `p`, `q`, and `r`.

Given the initial state:
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9
- The input or file must have at least 2 lines
- `line` is the second line of the input or file

After executing the code:
- `p`, `q`, and `r` are assigned the integer values from the second line of the input or file.
- The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9, `p`, `q`, and `r` are the integer values from the second line of the input or file.**
