Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq a, b, c \leq 10^9\).
- `p` is the first integer from the split line.
- `q` is the sum of the second integer from the split line and the third integer from the split line.
- `r` is the third integer from the split line.
- `line` is the next line in the file after the current one, and the file must have at least one more line.

### Print Statement:
```python
print((p - q // 3, -1)[r < q % 3])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `p`, `q`, and `r`:**
   - `p` is the first integer from the split line.
   - `q` is the sum of the second and third integers from the split line.
   - `r` is the third integer from the split line.

2. **Expression Breakdown:**
   - `q // 3` is the integer division of `q` by 3.
   - `q % 3` is the remainder when `q` is divided by 3.
   - `(p - q // 3, -1)[r < q % 3]` is a conditional expression that evaluates to either `p - q // 3` or `-1` depending on the condition `r < q % 3`.

3. **Condition Evaluation:**
   - If `r < q % 3` is true, the expression evaluates to `-1`.
   - If `r < q % 3` is false, the expression evaluates to `p - q // 3`.

### Final Output:
- The output depends on the values of `p`, `q`, and `r` from the split line.
- If `r < q % 3`, the output will be `-1`.
- If `r >= q % 3`, the output will be `p - q // 3`.

### Example Scenarios:
- If `p = 10`, `q = 15`, and `r = 2`:
  - `q % 3 = 0` (since 15 % 3 = 0)
  - `r < q % 3` is false (2 < 0 is false)
  - Output: `p - q // 3 = 10 - 5 = 5`

- If `p = 10`, `q = 16`, and `r = 1`:
  - `q % 3 = 1` (since 16 % 3 = 1)
  - `r < q % 3` is true (1 < 1 is false)
  - Output: `-1`

### General Output:
Based on the given conditions, the output will be:
- **-1** if `r < q % 3`
- **p - q // 3** if `r >= q % 3`

Output: **(p - q // 3, -1)[r < q % 3]** (where the value depends on the condition `r < q % 3`)
