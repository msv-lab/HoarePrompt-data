You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The organizing committee plans to take the participants of the Olympiad on a
hike after the tour. Currently, the number of tents needed to be taken is
being calculated. It is known that each tent can accommodate up to 3 people.

Among the participants, there are a introverts, b extroverts, and c
universals:

  * Each introvert wants to live in a tent alone. Thus, a tent with an introvert must contain exactly one person — only the introvert himself. 
  * Each extrovert wants to live in a tent with two others. Thus, the tent with an extrovert must contain exactly three people. 
  * Each universal is fine with any option (living alone, with one other person, or with two others). 

The organizing committee respects the wishes of each participant very much, so
they want to fulfill all of them.

Tell us the minimum number of tents needed to be taken so that all
participants can be accommodated according to their preferences. If it is
impossible to accommodate the participants in a way that fulfills all the
wishes, output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case is described by a single line containing three integers a , b ,
c (0 \le a, b, c \le 10^9 ) — the number of introverts, extroverts, and
universals, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of tents, or
-1 if it is impossible to accommodate the participants.

Note

In the first test case, 1 tent will be given to the introverts, 1 tent will be
shared by two extroverts and one universal, and the last tent will be shared
by two universals. In total, 3 tents are needed.

In the second test case, three extroverts will take 1 tent, and 1 tent will be
taken by an introvert. Then, one extrovert and one universal will be left.
This extrovert will not be able to live with two others.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to calculate the minimum number of tents required to accommodate `a` introverts, `b` extroverts, and `c` universals.
   - Introverts must live alone in a tent.
   - Extroverts must live in a tent with exactly two others.
   - Universals can live in any configuration (alone, with one other, or with two others).

2. **Input and Output:**
   - The input consists of multiple test cases, each with three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.
   - The output should be the minimum number of tents required or `-1` if it's impossible to satisfy all conditions.

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - **Introverts:** Each introvert requires a separate tent, so we need at least `a` tents for introverts.
   - **Extroverts:** Each tent for extroverts must have exactly 3 people. Therefore, we need at least `b` extroverts to be grouped in multiples of 3. If `b` is not a multiple of 3, we need to check if we can use universals to fill the remaining spots.
   - **Universals:** Universals can be used to fill any remaining spots in tents. They can also form their own tents if necessary.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads multiple lines from standard input, skipping the first line which contains the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it splits the line into three integers `p`, `q`, and `r` representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively.
   - It then adds the number of universals to the number of extroverts (`q += r`).
   - Finally, it prints the result of the expression `(p - q // 3, -1)[r < q % 3]`.

5. **Expression Breakdown:**
   - `q += r`: This combines the number of extroverts and universals.
   - `q // 3`: This calculates the number of full tents that can be formed with the combined extroverts and universals.
   - `p - q // 3`: This calculates the number of tents needed for introverts minus the number of full tents that can be formed with extroverts and universals.
   - `(p - q // 3, -1)[r < q % 3]`: This is a ternary-like operation. If `r < q % 3`, it means there are not enough universals to fill the remaining spots in the tents, so it returns `-1`. Otherwise, it returns `p - q // 3`.

6. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly handles the number of introverts and the combination of extroverts and universals.
   - It correctly checks if there are enough universals to fill the remaining spots in the tents.
   - However, the expression `p - q // 3` might not always give the correct number of tents. Specifically, it does not account for the fact that some universals might be used to form their own tents if there are not enough extroverts to pair with them.

### Conclusion:
The program has a logical flaw in the calculation of the number of tents. It does not correctly handle the scenario where universals might need to form their own tents if there are not enough extroverts to pair with them. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
