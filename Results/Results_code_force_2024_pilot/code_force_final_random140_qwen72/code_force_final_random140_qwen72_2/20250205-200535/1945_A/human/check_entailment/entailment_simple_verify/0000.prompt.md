You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The organizing committee plans to take the participants of the Olympiad on a
hike after the tour. Currently, the number of tents needed to be taken is
being calculated. It is known that each tent can accommodate up to 3 people.

Among the participants, there are a introverts, b extroverts, and c
universals:

  * Each introvert wants to live in a tent alone. Thus, a tent with an introvert must contain exactly one person — only the introvert himself. 
  * Each extrovert wants to live in a tent with two others. Thus, the tent with an extrovert must contain exactly three people. 
  * Each universal is fine with any option (living alone, with one other person, or with two others). 

The organizing committee respects the wishes of each participant very much, so
they want to fulfill all of them.

Tell us the minimum number of tents needed to be taken so that all
participants can be accommodated according to their preferences. If it is
impossible to accommodate the participants in a way that fulfills all the
wishes, output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case is described by a single line containing three integers a , b ,
c (0 \le a, b, c \le 10^9 ) — the number of introverts, extroverts, and
universals, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of tents, or
-1 if it is impossible to accommodate the participants.

Note

In the first test case, 1 tent will be given to the introverts, 1 tent will be
shared by two extroverts and one universal, and the last tent will be shared
by two universals. In total, 3 tents are needed.

In the second test case, three extroverts will take 1 tent, and 1 tent will be
taken by an introvert. Then, one extrovert and one universal will be left.
This extrovert will not be able to live with two others.

- Program: 
def func():
    for line in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (p, q, r) = map(int, line.split())
        q += r
        print((p - q // 3, -1)[r < q % 3])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a, b, and c are non-negative integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9, representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively.
def func():
    for line in [*open(0)][1:]:
        p, q, r = map(int, line.split())
        
        q += r
        
        print((p - q // 3, -1)[r < q % 3])
        
    #State: `a`, `b`, and `c` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9, `p` is the first integer from the last line processed in the file, `q` is the sum of the second integer from the last line processed in the file and the third integer from the last line processed in the file, `r` is the third integer from the last line processed in the file, and the file has been fully read with no more lines remaining.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical flaw that causes it to fail in certain scenarios. Specifically, the program incorrectly handles the distribution of universals (r) to accommodate extroverts (q).

### Issue:
The program adds all universals (r) to the extroverts (q) and then checks if the remaining universals (r) are less than the remainder of `q % 3`. This approach is flawed because it does not properly account for the fact that universals can be used to fill in the gaps for extroverts, but they can also be used to form their own tents.

### Example Case:
Consider the input `1 2 1`:
- 1 introvert (p = 1)
- 2 extroverts (q = 2)
- 1 universal (r = 1)

According to the problem description:
- The introvert needs 1 tent.
- The 2 extroverts need to be in a tent with 3 people, so they need 1 more person.
- The universal can join the extroverts to form a tent of 3 people.

The correct output should be `2` (1 tent for the introvert and 1 tent for the extroverts and the universal).

However, the program will output `-1` because it incorrectly checks if `r < q % 3` after adding all universals to the extroverts. This results in an incorrect conclusion that it is impossible to accommodate the participants.

Thus, the program is incorrect.
