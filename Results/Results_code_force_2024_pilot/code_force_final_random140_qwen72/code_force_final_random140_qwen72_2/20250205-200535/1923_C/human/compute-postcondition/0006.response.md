The code snippet updates the `sum` list by adding the value of `nums[i - 1]` to the previous element in the `sum` list. Let's break down the impact:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
   - `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5.
   - `q` is an input integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5.
   - `c` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9.
   - For each query, `l_i` and `r_i` are integers where 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n.
   - The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
   - The sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
   - `nums` is a list of integers read from the input.
   - `ones` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to 0 except `ones[1]` which is 1 if `nums[0]` is 1, otherwise `ones[1]` remains 0.
   - `sum` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to 0.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` must be at least 1.

2. **Code Execution:**
   - The code `sum[i] = sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1]` updates the `sum` list at index `i` by adding the value of `nums[i - 1]` to the value at index `i - 1` in the `sum` list.

3. **Impact:**
   - `sum[1]` is updated to `sum[0] + nums[0]`.
   - Since `sum[0]` is 0 (as per the initial state), `sum[1]` becomes `0 + nums[0]`, which simplifies to `nums[0]`.

4. **Output State:**
   - `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
   - `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5.
   - `q` is an input integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5.
   - `c` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9.
   - For each query, `l_i` and `r_i` are integers where 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n.
   - The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
   - The sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
   - `nums` is a list of integers read from the input.
   - `ones` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to 0 except `ones[1]` which is 1 if `nums[0]` is 1, otherwise `ones[1]` remains 0.
   - `sum` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to 0, except `sum[1]` which is now `nums[0]`.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` must be at least 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `q` is an input integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5, `c` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9, for each query, `l_i` and `r_i` are integers where 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `nums` is a list of integers read from the input, `ones` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to 0 except `ones[1]` which is 1 if `nums[0]` is 1, otherwise `ones[1]` remains 0, `sum` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to 0, except `sum[1]` which is now `nums[0]`, `i` is 1, `n` must be at least 1.**
