Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `q` is greater than 0.
- `_` is 2.
- `l` and `r` are input integers.
- `onesInRange` is calculated as `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`.
- `sumInRange` is calculated as `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`.

### Conditions:
1. If `l` is equal to `r`, the loop continues to the next iteration.
2. If `l` is not equal to `r`, the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange` is evaluated.
   - If this condition is less than or equal to `sumInRange`, the condition holds true.
   - Otherwise, the condition is greater than `sumInRange`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print('NO')` statement is unconditional and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state.
- Therefore, regardless of the values of `l`, `r`, `onesInRange`, `sumInRange`, or any other variables, the `print` statement will always execute and print the string `'NO'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **NO**
