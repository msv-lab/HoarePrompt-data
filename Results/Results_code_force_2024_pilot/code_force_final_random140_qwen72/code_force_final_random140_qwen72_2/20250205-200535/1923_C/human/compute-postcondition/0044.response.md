Output State: **`q` is greater than 0, `_` is 2, `l` and `r` are input integers, `onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`, `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`. If `l` is equal to `r`, the loop continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange` is evaluated. If this condition is less than or equal to `sumInRange`, the condition holds true. Otherwise, the condition is greater than `sumInRange`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet updates the value of `sumInRange` to `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`.
- All other variables (`q`, `_`, `l`, `r`, `onesInRange`) remain unchanged.
- The conditions involving `l` and `r` and the evaluation of the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange` relative to `sumInRange` remain as described in the initial state.
