Based on the initial state provided:

- `q` is greater than 0.
- `_` is 0.
- `l` and `r` are input integers.
- `l` is equal to `r`.

The code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`.

Since the `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state, it will simply print the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
