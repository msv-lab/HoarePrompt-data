Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads input values for multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and an integer `q`. It then reads a list of `n` integers. For each of the `q` queries, it reads two integers `l` and `r`, representing a segment of the list from index `l` to `r`. The function calculates the number of ones and the sum of elements within the specified segment. It prints 'YES' if twice the number of ones plus the length of the segment minus the number of ones is less than or equal to the sum of the segment; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all queries, the function completes, and the state of the program reflects the completion of all input queries. **
