Postcondition: **`q` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `l` and `r` are input integers, `onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`, `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`. If `l` is equal to `r`, we continue to the next iteration of the loop. The current condition is that twice the number of ones in the range plus the length of the range minus the number of ones in the range is less than or equal to the sum of the elements in the range.**
