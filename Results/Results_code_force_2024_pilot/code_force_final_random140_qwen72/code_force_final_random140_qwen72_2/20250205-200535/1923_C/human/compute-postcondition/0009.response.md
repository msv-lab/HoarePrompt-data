The code updates the `sum` list by adding the value of `nums[i - 1]` to the previous element in the `sum` list. Given that `i` is 2, `sum[2]` is updated to be the sum of `sum[1]` and `nums[1]`.

Let's break it down:

- `sum[1]` is initially `nums[0]`.
- `nums[1]` is the second element in the `nums` list.
- `sum[2]` is updated to be `sum[1] + nums[1]`.

Therefore, the new value of `sum[2]` is `nums[0] + nums[1]`.

All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `q` is an input integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5, `c` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9, for each query, `l_i` and `r_i` are integers where 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `nums` is a list of integers read from the input, `ones` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to 0 except `ones[1]` which is 1 if `nums[0]` is 1, otherwise `ones[1]` remains 0, `sum` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to 0, except `sum[1]` which is now `nums[0]`, `i` is 2, `n` must be at least 1, `ones[2]` is `ones[1] + (1 if nums[1] == 1 else 0), `sum[2]` is `nums[0] + nums[1]`.**
