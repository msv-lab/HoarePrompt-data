Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `q` is an input integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5, `c` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9, for each query, `l_i` and `r_i` are integers where 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `nums` is a list of integers read from the input, `ones` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to 0 except `ones[1]` which is 1 if `nums[0]` is 1, otherwise `ones[1]` remains 0, `sum` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to 0, except `sum[1]` which is now `nums[0]`, `i` is 3, `n` must be at least 3, `ones[2]` is `ones[1] + (1 if nums[1] == 1 else 0), `sum[2]` is `nums[0] + nums[1], `ones[3]` is `ones[2] + (1 if nums[2] == 1 else 0), `sum[3]` is `sum[2] + nums[2]`**

Explanation:
- The code updates the `sum` list at index `i` (which is 3) to be the sum of the value at `sum[i - 1]` (which is `sum[2]`) and the value at `nums[i - 1]` (which is `nums[2]`).
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
