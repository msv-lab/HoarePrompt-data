The code snippet `nums = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `nums`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5
- `q` is an input integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5
- `c` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9
- For each query, `l_i` and `r_i` are integers where 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n
- The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5
- The sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5

After executing the code snippet:
- `nums` is a list of integers read from the input.

The values of `t`, `n`, `q`, `c`, `l_i`, and `r_i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `q` is an input integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5, `c` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9, for each query, `l_i` and `r_i` are integers where 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `nums` is a list of integers read from the input.**
