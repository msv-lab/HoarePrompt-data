Postcondition: **`q` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `l` and `r` are input integers, `onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`, and `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`. If `l` is equal to `r`, we continue to the next iteration of the loop. If `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange` is less than or equal to `sumInRange`, the condition holds true. Otherwise, `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange` is greater than `sumInRange`.**
