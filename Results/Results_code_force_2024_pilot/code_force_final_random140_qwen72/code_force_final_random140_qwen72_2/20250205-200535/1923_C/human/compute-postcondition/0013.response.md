Output State: **After the loop has executed all iterations:**
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5.
- `q` is an input integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5.
- `c` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9.
- For each query, `l_i` and `r_i` are integers where 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n.
- The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
- The sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
- `nums` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `ones` is a list of length `n + 1` where `ones[i]` is the cumulative count of 1s in `nums` from index 0 to index `i-1`.
- `sum` is a list of length `n + 1` where `sum[i]` is the cumulative sum of elements in `nums` from index 0 to index `i-1`.
- `i` is `n + 1`.
- `n` must be at least 1.

This means that after the loop has completed all its iterations:
- The `ones` list will contain the cumulative count of 1s up to each index in `nums`.
- The `sum` list will contain the cumulative sum of elements up to each index in `nums`.
- The loop variable `i` will be equal to `n + 1`, indicating that the loop has finished executing.
