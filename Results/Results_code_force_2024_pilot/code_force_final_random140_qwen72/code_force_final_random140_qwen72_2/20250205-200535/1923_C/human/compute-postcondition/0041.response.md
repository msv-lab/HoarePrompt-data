Postcondition: ***`q` is greater than 0, `_` is 2, `l` and `r` are input integers, `onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`, `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`. If `l` is equal to `r`, the loop continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange` is evaluated. If this condition is less than or equal to `sumInRange`, the condition holds true. Otherwise, the condition is greater than `sumInRange`.***
