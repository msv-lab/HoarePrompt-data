Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

# Annotated Program:
import math

testCases = int(input())
for i in range(testCases):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and q are integers where 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 · 10^5; c is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9; for each query, l_i and r_i are integers where 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    n, q = map(int, input().split(' '))
    nums = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    ones = [(0) for i in range(n + 1)]
    sum = [(0) for i in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        ones[i] = ones[i - 1] + (1 if nums[i - 1] == 1 else 0)
        
        sum[i] = sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1]
        
    #State: After the loop has executed all iterations:
    for _ in range(q):
        l, r = map(int, input().split(' '))
        
        if l == r:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        onesInRange = ones[r] - ones[l - 1]
        
        sumInRange = sum[r] - sum[l - 1]
        
        if 2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `q` is greater than or equal to 0, `_` is `q-1`, `l` and `r` are the last set of input integers, `onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`, and `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`. If `l` is equal to `r`, the loop would have printed 'NO' and continued to the next iteration. If `l` is not equal to `r`, the loop would have evaluated the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange` and printed 'YES' if it is less than or equal to `sumInRange`, otherwise it would have printed 'NO'. The loop has completed all `q` iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads input values for multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and an integer `q`. It then reads a list of `n` integers. For each of the `q` queries, it reads two integers `l` and `r`, representing a segment of the list from index `l` to `r`. The function calculates the number of ones and the sum of elements within the specified segment. It prints 'YES' if twice the number of ones plus the length of the segment minus the number of ones is less than or equal to the sum of the segment; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all queries, the function completes, and the state of the program reflects the completion of all input queries.
