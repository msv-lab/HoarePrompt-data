Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem as described. Let's break down the key parts of the solution to ensure correctness:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `q`, the length of the array `c` and the number of queries.
   - It reads the array `c` and initializes two lists `ones` and `sum` to keep track of the cumulative count of ones and the cumulative sum of elements in the array, respectively.

2. **Cumulative Arrays:**
   - The program iterates through the array `c` to populate the `ones` and `sum` arrays.
   - `ones[i]` stores the number of ones from the start of the array up to index `i-1`.
   - `sum[i]` stores the sum of elements from the start of the array up to index `i-1`.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, it reads the indices `l` and `r`.
   - If `l` is equal to `r`, it immediately prints 'NO' because a single-element subarray cannot satisfy the condition \(a_i \neq b_i\) for all \(i\).
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of ones and the sum within the subarray from `l` to `r` using the precomputed cumulative arrays.
   - It checks if the condition \(2 \times \text{onesInRange} + (r - l + 1) - \text{onesInRange} \leq \text{sumInRange}\) holds. This condition ensures that there is enough "slack" to create a different array `b` with the same sum and all elements greater than zero.

4. **Output:**
   - If the condition is satisfied, it prints 'YES'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The logic and implementation appear to correctly address the problem requirements. The use of cumulative arrays allows efficient computation of the required values for each query, and the condition check is logically sound.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
