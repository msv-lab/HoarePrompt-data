Postcondition: ***`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 2 · 10^9, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `b` is a list of integers initialized to zero with length `n + 1`, and for each index `j` in `b`, `b[j]` is the sum of all elements in `a` whose corresponding input `x` has an absolute value equal to `j`. If `r` (which is calculated as `2 * k - b[2]`) is less than `b[i]`, the program returns the value of `r`.***
