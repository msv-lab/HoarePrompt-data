Functionality: ** The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `t` from the user input, where `1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4`. If the input is valid, it calls the function `func_1` exactly `t` times. If the input is invalid (not a valid integer or out of the specified range), it prints 'Invalid input format' and does not execute the loop. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, if the input was valid, `func_1` has been called `t` times; otherwise, an error message is printed. **
