You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^9. a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 10^9. b is a list of integers initialized to zero with length n + 1.
def func_1():
    try:
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b = [0] * (n + 1)
        for i in range(n):
            x = int(input())
            
            b[abs(x)] += a[i]
            
        #State: `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5, `i` is `n - 1`, `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 2 · 10^9, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `b` is a list of integers initialized to zero with length `n + 1`, and for each index `j` in `b`, `b[j]` is the sum of all elements in `a` whose corresponding input `x` has an absolute value equal to `j`.
        r = 0
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            r += k
            
            if r < b[i]:
                print('NO')
                return
            
            r -= b[i]
            
        #State: After all iterations, `n` remains an integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5, `i` is `n`, `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 2 · 10^9, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `b` is a list of integers initialized to zero with length `n + 1`, and for each index `j` in `b`, `b[j]` is the sum of all elements in `a` whose corresponding input `x` has an absolute value equal to `j`. `r` is now `n * k - (sum of b[1] to b[n])`. If at any point during the loop `r` becomes less than `b[i]`, the program prints 'NO' and returns.
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
    except (ValueError):
        print('Invalid input format')
        #This is printed: Invalid input format
    #State: `n` and `k` are integers within their respective ranges, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `b` is a list of integers initialized to zero with length `n + 1`, and `r` is calculated based on the operations described. If any input is invalid, the program prints 'Invalid input format'. If the conditions in the loop are met, the program prints 'NO' and returns; otherwise, it prints 'YES' and returns.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` does not explicitly accept any parameters but operates under the constraints that `n` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^9, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 10^9. It also uses a list `b` initialized to zeros with length `n + 1`. The function returns different values based on the following cases:

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program does not return any value.

Case_2: The program returns the value of `r`, which is calculated as `2 * k - b[2]`. Here, `k` is an integer within the range 1 to 2 * 10^9, and `b[2]` is the sum of all elements in the list `a` whose corresponding input `x` has an absolute value equal to 2.

Case_3: The program returns the value of `r`, which is calculated as `3 * k - b[2] - b[3]`, where `k` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^9, and `b[2]` and `b[3]` are the sums of elements in `a` whose corresponding input `x` has an absolute value of 2 and 3, respectively.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
