The provided code snippet calls a function named `func_1()`. Since there is no definition or description of what `func_1()` does, we cannot determine its exact impact on the program state. However, based on the initial state, we know that `t` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4 and that `t` must be greater than 2. The variable `_` is set to 2.

Since `func_1()` does not modify any variables explicitly in the given context, and there is no additional information about side effects or returns from `func_1()`, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4, `_` is 2, `t` must be greater than 2.**
