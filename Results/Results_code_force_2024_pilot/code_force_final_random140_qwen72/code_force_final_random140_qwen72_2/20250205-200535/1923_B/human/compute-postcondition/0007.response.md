Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4, `_` is `t-1`, `t` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations completed.**

### Explanation:
- The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4.
- After each iteration, the loop counter `_` increments by 1, starting from 0.
- When the loop completes all `t` iterations, the loop counter `_` will be `t-1`.
- The condition `t` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations completed is always true because the loop runs exactly `t` times, and `t` is the number of iterations.
