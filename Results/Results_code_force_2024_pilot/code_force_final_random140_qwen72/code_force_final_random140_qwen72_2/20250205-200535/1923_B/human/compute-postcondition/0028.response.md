Output State: **`n` must be at least 3, `i` is 3, `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 2 · 10^9, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `b` is a list of integers initialized to zero with length `n + 1`, and for each index `j` in `b`, `b[j]` is the sum of all elements in `a` whose corresponding input `x` has an absolute value equal to `j`. `r` is now `3 * k - b[2] - b[3]`.** 

Explanation: The value of `r` was initially `2 * k - b[2] - b[3]`. After executing `r += k`, the new value of `r` becomes `2 * k - b[2] - b[3] + k`, which simplifies to `3 * k - b[2] - b[3]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
