The function call `func_1()` does not provide any information about what `func_1` does or what it returns. Without this information, we cannot determine the exact changes to the state. However, since no specific changes to the variables `t` or `_` are mentioned, we assume that these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4, `_` is 0 (the loop counter starts from 0)**. The function `func_1` has been called, but no changes to the variables `t` or `_` have been made.
