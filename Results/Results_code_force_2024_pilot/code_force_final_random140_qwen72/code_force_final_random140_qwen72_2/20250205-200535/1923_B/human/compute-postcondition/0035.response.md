Initial State: the state is unknown

```
print('Invalid input format')
```

Explanation:
- The initial state is described as "unknown," meaning there is no specific information about any variables or objects in the program's state before this line of code is executed.
- The `print` statement simply outputs a fixed string: `'Invalid input format'`.

Output: **Invalid input format**
