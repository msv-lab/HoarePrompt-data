A `ValueError` can occur at the line `t = int(input())` if the input provided cannot be converted to an integer. The `try` block attempts to read an integer from the user input and then iterates `t` times, calling `func_1()` in each iteration. If the input is valid, the loop runs as expected. However, if the input is invalid (e.g., a non-integer value), a `ValueError` is raised, and the `except` block is executed, printing "Invalid input format" and leaving the state of `t` unknown.

Therefore, the output state is: **If the input is a valid integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4, `t` is set to that integer, and the function `func_1()` is called `t` times. If the input is invalid, the program prints "Invalid input format" and the state of `t` is unknown.**
