The function `func_1()` is called, but without the definition of `func_1()`, it's impossible to determine its exact effect on the variables. However, since no changes to the variables are specified within the code snippet, we assume that the function does not alter the state of the variables provided in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4, `_` is 1, `t` must be greater than 1**
