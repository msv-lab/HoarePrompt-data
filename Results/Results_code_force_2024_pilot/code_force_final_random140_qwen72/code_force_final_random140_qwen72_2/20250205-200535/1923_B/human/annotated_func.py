If at any point during the loop `r` becomes less than `b[i]`, the program prints 'NO' and returns.

    #State: `n` and `k` are integers within their respective ranges, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `b` is a list of integers initialized to zero with length `n + 1`, and `r` is calculated based on the operations described. If any input is invalid, the program prints 'Invalid input format'. If the conditions in the loop are met, the program prints 'NO' and returns; otherwise, it prints 'YES' and returns.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads input values for `n` and `k`, followed by a list of `n` integers `a`. It then reads `n` additional integers, each of which is used to update a list `b` of length `n + 1` by adding the corresponding element from `a` to `b[abs(x)]`. The function checks if the cumulative value `r` (initialized as 0 and incremented by `k` for each iteration) is sufficient to cover the values in `b` at each step. If at any point `r` is less than `b[i]`, the function prints 'NO' and returns. If the loop completes without this condition being met, the function prints 'YES'. In case of invalid input, the function prints 'Invalid input format'. The function does not return any value explicitly, but its primary purpose is to determine and print whether the condition `r >= b[i]` holds true for all `i` in the range 1 to `n`.

    except (ValueError):
        print('Invalid input format')
        #This is printed: Invalid input format
    #State: If the input is a valid integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4, `t` is set to this integer, and the function calls `func_1()` `t` times. If the input is not a valid integer, the program prints 'Invalid input format' and terminates without executing the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `t` from the user input, where `1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4`. If the input is valid, it calls the function `func_1` exactly `t` times. If the input is invalid (not a valid integer or out of the specified range), it prints 'Invalid input format' and does not execute the loop. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, if the input was valid, `func_1` has been called `t` times; otherwise, an error message is printed.
