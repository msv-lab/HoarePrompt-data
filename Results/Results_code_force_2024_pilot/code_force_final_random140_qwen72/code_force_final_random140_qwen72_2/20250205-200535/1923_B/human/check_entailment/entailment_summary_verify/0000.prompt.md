You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are playing a computer game. The current level of this game can be modeled
as a straight line. Your character is in point 0 of this line. There are n
monsters trying to kill your character; the i -th monster has health equal to
a_i and is initially in the point x_i .

Every second, the following happens:

  * first, you fire up to k bullets at monsters. Each bullet targets exactly one monster and decreases its health by 1 . For each bullet, you choose its target arbitrary (for example, you can fire all bullets at one monster, fire all bullets at different monsters, or choose any other combination). Any monster can be targeted by a bullet, regardless of its position and any other factors; 
  * then, all alive monsters with health 0 or less die; 
  * then, all alive monsters move 1 point closer to you (monsters to the left of you increase their coordinates by 1 , monsters to the right of you decrease their coordinates by 1 ). If any monster reaches your character (moves to the point 0 ), you lose. 

Can you survive and kill all n monsters without letting any of them reach your
character?

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 3 \cdot 10^4 )
— the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines:

  * the first line contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ; 1 \le k \le 2 \cdot 10^9 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains n integers x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n (-n \le x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < \dots < x_n \le n ; x_i \ne 0 ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if you can kill all n monsters before they reach
your character, or NO otherwise.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

    2 1 3 2 5
    
    -3 -2 3 4 5
    
    2 1
    
    1 2
    
    1 2

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, you can act as follows:

  * during the 1 -st second, fire 1 bullet at the 1 -st monster and 1 bullet at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 1 -st monster dies, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd monster move closer; 
  * during the 2 -nd second, fire 2 bullets at the 2 -nd monster. Then the 2 -nd monster dies, the 3 -rd monster moves closer; 
  * during the 3 -rd second, fire 2 bullets at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 3 -rd monster dies. 

In the second example, you can fire only 1 bullet, so you can kill only one of
the two monsters during the 1 -st second. Then, the remaining monster moves
closer and kills your character.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1():
    try:
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b = [0] * (n + 1)
        for i in range(n):
            x = int(input())
            b[abs(x)] += a[i]
        r = 0
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            r += k
            if r < b[i]:
                print('NO')
                return
            r -= b[i]
        print('YES')
    except ValueError:
        print('Invalid input format')

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    try:
        t = int(input())
        for _ in range(t):
            func_1()
    except ValueError:
        print('Invalid input format')



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `t` from the user input, where `1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4`. If the input is valid, it calls the function `func_1` exactly `t` times. If the input is invalid (not a valid integer or out of the specified range), it prints 'Invalid input format' and does not execute the loop. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, if the input was valid, `func_1` has been called `t` times; otherwise, an error message is printed.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the input format correctly as specified in the problem description. Specifically, the problem states that each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains two integers `n` and `k`, the second line contains `n` integers representing the health of the monsters, and the third line contains `n` integers representing the positions of the monsters. However, in `func_1`, the positions of the monsters are read one by one using a loop, which is incorrect. This will cause the program to fail when reading the input for multiple test cases.

Additionally, the logic in `func_1` does not correctly simulate the game as described. The program incorrectly assumes that the positions of the monsters are always positive and uses `abs(x)` to index into the `b` array. This will not work correctly for negative positions, as the problem specifies that the positions can be negative.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:
```
Input:
2
3 2
1 2 3
-1 2 3
2 1
1 1
-1 1

Expected Output:
YES
NO

Actual Output:
NO
NO
```

In the first test case, the program incorrectly outputs "NO" because it does not correctly handle the positions of the monsters. In the second test case, the program also outputs "NO" incorrectly for the same reason.
