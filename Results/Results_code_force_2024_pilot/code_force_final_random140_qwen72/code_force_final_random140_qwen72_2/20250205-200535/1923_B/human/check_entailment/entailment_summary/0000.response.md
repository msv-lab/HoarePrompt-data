### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Looping:**
   - `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times, calling `func_1` for each test case. This correctly handles the input format as described in the problem statement.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - `func_1` reads the values of `n` and `k` for each test case.
   - It then reads the list `a` of monster healths and the list `x` of monster positions.
   - The function uses a list `b` of length `n + 1` to accumulate the total health of monsters that are at a distance `i` from the player. This is done by updating `b[abs(x)]` with the corresponding health from `a`.

3. **Checking Survival:**
   - The function initializes a variable `r` to 0, which represents the cumulative number of bullets fired.
   - For each distance `i` from 1 to `n`, it increments `r` by `k` (the number of bullets that can be fired per second).
   - It then checks if the cumulative bullets `r` are sufficient to cover the total health of monsters at distance `i` (`b[i]`). If `r` is less than `b[i]`, it prints 'NO' and returns, indicating that the player cannot survive.
   - If the loop completes without encountering this condition, it prints 'YES', indicating that the player can survive and kill all monsters.

4. **Error Handling:**
   - Both functions handle invalid input by printing 'Invalid input format' and returning or breaking out of the loop.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It reads the input, processes each test case, and determines whether the player can survive and kill all monsters. The functions work together to ensure that the program meets the requirements of the problem.

### Correctness:
**True**
