Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the code snippet).
- `a` is an input string with a length greater than 1.
- `i` is `len(a) - 2`.
- `cut` is the number of occurrences where a '1' is immediately followed by a '0' in the string `a`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(cut + 1)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `a`**: This is an input string with a length greater than 1. The exact content of `a` is not specified, but it must contain at least two characters.
2. **Variable `i`**: This is calculated as `len(a) - 2`. Since `a` has a length greater than 1, `i` will be a non-negative integer representing the second-to-last index of the string `a`.
3. **Variable `cut`**: This is the number of occurrences where a '1' is immediately followed by a '0' in the string `a`. The exact value of `cut` depends on the content of `a`.

### What is Printed:
The code snippet `print(cut + 1)` will print the value of `cut` plus 1. 

- **`cut`**: The number of times '1' is immediately followed by '0' in the string `a`.
- **`cut + 1`**: The value of `cut` incremented by 1.

### Final Output:
Output: **cut + 1 (where cut is the number of occurrences where a '1' is immediately followed by a '0' in the string `a`)**
