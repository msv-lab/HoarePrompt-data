To determine what will be printed by the `print(cut + 1)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 1 (this variable is not used in the print statement, so it's not relevant to our calculation).
   - `a` is a new input string with a length greater than 1.
   - `i` is `len(a) - 2` (this variable is not used in the print statement, so it's not relevant to our calculation).
   - `cut` is the number of occurrences of the substring "10" in `a`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The statement `print(cut + 1)` will print the value of `cut` plus 1.

3. **Explanation:**
   - `cut` is the number of times the substring "10" appears in the string `a`.
   - Adding 1 to `cut` gives us `cut + 1`.

Since the exact value of `cut` depends on the specific content of the string `a`, we can only describe the output in terms of `cut`.

Output: **cut + 1 (where cut is the number of occurrences of the substring "10" in the string a)**
