The value of `cut` is incremented by 1. Initially, `cut` is set to 2 if the second character of `a` is '1' and the third character of `a` is '0'; otherwise, `cut` remains 0. After the increment, if the condition was met, `cut` becomes 3. If the condition was not met, `cut` becomes 1. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `a` is an input string with a length greater than 2, `i` is 2, if the second character of `a` is '1' and the third character of `a` is '0', then `cut` is 3. Otherwise, `cut` is 1.**
