### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum number of pieces to cut a binary string into so that these pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string.
   - A sorted binary string has all '0's before all '1's.

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The key observation is that any transition from '1' to '0' in the string indicates a point where we need to make a cut to ensure that the pieces can be rearranged correctly.
   - For example, in the string "11010", there are two transitions from '1' to '0' (at positions 2 and 4). This means we need to make cuts at these points to get the pieces "11", "0", and "10".

3. **Program Logic:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `a`.
   - It initializes a counter `cut` to 0.
   - It iterates through the string, checking for transitions from '1' to '0'.
   - Each time it finds such a transition, it increments the `cut` counter.
   - Finally, it prints `cut + 1` because the number of pieces is one more than the number of cuts.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If the string is already sorted (all '0's followed by all '1's), no cuts are needed, and the program correctly outputs 1.
   - If the string consists of only '0's or only '1's, no cuts are needed, and the program correctly outputs 1.
   - If the string has multiple transitions, the program correctly counts the number of cuts and adds 1 to get the number of pieces.

5. **Verification with Examples:**
   - For "11010", the program correctly identifies two transitions and outputs 3.
   - For "00000000", the program correctly identifies no transitions and outputs 1.
   - For "1", the program correctly identifies no transitions and outputs 1.
   - For "10", the program correctly identifies one transition and outputs 2.
   - For "0001111", the program correctly identifies no transitions and outputs 1.
   - For "0110", the program correctly identifies one transition and outputs 2.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of pieces needed to rearrange the binary string into a sorted binary string. Therefore, the program is correct.
