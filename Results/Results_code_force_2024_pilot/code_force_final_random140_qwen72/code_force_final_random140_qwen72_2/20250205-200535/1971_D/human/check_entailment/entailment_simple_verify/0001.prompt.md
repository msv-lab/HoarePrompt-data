You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a = input()
        cut = 0
        for i in range(len(a) - 1):
            if a[i] == '1' and a[i + 1] == '0':
                cut += 1
        print(cut + 1)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and s is a string of length 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500 consisting of characters '0' and '1'.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a = input()
        
        cut = 0
        
        for i in range(len(a) - 1):
            if a[i] == '1' and a[i + 1] == '0':
                cut += 1
        
        print(cut + 1)
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `a` is the last input string with a length greater than 1, `i` is `len(a) - 2`, and `cut` is the number of occurrences of the substring "10" in the last input string `a`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum number of pieces to cut a binary string into so that these pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string.
   - A sorted binary string has all '0's before all '1's.

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The key observation is that any transition from '1' to '0' in the string indicates a point where we need to make a cut to ensure that the pieces can be rearranged correctly.
   - For example, in the string "11010", there are two transitions from '1' to '0' (at positions 2 and 4). This means we need to make cuts at these points to get the pieces "11", "0", and "10".

3. **Program Logic:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `a`.
   - It initializes a counter `cut` to 0.
   - It iterates through the string, checking for transitions from '1' to '0'.
   - Each time it finds such a transition, it increments the `cut` counter.
   - Finally, it prints `cut + 1` because the number of pieces is one more than the number of cuts.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If the string is already sorted (all '0's followed by all '1's), no cuts are needed, and the program correctly outputs 1.
   - If the string consists of only '0's or only '1's, no cuts are needed, and the program correctly outputs 1.
   - If the string has multiple transitions, the program correctly counts the number of cuts and adds 1 to get the number of pieces.

5. **Verification with Examples:**
   - For "11010", the program correctly identifies two transitions and outputs 3.
   - For "00000000", the program correctly identifies no transitions and outputs 1.
   - For "1", the program correctly identifies no transitions and outputs 1.
   - For "10", the program correctly identifies one transition and outputs 2.
   - For "0001111", the program correctly identifies no transitions and outputs 1.
   - For "0110", the program correctly identifies one transition and outputs 2.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of pieces needed to rearrange the binary string into a sorted binary string. Therefore, the program is correct.
