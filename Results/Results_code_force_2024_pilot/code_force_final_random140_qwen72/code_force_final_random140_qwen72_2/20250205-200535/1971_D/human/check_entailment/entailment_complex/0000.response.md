Reasoning:  
The program aims to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of pieces a binary string needs to be cut into so that these pieces can be rearranged into a sorted binary string. The logic implemented in the function is to count the number of times a '1' is immediately followed by a '0' in the string. Each occurrence of "10" indicates a point where the string needs to be cut because a '1' cannot precede a '0' in a sorted binary string. By adding 1 to the count of these occurrences, we get the total number of pieces required.

The program correctly handles the following aspects:
- Reading the number of test cases.
- Iterating through each test case.
- Counting the transitions from '1' to '0'.
- Printing the result for each test case, which is the number of cuts plus one.

There are no logical errors in the program, and it correctly implements the solution based on the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **True**
