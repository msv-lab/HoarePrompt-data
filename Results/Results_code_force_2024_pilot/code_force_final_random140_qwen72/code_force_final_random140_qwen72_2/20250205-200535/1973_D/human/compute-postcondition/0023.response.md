To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `j` and `k`.

1. **Variable `j`**: This variable is initialized by the loop and will start from 1.
2. **Variable `k`**: The loop will run as long as `j` is less than or equal to `k`. Therefore, `k` must be a positive integer.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\)
- `i` is `n // k`
- `max_val` is the largest integer \(i\) such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n` (if no such \(i\) exists, `max_val` remains 0)
- `m` is `i * max_val`
- `p` is 0

For the loop to execute:
- `j` must start at 1.
- `k` must be a positive integer greater than or equal to 1.

Therefore, the adjusted state should ensure that `k` is at least 1 and `j` starts at 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\), `i` is `n // k`, `max_val` is the largest integer \(i\) such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n` (if no such \(i\) exists, `max_val` remains 0), `m` is `i * max_val`, `p` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` must be greater than or equal to 1**
