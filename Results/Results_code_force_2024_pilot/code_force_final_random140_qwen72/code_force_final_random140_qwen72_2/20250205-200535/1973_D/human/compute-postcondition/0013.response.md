To determine the state adjustments necessary for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `max_val` is either 0 or `n - 1` depending on whether `r` is greater than `n` or not.
- `r` is the result of `func_1(1, (n - 1) * n)`.
- If `r` is less than or equal to `n`, `max_val` is set to `n - 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `max_val` remains 0.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates from `n` down to `1` (inclusive) in steps of `-1`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n - 1`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1.
- The loop condition is `i > 0`, so `i` must be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Current State**: `i` is `n - 1`.
2. **Next Iteration**: `i` will be decremented by 1, so `i` will be `n - 2`.
3. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i > 0`.

### Final State:
- `i` is `n - 2`.
- The other variables (`n`, `max_val`, `r`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head and are not modified by the loop itself.

### Conclusion:
State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\), `i` is `n - 2`, `max_val` is either 0 or `n - 1` depending on whether `r` is greater than `n` or not, and `r` is the result of `func_1(1, (n - 1) * n)`**.
