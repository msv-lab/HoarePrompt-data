Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\), `i` is `n - 1`, `max_val` is `n - 1`, `r` is the result of `func_1(1, (n - 1) * n)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- The values of `n`, `i`, `max_val`, and `r` remain unchanged.
- The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most immediate loop or conditional block it is within.
