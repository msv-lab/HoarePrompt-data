The given code snippet updates the value of `p` by calling `func_1(p + 1, m)`. Let's break down the impact of this code on the program:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\).
   - `i` is `n // k`.
   - `max_val` is the largest integer \(i\) such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n` (if no such \(i\) exists, `max_val` remains 0).
   - `m` is `i * max_val`.
   - `p` is `func_1(p + 1, m)`.
   - `j` is 3.
   - `k` is greater than or equal to 1.

2. **Code Execution:**
   - The line `p = func_1(p + 1, m)` updates the value of `p` to the result of the function call `func_1(p + 1, m)`.

3. **Impact on Variables:**
   - `p` is updated to the new value `func_1(p + 1, m)`.
   - All other variables (`n`, `i`, `max_val`, `m`, `j`, `k`) remain unchanged.

4. **Output State:**
   - `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\).
   - `i` is `n // k`.
   - `max_val` is the largest integer \(i\) such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n` (if no such \(i\) exists, `max_val` remains 0).
   - `m` is `i * max_val`.
   - `p` is now `func_1(p + 1, m)`.
   - `j` is 3.
   - `k` is greater than or equal to 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\), `i` is `n // k`, `max_val` is the largest integer \(i\) such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n` (if no such \(i\) exists, `max_val` remains 0), `m` is `i * max_val`, `p` is `func_1(p + 1, m)`, `j` is 3, `k` is greater than or equal to 1.**
