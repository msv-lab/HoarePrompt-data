The only variable in the loop head is `_`, and the loop's execution depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be initialized or adjusted; it simply takes on values from the range generated by `range(t)`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
