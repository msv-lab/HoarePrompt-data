To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `j` and `k`.

Given the loop statement:
```python
for j in range(1, k + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

For the loop to execute:
- `k` must be at least 1, because the range function `range(1, k + 1)` will generate a sequence starting from 1 up to but not including `k + 1`. If `k` is 0, the range would be empty, and the loop would not execute.

At the start of the loop:
- `j` should be 1, as this is the first value in the range generated by `range(1, k + 1)`.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments to ensure the loop executes are:
- `k` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `j` should be 1.

The other variables (`n`, `i`, `max_val`, `m`, `p`) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\), `i` is `n // k - 1`, `max_val` is the largest integer \(i\) such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n` (if no such \(i\) exists, `max_val` remains 0), `m` is `i * max_val`, `p` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, and `p` is not equal to `n`**
