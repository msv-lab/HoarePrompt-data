Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\), `i` is `n // k`, `max_val` is the largest integer \(i\) such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n` (if no such \(i\) exists, `max_val` remains 0), `m` is `i * max_val`, `p` is `func_1(p + 1, m)`, `j` is 1, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, and the current value of `p` is greater than or equal to `n`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is currently in. The values of the variables `n`, `i`, `max_val`, `m`, `p`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged. The only change is that the program control exits the current loop or conditional block.
