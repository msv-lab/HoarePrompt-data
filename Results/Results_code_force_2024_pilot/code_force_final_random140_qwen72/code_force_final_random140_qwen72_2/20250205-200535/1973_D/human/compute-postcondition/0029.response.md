Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\), `i` is `n // k`, `max_val` is the largest integer \(i\) such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n` (if no such \(i\) exists, `max_val` remains 0), `m` is `i * max_val`, `p` is `func_1(p + 1, m)`, `j` is 2, `k` is greater than or equal to 1. If `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- The value of `p` is updated to `func_1(p + 1, m)`.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `max_val`, `m`, `j`, `k`) remain unchanged.
- The condition for breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement is checked: if `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
