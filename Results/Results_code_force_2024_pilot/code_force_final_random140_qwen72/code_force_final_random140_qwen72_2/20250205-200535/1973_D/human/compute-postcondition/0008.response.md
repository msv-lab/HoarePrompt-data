The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters. However, it is mentioned that `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, which suggests that the context or environment in which `func_4` is called might involve `t`. Since the function itself does not take parameters, its behavior or output is not directly dependent on `t`.

Given the lack of specific output details, I can only infer that the function might perform some operations related to the concept of test cases, but without further information, the exact output cannot be determined.

However, based on the given structure and the typical use of such functions in programming, we can generalize:

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It likely performs operations related to a predefined number of test cases (`t`), but the specific output or return value is not defined in the provided information.**
