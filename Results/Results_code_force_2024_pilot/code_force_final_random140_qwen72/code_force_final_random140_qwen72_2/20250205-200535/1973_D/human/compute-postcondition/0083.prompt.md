Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After all iterations of the loop, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\), `i` is 0, and `max_val` is the largest integer \(i\) such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n`. If no such \(i\) exists, `max_val` remains 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n // k, 0, -1):
    m = i * max_val
    p = 0
    for j in range(1, k + 1):
        p = func_1(p + 1, m)
        if p >= n:
            break
    if p == n:
        func_2(m)
        return


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\), `i` is `n // k`, `max_val` is the largest integer \(i\) such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n` (if no such \(i\) exists, `max_val` remains 0), `m` is `i * max_val`, `p` is the final value after all iterations of the loop, which is `func_1(p + 1, m)` for each iteration until `p` is greater than or equal to `n` or `j` reaches `k`, `j` is `k`, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, and `p` is not equal to `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\), `i` is `n // k - 1`, `max_val` is the largest integer \(i\) such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n` (if no such \(i\) exists, `max_val` remains 0), `m` is `i * max_val`, `p` is the final value of `func_1(p + 1, m)` after the loop completes, `j` is `k`, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, and `p` is not equal to `n` unless the loop breaks because `p` becomes greater than or equal to `n`. Additionally, `p` is not equal to `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\), `i` is `n // k - 2`, `max_val` is the largest integer \(i\) such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n` (if no such \(i\) exists, `max_val` remains 0), `m` is `i * max_val`, `j` is `k`, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, and `p` is the result of `func_1(p + 1, m)` after the loop has executed `k` times. If `p` is greater than or equal to `n` at any point during the loop, the loop breaks, and `p` retains the value it had when the condition was met. Otherwise, `p` is the final result of `func_1(p + 1, m)` after the loop completes all `k` iterations. Additionally, `p` is not equal to `n`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
