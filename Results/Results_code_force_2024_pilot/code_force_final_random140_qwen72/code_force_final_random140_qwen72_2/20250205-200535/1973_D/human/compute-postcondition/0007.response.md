Output State: **`t` is 0.**

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `t` (which represents the number of test cases) will be reduced to 0. This is because each iteration of the loop effectively decrements the value of `t` by 1, and the loop continues until `t` reaches 0. Therefore, when the loop finishes executing, `t` will be 0.
