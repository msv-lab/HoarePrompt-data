To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables and conditions specified in the loop head. The loop head is:

```python
for j in range(1, k + 1):
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The variable `j` is the loop counter.
   - The variable `k` is the upper bound for the loop.

2. **Current State:**
   - `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\).
   - `i` is `n // k - 1`.
   - `max_val` is the largest integer \(i\) such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n` (if no such \(i\) exists, `max_val` remains 0).
   - `m` is `i * max_val`.
   - `p` is `func_1(p + 1, m)`.
   - `j` is 2.
   - `k` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - `p` is not equal to `n`.

3. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - The loop will execute again if `j` is less than `k + 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 2.
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, making it 3.
   - The condition `k` must still be greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to continue.

### Adjusted State:
- `j` is incremented by 1, so `j` is now 3.
- `k` must remain greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to continue.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\), `i` is `n // k - 1`, `max_val` is the largest integer \(i\) such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n` (if no such \(i\) exists, `max_val` remains 0), `m` is `i * max_val`, `p` is `func_1(p + 1, m)`, `j` is 3, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, and `p` is not equal to `n`.**
