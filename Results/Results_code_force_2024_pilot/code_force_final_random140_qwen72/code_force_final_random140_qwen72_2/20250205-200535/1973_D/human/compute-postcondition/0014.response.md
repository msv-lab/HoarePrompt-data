Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\), `i` is `n - 2`, `max_val` is either 0 or `n - 1` depending on whether `r` is greater than `n` or not, and `r` is the result of `func_1(1, (n - 2) * n)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` remains unchanged.
- The value of `i` remains `n - 2`.
- The value of `max_val` remains either 0 or `n - 1` depending on whether the new value of `r` is greater than `n` or not.
- The value of `r` is updated to the result of `func_1(1, (n - 2) * n)`.
