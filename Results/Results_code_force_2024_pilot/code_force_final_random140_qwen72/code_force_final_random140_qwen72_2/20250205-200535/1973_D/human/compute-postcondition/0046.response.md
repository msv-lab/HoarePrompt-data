Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\), `i` is `n // k - 1`, `max_val` is the largest integer \(i\) such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n` (if no such \(i\) exists, `max_val` remains 0), `m` is `i * max_val`, `p` is `func_1(p + 1, m)`, `j` is 1, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, and `p` is not equal to `n`. Additionally, the current value of `p` is greater than or equal to `n`.**
