To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and its impact on the variables:

### Initial State:
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\)
- `i` is `n // k`
- `max_val` is the largest integer \(i\) such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n` (if no such \(i\) exists, `max_val` remains 0)
- `m` is `i * max_val`
- `p` is the final value after all iterations of the loop, which is `func_1(p + 1, m)` for each iteration until `p` is greater than or equal to `n` or `j` reaches `k`
- `j` is `k`
- `k` is greater than or equal to 1
- `p` is equal to `n`

### Code Snippet:
```python
func_2(m)
```

### Analysis:
- The function `func_2(m)` is called with the argument `m`.
- The exact behavior of `func_2` is not specified, so we cannot determine how it affects the variables directly.
- However, since the function call does not modify any of the variables explicitly mentioned in the initial state, the values of these variables remain unchanged.

### Output State:
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\)
- `i` is `n // k`
- `max_val` is the largest integer \(i\) such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n` (if no such \(i\) exists, `max_val` remains 0)
- `m` is `i * max_val`
- `p` is the final value after all iterations of the loop, which is `func_1(p + 1, m)` for each iteration until `p` is greater than or equal to `n` or `j` reaches `k`
- `j` is `k`
- `k` is greater than or equal to 1
- `p` is equal to `n`

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\), `i` is `n // k`, `max_val` is the largest integer \(i\) such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n` (if no such \(i\) exists, `max_val` remains 0), `m` is `i * max_val`, `p` is the final value after all iterations of the loop, which is `func_1(p + 1, m)` for each iteration until `p` is greater than or equal to `n` or `j` reaches `k`, `j` is `k`, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, and `p` is equal to `n`.**
