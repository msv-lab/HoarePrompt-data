Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\), `i` is 0, and `max_val` is the largest integer \(i\) such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n`. If no such \(i\) exists, `max_val` remains 0.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `n` down to 1, decrementing `i` by 1 each time.
- For each iteration, `r` is calculated as `func_1(1, i * n)`.
- If `r` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop sets `max_val` to the current value of `i` and breaks out of the loop.
- If no such `i` is found where `r` is less than or equal to `n`, `max_val` remains 0.
- After all iterations, `i` will be 0 because the loop runs until `i` reaches 0.
