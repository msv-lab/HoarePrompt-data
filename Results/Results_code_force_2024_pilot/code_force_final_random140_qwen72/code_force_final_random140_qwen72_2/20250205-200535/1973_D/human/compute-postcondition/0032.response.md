To determine the states that need adjustment for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop head:

### Given Information:
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is `n // k`.
- `max_val` is the largest integer \(i\) such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n` (if no such \(i\) exists, `max_val` remains 0).
- `m` is `i * max_val`.
- `p` is `func_1(p + 1, m)`.
- `j` is 2.
- `k` is greater than or equal to 1.
- If `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing the next statement after the if block.

### Loop Head:
```python
for j in range(1, k + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop head involves the variable `j` and the parameter `k`.
- The loop will continue as long as `j` is within the range `1` to `k` (inclusive).

### Current State:
- `j` is 2.
- `k` is greater than or equal to 1.

### Adjustments Needed:
- For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1.
- The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than or equal to `k`.

### New State:
- `j` is incremented from 2 to 3.
- The condition for the loop to continue is that `j` must be less than or equal to `k`.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\), `i` is `n // k`, `max_val` is the largest integer \(i\) such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n` (if no such \(i\) exists, `max_val` remains 0), `m` is `i * max_val`, `p` is `func_1(p + 1, m)`, `j` is 3, `k` is greater than or equal to 1. If `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing the next statement after the if block.**
