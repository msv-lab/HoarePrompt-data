The function `func_2(m)` is called with the argument `m`. Since the exact implementation of `func_2` is not provided, we cannot determine the specific changes it might make to the variables or the program state. However, based on the initial state, we know that:

- `i` remains `n // k - 2`
- `n // k` must be greater than 1
- `n` and `k` remain unchanged
- `m` is still `i * max_val`
- `j` is `k`
- `k` must be greater than 0
- `p` is the final value returned by `func_1(p + 1, m)` after the last iteration, unless `p` became greater than or equal to `n` during any iteration, in which case `p` is set to 0 and the loop breaks early. Currently, `p` is equal to `n`.

Since `func_2(m)` does not modify the values of `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `j`, or `p` (as no information about such modifications is provided), the state of these variables remains the same.

Output State: **`i` remains `n // k - 2`, `n // k` must be greater than 1, `n` and `k` remain unchanged, `m` is still `i * max_val`, `j` is `k`, `k` must be greater than 0, and `p` is the final value returned by `func_1(p + 1, m)` after the last iteration, unless `p` became greater than or equal to `n` during any iteration, in which case `p` is set to 0 and the loop breaks early. Additionally, the current value of `p` is equal to `n`.**
