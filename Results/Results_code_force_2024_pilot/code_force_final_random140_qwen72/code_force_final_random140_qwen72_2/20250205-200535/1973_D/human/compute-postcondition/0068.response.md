Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\), `i` is `n // k - 2`, `max_val` is the largest integer \(i\) such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n` (if no such \(i\) exists, `max_val` remains 0), `m` is `i * max_val`, `p` is the result of `func_1(p + 1, m)`, `j` is 1, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `p` is now greater than or equal to `n`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- The `break` statement causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is currently in.
- The values of `n`, `i`, `max_val`, `m`, `p`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged.
- The condition that `p` is now greater than or equal to `n` is still valid.
- The output state reflects that the program has exited the loop or conditional block, but all other variable values and conditions remain as they were before the `break` statement was executed.
