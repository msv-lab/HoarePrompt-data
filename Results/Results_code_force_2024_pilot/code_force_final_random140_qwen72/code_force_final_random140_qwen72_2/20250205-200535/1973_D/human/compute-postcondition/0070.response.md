To determine the state adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop head:

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\)
- `i` is `n // k - 2`
- `max_val` is the largest integer \(i\) such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n` (if no such \(i\) exists, `max_val` remains 0)
- `m` is `i * max_val`
- `p` is the result of `func_1(p + 1, m)`
- `j` is 1
- `k` is greater than or equal to 1
- If `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `n`, `i`, `max_val`, `m`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged, and `p` is still the result of `func_1(p + 1, m)`.

### Loop Head:
```python
for j in range(1, k + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop head involves the variable `j` and the constant `k`.
- The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is within the range `1` to `k` (inclusive).

### Adjustments Needed:
- At the start of the next iteration, `j` should be incremented by 1.
- The condition for the loop to continue is that `j` must be less than or equal to `k`.

### Updated State:
- `j` is incremented from 1 to 2.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `max_val`, `m`, `p`, and `k`) remain unchanged.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\), `i` is `n // k - 2`, `max_val` is the largest integer \(i\) such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n` (if no such \(i\) exists, `max_val` remains 0), `m` is `i * max_val`, `p` is the result of `func_1(p + 1, m)`, `j` is 2, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, and if `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `n`, `i`, `max_val`, `m`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged, and `p` is still the result of `func_1(p + 1, m)`.**
