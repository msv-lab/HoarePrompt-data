Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not correctly solve the problem as specified. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Approach in `func_3`**: The function attempts to find the maximum value by checking `i * n` for `i` ranging from `n` down to `1`. This approach is flawed because it does not consider the actual structure of the array and the constraints of the problem. Specifically, it does not ensure that the subarrays can be split such that all subarrays have the same value of `f(l, r)`.

2. **Incorrect Use of `assert` Statements**: The `assert` statements are used incorrectly. For example, `assert r == n` assumes that the returned value `r` should always be `n`, which is not necessarily true. Similarly, `assert max_val > 0` assumes that a valid `max_val` will always be found, which may not be the case.

3. **Incorrect Calculation of `m`**: The calculation of `m` as `i * max_val` and the subsequent checks do not correctly handle the splitting of the array into `k` subarrays with the same value of `f(l, r)`.

4. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases where no valid `m` exists, especially when `k` is greater than 1.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- Use a more systematic approach to find the maximum value `m` that can be achieved by splitting the array into `k` subarrays.
- Ensure that the subarrays meet the condition `f(l, r) = m` for all subarrays.
- Handle edge cases where no valid `m` exists.

A correct solution would involve a more sophisticated algorithm to explore possible values of `m` and verify if the array can be split accordingly.
