### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem involves finding the largest value `m` such that the array can be split into `k` subarrays where each subarray has a product of its length and its maximum value equal to `m`.
   - The solution involves making queries to determine the smallest `r` such that `f(l, r) = x`.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function makes a query to the interactive system to find the smallest `r` such that `f(l, r) = x`. It reads the response and returns it.
   - **func_2**: This function prints the answer `m` and reads the response to check if the answer is correct.
   - **func_3**: This function handles the logic for a single test case. It tries to find the largest `m` by iterating over possible values and using `func_1` to validate the splits.
   - **func_4**: This function handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases `t` and calling `func_3` for each test case.

3. **Detailed Function Analysis**:
   - **func_3**:
     - It starts by reading `n` and `k` from the input.
     - It initializes `max_val` to 0 and iterates from `n` down to 1 to find the maximum value in the array.
     - It then iterates over possible values of `i` to find the largest `m` such that the array can be split into `k` subarrays with the required property.
     - If a valid `m` is found, it calls `func_2(m)`. If no valid `m` is found, it calls `func_2(-1)`.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in `func_3` correctly attempts to find the largest `m` by iterating over possible values and using `func_1` to validate the splits.
   - The function `func_2` correctly prints the answer and checks if it is correct.
   - The function `func_4` correctly handles multiple test cases by calling `func_3` for each test case.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
