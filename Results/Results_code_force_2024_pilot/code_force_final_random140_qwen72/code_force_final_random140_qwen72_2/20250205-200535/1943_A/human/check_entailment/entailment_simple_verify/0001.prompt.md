You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, representing the number of test cases processed. For each test case, `n` is an input integer, and `a` is a list of integers input by the user. The variable `cntl` is a list of integers with length `n + 1`, where each element `cntl[i]` represents the number of times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`. If `cntl[0]` is 0, the loop prints 0 for that test case. Otherwise, the loop checks each integer from 1 to `n` inclusive. If any integer `j` in the range 1 to `n` has a count less than 2, and either its count is 0 or `c` (which is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]`) becomes 0, the loop breaks early and prints the value of `j`. If no such integer is found, the loop completes all iterations without printing anything. The loop iterates through all `t` test cases, and the final state of `t` is 0, indicating all test cases have been processed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns removing elements from an array `a`.
   - Alice appends the chosen element to an array `c`, while Bob simply removes the chosen element.
   - The goal is to determine the MEX (Minimum EXcludant) of the array `c` at the end of the game, where both players play optimally.
   - Alice aims to maximize the MEX, while Bob aims to minimize it.

2. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice will always choose the smallest available number that can help increase the MEX.
   - Bob will try to prevent Alice from achieving a higher MEX by choosing numbers that are critical to the MEX calculation.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a`.
   - It initializes a count array `cntl` to keep track of the frequency of each number in `a`.
   - If the count of `0` in `a` is zero, it immediately prints `0` because the MEX of an array that doesn't contain `0` is `0`.
   - Otherwise, it initializes a variable `c` to the minimum of `2` and the count of `0` in `a`.
   - It then iterates through the numbers from `1` to `n`:
     - If the count of the current number `j` is less than `2`, it checks if the count is `0` or `1`.
     - If the count is `0`, it prints `j` and breaks out of the loop.
     - If the count is `1`, it decrements `c` and checks if `c` becomes `0`. If so, it prints `j` and breaks out of the loop.

4. **Correctness**:
   - The program correctly handles the base case where the count of `0` is zero.
   - It correctly iterates through the numbers and applies the optimal strategy for both players.
   - The logic ensures that the MEX is calculated correctly by considering the counts of each number and the optimal moves of both players.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and follows the optimal strategy for both players to determine the MEX of the array `c`.

Correctness: **True**
