Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the game between Alice and Bob by calculating the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally. The key points to consider are:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. It reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.

2. **Counting Elements**: The program initializes a list `cntl` of size `n + 1` to count the occurrences of each integer in the array `a`. This is done correctly using a loop.

3. **Handling Special Case for 0**: The program checks if the count of 0 (`cntl[0]`) is zero. If so, it immediately prints 0 and moves to the next test case. This is correct because if 0 is not in the array, the MEX must be 0.

4. **Optimal Play Strategy**:
   - **Variable `c`**: The variable `c` is initialized to the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]`. This is because Alice can pick at most two 0s (if available) to maximize the MEX.
   - **Loop Through Elements**: The program then iterates through the elements from 1 to `n`:
     - If the count of an element `j` is 0, it means `j` is not in the array, and thus the MEX is `j`.
     - If the count of `j` is 1, it means Bob can pick this element, and Alice can only pick one 0 (if `c` is 1). If `c` becomes 0, the MEX is `j`.

5. **Output**: The program prints the MEX for each test case and handles all test cases correctly.

The logic and implementation of the program align with the problem statement and the optimal strategy for both players. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
