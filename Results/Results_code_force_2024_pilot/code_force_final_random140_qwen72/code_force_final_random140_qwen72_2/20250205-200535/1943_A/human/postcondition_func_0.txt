The function `func` processes a series of test cases. Each test case involves an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. The function counts the occurrences of each integer in the list. If the integer `0` does not appear in the list, the function prints `0`. Otherwise, it finds the smallest integer `j` (from 1 to `n`) that appears fewer than twice in the list and prints it. If no such integer exists, the function prints nothing. The function processes all test cases and does not return any values; it only prints results to the console.
