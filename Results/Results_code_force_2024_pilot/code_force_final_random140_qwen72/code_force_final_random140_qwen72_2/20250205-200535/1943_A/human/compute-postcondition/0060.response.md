Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

1. **_ is incremented by the length of list `a`**: This statement modifies `_` but does not affect the print statement directly.
2. **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4**: This is a constraint on `t`, but it does not directly impact the print statement.
3. **`n` is an input integer**: This is the length of the list `a`.
4. **`a` is a new list of integers input by the user**: This is the list whose elements are used to populate `cntl`.
5. **`cntl` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where each element `cntl[i]` is the count of occurrences of `i` in `a`**: This means `cntl` keeps track of how many times each integer from 0 to `n` appears in `a`.
6. **`c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]` (which is 0)**: Since `cntl[0]` is explicitly stated to be 0, `c` will be `min(2, 0)`, which is 0.
7. **`j` is `n`**: This sets `j` to the value of `n`.
8. **`cntl[0]` is 0**: This is explicitly stated and confirms that the count of 0 in `a` is 0.

Given the print statement:
```python
print(0)
```

The print statement simply prints the integer 0. The values of other variables and the state of the program do not affect this specific print statement.

Output: **0**
