Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `_` is incremented by the length of list `a`.
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\).
- `n` must be at least 1.
- `a` is a new list of integers input by the user.
- `cntl` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where each element `cntl[i]` is the count of occurrences of `i` in `a`.
- `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]`.
- `j` is `n - 1`.
- `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(j)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `n`**: 
   - `n` must be at least 1. This means `n` is a positive integer.

2. **Variable `j`**:
   - `j` is defined as `n - 1`.
   - Since `n` is at least 1, `j` will be at least 0 (i.e., \( j = n - 1 \geq 0 \)).

3. **Other Variables**:
   - The other variables (`_`, `t`, `a`, `cntl`, `c`) are not directly relevant to the value of `j` or the `print` statement.

### Conclusion:
The `print(j)` statement will print the value of `j`, which is `n - 1`.

Output: **n - 1 (where n is at least 1)**
