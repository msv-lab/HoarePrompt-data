Output State: **`_` is a placeholder for the loop, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `cntl` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, `i` is the second element of `a`, `cntl[i]` is 2.**

Explanation: The code `cntl[i] += 1` increments the value of `cntl[i]` by 1. Initially, `cntl[i]` was 1, so after the increment, `cntl[i]` becomes 2. All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
