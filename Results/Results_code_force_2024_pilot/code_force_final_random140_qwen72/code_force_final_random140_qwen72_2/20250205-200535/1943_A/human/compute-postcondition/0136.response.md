The code snippet `c -= 1` decrements the value of `c` by 1. However, the initial state does not specify the value of `c`. Therefore, we can only state that `c` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`a` is a new list of integers input by the user with `n` elements, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `j` is 3, `n` is greater than 2, and `c` is decreased by 1.**
