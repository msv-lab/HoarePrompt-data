The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, which iterates over the elements of the list `a`. The state of the loop depends on the list `a` having elements left to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, and `i` was set to the first element of `a`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must still have at least 1 element remaining, and `i` will be set to the next element in the list.

State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new list of integers input by the user that must have at least 1 element, `cntl` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where each element is 0 except `cntl[i]` which is 1, `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]` (which is 0), `j` is `n`, `i` is the next element in the list `a`**
