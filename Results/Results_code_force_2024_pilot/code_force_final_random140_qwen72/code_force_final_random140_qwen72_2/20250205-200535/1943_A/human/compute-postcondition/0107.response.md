Postcondition: **After the loop executes all iterations, `a` is a new list of integers input by the user with `n` elements, and for each element `i` in `a`, `cntl[i]` is incremented by 1. The length of `cntl` remains `n + 1`, and the other variables (`t`, `j`, `c`) remain unchanged. Additionally, the current value of `cntl[0]` is 0.**
