Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new list of integers input by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `cntl` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where each element is 0 except `cntl[i]` which is now 2 (previously it was 1), `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]` (which is 0), `j` is `n`, `i` is the next element in the list `a`.**
