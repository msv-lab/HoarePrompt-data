Output State: **`_` is a placeholder for the loop, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers input by the user.** 

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in a list called `a`. The other variables (`_`, `t`, and `n`) remain unchanged.
