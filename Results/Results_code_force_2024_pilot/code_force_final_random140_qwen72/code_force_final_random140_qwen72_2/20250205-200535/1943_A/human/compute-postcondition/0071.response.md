Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `_` is incremented by the length of list `a`. This does not affect the value of `j` directly.
   - `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4. This is not directly relevant to the value of `j`.
   - `n` must be at least 1. This means `n` is a positive integer.
   - `a` is a new list of integers input by the user.
   - `cntl` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where each element `cntl[i]` is the count of occurrences of `i` in `a`.
   - `c` is the minimum of 1 and `cntl[0]`.
   - `j` is `n`.
   - `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, meaning there is at least one occurrence of 0 in the list `a`.
   - The current value of `cntl[j]` is greater than 0 but less than 2, meaning there is exactly one occurrence of `j` in the list `a`.
   - The current value of `c` is 0, which implies that `cntl[0]` is greater than 1 (since the minimum of 1 and `cntl[0]` would otherwise be 1).

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(j)`.

Given the initial state:
- `j` is set to `n`.
- `n` is at least 1 and is the length of the list `a` minus 1 (since `cntl` has length `n + 1`).
- The value of `j` is the same as `n`.

Therefore, the value of `j` is the length of the list `a` minus 1.

Output: **n (where n is the length of the list `a` minus 1)**
