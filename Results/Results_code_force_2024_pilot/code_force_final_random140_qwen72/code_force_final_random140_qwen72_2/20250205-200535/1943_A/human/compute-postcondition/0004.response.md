The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If `a` contains at least one element, the loop will execute. The variable `i` will take the value of each element in `a` during each iteration.

For the loop to execute, `a` must have at least one element. The state of `i` will be the first element of `a` when the loop starts.

State: **`_` is a placeholder for the loop, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 1 element, `cntl` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, `i` is the first element of `a`**
