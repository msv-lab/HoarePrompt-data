Postcondition: **`_` is a placeholder for the loop, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `n` is an input integer and must be at least 3, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `cntl` is a list of integers with length `n + 1`, where each element `cntl[i]` represents the number of times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]`, and `j` is 3. If `cntl[j]` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `c` is the minimum of 1 and `cntl[0]` - 1, and if `c` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
