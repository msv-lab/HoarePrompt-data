Postcondition: **`_` is a placeholder for the loop, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `n` is an input integer and must be at least 1, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `cntl` is a list of integers with length `n + 1`, where each element `cntl[i]` represents the number of times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]`, `j` is 1, and `cntl[j]` is less than 2. If `cntl[j]` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `cntl[j]` is not 0, and `c` is 0, we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
