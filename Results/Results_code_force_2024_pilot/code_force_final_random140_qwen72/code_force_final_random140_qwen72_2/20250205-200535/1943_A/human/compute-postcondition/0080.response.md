Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `_` is incremented by the length of list `a`.
   - `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\).
   - `n` must be at least 1.
   - `a` is a new list of integers input by the user.
   - `cntl` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where each element `cntl[i]` is the count of occurrences of `i` in `a`.
   - `c` is the minimum of 1 and `cntl[0] - 1`.
   - `j` is `n - 1`.
   - `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(j)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `j` is defined as `n - 1`.
   - Since `n` must be at least 1, the smallest possible value for `n` is 1.
   - Therefore, the smallest possible value for `j` is \(1 - 1 = 0\).

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The value of `j` will be `n - 1`.
   - Given that `n` is at least 1, `j` will be at least 0.

Output: **n - 1 (where n is the length of the list `a` minus 1)**
