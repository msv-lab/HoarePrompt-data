The code snippet `cntl[i] += 1` increments the value at the index `i` in the list `cntl` by 1. Since `i` is the first element of the list `a`, the value at the index `i` in `cntl` is incremented by 1. The list `a` and the variable `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a new list of integers input by the user that must have at least 1 element, `i` is the first element of `a`, `cntl[i]` is incremented by 1.**
