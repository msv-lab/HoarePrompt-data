The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder to iterate over the range specified by the input. For the loop to execute, the input must be a positive integer because the loop iterates based on this value.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of an integer `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where 0 ≤ a_i < n.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

To ensure the loop executes, the input must be a positive integer. Since `t` represents the number of test cases, and each test case will be processed in the loop, the input should be equal to `t`.

State: **`_` is a placeholder for the loop, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, and the input must be a positive integer equal to `t` for the loop to execute.**
