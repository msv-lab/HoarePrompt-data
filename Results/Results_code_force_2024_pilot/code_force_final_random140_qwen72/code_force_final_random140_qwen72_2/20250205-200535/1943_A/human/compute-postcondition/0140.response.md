Postcondition: ***`a` is a new list of integers input by the user with `n` elements, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `j` is 3, and `n` is greater than 2. If `cntl[j]` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `c` is decreased by 1, and if `c` becomes 0, we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
