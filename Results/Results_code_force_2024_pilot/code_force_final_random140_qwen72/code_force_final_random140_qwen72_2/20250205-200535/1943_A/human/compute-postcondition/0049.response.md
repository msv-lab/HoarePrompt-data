The value of `n` is updated to the new input integer. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `cntl` is a list of integers with length `n + 1`, where each element `cntl[i]` represents the number of times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`, `cntl[0]` is 0 indicating that the integer 0 does not appear in the list `a`, `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]`, and `j` is `n`.**
