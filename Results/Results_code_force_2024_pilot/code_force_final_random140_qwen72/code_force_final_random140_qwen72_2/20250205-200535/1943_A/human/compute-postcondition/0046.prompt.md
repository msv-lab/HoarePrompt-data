Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `_` is a placeholder for the loop, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `cntl` is a list of integers with length `n + 1`, where each element `cntl[i]` represents the number of times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]`.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    if cntl[j] < 2:
        if cntl[j] == 0:
            print(j)
            break
        else:
            c -= 1
            if not c:
                print(j)
                break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `_` is a placeholder for the loop, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `n` is an input integer and must be at least 1, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `cntl` is a list of integers with length `n + 1`, where each element `cntl[i]` represents the number of times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]`, `j` is 1. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, and if `cntl[j]` is 0 or `c` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `_` is a placeholder for the loop, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `n` is an input integer and must be at least 1, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `cntl` is a list of integers with length `n + 1`, where each element `cntl[i]` represents the number of times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]`, and `j` is 2. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, then: if `cntl[j]` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `c` is decremented by 1, and if `c` becomes 0, we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `cntl[j]` is not less than 2, the program continues without breaking the loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`_` is a placeholder for the loop, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `n` is an input integer and must be at least 3, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `cntl` is a list of integers with length `n + 1`, where each element `cntl[i]` represents the number of times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]`, and `j` is 3. If `cntl[j]` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `cntl[j]` is 1, `c` is set to the minimum of 1 and `cntl[0]` - 1, and if `c` becomes 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
