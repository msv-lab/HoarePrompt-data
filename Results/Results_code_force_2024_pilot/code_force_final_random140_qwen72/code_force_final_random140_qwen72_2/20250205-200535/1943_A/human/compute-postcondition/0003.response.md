Output State: **`_` is a placeholder for the loop, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `cntl` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`.** 

Explanation: The code initializes a list `cntl` with `n + 1` elements, all set to 0. The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.
