Based on the initial state provided:

- `a` is a list of integers input by the user with `n` elements.
- For each element `i` in `a`, `cntl[i]` is incremented by 1.
- The length of `cntl` is `n + 1`.
- The current value of `cntl[0]` is 0.
- The other variables (`t`, `j`, `c`) remain unchanged.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print(0)
```

This statement simply prints the integer `0`.

Output: **0**
