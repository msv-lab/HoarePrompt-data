Output State: **_ is incremented by the length of list `a`, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new list of integers input by the user, `cntl` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where each element `cntl[i]` is the count of occurrences of `i` in `a`, `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]` (which is 0), and `j` is `n`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each element `i` in the list `a`.
- For each iteration, the value of `cntl[i]` is incremented by 1.
- After all iterations, `cntl[i]` will contain the number of times `i` appears in the list `a`.
- The variable `_` is incremented by 1 for each iteration, so after all iterations, `_` will be incremented by the length of `a`.
- The variables `t`, `n`, `c`, and `j` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
