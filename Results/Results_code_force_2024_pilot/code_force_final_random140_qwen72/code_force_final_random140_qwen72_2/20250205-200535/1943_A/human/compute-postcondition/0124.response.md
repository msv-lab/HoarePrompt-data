The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` relative to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `n` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 (so `j` becomes 2), and `n` must still be greater than `j` (so `n` must be greater than 2).

State: **`a` is a new list of integers input by the user with `n` elements, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `c` is set to the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]`, `j` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 2.**
