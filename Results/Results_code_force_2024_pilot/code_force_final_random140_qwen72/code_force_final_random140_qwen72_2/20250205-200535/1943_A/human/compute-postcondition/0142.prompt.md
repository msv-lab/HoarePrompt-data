Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After the loop executes all iterations, `a` is a new list of integers input by the user with `n` elements, and for each element `i` in `a`, `cntl[i]` is incremented by 1. The length of `cntl` remains `n + 1`, and the other variables (`t`, `j`) remain unchanged. Additionally, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0. `c` is set to the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]`.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    if cntl[j] < 2:
        if cntl[j] == 0:
            print(j)
            break
        else:
            c -= 1
            if not c:
                print(j)
                break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a` is a new list of integers input by the user with `n` elements, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `c` is set to the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]`, `j` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 0. If `cntl[j]` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2 but not equal to 0, `c` is set to the minimum of 1 and `cntl[0]`. If `c` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the same values for `a`, `cntl`, `c`, `j`, and `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`a` is a new list of integers input by the user with `n` elements, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `j` is 2, and `n` is greater than 2. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, the program checks if `cntl[j]` is 0. If `cntl[j]` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `cntl[j]` is 1, `c` is set to the minimum of 1 and `cntl[0] - 1`. If `c` becomes 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `c` is not 0, the program continues as normal.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`a` is a new list of integers input by the user with `n` elements, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `j` is 3, and `n` is greater than 2. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, the following occurs: if `cntl[j]` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `c` is decreased by 1, and if `c` becomes 0, we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
