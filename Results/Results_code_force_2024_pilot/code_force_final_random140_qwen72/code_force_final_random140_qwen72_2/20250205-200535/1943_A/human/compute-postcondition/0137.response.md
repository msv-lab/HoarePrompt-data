Based on the initial state provided:

- `a` is a new list of integers input by the user with `n` elements.
- `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0.
- `j` is 3.
- `n` is greater than 2.
- `c` is decreased by 1 (though `c` is not used in the print statement).

The print statement is:
```python
print(j)
```

The value of `j` is explicitly given as 3. Therefore, the print statement will output the value of `j`.

Output: **3**
