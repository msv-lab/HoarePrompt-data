Postcondition: ***`a` is a new list of integers input by the user with `n` elements, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `c` is set to the minimum of 1 and `cntl[0]`, `j` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, and the current value of `cntl[j]` is less than 2 but not equal to 0. If `c` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the same values for `a`, `cntl`, `c`, `j`, and `n`.***
