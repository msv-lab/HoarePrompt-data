Based on the initial state provided:

- `_` is a placeholder for the loop (not relevant for this specific print statement).
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4 (not relevant for this specific print statement).
- `n` is an input integer and must be at least 3.
- `a` is a list of integers input by the user.
- `cntl` is a list of integers with length `n + 1`, where each element `cntl[i]` represents the number of times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`.
- `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0.
- `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]`.
- `j` is 3.

The print statement is:
```python
print(j)
```

Given that `j` is explicitly set to 3, the print statement will output the value of `j`.

Output: **3**
