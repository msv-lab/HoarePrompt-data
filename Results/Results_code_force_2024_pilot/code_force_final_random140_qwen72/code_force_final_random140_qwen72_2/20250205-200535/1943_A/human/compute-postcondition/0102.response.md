The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `a`. If `a` has more elements, the loop will continue to execute. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `i` is the first element of `a`, and `cntl[i]` is incremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must have at least 2 elements, and `i` will now be the second element of `a`.

State: **`a` is a new list of integers input by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element of `a`, `cntl[i]` is incremented by 1.**
