Output State: **`_` is a placeholder for the loop, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 3 elements, `cntl` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, `i` is the third element of `a`, `cntl[i]` is 3.**

Explanation: The value of `cntl[i]` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
