The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `_` is incremented by 1
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4
- `n` is an input integer
- `a` is a list of integers input by the user
- `cntl` is a list of integers with length `n + 1`, where each element `cntl[i]` represents the number of times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`
- `cntl[0]` is 0, indicating that the integer 0 does not appear in the list `a`
- `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]`
- `j` is `n`

After executing the code snippet, the list `a` is updated to the new list of integers input by the user. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new list of integers input by the user, `cntl` is a list of integers with length `n + 1`, where each element `cntl[i]` represents the number of times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`, `cntl[0]` is 0, `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]`, and `j` is `n`.**
