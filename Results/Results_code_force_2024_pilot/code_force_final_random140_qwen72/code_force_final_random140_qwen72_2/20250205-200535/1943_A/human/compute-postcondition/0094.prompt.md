Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: _ is incremented by the length of list `a`, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new list of integers input by the user, `cntl` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where each element `cntl[i]` is the count of occurrences of `i` in `a`, `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]`, `j` is `n`, and `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    if cntl[j] < 2:
        if cntl[j] == 0:
            print(j)
            break
        else:
            c -= 1
            if not c:
                print(j)
                break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: _ is incremented by the length of list `a`, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `n` must be at least 1, `a` is a new list of integers input by the user, `cntl` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where each element `cntl[i]` is the count of occurrences of `i` in `a`, `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]`, `j` is `n`, and `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, and specifically if `cntl[j]` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `cntl[j]` is greater than 0 but less than 2, `c` is updated to the minimum of 1 and `cntl[0]`, and if `c` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: _ is incremented by the length of list `a`, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `n` must be at least 1, `a` is a new list of integers input by the user, `cntl` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where each element `cntl[i]` is the count of occurrences of `i` in `a`, `j` is `n - 1`, and `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0. If `cntl[j]` is 0 or if `c` (which is the minimum of 1 and `cntl[0] - 1`) is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `c` is the minimum of 1 and `cntl[0] - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: _ is incremented by the length of list `a`, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `n` must be at least 1, `a` is a new list of integers input by the user, `cntl` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where each element `cntl[i]` is the count of occurrences of `i` in `a`, `j` is `n`, and `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0. If `cntl[j]` is 0 or if `c` (which is the minimum of 1 and `cntl[0] - 1`) is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `c` is the minimum of 1 and `cntl[0] - 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
