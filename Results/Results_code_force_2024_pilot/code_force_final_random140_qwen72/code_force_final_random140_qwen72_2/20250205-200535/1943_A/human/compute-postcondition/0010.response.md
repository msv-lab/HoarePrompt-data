Output State: **_ is a placeholder for the loop, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `cntl` is a list of integers with length `n + 1`, where each element `cntl[i]` represents the number of times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each element `i` in the list `a`.
- For each iteration, the value at index `i` in the list `cntl` is incremented by 1.
- After all iterations, `cntl[i]` will contain the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `a`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
