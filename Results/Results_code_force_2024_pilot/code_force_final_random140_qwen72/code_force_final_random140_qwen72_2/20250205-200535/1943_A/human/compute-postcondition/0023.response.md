Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `_` is a placeholder for the loop.
   - `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \times 10^4\).
   - `n` is an input integer and must be at least 1.
   - `a` is a list of integers input by the user.
   - `cntl` is a list of integers with length `n + 1`, where each element `cntl[i]` represents the number of times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`.
   - `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0.
   - `c` is the minimum of 1 and `cntl[0]`.
   - `j` is 1.
   - `cntl[j]` is less than 2.
   - `cntl[j]` is not equal to 0.
   - Additionally, `c` is 0.

2. **Analyzing the Variables:**
   - `j` is explicitly set to 1.
   - `cntl[j]` is less than 2 and not equal to 0. This means `cntl[1]` must be 1.
   - `c` is 0, but this does not affect the value of `j`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(j)`.
   - Since `j` is explicitly set to 1, the value of `j` is 1.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be:

Output: **1**
