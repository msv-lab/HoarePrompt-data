Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 0 ≤ a_i < n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cntl = [(0) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for i in a:
        cntl[i] += 1
    if cntl[0] == 0:
        print(0)
    else:
        c = min(2, cntl[0])
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            if cntl[j] < 2:
                if cntl[j] == 0:
                    print(j)
                    break
                else:
                    c -= 1
                    if not c:
                        print(j)
                        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `cntl` is a list of integers with length `n + 1`, where each element `cntl[i]` represents the number of times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`. If `cntl[0]` is 0, it indicates that the integer 0 does not appear in the list `a`. If `cntl[0]` is not 0, the loop has completed all iterations, and `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]`, and `j` is `n`. The loop has checked each integer from 1 to `n` inclusive. If any integer `j` in the range 1 to `n` had a count less than 2, and either its count was 0 or `c` became 0, the loop broke early and printed the value of `j`. If no such integer was found, the loop completed all iterations without printing anything.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: _ is incremented by the length of list `a`, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new list of integers input by the user, `cntl` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where each element `cntl[i]` is the count of occurrences of `i` in `a`, and `j` is `n`. If `cntl[0]` is 0, then `c` remains 0. Otherwise, `c` is the minimum of 0 and `cntl[0] - (number of times `c` was decremented)`, and `j` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *After the loop executes all iterations, `a` is a new list of integers input by the user with `n` elements, and for each element `i` in `a`, `cntl[i]` is incremented by 1. The length of `cntl` remains `n + 1`, and the other variables (`t`, `j`, `c`) remain unchanged. If `cntl[0]` is 0, the program continues with the updated `cntl` array. Otherwise, the loop will terminate when either a value `j` is found such that `cntl[j]` is 0, or `c` reaches 0. In both cases, the loop will print the current value of `j` and break. If the loop completes all iterations without breaking, `j` will be equal to `n + 1`, and `c` will be the result of subtracting the number of times `cntl[j]` was 1 from the initial value of `c`. The values of `a`, `cntl`, and `n` remain unchanged, except for the changes to `c` and `j` as described.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
