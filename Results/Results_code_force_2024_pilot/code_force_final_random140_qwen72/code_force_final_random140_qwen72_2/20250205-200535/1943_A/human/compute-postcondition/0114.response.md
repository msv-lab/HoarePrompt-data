Based on the initial state:

- `a` is a new list of integers input by the user with `n` elements.
- `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0.
- `c` is set to the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]`.
- `j` is 1.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- The current value of `cntl[j]` is 0.

Given this information, the `print(j)` statement will print the value of `j`.

Since `j` is explicitly set to 1, the output will be:

Output: **1**
