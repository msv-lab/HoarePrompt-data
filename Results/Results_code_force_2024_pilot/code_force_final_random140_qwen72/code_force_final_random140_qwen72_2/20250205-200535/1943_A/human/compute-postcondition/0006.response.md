The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `a`. If there are more elements in `a`, the loop will execute again with the next element.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` was the first element of `a`, and `cntl[i]` was set to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must have at least 2 elements. The next value of `i` will be the second element of `a`.

State: **`_` is a placeholder for the loop, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `cntl` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, `i` is the second element of `a`, `cntl[i]` is 1**
