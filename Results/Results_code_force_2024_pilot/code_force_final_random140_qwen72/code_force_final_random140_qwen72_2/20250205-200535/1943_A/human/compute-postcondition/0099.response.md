Output State: **_ is incremented by 1, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new list of integers input by the user, `cntl` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where each element `cntl[i]` is 0, `j` is 0, and if `cntl[0]` is 0, then `c` remains 0. Otherwise, `c` is the minimum of 0 and `cntl[0] - (number of times `c` was decremented).**

Explanation:
- The line `cntl = [(0) for _ in range(n + 1)]` initializes `cntl` as a list of zeros with length `n + 1`.
- All other variables (`_`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `j`, `c`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The condition for `c` remains the same: if `cntl[0]` is 0, then `c` remains 0. Otherwise, `c` is the minimum of 0 and `cntl[0] - (number of times `c` was decremented).`
