To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop head:

### Given State:
- `_` is incremented by the length of list `a`.
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a new list of integers input by the user.
- `cntl` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where each element `cntl[i]` is the count of occurrences of `i` in `a`.
- `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]`.
- `j` is `n`.
- `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0.

### Loop Head:
```python
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop head involves the variable `j` and the expression `range(1, n + 1)`.
- For the loop to execute, the range must contain at least one value. This means `n + 1` must be greater than 1, which implies `n` must be at least 1.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The variable `j` is initialized to `n` in the given state, but this is not relevant to the loop head.
- The variable `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

### Final State:
- The only adjustment needed is to ensure that `n` is at least 1.
- The other variables and conditions remain as they are.

### Final Answer:
State: **`_` is incremented by the length of list `a`, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `n` must be at least 1, `a` is a new list of integers input by the user, `cntl` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where each element `cntl[i]` is the count of occurrences of `i` in `a`, `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]`, `j` is `n`, and `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0**
