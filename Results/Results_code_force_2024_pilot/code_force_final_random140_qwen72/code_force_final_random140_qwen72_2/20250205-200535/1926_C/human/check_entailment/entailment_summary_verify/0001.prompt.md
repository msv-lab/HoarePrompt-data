You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Please note that the time limit for this problem is only 0.5 seconds per test.

Vladislav wrote the integers from 1 to n , inclusive, on the board. Then he
replaced each integer with the sum of its digits.

What is the sum of the numbers on the board now?

For example, if n=12 then initially the numbers on the board are:

Then after the replacement, the numbers become:

The sum of these numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3=51 . Thus, for n=12 the
answer is 51 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the largest number Vladislav writes.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of the numbers at the
end of the process.

- Program:
soma = 0
for i in range(13):
    soma += func_1(i)
print(soma)

def func_1(n):
    return sum((int(d) for d in str(n)))



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and returns the sum of its digits. After the function concludes, the input integer `n` remains unchanged, and the returned value is the sum of the digits of `n`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires calculating the sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to \( n \).
   - For example, if \( n = 12 \), the numbers on the board are initially 1, 2, 3, ..., 12. After replacing each number with the sum of its digits, the numbers become 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3. The sum of these numbers is 51.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The program initializes a variable `soma` to 0.
   - It then iterates over the range from 0 to 12 (inclusive) using a `for` loop.
   - Inside the loop, it calls the function `func_1(i)` and adds the result to `soma`.
   - Finally, it prints the value of `soma`.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1(n)` takes an integer \( n \) and returns the sum of its digits.
   - It does this by converting the integer to a string, iterating over each character in the string, converting each character back to an integer, and summing these integers.

4. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The loop iterates from 0 to 12, which means it processes the numbers 0 through 12.
   - However, the problem specifies that the numbers should be from 1 to \( n \). Therefore, the loop should start from 1, not 0.
   - The function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a number.

5. **Time Complexity:**
   - The time complexity of the function `func_1` is \( O(\log n) \) because it iterates over the digits of the number.
   - The main loop runs 13 times, which is constant and well within the time limit of 0.5 seconds.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The program is almost correct but has a minor issue with the range of the loop. It should start from 1 instead of 0 to match the problem's requirements.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it includes 0 in the range, which is not part of the problem's requirement. The loop should start from 1 to \( n \).
