Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem description. Specifically, the program does not handle multiple test cases as required by the problem statement. The program also has a fixed loop that iterates from 0 to 12, which does not match the problem's requirement to handle different values of `n` up to \(2 \cdot 10^5\) and multiple test cases.

To be correct, the program should:
1. Read the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, read the value of `n`.
3. Compute the sum of the digit sums for each number from 1 to `n`.
4. Output the result for each test case.

The current implementation fails to meet these requirements, making it incorrect.
