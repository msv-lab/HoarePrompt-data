You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Please note that the time limit for this problem is only 0.5 seconds per test.

Vladislav wrote the integers from 1 to n , inclusive, on the board. Then he
replaced each integer with the sum of its digits.

What is the sum of the numbers on the board now?

For example, if n=12 then initially the numbers on the board are:

Then after the replacement, the numbers become:

The sum of these numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3=51 . Thus, for n=12 the
answer is 51 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the largest number Vladislav writes.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of the numbers at the
end of the process.

- Program: 
soma = 0
for i in range(13):
    soma += func_1(i)
print(soma)

def func_1(n):
    return sum((int(d) for d in str(n)))



- Annotated Code: 
soma = 0
for i in range(13):
    soma += func_1(i)
print(soma)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.
def func_1(n):
    return sum(int(d) for d in str(n))
    #The program returns the sum of the digits of the integer `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and returns the sum of its digits. After the function concludes, the input integer `n` remains unchanged, and the returned value is the sum of the digits of `n`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem description. Specifically, the program does not handle multiple test cases as required by the problem statement. The program also has a fixed loop that iterates from 0 to 12, which does not match the problem's requirement to handle different values of `n` up to \(2 \cdot 10^5\) and multiple test cases.

To be correct, the program should:
1. Read the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, read the value of `n`.
3. Compute the sum of the digit sums for each number from 1 to `n`.
4. Output the result for each test case.

The current implementation fails to meet these requirements, making it incorrect.
