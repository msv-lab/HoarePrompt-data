Postcondition: ***`cur_arr` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `i` is the second element of `cur_arr`, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30, `new_arr` contains the first element of `cur_arr`. If the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is 0, `new_arr` also contains `xor`, and `xor` is 0.***
