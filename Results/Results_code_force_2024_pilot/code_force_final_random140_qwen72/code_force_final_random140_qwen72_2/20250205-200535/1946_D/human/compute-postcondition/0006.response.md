Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `i` is the first element of `cur_arr`, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30, `new_arr` is an empty list, `xor` is now equal to the first element of `cur_arr`.**

Explanation: The value of `xor` is updated by performing an XOR operation with the value of `i`, which is the first element of `cur_arr`. Since `xor` was initially 0, the new value of `xor` is simply the value of `i`. All other variables remain unchanged.
