Postcondition: ***`cur_arr` remains unchanged as it was initially, `bit` remains an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30, `new_arr` contains all the intermediate XOR results where the bit at position `bit` in the XOR result is 0. If the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is set to 1, `thing1` is -1. Otherwise, if the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is 0, `thing1` is the length of `new_arr`.***
