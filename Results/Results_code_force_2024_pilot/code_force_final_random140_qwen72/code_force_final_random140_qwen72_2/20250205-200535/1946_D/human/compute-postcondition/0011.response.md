The only objects in the loop head are `i` and `cur_arr`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the state of `cur_arr`. If `cur_arr` has more elements, the loop will execute again with the next element.

At the end of the last iteration, `cur_arr` is a list of integers with at least one element, `i` is the first element of `cur_arr`, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30, `new_arr` is an empty list or contains the first element of `cur_arr`, and `xor` is either 0 or remains equal to the first element of `cur_arr` depending on whether the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is 0 or 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `cur_arr` must have at least two elements. After the first iteration, `i` will now be the second element of `cur_arr`.

State: **`cur_arr` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `i` is the second element of `cur_arr`, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30, `new_arr` is an empty list or contains the first element of `cur_arr`, and `xor` is either 0 or remains equal to the first element of `cur_arr` depending on whether the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is 0 or 1.**
