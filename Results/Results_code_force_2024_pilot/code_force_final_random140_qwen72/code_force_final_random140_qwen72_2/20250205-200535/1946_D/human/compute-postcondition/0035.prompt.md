You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: cur_arr is a list of integers, and bit is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30.
def find_new(cur_arr, bit):
    if (bit == -1) :
        return len(cur_arr)
        #The program returns the length of the list `cur_arr`.
    #State: cur_arr is a list of integers, and bit is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30, and bit is not -1
    new_arr = []
    xor = 0
    for i in cur_arr:
        xor ^= i
        
        if not xor >> bit & 1:
            new_arr.append(xor)
            xor = 0
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `cur_arr` remains unchanged as it was initially. `bit` remains an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30. `new_arr` contains all the intermediate XOR results where the bit at position `bit` in the XOR result is 0. `xor` is 0 if the final XOR of all elements in `cur_arr` has the bit at position `bit` set to 0; otherwise, `xor` is the final XOR of all elements in `cur_arr`.
    if (xor >> bit & 1) :
        thing1 = -1
    else :
        thing1 = len(new_arr)
    #State: *`cur_arr` remains unchanged as it was initially, `bit` remains an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30, `new_arr` contains all the intermediate XOR results where the bit at position `bit` in the XOR result is 0. If the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is set to 1, `thing1` is -1. Otherwise, if the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is 0, `thing1` is the length of `new_arr`.
    if (x >> bit & 1) :
        return max(thing1, find_new(cur_arr, bit - 1))
        #The program returns the maximum value between -1 and the result of `find_new(cur_arr, bit - 1)`. Here, `cur_arr` remains unchanged, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30, and `thing1` is -1. The function `find_new` is called with `cur_arr` and `bit - 1` as arguments, and its result is compared with -1 to determine the final return value.
    else :
        if (thing1 != -1) :
            return find_new(new_arr, bit - 1)
            #The program returns the result of the function `find_new` called with `new_arr` and `bit - 1`. Here, `new_arr` contains all the intermediate XOR results where the bit at position `bit` in the XOR result is 0, and `bit - 1` is an integer such that 0 <= bit - 1 < 30.
        #State: *`cur_arr` remains unchanged as it was initially, `bit` remains an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30, `new_arr` contains all the intermediate XOR results where the bit at position `bit` in the XOR result is 0. The bit at position `bit` in `x` is 0, and `thing1` is the length of `new_arr`. Additionally, `thing1` is -1.
    #State: *`cur_arr` remains unchanged as it was initially, `bit` remains an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30, `new_arr` contains all the intermediate XOR results where the bit at position `bit` in the XOR result is 0. The bit at position `bit` in `x` is 0, and `thing1` is the length of `new_arr`. Additionally, `thing1` is -1.
    return -1
    #The program returns -1.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `find_new` accepts a list of integers `cur_arr` and an integer `bit` (0 <= bit < 30). It returns the length of `cur_arr` in Case_1, the maximum value between -1 and the result of `find_new(cur_arr, bit - 1)` in Case_2, the result of `find_new(new_arr, bit - 1)` where `new_arr` contains XOR results with the bit at position `bit` set to 0 in Case_3, and -1 in Case_4.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the length of the list `cur_arr`.

Case_2: The program returns the maximum value between -1 and the result of `find_new(cur_arr, bit - 1)`. Here, `cur_arr` remains unchanged, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30, and `thing1` is -1. The function `find_new` is called with `cur_arr` and `bit - 1` as arguments, and its result is compared with -1 to determine the final return value.

Case_3: The program returns the result of the function `find_new` called with `new_arr` and `bit - 1`. Here, `new_arr` contains all the intermediate XOR results where the bit at position `bit` in the XOR result is 0, and `bit - 1` is an integer such that 0 <= bit - 1 < 30.

Case_4: The program returns -1.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
