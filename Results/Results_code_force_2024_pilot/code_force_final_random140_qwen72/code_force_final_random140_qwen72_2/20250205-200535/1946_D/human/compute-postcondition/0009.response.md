Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `i` is the first element of `cur_arr`, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30, `new_arr` is a list containing the first element of `cur_arr`, `xor` is 0.** 

Explanation: The code sets `xor` to 0, overriding its previous value which was the first element of `cur_arr`. All other variables (`cur_arr`, `i`, `bit`, `new_arr`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
