Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `i` is the second element of `cur_arr`, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30, `new_arr` contains the first element of `cur_arr` and `xor`, and `xor` is the result of `xor` XOR `i`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `xor` to the list `new_arr`. Initially, `new_arr` was either empty or contained the first element of `cur_arr`. After the code executes, `new_arr` now contains the first element of `cur_arr` (if it was already present) and the value of `xor`. The values of `cur_arr`, `i`, `bit`, and `xor` remain unchanged.
