Output State: **The program returns the maximum value between -1 and the result of `find_new(cur_arr, bit - 1)`. Here, `cur_arr` remains unchanged, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30, and `thing1` is -1. The function `find_new` is called with `cur_arr` and `bit - 1` as arguments, and its result is compared with -1 to determine the final return value.**
