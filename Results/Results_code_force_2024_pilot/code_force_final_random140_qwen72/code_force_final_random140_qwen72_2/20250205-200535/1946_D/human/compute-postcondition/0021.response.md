Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `cur_arr` remains unchanged as it was initially. `bit` remains an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30. `new_arr` contains all the intermediate XOR results where the bit at position `bit` in the XOR result is 0. `xor` is 0 if the final XOR of all elements in `cur_arr` has the bit at position `bit` set to 0; otherwise, `xor` is the final XOR of all elements in `cur_arr`.**

Explanation:
- `cur_arr` remains the same as it was before the loop started because the loop does not modify `cur_arr`.
- `bit` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- `new_arr` will contain all the intermediate XOR results (`xor`) that had the bit at position `bit` set to 0. This means that for each iteration where the condition `not xor >> bit & 1` is true, `xor` is appended to `new_arr` and then reset to 0.
- `xor` will be 0 if the final XOR of all elements in `cur_arr` has the bit at position `bit` set to 0. Otherwise, `xor` will be the final XOR of all elements in `cur_arr`. This is because the loop resets `xor` to 0 whenever the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is 0, and the final value of `xor` is the cumulative XOR of all elements in `cur_arr` that did not reset `xor` to 0.
