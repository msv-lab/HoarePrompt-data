### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to find the maximum number of segments `[l_i, r_i]` such that the bitwise OR of the XOR results of these segments is less than or equal to `x`.
   - Each segment must satisfy the conditions: `l_1 = 1`, `r_k = n`, `l_i <= r_i`, and `r_i + 1 = l_{i+1}`.
   - If no such segments exist, we should return `-1`.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(arr, x)`**:
     - This function calls `find_new(arr, 30)`. The choice of `30` is appropriate because the problem constraints specify that `0 <= x < 2^30`, meaning the highest bit to consider is the 30th bit.
   - **`find_new(cur_arr, bit)`**:
     - This function recursively processes the array by considering the current bit position (`bit`).
     - If `bit` is `-1`, it means all bits have been processed, and the function returns the length of the current array, which represents the number of segments.
     - It initializes an empty list `new_arr` and a variable `xor` to keep track of the cumulative XOR of the elements.
     - For each element in `cur_arr`, it updates the cumulative XOR and checks if the current bit of the cumulative XOR is set (using `xor >> bit & 1`).
     - If the current bit is not set, it appends the cumulative XOR to `new_arr` and resets `xor` to `0`.
     - After processing all elements, it checks if the last cumulative XOR has the current bit set. If it does, `thing1` is set to `-1`; otherwise, it is set to the length of `new_arr`.
     - Depending on whether the current bit of `x` is set, it either returns the maximum of `thing1` and the result of the next recursive call with `bit - 1`, or it continues the recursion with `new_arr` and `bit - 1`.
     - If `thing1` is `-1` and the current bit of `x` is not set, it returns `-1`.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The function correctly processes the array by considering each bit from the most significant to the least significant.
   - It ensures that the cumulative XOR of each segment does not set any bit higher than allowed by `x`.
   - The recursive approach ensures that the maximum number of valid segments is found.
   - The base case of the recursion (when `bit == -1`) correctly returns the number of segments formed.

4. **Annotated Code Verification**:
   - The annotations confirm that the state of the program is maintained correctly at each step.
   - The logic for appending to `new_arr` and resetting `xor` ensures that only valid segments are considered.
   - The recursive calls and the conditions for returning `-1` or the maximum value are logically sound and align with the problem requirements.

Given the above reasoning and the verification of the annotated code, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
