### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires maximizing the sum of the array after performing `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray, computing its sum, and inserting this sum anywhere in the array.
   - The final sum should be computed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Analyzing the Solution:**
   - The solution iterates through the array to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray (`maxi`) and the current sum of the subarray being considered (`c`).
   - If an element is negative and the current sum `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of the element, it resets `c` to 0 and updates `maxi`.
   - Otherwise, it adds the element to `c`.

3. **Formulating the Final Sum:**
   - The final sum is calculated using the formula: \((2^k \times \text{maxi} - \text{maxi} + \text{sum(l)}) \% 1000000007\).
   - This formula is intended to account for the effect of inserting the maximum subarray sum `k` times, but it also subtracts `maxi` once to avoid double-counting the initial subarray sum.

4. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic of finding the maximum subarray sum is correct.
   - However, the formula used to calculate the final sum has a logical flaw. Specifically, the term \(2^k \times \text{maxi} - \text{maxi}\) is incorrect. The correct formula should be \(2^k \times \text{maxi}\) because each insertion of the maximum subarray sum should be counted `k` times, not `k-1` times.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The solution handles edge cases such as negative elements and zero elements correctly.
   - It also handles the case where the array is entirely negative by resetting `c` to 0 when necessary.

### Corrected Formula:
The correct formula for the final sum should be:
\[
(2^k \times \text{maxi} + \text{sum(l)}) \% 1000000007
\]

### Conclusion:
The provided solution has a logical error in the formula used to calculate the final sum. The correct formula should be \((2^k \times \text{maxi} + \text{sum(l)}) \% 1000000007\). Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Final: **False**
