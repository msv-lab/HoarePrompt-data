To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the computation step by step:

### Initial State:
- `i` is 1.
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `l` is a list of integers provided by the user.
- `c` is the sum of all non-negative integers in the list `l` up to the last positive segment before encountering a negative integer that resets `c` to 0.
- `maxi` is the maximum value between the previous `maxi` and the current `c`.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Sum of List `l`:**
   - `sum(l)` is the sum of all elements in the list `l`.

2. **Calculation of `c`:**
   - `c` is the sum of all non-negative integers in the list `l` up to the last positive segment before encountering a negative integer. This means `c` is reset to 0 whenever a negative integer is encountered.

3. **Calculation of `maxi`:**
   - `maxi` is the maximum value between the previous `maxi` and the current `c`. This means `maxi` keeps track of the highest sum of non-negative integers encountered in any segment of the list `l`.

4. **Final Expression:**
   - The expression to be printed is: \((2^k \times \text{maxi} - \text{maxi} + \text{sum}(l)) \% 1000000007\).

### Explanation:
- **\(2^k \times \text{maxi}\):** This is the product of \(2\) raised to the power of `k` and the maximum sum of non-negative integers (`maxi`).
- **\(- \text{maxi}\):** Subtracting `maxi` from the product.
- **\(+ \text{sum}(l)\):** Adding the sum of all elements in the list `l`.
- **\(\% 1000000007\):** Taking the result modulo \(1000000007\) to ensure the result fits within a standard integer range.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the result of the expression \((2^k \times \text{maxi} - \text{maxi} + \text{sum}(l)) \% 1000000007\).

Output: **(2^k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007 (where k is the input integer, maxi is the maximum sum of non-negative integers in segments of the list l, and sum(l) is the sum of all elements in the list l)**
