Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers.** 

The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into parts based on spaces, converts each part to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `l`. The values of `i`, `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
