Output State: **`i` is 1, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `c` is the sum of all non-negative elements in `l` up to the last non-negative element before a negative element that resets `c`, `maxi` is the maximum value between the previous `maxi` and the current `c`, and the loop will execute again if `i` (which is 1) is less than the value of `int(input())`.**
