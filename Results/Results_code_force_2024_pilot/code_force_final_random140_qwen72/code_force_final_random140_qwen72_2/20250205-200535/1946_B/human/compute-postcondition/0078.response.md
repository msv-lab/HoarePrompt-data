Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `k`, and an array `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates a specific value based on the array and the number of operations `k`. The final result for each test case is printed, which is the result of the formula `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007`, where `maxi` is the maximum sum of contiguous non-negative segments in the array, and `sum(l)` is the total sum of the array. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value. **
