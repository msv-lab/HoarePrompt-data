To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the computation step by step:

### Initial State:
- `i` is 2.
- `t` is an integer where \( 1 \leq t \leq 10^4 \).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `l` is a list of integers provided by the user.
- `c` is the sum of all non-negative elements in `l` minus the largest positive cumulative sum reset by any negative element in `l` that caused a reset.
- `maxi` is the maximum value between the previous `maxi` and the current `c`.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Sum of List `l`**:
   - `sum(l)` is the sum of all elements in the list `l`.

2. **Computation of `c`**:
   - `c` is calculated as the sum of all non-negative elements in `l` minus the largest positive cumulative sum reset by any negative element in `l` that caused a reset.
   - This means that if a negative element in `l` causes the cumulative sum to become negative, the cumulative sum is reset to zero, and the largest such reset value is subtracted from the sum of non-negative elements.

3. **Update of `maxi`**:
   - `maxi` is updated to be the maximum value between the previous `maxi` and the current `c`.

4. **Final Computation**:
   - The expression `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007` is evaluated.
   - `2 ** k` is the power of 2 raised to the exponent `k`.
   - `2 ** k * maxi` multiplies this power by `maxi`.
   - `2 ** k * maxi - maxi` simplifies to `maxi * (2 ** k - 1)`.
   - Adding `sum(l)` to this result gives `maxi * (2 ** k - 1) + sum(l)`.
   - Finally, the result is taken modulo `1000000007`.

### Output:
The `print` statement will output the result of the expression `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007`.

Given the initial state and the steps involved, the output can be described as follows:

Output: **(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007 (where `k` is the input integer, `maxi` is the maximum value between the previous `maxi` and the current `c`, and `sum(l)` is the sum of all elements in the list `l`)**
