Output State: **`i` is 2, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `c` is 0, `maxi` is the maximum value between the previous `maxi` and the current `c`.**

Explanation: The code snippet sets `c` to 0. This overrides the previous value of `c`, which was the sum of all non-negative integers in the list `l` up to the last positive segment before encountering a negative integer that resets `c` to 0. All other variables (`i`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `l`, and `maxi`) remain unchanged. The value of `maxi` remains the maximum value between the previous `maxi` and the current `c` (which is now 0).
