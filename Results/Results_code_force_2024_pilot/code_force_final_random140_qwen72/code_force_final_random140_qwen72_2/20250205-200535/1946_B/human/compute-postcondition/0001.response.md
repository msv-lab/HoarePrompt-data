The code snippet `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into two parts, and assigns the first part to `n` and the second part to `k`, converting both to integers.

- `i` remains unchanged at 0.
- `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` and `k` are now assigned specific integer values based on the input.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.**
