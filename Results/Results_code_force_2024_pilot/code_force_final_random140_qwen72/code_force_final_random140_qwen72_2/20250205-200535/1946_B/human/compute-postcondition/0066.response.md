The value of `c` is incremented by the value of `ele`, which is the second element of the list `l`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `ele` is the second element of `l`, `maxi` is 0, and `c` is now `c + ele`.**
