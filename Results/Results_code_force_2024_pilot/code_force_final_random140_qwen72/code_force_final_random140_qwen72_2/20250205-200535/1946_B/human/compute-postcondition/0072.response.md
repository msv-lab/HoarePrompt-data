Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `ele` is the third element of `l`, and `maxi` is the maximum of 0 and the initial value of `c`. If `ele` is negative and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `c` remains 0. Otherwise, `c` is updated to `c + ele`.***
