To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the computation step by step:

### Initial State:
- `i` is 0.
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `l` is a list of integers.
- `c` is the sum of all non-negative elements in `l` up to the last non-negative element before a negative element that resets `c`.
- `maxi` is the maximum value between the previous `maxi` and the current `c`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print((2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Sum of List `l`**:
   - `sum(l)` is the sum of all elements in the list `l`.

2. **Calculation of `c`**:
   - `c` is the sum of all non-negative elements in `l` up to the last non-negative element before a negative element. This means if there are multiple sequences of non-negative elements separated by negative elements, `c` will be the sum of the last such sequence before a negative element.

3. **Calculation of `maxi`**:
   - `maxi` is the maximum value between the previous `maxi` and the current `c`. Initially, `maxi` might be set to 0 or some other initial value, but it will be updated to the maximum value of `c` encountered during the processing of the list `l`.

4. **Final Expression**:
   - The expression `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007` involves:
     - `2 ** k * maxi`: This multiplies `maxi` by \(2^k\).
     - `- maxi`: Subtracts `maxi` from the result.
     - `+ sum(l)`: Adds the sum of all elements in `l`.
     - `% 1000000007`: Takes the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Final Output:
Given the initial state and the described computation, the output of the `print` statement will be the result of the expression `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007`.

Since the exact values of `l`, `k`, and `maxi` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007 (where `k` is the input integer, `maxi` is the maximum value between the previous `maxi` and the current `c`, and `sum(l)` is the sum of all elements in the list `l`)**
