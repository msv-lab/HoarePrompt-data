Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `c` is 0, `maxi` is 0, `ele` is the first element of `l`. Either `ele` is greater than or equal to 0, or `c` is greater than `abs(ele)`***
