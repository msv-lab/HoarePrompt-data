Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `ele` is the second element of the list `l`, and `maxi` is 0. If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `c` is 0. Otherwise, `c` is the second element of the list `l`.***
