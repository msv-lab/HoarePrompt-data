Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers, `c` is the sum of all non-negative elements in `l` up to the last non-negative element before a negative element that resets `c`, and `maxi` is the maximum value of `c` observed during the loop execution.**

### Explanation:
- **`i`**: Remains 0 as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`t`**: Remains an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`n`**: Remains an input integer as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`k`**: Remains an input integer as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`l`**: Remains the same list of integers as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`c`**: After the loop completes, `c` will be the sum of all non-negative elements in `l` up to the last non-negative element before a negative element that resets `c`. If no such reset occurs, `c` will be the sum of all non-negative elements in `l`.
- **`maxi`**: After the loop completes, `maxi` will be the maximum value of `c` observed during the loop execution. This means `maxi` will store the highest sum of consecutive non-negative elements encountered before any reset due to a negative element.
