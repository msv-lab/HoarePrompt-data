You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

Example

Input

    6 1
    
    12 10 14 11 8 3
    
    6 5
    
    7 2 727 10 12 13
    
    2 2
    
    1000000000 1

Output

    1
    2
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each involving a list of distinct Cowdeforces ratings for a group of cows. For each test case, it calculates and prints the maximum number of cows whose ratings are less than or equal to the rating of a specified cow (at index `k-1`), considering both the original list and a hypothetical scenario where the specified cow's rating is swapped with the next higher rating in the list. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have `n` cows with distinct ratings.
   - The tournament is a single-elimination tournament where the cow with the higher rating wins.
   - We need to maximize the number of wins for cow `k` by optionally swapping its position with another cow once.

2. **Initial Wins Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` starts by reading the number of cows `n` and the index of our cow `k`.
   - It reads the ratings of the cows into a list `a`.
   - It initializes a variable `wins` to count the number of matches our cow can win without any swaps.
   - It iterates through the list `a` to count how many consecutive matches our cow can win starting from its initial position.

3. **Wins Without Swap:**
   - The loop `for i in range(n):` checks if the current cow's rating is greater than our cow's rating. If it is, the loop breaks, and `wins` is the number of matches won.
   - If `wins` is greater than or equal to `k`, it means our cow can win all the matches up to its initial position, so we print `wins - 1`.

4. **Wins With Swap:**
   - The variable `wins_with_swap` is initialized to `wins + 1` to account for the potential additional win after a swap.
   - The loop `for i in range(wins_with_swap, k - 1):` checks if the cow at position `i` has a rating lower than our cow's rating. If it does, `wins_with_swap` is incremented.
   - The final result is the maximum of `wins - 1` and `wins_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins > 0)`.

5. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The logic for counting wins without a swap is correct.
   - The logic for counting wins with a swap is also correct, but the final calculation of `wins_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins > 0)` seems overly complex and might be incorrect.
   - The condition `if wins >= k` should be `if wins >= k - 1` because the initial position of our cow is `k - 1`.

### Conclusion:
The program has some logical issues in the final calculation of wins with a swap and the condition for checking the number of wins without a swap. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
