Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `wins` is 0.**

Explanation: The variable `wins` is initialized to 0. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, and `a`) remain unchanged and retain their initial values and constraints.
