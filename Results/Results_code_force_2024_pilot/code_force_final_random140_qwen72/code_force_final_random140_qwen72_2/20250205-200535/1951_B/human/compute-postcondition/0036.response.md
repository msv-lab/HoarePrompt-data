The function `func_1` is designed to process multiple test cases. It accepts no direct parameters but reads input data structured as follows: For each test case, the first line contains two integers `n` and `k`, where `n` represents the number of cows and `k` is the index of your cow. The second line contains `n` distinct integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. The function processes each test case to determine the rating of the cow at index `k` (considering 1-based indexing) and returns the rating of your cow for each test case.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each containing a list of distinct Cowdeforces ratings for a group of cows. It returns the rating of the cow at a specified index for each test case.**
