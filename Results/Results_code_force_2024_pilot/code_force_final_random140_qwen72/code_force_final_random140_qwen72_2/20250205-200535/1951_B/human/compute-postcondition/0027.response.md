Output State: **The loop is terminated, and the values of `wins_with_swap`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged.** 

Explanation: The `break` statement causes the loop to terminate immediately, and no further iterations occur. As a result, the values of `wins_with_swap`, `k`, and `i` are not modified by the `break` statement. The loop will not continue to execute, even if `i` is less than `k - 1`.
