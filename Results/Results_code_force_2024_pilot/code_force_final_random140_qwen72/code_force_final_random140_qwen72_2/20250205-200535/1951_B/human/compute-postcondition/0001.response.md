The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into parts based on spaces, converts each part to an integer, and stores these integers in a list called `a`. The variables `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `a` is a list of integers from the input.**
