The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k` using the `map` function and `int` conversion. The values of `n` and `k` are now updated based on the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ n.**
