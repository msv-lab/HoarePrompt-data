Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `wins` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k - 1]` before encountering an element greater than `a[k - 1]`, `i` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than `a[k - 1]` or `n` if no such element exists.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates through the list `a` starting from index 0.
- For each element `a[i]`, it checks if `a[i]` is greater than `a[k - 1]`.
- If `a[i]` is greater than `a[k - 1]`, the loop breaks, and the value of `wins` is the number of elements that were less than or equal to `a[k - 1]` up to that point.
- If no element in `a` is greater than `a[k - 1]`, the loop completes all `n` iterations, and `wins` will be `n`.
- The variable `i` will be the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than `a[k - 1]`, or `n` if no such element exists.
