The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still be greater than or equal to 2.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `wins` is 2, `i` is 2**
