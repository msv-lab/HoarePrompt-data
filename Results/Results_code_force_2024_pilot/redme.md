THere are 2 rerurns for qwen 72(rerun number 1 was cancelled due to connectivity issue) and 3 reruns for qwen7.
in each folder (one for qwe7 and one for qwen72) the main results file is total_results_new_metrics.json with the classifiers results
if you want to check individual examples that perform really well on  one classifier compared to another , look at the classifier_comparison_results.json. there then "performance" will tell you how much classifier A out performed classifier B and the      "run_numbers" will tell you in which reruns this outperformance occurs so you can go check it.
