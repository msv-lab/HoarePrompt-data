Let's call a number a binary decimal if it is a positive integer and all
digits in its decimal notation are either 0 or 1 . For example, 1\,010\,111 is
a binary decimal, while 10\,201 and 787\,788 are not.

Given a number n , you are asked whether or not it is possible to represent n
as a product of some (not necessarily distinct) binary decimals.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) â€” the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
10^5 ).

Output

For each test case, output "YES" (without quotes) if n can be represented as a
product of binary decimals, and "NO" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yES", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

Example

Input

    11
    
    121
    
    1
    
    14641
    
    12221
    
    10110
    
    100000
    
    99
    
    112
    
    2024
    
    12421
    
    1001

Output

    YES
    YES
    YES
    YES
    YES
    YES
    NO
    NO
    NO
    NO
    YES
    
Note

The first five test cases can be represented as a product of binary decimals
as follows:

  * 121 = 11 \times 11 . 
  * 1 = 1 is already a binary decimal. 
  * 14\,641 = 11 \times 11 \times 11 \times 11 . 
  * 12\,221 = 11 \times 11 \times 101 . 
  * 10\,110 = 10\,110 is already a binary decimal.
