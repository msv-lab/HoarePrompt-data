Alice and Bob came up with a rather strange game. They have an array of
integers a_1, a_2,\ldots, a_n . Alice chooses a certain integer k and tells it
to Bob, then the following happens:

  * Bob chooses two integers i and j (1 \le i < j \le n ), and then finds the maximum among the integers a_i, a_{i + 1},\ldots, a_j ; 
  * If the obtained maximum is strictly greater than k , Alice wins, otherwise Bob wins. 

Help Alice find the maximum k at which she is guaranteed to win.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 5
\cdot 10^4 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2,\ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^4 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer — the maximum integer k at which Alice
is guaranteed to win.

Note

In the first test case, all possible subsegments that Bob can choose look as
follows: [2, 4], [2, 4, 1], [2, 4, 1, 7], [4, 1], [4, 1, 7], [1, 7] . The
maximums on the subsegments are respectively equal to 4, 4, 7, 4, 7, 7 . It
can be shown that 3 is the largest integer such that any of the maximums will
be strictly greater than it.

In the third test case, the only segment that Bob can choose is [1, 1] . So
the answer is 0 .
