Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks if two lists (`patterns1` and `patterns2`) have the same elements in the same order. It uses a dictionary to map elements from `patterns1` to `patterns2` and ensures that each element in `patterns1` maps to the corresponding element in `patterns2`. The function returns `False` if the lengths of the two lists are not equal or if any mapping does not match. 

Given the problem description and the examples, this implementation appears to handle all potential cases correctly. Here's a brief analysis:

1. **Length Check**: The function first checks if the lengths of the two lists are equal. If they are not, it immediately returns `False`, which is correct because the sequences cannot match if their lengths differ.

2. **Mapping Validation**: For each pair of elements `(p1, p2)` from `patterns1` and `patterns2`, the function either adds the mapping to the dictionary or checks if the current element `p1` maps to the correct element `p2`. If any mapping fails, the function returns `False`.

Since the function handles all edge cases (unequal lengths and incorrect mappings), and no counterexample has been found, the function is considered correct.
