### Reasoning:

The original assessment claims that the function `func_1` checks if two lists (`patterns1` and `patterns2`) have the same elements in the same order. However, upon closer inspection, the function actually checks for a one-to-one correspondence between elements in `patterns1` and `patterns2` without enforcing the order. This means the function checks if every element in `patterns1` can be uniquely mapped to an element in `patterns2`, but it does not ensure that the elements appear in the same order.

Let's break down the key points:

1. **Length Check**: The function correctly checks if the lengths of `patterns1` and `patterns2` are equal. If they are not, it returns `False`.

2. **Mapping Validation**: The function uses a dictionary to map each element from `patterns1` to the corresponding element from `patterns2`. It ensures that each element in `patterns1` maps to exactly one element in `patterns2`, but it does not verify the order in which these elements appear.

To illustrate the discrepancy, consider the following example:

```python
patterns1 = ['a', 'b', 'c']
patterns2 = ['x', 'y', 'z']

# The function would return True because the mapping is unique,
# even though the order does not match the original sequence.
```

However, the problem description explicitly states that we need to check whether the sequence in `patterns1` matches the sequence in `patterns2`. Therefore, the function should also ensure that the elements appear in the same order. Without this additional check, the function is not fully meeting the requirements of the problem description.

Based on the analysis, the function does not correctly implement the requirement to check if the sequences follow the same pattern. Hence, the original assessment is inaccurate.

### Final:
**False**
