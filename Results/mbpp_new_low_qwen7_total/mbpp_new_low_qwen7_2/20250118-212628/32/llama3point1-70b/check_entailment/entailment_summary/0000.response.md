Reasoning:
The provided program `func_1` is designed to check if the elements in `patterns1` can be mapped one-to-one to the elements in `patterns2` such that each element in `patterns1` has a unique corresponding element in `patterns2`. However, the execution summary and potential edge cases analysis reveal some issues:

1. The current implementation correctly checks if the lengths of `patterns1` and `patterns2` are equal.
2. It ensures that each element in `patterns1` maps uniquely to an element in `patterns2` without contradictions.
3. However, the execution summary mentions some edge cases and missing functionality:
   - The function does not handle non-string elements in `patterns1` or `patterns2`.
   - It does not explicitly check for duplicate elements within `patterns1` before attempting to create the mapping. If `patterns1` contains duplicates, the function might return `False` prematurely even though `patterns2` could still contain valid mappings.

Given these points, although the provided function seems to address the core requirement, there are potential issues with handling edge cases that could lead to incorrect results under certain conditions. Therefore, based on the given information, the function does not fully meet the requirements as specified.

Correctness: **False**
