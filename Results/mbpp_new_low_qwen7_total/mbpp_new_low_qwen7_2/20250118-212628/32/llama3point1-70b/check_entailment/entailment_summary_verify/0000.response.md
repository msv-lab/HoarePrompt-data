### Reasoning:

The original assessment stated that the function `func_1` is correct. Let's evaluate this claim step-by-step using the provided problem description, function code, and function summary.

#### 1. Problem Description:
The task is to write a function to check whether the sequences in `patterns1` and `patterns2` follow the same pattern. This means we need to ensure that the elements in `patterns1` correspond to the elements in `patterns2` in the exact same order.

#### 2. Function Code Analysis:
```python
def func_1(patterns1, patterns2):
    if len(patterns1) != len(patterns2):
        return False
    mapping = {}
    for (p1, p2) in zip(patterns1, patterns2):
        if p1 not in mapping:
            mapping[p1] = p2
        elif mapping[p1] != p2:
            return False
    return True
```

#### 3. Function Summary Analysis:
- The function checks if the lengths of `patterns1` and `patterns2` are equal. If not, it returns `False`.
- It then creates a mapping dictionary where each element from `patterns1` is paired with the corresponding element from `patterns2`.
- If any element from `patterns1` appears more than once but with a different corresponding element from `patterns2`, the function returns `False`.
- Otherwise, it returns `True`.

#### 4. Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:
- **Edge Case Handling**:
  - The function correctly handles the case where the lengths of the two lists are not equal by returning `False`.
  - However, the function does not handle other potential issues such as non-string elements in the input lists or the presence of duplicate elements within `patterns1` before creating the mapping. These issues can lead to unexpected behavior or errors if non-string elements are present or if `patterns1` contains duplicates.

#### 5. Correctness Evaluation:
- **Length Check**: Correctly ensures that the sequences have the same length.
- **Mapping Validation**: Ensures that each element from `patterns1` maps to the corresponding element in `patterns2`. It correctly returns `False` if any mapping fails.

However, the original assessment did not account for the following:
- **Non-String Elements**: The function assumes that both `patterns1` and `patterns2` are lists of strings. If non-string elements are present, the function may return unexpected results or raise errors.
- **Duplicate Elements in `patterns1`**: The function does not handle the case where `patterns1` contains duplicate elements. This could lead to premature termination of the function even if `patterns2` could still contain valid mappings.

#### 6. Conclusion:
While the function correctly checks for the equality of lengths and ensures that each element from `patterns1` maps to the corresponding element in `patterns2`, it does not handle all potential edge cases mentioned in the "Potential edge cases and missing functionality" section. Therefore, the original assessment that the function is correct is incomplete and potentially misleading.

### Final:
**False**

The function `func_1` is not fully correct due to its inability to handle non-string elements and the presence of duplicate elements in `patterns1`.
