### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program against the problem description and the provided function summary.

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to check whether the elements of `patterns1` follow the sequence given in `patterns2`. This implies that each element in `patterns1` should map to a unique corresponding element in `patterns2`.

2. **Function Summary**: The function `func_1` does the following:
   - Checks if the lengths of `patterns1` and `patterns2` are equal.
   - Uses a dictionary `mapping` to store the one-to-one correspondences between elements of `patterns1` and `patterns2`.
   - Returns `False` if any element in `patterns1` appears more than once with a different corresponding element in `patterns2`.
   - Returns `True` only if all elements in `patterns1` have unique corresponding elements in `patterns2` and the lengths of the two lists are equal.

3. **Edge Cases and Missing Functionality**:
   - The function does not handle the case where `patterns1` or `patterns2` is not a list of strings, which could lead to errors.
   - The function does not check for duplicate elements within `patterns1` before creating the mapping. This means it may prematurely return `False` if `patterns1` contains duplicates, even if `patterns2` can still provide valid mappings.

Given these points, let's evaluate the correctness of the function:

- **Length Check**: The function correctly checks if the lengths of `patterns1` and `patterns2` are equal. If they are not, it returns `False`, which is necessary for ensuring that the sequences can be compared.
- **Mapping and Consistency**: The function uses a dictionary to ensure that each element in `patterns1` maps uniquely to an element in `patterns2`. If it finds a conflict (i.e., an element in `patterns1` maps to more than one element in `patterns2`), it returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`.

However, there is a critical flaw in the logic of the function:

- **Duplicate Elements in `patterns1`**: The function does not account for the possibility that `patterns1` might contain duplicate elements. If `patterns1` has a duplicate element, the function will return `False` immediately, even if `patterns2` can provide valid mappings for those duplicates. For example:
  ```python
  patterns1 = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'B']
  patterns2 = ['X', 'Y', 'Z', 'Y']
  ```
  The function would return `False` because 'B' appears twice in `patterns1`, but `patterns2` can still map 'B' to 'Y'. 

Since the function does not handle this scenario correctly, it fails to meet the requirement of checking for a consistent one-to-one correspondence between `patterns1` and `patterns2`.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment stated that the function correctly implements the requirement to check for a consistent one-to-one correspondence between the two lists. However, due to the lack of handling duplicate elements in `patterns1`, the function is not fully correct.

**Final: False**
