### Reasoning:
The given function `func_1` takes two lists `patterns1` and `patterns2` and checks if there is a consistent one-to-one correspondence between elements of `patterns1` and `patterns2`. Specifically, it ensures that each element in `patterns1` maps uniquely to an element in `patterns2` without any conflicts. The function uses a dictionary to keep track of these mappings and returns `False` as soon as a conflict is detected (i.e., an element in `patterns1` maps to more than one element in `patterns2`). If no conflicts are found, it returns `True`.

Given this behavior, the function appears to correctly implement the requirement to check for a consistent one-to-one correspondence between the two lists.

### Correctness:
**True**
