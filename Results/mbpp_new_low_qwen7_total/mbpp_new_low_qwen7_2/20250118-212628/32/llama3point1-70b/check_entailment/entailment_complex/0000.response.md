Reasoning:
The function `func_1` aims to check if the elements in `patterns1` can be mapped to the corresponding elements in `patterns2` such that each element in `patterns1` maps uniquely to an element in `patterns2`. The function first checks if the lengths of the two lists are equal. If not, it immediately returns `False`. Then, it iterates through the elements of both lists simultaneously, using a dictionary to map each element in `patterns1` to its corresponding element in `patterns2`. If it finds a mismatch or a duplicate key in the dictionary, it returns `False`. If no issues are found, it returns `True`.

Based on the provided explanation and the logic of the function, the function correctly implements the intended behavior. It ensures that:

1. The lengths of the input lists are equal.
2. Each element in `patterns1` maps uniquely to an element in `patterns2`.

Therefore, the function should work correctly for valid inputs as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
