Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Write a function to check whether it follows the sequence given in the patterns array.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: patterns1 and patterns2 are lists of strings.
def func_1(patterns1, patterns2):
    if (len(patterns1) != len(patterns2)) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: patterns1 and patterns2 are lists of strings, and the length of patterns1 is equal to the length of patterns2
    mapping = {}
    for (p1, p2) in zip(patterns1, patterns2):
        if p1 not in mapping:
            mapping[p1] = p2
        elif mapping[p1] != p2:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `patterns1` is a list of strings, `patterns2` is a list of strings, and the length of `patterns1` is equal to the length of `patterns2`. The `mapping` dictionary contains key-value pairs where each key is a string from `patterns1` and the corresponding value is the string from `patterns2` that has the same index. The function returns `False` if any string from `patterns1` appears more than once but with different corresponding strings from `patterns2`. Otherwise, the function does not return anything, meaning the `mapping` dictionary is fully populated without any contradictions.
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `patterns1` and `patterns2`, both of which are lists of strings. It checks if the lengths of `patterns1` and `patterns2` are equal. If they are not, it returns `False`. If they are equal, it creates a mapping dictionary where each element from `patterns1` is paired with the corresponding element from `patterns2`. The function returns `False` if any element from `patterns1` appears more than once but with a different corresponding element from `patterns2`. If no such contradiction is found, the function returns `True`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function does not handle the case where either `patterns1` or `patterns2` is not a list of strings. This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors if non-string elements are present.
- The function does not check for the presence of duplicate elements within `patterns1` before creating the mapping. If `patterns1` contains duplicates, the function might return `False` prematurely even though `patterns2` could still contain valid mappings.

After the program concludes, the final state of the program will be:
- The function returns `False` in all cases where the lengths of `patterns1` and `patterns2` are not equal, or if any element from `patterns1` appears more than once with a different corresponding element from `patterns2`.
- The function returns `True` if all elements from `patterns1` have unique corresponding elements in `patterns2` and the lengths of the two lists are equal.
