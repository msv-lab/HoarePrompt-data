### Reasoning:

The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that checks if two lists of strings, `patterns1` and `patterns2`, follow a consistent mapping pattern. Hereâ€™s how the logic works:

1. **Length Check**: 
   - The function first checks if the lengths of `patterns1` and `patterns2` are equal. If they are not, the function immediately returns `False`.

2. **Mapping Construction**:
   - A dictionary `mapping` is used to store the relationship between elements of `patterns1` and `patterns2`.
   - For each pair of elements `(p1, p2)` from `patterns1` and `patterns2`:
     - If `p1` is not already in the dictionary, it is added with the corresponding `p2` as its value.
     - If `p1` is already in the dictionary, the function checks if the current `p2` matches the stored value. If it does not match, the function returns `False`.

3. **Final Return**:
   - If no contradictions are found during the iteration, the function returns `True`.

Given this logic, the function correctly checks for a consistent one-to-one mapping between the elements of `patterns1` and `patterns2`. If any element in `patterns1` maps to multiple different elements in `patterns2`, the function will return `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`.

### Conclusion:
The provided code accurately implements the logic required to check for a consistent sequence between `patterns1` and `patterns2`.

### Response:
Correctness: **True**
