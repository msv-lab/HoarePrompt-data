Output State: **`patterns1` is a list of strings, `patterns2` is a list of strings, and the length of `patterns1` is equal to the length of `patterns2`. The `mapping` dictionary contains key-value pairs where each key is a string from `patterns1` and the corresponding value is the string from `patterns2` that has the same index. The function returns `False` if any string from `patterns1` appears more than once but with different corresponding strings from `patterns2`. Otherwise, the function does not return anything, meaning the `mapping` dictionary is fully populated without any contradictions.**

### Explanation:
1. **Analyze the Code and Initial State**: 
   - `patterns1` and `patterns2` are lists of strings.
   - `mapping` is an empty dictionary initially.
   - The loop iterates over pairs of elements from `patterns1` and `patterns2` using `zip`.

2. **Track Variable Changes**:
   - `patterns1` and `patterns2` remain unchanged during the loop.
   - `mapping` is updated based on the condition inside the loop.
   - The loop returns `False` as soon as it finds a contradiction (i.e., `p1` already exists in `mapping` but `mapping[p1]` does not match `p2`).

3. **Summarize the Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop continues until it processes all pairs in `patterns1` and `patterns2`.
   - For each pair `(p1, p2)`, if `p1` is not in `mapping`, it is added with `p2` as its value.
   - If `p1` is already in `mapping` and its value does not match `p2`, the function returns `False`.
   - If the loop completes without returning, the `mapping` dictionary is fully populated with unique mappings.

4. **Verify Relationships**:
   - After the loop, `mapping` will contain exactly one entry for each distinct element in `patterns1`.
   - The function returns `False` if any element in `patterns1` maps to different elements in `patterns2`, ensuring the relationship between `patterns1` and `patterns2` is consistent.
   - If the function does not return, the `mapping` dictionary is correct and complete.

Therefore, the final output state after the loop finishes is as described above.
