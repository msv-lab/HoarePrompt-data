`mapping[p1]` is assigned the value `p2`. This means that the key `p1` in the dictionary `mapping` is associated with the value `p2`. The lengths of `patterns1` and `patterns2` remain unchanged, and their elements are still the same. The initial state's conditions about the lists and the dictionary are preserved.

Output State: **`patterns1` is a list of strings with at least one element, `patterns2` is a list of strings with at least one element, both lists have the same length, and `mapping` is a dictionary with the entry `p1: p2`.**
