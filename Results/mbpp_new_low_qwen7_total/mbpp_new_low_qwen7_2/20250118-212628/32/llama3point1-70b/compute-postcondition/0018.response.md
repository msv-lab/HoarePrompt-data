The code `mapping[p1] = p2` assigns the value of `p2` to the key `p1` in the dictionary `mapping`. Since the initial values of `p1` and `p2` are not specified, we will keep them as they are.

Output State: **`mapping` is a dictionary with the key `p1` mapped to `p2`, `p1` is its original value, and `p2` is its original value.**
