Postcondition: ***`patterns1` is a list of strings with at least one element, `patterns2` is a list of strings with at least one element, both lists have the same length, and `mapping` is a dictionary. If `p1` is not in `mapping`, then `mapping` is updated with a key-value pair where the key is `p1` and the value is `p2`, and the first pair `(p1, p2)` from `zip(patterns1, patterns2)` is no longer accessible. Otherwise, `mapping[p1]` is equal to `p2`.***
