Postcondition: ***`patterns1` is a list of strings with at least one element, `patterns2` is a list of strings with at least one element, both lists have the same length, and `mapping` is a dictionary. If `p1` is not in `mapping`, no change is made to the return value. If `p1` is in `mapping` and `mapping[p1]` equals `p2`, no change is made to the return value. If `p1` is in `mapping` and `mapping[p1]` does not equal `p2`, the function returns False.***
