The code creates an empty dictionary called `mapping`. This does not affect the values of `patterns1` or `patterns2`, which remain as lists of strings with the same length. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`patterns1` is a list of strings, `patterns2` is a list of strings, and the length of `patterns1` is equal to the length of `patterns2`; `mapping` is an empty dictionary.**
