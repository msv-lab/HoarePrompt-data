Functionality: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `patterns1` and `patterns2`, both of which are lists of strings. It checks if the lengths of `patterns1` and `patterns2` are equal. If they are not, it returns `False`. If they are equal, it creates a mapping dictionary where each element from `patterns1` is paired with the corresponding element from `patterns2`. The function returns `False` if any element from `patterns1` appears more than once but with a different corresponding element from `patterns2`. If no such contradiction is found, the function returns `True`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function does not handle the case where either `patterns1` or `patterns2` is not a list of strings. This could lead to unexpected behavior or errors if non-string elements are present.
- The function does not check for the presence of duplicate elements within `patterns1` before creating the mapping. If `patterns1` contains duplicates, the function might return `False` prematurely even though `patterns2` could still contain valid mappings.

After the program concludes, the final state of the program will be:
- The function returns `False` in all cases where the lengths of `patterns1` and `patterns2` are not equal, or if any element from `patterns1` appears more than once with a different corresponding element from `patterns2`.
- The function returns `True` if all elements from `patterns1` have unique corresponding elements in `patterns2` and the lengths of the two lists are equal.
