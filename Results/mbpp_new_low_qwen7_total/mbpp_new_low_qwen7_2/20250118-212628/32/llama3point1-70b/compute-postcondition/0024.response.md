The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `patterns1` and `patterns2`. Both `patterns1` and `patterns2` are lists of strings. The function has multiple return points where it returns `False` in four cases and `True` in one case. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two lists of strings, `patterns1` and `patterns2`, and return `True` under specific conditions while returning `False` in other scenarios.
