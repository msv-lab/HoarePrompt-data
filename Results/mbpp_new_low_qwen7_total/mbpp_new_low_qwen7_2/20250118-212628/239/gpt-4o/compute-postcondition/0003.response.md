Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list of lists containing integers. It first counts the occurrences of each integer using a `Counter` object. Then, it creates a new list `result` containing only those integers from the flattened version of `lst` that appear exactly once. Finally, it returns the `result` list. Potential edge cases include when `lst` is empty or contains no unique integers. The function correctly handles these cases by ensuring the `result` list is populated based on the criteria of unique integers.**
