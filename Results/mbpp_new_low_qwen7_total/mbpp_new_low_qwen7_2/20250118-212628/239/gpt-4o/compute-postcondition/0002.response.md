The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`. `lst` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains integers. After executing the function body, it returns a list 'result' containing integers that appear exactly once in the flattened version of 'lst'. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of lists `lst` and return a list of integers that appear exactly once when all inner lists are combined into a single list.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter lst, which is a list of lists containing integers, and returns a list of integers that appear exactly once in the flattened version of lst.**
