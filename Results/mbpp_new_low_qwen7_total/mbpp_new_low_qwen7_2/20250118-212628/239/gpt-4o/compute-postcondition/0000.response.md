The initial state is that `lst` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains integers.

The code snippet consists of two lines:

1. `count = Counter(lst)`
2. `result = [num for num in lst if count[num] == 1]`

Let's analyze the effect of these lines:

1. The first line creates a `Counter` object named `count` that counts the occurrences of each element in `lst`. For example, if `lst` is `[[1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4], [1, 4, 5]]`, then `count` would be `Counter({1: 2, 2: 2, 3: 2, 4: 2, 5: 1})`.

2. The second line creates a new list `result` containing only those elements from `lst` that appear exactly once in the `Counter` `count`. In the example given, `result` would be `[5]` because `5` appears exactly once, while all other numbers appear more than once.

Given this analysis, the final state after running the code snippet is that `result` is a list containing integers that appear exactly once in the flattened version of `lst`. `lst` itself is unchanged, and `count` is no longer accessible in the global scope since it was not returned or assigned to a global variable.

Output State: **lst is a list of lists, result is a list containing integers that appear exactly once in the flattened version of lst**
