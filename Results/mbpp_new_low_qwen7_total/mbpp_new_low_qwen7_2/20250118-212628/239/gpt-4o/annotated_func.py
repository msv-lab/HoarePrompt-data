#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of lists, where each inner list contains integers.
def func_1(lst):
    count = Counter(lst)

result = [num for num in lst if count[num] == 1]
    return result
    #The program returns a list 'result' containing integers that appear exactly once in the flattened version of 'lst'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list of lists containing integers. It first counts the occurrences of each integer using a `Counter` object. Then, it creates a new list `result` containing only those integers from the flattened version of `lst` that appear exactly once. Finally, it returns the `result` list. Potential edge cases include when `lst` is empty or contains no unique integers. The function correctly handles these cases by ensuring the `result` list is populated based on the criteria of unique integers.
