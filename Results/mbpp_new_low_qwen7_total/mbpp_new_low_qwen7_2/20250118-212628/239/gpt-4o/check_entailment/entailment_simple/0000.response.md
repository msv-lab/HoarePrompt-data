### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` takes a single argument `lst`, which is expected to be a list of lists containing integers.
2. **Counter Usage**: The `Counter` object from the `collections` module is used to count the occurrences of each integer across all sublists.
3. **Result Construction**: A list comprehension is used to construct `result`, which contains only those integers from `lst` that have a count of exactly one in the flattened version of `lst`.

However, there are some issues with the current implementation:
- The `count` variable is only defined but not updated with the counts from the flattened list.
- The `lst` passed to `Counter` is not flattened; it treats `lst` as a single list rather than considering each sublist separately.

Given these points, let's modify the function to correctly handle the nested lists:

```python
from collections import Counter

def func_1(lst):
    # Flatten the list of lists into a single list
    flat_list = [item for sublist in lst for item in sublist]
    
    # Use Counter to count occurrences of each number
    count = Counter(flat_list)
    
    # Construct the result list with numbers appearing exactly once
    result = [num for num in flat_list if count[num] == 1]
    
    return result
```

Now, let's verify the correctness with the provided assertions:

```python
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == [4, 5]  # Expected: [4, 5]
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 5]) == [3, 4, 5]  # Expected: [3, 4, 5]
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  # Expected: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

The corrected function should now work as expected. 

### Response:

**Reasoning:** The original implementation had an issue with flattening the nested list. After correcting this, the function now correctly removes duplicates from the flattened list.

**Correctness:** **False**
