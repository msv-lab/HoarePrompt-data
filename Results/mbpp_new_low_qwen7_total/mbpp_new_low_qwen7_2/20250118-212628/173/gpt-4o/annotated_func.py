#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list containing elements of various types including integers, floats, strings, etc., but at least one numeric element (integer or float) must be present in the list.
def func_1(lst):
    int_values = [x for x in lst if isinstance(x, int)]
    return min(int_values)
    #The program returns the minimum integer value from the list 'int_values'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` containing elements of various types and returns the minimum integer value from the list. If the list contains no integers, the function will raise a `ValueError`. The function iterates through the list, filters out non-integer values, and returns the smallest integer found. If the filtered list `int_values` is empty, the function raises a `ValueError` indicating that no integer values were found in the original list.
