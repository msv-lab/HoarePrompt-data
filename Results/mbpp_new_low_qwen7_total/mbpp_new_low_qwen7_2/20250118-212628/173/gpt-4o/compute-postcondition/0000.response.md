The code creates a new list `int_values` which contains only the integer elements from the original list `lst`. The other variables and their values remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `lst` is a list containing elements of various types including integers, floats, strings, etc., but at least one numeric element is present in the list; `int_values` is a list containing only the integer elements from `lst`.

Output State: **`lst` is a list containing elements of various types including integers, floats, strings, etc., but at least one numeric element is present in the list; `int_values` is a list containing only the integer elements from `lst`**
