Reasoning:
- The problem requires finding the minimum value in a heterogeneous list, which can contain elements of different types (e.g., integers, floats, strings).
- The provided implementation filters out non-integer values using a list comprehension with `isinstance(x, int)`, which is a correct approach for filtering integers from the list.
- However, the function only returns the minimum value among the integers found, ignoring other types like strings and floats that might also be part of the list.
- This approach will not handle cases where the list contains non-integer values and no integers, which would cause a `ValueError` when calling `min()` on an empty list.
- The provided test cases assume the presence of at least one integer in the list, which does not cover all possible edge cases.

Given these points, the function will fail to handle lists without any integer values correctly.

Correctness: **False**
