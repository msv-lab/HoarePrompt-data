Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Write a function to find the minimum value in a given heterogeneous list.

# Annotated Program:
assert func_1(['Python', 3, 2, 4, 5, 'version']) == 2
assert func_1(['Python', 15, 20, 25]) == 15
assert func_1(['Python', 30, 20, 40, 50, 'version']) == 20

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list containing elements of various types including integers, floats, strings, etc., but at least one numeric element (integer or float) must be present in the list.
def func_1(lst):
    int_values = [x for x in lst if isinstance(x, int)]
    return min(int_values)
    #The program returns the minimum integer value from the list 'int_values'


# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
