You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Write a function to find the minimum value in a given heterogeneous list.

- Program: 
assert func_1(['Python', 3, 2, 4, 5, 'version']) == 2
assert func_1(['Python', 15, 20, 25]) == 15
assert func_1(['Python', 30, 20, 40, 50, 'version']) == 20

def func_1(lst):
    int_values = [x for x in lst if isinstance(x, int)]
    return min(int_values)



- Annotated Code: 
assert func_1(['Python', 3, 2, 4, 5, 'version']) == 2
assert func_1(['Python', 15, 20, 25]) == 15
assert func_1(['Python', 30, 20, 40, 50, 'version']) == 20

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list containing elements of various types including integers, floats, strings, etc., but at least one numeric element (integer or float) must be present in the list.
def func_1(lst):
    int_values = [x for x in lst if isinstance(x, int)]
    return min(int_values)
    #The program returns the minimum integer value from the list 'int_values'



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

The provided program defines a function `func_1` that aims to find the minimum integer value in a given list containing both integers and strings. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the function:

1. The function uses a list comprehension to filter out only the integer values from the input list `lst`.
2. It then uses the `min()` function to find the smallest integer in the filtered list.
3. The function returns this minimum integer value.

However, there are two key issues with this approach:

1. **Handling Non-Integer Values**: The function will raise a `TypeError` when it attempts to pass a non-integer (e.g., string) value to the `min()` function. This is because `min()` expects all elements in the iterable to be of the same type, and attempting to compare a string with an integer results in a TypeError.

2. **Return Value**: If the input list contains no integers at all, the list comprehension `[x for x in lst if isinstance(x, int)]` will result in an empty list. The `min()` function applied to an empty list will raise a `ValueError`.

To address these issues, the function should handle cases where there are no integers or where the list contains non-comparable types.

### Corrected Code Example:

```python
def func_1(lst):
    int_values = [x for x in lst if isinstance(x, int)]
    if not int_values:
        raise ValueError("No integer values found in the list")
    return min(int_values)
```

### Evaluation:

Given the provided test cases, the current implementation will fail because it does not account for lists without any integer values or lists containing non-integer types.

### Conclusion:

The provided program is incorrect because it does not handle edge cases properly and can raise exceptions. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**False**
