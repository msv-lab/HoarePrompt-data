Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem description, the provided program, the function summary, and the original assessment step by step.

### Problem Description
The task is to write a function to find the minimum value in a given heterogeneous list. This means the list can contain elements of different types (e.g., integers, strings).

### Provided Program
```python
assert func_1(['Python', 3, 2, 4, 5, 'version']) == 2
assert func_1(['Python', 15, 20, 25]) == 15
assert func_1(['Python', 30, 20, 40, 50, 'version']) == 20
```
```python
def func_1(lst):
    int_values = [x for x in lst if isinstance(x, int)]
    return min(int_values)
```

### Function Summary
The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` containing elements of various types and returns the minimum integer value from the list. If the list contains no integers, the function will raise a `ValueError`.

### Original Assessment
**Correctness: False**

**Explanation:** The provided function `func_1` only considers integer values in the list when finding the minimum value. However, the problem description specifies that the list can contain heterogeneous elements (elements of different types). The function does not handle non-integer values correctly. For example, if the list contains strings or other non-numeric types, the function will raise a `TypeError` when attempting to call `min(int_values)` because the list will contain non-integer values.

To fix this, the function should handle cases where the list contains non-integer values gracefully, such as returning `None` or a specific message indicating that no integer values were found. Here is an updated version of the function:

```python
def func_1(lst):
    int_values = [x for x in lst if isinstance(x, int)]
    if int_values:
        return min(int_values)
    else:
        return None  # or any other appropriate value to indicate no integer values were found
```

### Analysis
- The function `func_1` correctly filters out non-integer values and attempts to find the minimum value among the integers.
- The function summary accurately describes the behavior of the function, including the fact that it raises a `ValueError` if no integers are found.
- The original assessment is accurate in noting that the function currently does not handle the case where no integers are present. It is correct to say that the function should return `None` or some other appropriate value to indicate the absence of integers.

### Conclusion
While the original assessment is correct in pointing out the issue with handling non-integer values, the current implementation does not explicitly handle the case where no integers are present. However, the provided program does not raise a `TypeError` because the `min()` function called on an empty list `int_values` will simply return `None` by default, which aligns with the function summary.

Given the current implementation and the provided assertions, the function behaves as expected for the given test cases. Therefore, the original assessment is slightly over-critical but still fundamentally correct.

Final: **True**
