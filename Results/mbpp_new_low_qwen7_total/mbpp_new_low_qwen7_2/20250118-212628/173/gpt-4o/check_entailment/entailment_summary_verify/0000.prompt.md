You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Write a function to find the minimum value in a given heterogeneous list.

- Program:
assert func_1(['Python', 3, 2, 4, 5, 'version']) == 2
assert func_1(['Python', 15, 20, 25]) == 15
assert func_1(['Python', 30, 20, 40, 50, 'version']) == 20

def func_1(lst):
    int_values = [x for x in lst if isinstance(x, int)]
    return min(int_values)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` containing elements of various types and returns the minimum integer value from the list. If the list contains no integers, the function will raise a `ValueError`. The function iterates through the list, filters out non-integer values, and returns the smallest integer found. If the filtered list `int_values` is empty, the function raises a `ValueError` indicating that no integer values were found in the original list.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` only considers integer values in the list when finding the minimum value. However, the problem description specifies that the list can contain heterogeneous elements (elements of different types). The function does not handle non-integer values correctly. For example, if the list contains strings or other non-numeric types, the function will raise a `TypeError` when attempting to call `min(int_values)` because the list will contain non-integer values.

To fix this, the function should handle cases where the list contains non-integer values gracefully, such as returning `None` or a specific message indicating that no integer values were found. Here is an updated version of the function:

```python
def func_1(lst):
    int_values = [x for x in lst if isinstance(x, int)]
    if int_values:
        return min(int_values)
    else:
        return None  # or any other appropriate value to indicate no integer values were found
```

This updated function ensures that the program works correctly for all potential cases as specified in the problem description.
