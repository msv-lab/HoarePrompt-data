Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the minimum value in a heterogeneous list, which can contain various data types such as integers, floats, strings, etc.
2. The annotated program checks if an element in the list is an integer using `isinstance(x, int)` and collects these integers in the list `int_values`.
3. It then uses the `min()` function to find the smallest integer in `int_values`.
4. However, the problem does not guarantee that the list will contain only integers. There might be cases where the list contains non-integer values like floats or strings.
5. The current implementation will only consider integers and ignore other types, which might lead to incorrect results if non-integer values are present in the list.
6. For example, if the list is `['Python', 15.5, 20, 25]`, the function will return `15` because it only considers integers, ignoring the float `15.5`.

Correctness: **False**

The function should handle all numeric types (integers and floats) and find the minimum numeric value in the list.
