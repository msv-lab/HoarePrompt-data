### Reasoning:

The provided program defines a function `func_1` that aims to find the minimum integer value in a given list containing both integers and strings. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the function:

1. The function uses a list comprehension to filter out only the integer values from the input list `lst`.
2. It then uses the `min()` function to find the smallest integer in the filtered list.
3. The function returns this minimum integer value.

However, there are two key issues with this approach:

1. **Handling Non-Integer Values**: The function will raise a `TypeError` when it attempts to pass a non-integer (e.g., string) value to the `min()` function. This is because `min()` expects all elements in the iterable to be of the same type, and attempting to compare a string with an integer results in a TypeError.

2. **Return Value**: If the input list contains no integers at all, the list comprehension `[x for x in lst if isinstance(x, int)]` will result in an empty list. The `min()` function applied to an empty list will raise a `ValueError`.

To address these issues, the function should handle cases where there are no integers or where the list contains non-comparable types.

### Corrected Code Example:

```python
def func_1(lst):
    int_values = [x for x in lst if isinstance(x, int)]
    if not int_values:
        raise ValueError("No integer values found in the list")
    return min(int_values)
```

### Evaluation:

Given the provided test cases, the current implementation will fail because it does not account for lists without any integer values or lists containing non-integer types.

### Conclusion:

The provided program is incorrect because it does not handle edge cases properly and can raise exceptions. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**False**
