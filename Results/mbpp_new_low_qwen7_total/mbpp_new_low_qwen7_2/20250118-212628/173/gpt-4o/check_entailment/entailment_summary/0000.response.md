Reasoning:
The provided program defines a function `func_1` that attempts to find the minimum integer value in a mixed-type list. However, the function's current implementation will only consider integer values and ignore other types such as strings. This approach is correct according to the problem statement, which specifies finding the minimum value among integers in the list.

Let's analyze the assertions:
1. `assert func_1(['Python', 3, 2, 4, 5, 'version']) == 2`: This test case checks a list with an integer `2`, which is correctly identified as the minimum.
2. `assert func_1(['Python', 15, 20, 25]) == 15`: This test case checks a list with multiple integers, where `15` is the smallest, and it passes.
3. `assert func_1(['Python', 30, 20, 40, 50, 'version']) == 20`: This test case also passes as `20` is the smallest integer in the list.

Given that the function behaves as expected based on the provided test cases and the problem description, the function appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
