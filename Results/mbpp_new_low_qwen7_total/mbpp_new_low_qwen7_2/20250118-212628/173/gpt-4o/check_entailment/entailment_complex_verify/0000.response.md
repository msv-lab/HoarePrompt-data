### Reasoning

Let's analyze the program step-by-step based on the given annotations and the problem description.

#### Annotations:
1. **Assertion Check**:
   - The assertions check if the function `func_1` returns the correct minimum integer value from the given lists.
   - The first assertion checks a list with mixed types (`['Python', 3, 2, 4, 5, 'version']`) and expects the minimum integer value to be `2`.
   - The second assertion checks a list with only integer values (`['Python', 15, 20, 25]`) and expects the minimum integer value to be `15`.
   - The third assertion checks another list with mixed types (`['Python', 30, 20, 40, 50, 'version']`) and expects the minimum integer value to be `20`.

2. **Function Behavior**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` as input.
   - It creates a new list `int_values` containing only the integer elements from `lst`.
   - The function then calls `min(int_values)` to find the minimum integer value in `int_values`.
   - If `int_values` is not empty, it returns the minimum value; otherwise, it does not handle the case where `int_values` is empty.

#### Analysis:
1. **Heterogeneous List Handling**:
   - The function correctly filters out non-integer values using the list comprehension `[x for x in lst if isinstance(x, int)]`.
   - The function then finds the minimum value from the filtered list of integers.
   - This approach handles cases where the list contains non-integer values, as the non-integer values are excluded from the calculation.

2. **Empty Filtered List**:
   - If the list `lst` contains no integers, the list `int_values` will be empty.
   - In the provided code, the function does not handle this case explicitly, which would result in a `ValueError` being raised.
   - However, the original assessment suggests that the function should return `None` or another appropriate value when no integer values are found.

#### Conclusion:
- The function correctly identifies and returns the minimum integer value from the list, handling cases where the list contains non-integer values by excluding them.
- While the original assessment correctly pointed out that the function should handle the case where no integers are found, the provided function does not do so explicitly, leading to a `ValueError`.
- However, since the problem statement does not specify how to handle the absence of integer values (i.e., it could return `None` or raise an error), the current implementation is technically correct based on the given requirements.

### Final Evaluation:
Given the problem description and the provided assertions, the function `func_1` meets the requirements of finding the minimum integer value from a heterogeneous list. Although the original assessment suggested handling the case where no integers are found more gracefully, the current implementation does not explicitly address this, but it still functions correctly for the provided test cases.

Therefore, the original assessment's concern is valid but not necessarily a critical flaw given the problem's requirements.

**Final: True**
