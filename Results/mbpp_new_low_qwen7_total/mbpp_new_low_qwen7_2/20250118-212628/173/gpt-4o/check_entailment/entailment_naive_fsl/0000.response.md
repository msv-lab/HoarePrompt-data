Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` only considers integer values in the list when finding the minimum value. However, the problem description specifies that the list can contain heterogeneous elements (elements of different types). The function does not handle non-integer values correctly. For example, if the list contains strings or other non-numeric types, the function will raise a `TypeError` when attempting to call `min(int_values)` because the list will contain non-integer values.

To fix this, the function should handle cases where the list contains non-integer values gracefully, such as returning `None` or a specific message indicating that no integer values were found. Here is an updated version of the function:

```python
def func_1(lst):
    int_values = [x for x in lst if isinstance(x, int)]
    if int_values:
        return min(int_values)
    else:
        return None  # or any other appropriate value to indicate no integer values were found
```

This updated function ensures that the program works correctly for all potential cases as specified in the problem description.
