The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s`, which is a string, and `pattern`, which is a valid regular expression string. The function attempts to find a match of the regular expression `pattern` within the string `s`. If a match is found, it returns the matched group along with the start and end indices of the match. If no match is found, it returns `None`.
