Reasoning:
The provided function `func_1` uses the `re.search()` method from the `re` module to search for a regex pattern within a string `s`. If a match is found, it returns a tuple containing the matched substring, its start index, and its end index. If no match is found, it returns `None`.

Here's a breakdown of the function:
- `match = re.search(pattern, s)`: This line searches for the first occurrence of the pattern in the string `s`.
- If `match` is not `None`, the function returns a tuple `(match.group(), match.start(), match.end())`, which contains the matched substring, its starting index, and its ending index.
- If `match` is `None`, indicating that no match was found, the function returns `None`.

Given this logic, the function appears to correctly implement the required behavior as per the problem statement. Therefore, the function should work as expected for valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
