Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Write a function to search a string for a regex pattern. The function should return the matching subtring, a start index and an end index.

# Program:
import re

def func_1(s, pattern):
    match = re.search(pattern, s)
    if match:
        return (match.group(), match.start(), match.end())
    else:
        return None



# Your response:
