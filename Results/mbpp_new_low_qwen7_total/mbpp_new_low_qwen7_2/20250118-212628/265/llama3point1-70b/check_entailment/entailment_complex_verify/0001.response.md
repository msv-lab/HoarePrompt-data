Reasoning:

The original assessment accurately describes the function `func_1`. Let's break down the code and the annotations to ensure the function meets the requirements:

1. **Function Definition and Input Parameters**: The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `s` (a string) and `pattern` (a valid regular expression string). This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Search for Pattern**: The line `match = re.search(pattern, s)` uses the `re.search()` method to find the first occurrence of the pattern in the string `s`. This is the core functionality of the function.

3. **Return Values**:
   - If a match is found (`if match:`), the function returns a tuple containing the matched substring (`match.group()`), its start index (`match.start()`), and its end index (`match.end()`).
   - If no match is found (`else`), the function returns `None`.

4. **Annotations**:
   - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program before and after the function call, as well as the behavior of the function under both matching and non-matching conditions.

5. **Validation**:
   - The original assessment correctly states that if a match is found, the function returns the matched substring along with its start and end indices.
   - It also correctly states that if no match is found, the function returns `None`.

Given this analysis, the function `func_1` correctly implements the required behavior as described in the problem statement.

Final: **True**
