Reasoning: 

The original assessment correctly identifies a discrepancy between the function's current implementation and the problem description. The problem description requires the function to return a tuple containing the matching substring, start index, and end index even if no match is found. However, the current implementation returns `None` when no match is found, which does not align with the required format.

To address this, the function can be modified to return a tuple where each element is `None` when no match is found. Here is the revised version:

```python
import re

def func_1(s, pattern):
    match = re.search(pattern, s)
    if match:
        return (match.group(), match.start(), match.end())
    else:
        return (None, None, None)
```

With this modification, the function will always return a tuple, regardless of whether a match is found or not. This ensures compliance with the problem description.

Final: **False**
