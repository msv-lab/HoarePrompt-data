Reasoning:
1. The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `s` (a string) and `pattern` (a valid regular expression).
2. It uses the `re.search` method to find the first occurrence of the pattern in the string `s`.
3. If a match is found, it returns three values: the matched substring (`match.group()`), the start index of the match (`match.start()`), and the end index of the match (`match.end()`).
4. If no match is found, it correctly returns `None`.

Given that the provided logic follows the requirements of the problem statement and handles both cases (when a match is found and when it is not), the function appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
