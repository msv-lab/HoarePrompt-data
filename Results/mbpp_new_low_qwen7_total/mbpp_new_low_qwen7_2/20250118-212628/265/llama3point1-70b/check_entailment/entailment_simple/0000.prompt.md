Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Write a function to search a string for a regex pattern. The function should return the matching subtring, a start index and an end index.

# Annotated Program:
import re

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string and pattern is a valid regular expression string.
def func_1(s, pattern):
    match = re.search(pattern, s)
    if match :
        return match.group(), match.start(), match.end()
        #`match.group()`, `match.start()`, `match.end()` where `match` is a match object
    else :
        return None
        #The program returns None


# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
