Reasoning: 

The original assessment incorrectly concluded that the function `func_1` is incorrect because it returns `None` when no match is found. However, upon closer inspection of the problem description and the function summary, we can see that the function is actually correctly implementing the specification provided in the problem description. The problem description requires the function to return the matching substring, start index, and end index. When no match is found, the function should return `None` for each of these values. This is exactly what the function does.

The function summary also supports this interpretation, stating that if no match is found, the function returns `None`. Therefore, the function is meeting the requirements specified in both the problem description and the function summary. The original assessment is inaccurate because it incorrectly suggests that the function should return a specific value like `(None, None, None)` or raise an exception when no match is found.

Final: **True**
