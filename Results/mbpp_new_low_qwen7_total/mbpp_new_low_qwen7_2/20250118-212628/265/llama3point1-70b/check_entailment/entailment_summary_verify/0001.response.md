Reasoning:
The original assessment accurately describes the functionality of the `func_1` function. The function indeed searches for a regex pattern within a given string using `re.search()`. It returns a tuple containing the matched substring, its start index, and its end index if a match is found. Otherwise, it returns `None`. 

Let's break down the function again for clarity:
1. `match = re.search(pattern, s)`: This line performs the regex search.
2. If `match` is not `None`, it means a match was found. The function then returns a tuple `(match.group(), match.start(), match.end())`, which provides the required information.
3. If `match` is `None`, it means no match was found, and the function returns `None`.

This matches exactly with the problem description and the function summary provided. There are no discrepancies or logical errors in the implementation that would render the function incorrect.

Final: **True**
