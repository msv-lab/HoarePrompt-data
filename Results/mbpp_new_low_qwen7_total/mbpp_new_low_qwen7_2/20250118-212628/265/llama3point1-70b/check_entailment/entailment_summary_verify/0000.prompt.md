You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Write a function to search a string for a regex pattern. The function should return the matching subtring, a start index and an end index.

- Program:
import re

def func_1(s, pattern):
    match = re.search(pattern, s)
    if match:
        return (match.group(), match.start(), match.end())
    else:
        return None



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s`, which is a string, and `pattern`, which is a valid regular expression string. The function attempts to find a match of the regular expression `pattern` within the string `s`. If a match is found, it returns the matched group along with the start and end indices of the match. If no match is found, it returns `None`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` returns `None` if no match is found, but the problem description specifies that the function should return a tuple containing the matching substring, start index, and end index. If no match is found, the function should return a tuple where each element is `None`, or it could raise an exception or return a specific value indicating no match was found. The current implementation does not meet this requirement, as it returns `None` directly when no match is found.
