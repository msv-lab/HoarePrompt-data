Reasoning:
- The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement.
- It uses the `re.search()` function to find the first occurrence of the regex pattern in the given string `s`.
- If a match is found, it returns the matched substring along with its start and end indices using `match.group()`, `match.start()`, and `match.end()` methods.
- If no match is found, it correctly returns `None`.

Given that the function follows the logic described in the problem statement and handles both cases (match found and no match found) appropriately, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
