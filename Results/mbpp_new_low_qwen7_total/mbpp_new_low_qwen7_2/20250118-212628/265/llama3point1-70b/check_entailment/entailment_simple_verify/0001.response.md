### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` searches for a regex pattern in a string `s` and returns the appropriate information if a match is found. However, let's review the annotated code step-by-step to ensure that all aspects of the function are thoroughly validated.

1. **Function Definition and Input Validation**:
   - The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `s` (a string) and `pattern` (a valid regular expression string).
   - The annotation states that before the function call, `s` is a string and `pattern` is a valid regular expression string. This is correct.

2. **Search Operation**:
   - `match = re.search(pattern, s)`: This line searches for the first occurrence of the pattern in the string `s`.
   - If a match is found, `match` will be a match object; otherwise, it will be `None`.

3. **Return Values**:
   - If `match` is not `None`, the function returns a tuple `(match.group(), match.start(), match.end())`.
     - `match.group()` returns the matched substring.
     - `match.start()` returns the starting index of the match.
     - `match.end()` returns the ending index of the match.
   - If `match` is `None`, the function returns `None`.

4. **Annotations**:
   - The annotation correctly states that if `match` is not `None`, the function returns a tuple with the matched substring, start index, and end index.
   - The annotation also correctly states that if `match` is `None`, the function returns `None`.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly implements the required behavior as described in the problem statement. It searches for a regex pattern in a string and returns the matching substring along with its start and end indices if a match is found. If no match is found, it returns `None`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
