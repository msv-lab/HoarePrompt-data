Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` returns `None` if no match is found, but the problem description specifies that the function should return a tuple containing the matching substring, start index, and end index. If no match is found, the function should return a tuple where each element is `None`, or it could raise an exception or return a specific value indicating no match was found. The current implementation does not meet this requirement, as it returns `None` directly when no match is found.
