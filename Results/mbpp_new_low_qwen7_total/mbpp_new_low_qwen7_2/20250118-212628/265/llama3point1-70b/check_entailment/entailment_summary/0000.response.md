Reasoning:
1. The provided function `func_1` takes two parameters: `s` (a string) and `pattern` (a regular expression).
2. It uses the `re.search()` method from the `re` module to search for the first occurrence of the pattern in the string.
3. If a match is found (`match` is not `None`), the function returns a tuple containing the matched substring (`match.group()`), and its start and end indices (`match.start()` and `match.end()`).
4. If no match is found, the function correctly returns `None`.

Based on the provided problem description and the execution summary, the function behaves as expected and meets the requirements specified:

- It returns the correct information when a match is found.
- It returns `None` when no match is found.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
