Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Write a function to search a string for a regex pattern. The function should return the matching subtring, a start index and an end index.

# Program:
import re

def func_1(s, pattern):
    match = re.search(pattern, s)
    if match:
        return (match.group(), match.start(), match.end())
    else:
        return None





# Execution Summary:
The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s`, which is a string, and `pattern`, which is a valid regular expression string. The function attempts to find a match of the regular expression `pattern` within the string `s`. If a match is found, it returns the matched group along with the start and end indices of the match. If no match is found, it returns `None`.


# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
