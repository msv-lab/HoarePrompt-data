#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string and pattern is a valid regular expression string.
def func_1(s, pattern):
    match = re.search(pattern, s)
    if match :
        return match.group(), match.start(), match.end()
        #`match.group()`, `match.start()`, `match.end()` where `match` is a match object
    else :
        return None
        #The program returns None
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s`, which is a string, and `pattern`, which is a valid regular expression string. The function attempts to find a match of the regular expression `pattern` within the string `s`. If a match is found, it returns the matched group along with the start and end indices of the match. If no match is found, it returns `None`.
