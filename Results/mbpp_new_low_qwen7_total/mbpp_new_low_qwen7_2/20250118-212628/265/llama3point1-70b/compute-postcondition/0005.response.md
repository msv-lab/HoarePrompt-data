The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s`, which is a string, and `pattern`, which is a valid regular expression string. 

- In Case_1, the function returns the group matched by the regular expression, the start index of the match, and the end index of the match, where `match` is a match object.
- In Case_2, the function returns `None`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` and a valid regular expression `pattern`. It attempts to find a match using the pattern in the string. If a match is found, it returns the matched group along with its start and end indices. If no match is found, it returns `None`.
