Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Write a python function to set all even bits of a given number.

# Program:
def func_1(n):
    return n | 2863311530





# Execution Summary:
The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and returns the result of performing a bitwise OR operation between `n` and the integer `2863311530`. The function does not modify the input variable `n` and instead creates a new value by applying the bitwise OR operation. This operation ensures that each bit of the resulting value is `1` if either of the corresponding bits of `n` or `2863311530` is `1`. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations or the code itself, and the code accurately reflects the described behavior.
