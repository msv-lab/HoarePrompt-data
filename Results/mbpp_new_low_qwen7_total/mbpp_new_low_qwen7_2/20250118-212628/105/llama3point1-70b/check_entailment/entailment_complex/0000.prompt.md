Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Write a python function to set all even bits of a given number.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer.
def func_1(n):
    return n | 2863311530
    #The program returns the bitwise OR of the integer 'n' and 2863311530
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and returns the result of performing a bitwise OR operation between `n` and the integer `2863311530`. The function does not modify the input variable `n` and instead creates a new value by applying the bitwise OR operation. This operation ensures that each bit of the resulting value is `1` if either of the corresponding bits of `n` or `2863311530` is `1`. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations or the code itself, and the code accurately reflects the described behavior.

# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
