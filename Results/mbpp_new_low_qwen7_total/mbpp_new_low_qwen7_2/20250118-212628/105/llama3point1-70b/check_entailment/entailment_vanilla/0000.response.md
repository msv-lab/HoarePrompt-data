Reasoning:
To determine if the given function `func_1` correctly sets all even bits of a given number, we need to understand what "even bits" mean and how the bitwise OR operation works.

- The even bits of a number refer to the bits at positions 0, 2, 4, 6, etc., when counting from the right (least significant bit).
- To set all even bits, we need a bitmask where every even position has a 1 and every odd position has a 0.

The number `2863311530` in binary is `100010001000100010001000100010001000100010`. This bitmask indeed has 1s in every even position and 0s in every odd position. When we perform a bitwise OR operation between any number `n` and this bitmask, it will set the even bits of `n` to 1 without changing the odd bits.

Let's verify this with a few examples:

1. If `n = 0`, the result should be `2863311530` because all even bits are already set.
2. If `n = 1`, the result should be `2863311531` because only the least significant bit (an odd bit) is 1, but after the operation, it becomes 0, and the even bits remain 1.
3. If `n = 2863311530`, the result should still be `2863311530` because all even bits are already set.

Since the function uses a bitmask that correctly targets all even bits, the given implementation appears to be correct for setting all even bits of a given number.

Correctness: **True**
