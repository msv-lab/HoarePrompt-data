Reasoning:
Let's re-evaluate the problem and the provided function to ensure its correctness. According to the problem description, the goal is to set all even bits of a given number. The key points are:
1. Even bits are the bits at positions 0, 2, 4, 6, etc., when counting from the right.
2. We need a bitmask where every even position has a 1 and every odd position has a 0.

The given function `func_1(n)` performs a bitwise OR operation between `n` and the constant `2863311530`. Let's examine the binary representation of `2863311530` to see if it matches our requirement:
```
2863311530 in binary: 100010001000100010001000100010001000100010
```

This binary representation does indeed have 1s in every even position and 0s in every odd position. Therefore, the function should work as intended to set all even bits of `n`.

However, let's verify this by checking the function against some test cases:
1. For `n = 0`, the result should be `2863311530`.
2. For `n = 1`, the result should be `2863311531`.
3. For `n = 2863311530`, the result should be `2863311530`.

Let's calculate these explicitly:
- `0 | 2863311530 = 2863311530`
- `1 | 2863311530 = 2863311531`
- `2863311530 | 2863311530 = 2863311530`

All these test cases confirm that the function correctly sets all even bits of `n`.

Given the analysis and the verification, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
