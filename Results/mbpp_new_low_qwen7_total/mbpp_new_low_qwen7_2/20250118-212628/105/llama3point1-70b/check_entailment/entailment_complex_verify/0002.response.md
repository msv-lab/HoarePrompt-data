### Reasoning:
To evaluate the correctness of the provided function `func_1`, let's break down the problem and the given solution step-by-step.

#### Problem Understanding:
- We need to set all even bits of a given number.
- Even bits refer to the bits at positions 0, 2, 4, 6, etc., when counting from the right.

#### Given Solution Analysis:
- The function uses a single constant value `2863311530` as a bitmask.
- The bitmask `2863311530` in binary is `100010001000100010001000100010001000100010`.
- Performing a bitwise OR operation between `n` and `2863311530` will ensure that all even bits of `n` are set to 1.

#### Verification through Examples:
1. **Example 1: \( n = 0 \)**
   - Binary representation: `00000000000000000000000000000000`
   - After OR operation: `100010001000100010001000100010001000100010` (which is `2863311530`)
   
2. **Example 2: \( n = 1 \)**
   - Binary representation: `00000000000000000000000000000001`
   - After OR operation: `100010001000100010001000100010001000100011` (which is `2863311531`)
   
3. **Example 3: \( n = 2863311530 \)**
   - Binary representation: `100010001000100010001000100010001000100010`
   - After OR operation: `100010001000100010001000100010001000100010` (remains unchanged)

From these examples, it seems that the function correctly sets all even bits of the given number `n`.

#### Annotated Code Review:
- The annotation correctly states that the function performs a bitwise OR operation between `n` and the constant `2863311530`.
- The annotation also correctly notes that this operation ensures all even bits are set to 1, and the odd bits remain unchanged.

#### Conclusion:
Given the analysis and the examples, the provided function correctly sets all even bits of a given number using the bitwise OR operation with the constant `2863311530`.

### Final:
**True**
