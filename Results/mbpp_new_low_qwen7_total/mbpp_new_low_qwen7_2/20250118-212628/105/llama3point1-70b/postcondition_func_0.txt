The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and returns the result of performing a bitwise OR operation between `n` and the integer `2863311530`. The function does not modify the input variable `n` and instead creates a new value by applying the bitwise OR operation. This operation ensures that each bit of the resulting value is `1` if either of the corresponding bits of `n` or `2863311530` is `1`. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations or the code itself, and the code accurately reflects the described behavior.
