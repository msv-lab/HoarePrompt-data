Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program uses a regular expression to check if a string contains the character 'a' followed by two or three 'b' characters. The regular expression `a(b{2,3})` matches the pattern correctly. The `re.search` function returns a match object if the pattern is found, and the `bool` function converts this to `True` or `False`. The examples provided also confirm that the function works as expected:

- `func_1('ac')` returns `False` because there is no 'a' followed by two or three 'b's.
- `func_1('dc')` returns `False` because there is no 'a' followed by two or three 'b's.
- `func_1('abbbba')` returns `True` because it contains 'a' followed by four 'b's.

Since the program correctly implements the logic for all the given examples and the regular expression pattern matches the problem description, the program is correct.
