### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given annotated program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Pattern Definition**: The pattern defined in the code is `a(b{2,3})`. This means it is looking for an 'a' character followed by exactly 2 or 3 'b' characters.
   
2. **Function Implementation**: The function `func_1` uses `re.search` to search for this pattern within the input string `text`.
   
3. **Assertions**:
   - `assert func_1('ac') == False`: This is correct because there is no 'a' followed by 2 or 3 'b' characters in 'ac'.
   - `assert func_1('dc') == False`: This is also correct because there is no 'a' followed by 2 or 3 'b' characters in 'dc'.
   - `assert func_1('abbbba') == True`: This is incorrect. The pattern `a(b{2,3})` expects exactly 2 or 3 'b' characters following 'a', but 'abbbba' has 5 'b' characters, which does not match the pattern.

4. **Return Statement**: The function returns `bool(match)`, which is appropriate since `match` will be a match object if the pattern is found, and `False` otherwise.

Given these points, the assertion `func_1('abbbba') == True` is incorrect. Therefore, the provided program is not fully correct based on the test cases.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **False**
