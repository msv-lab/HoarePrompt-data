Reasoning:
The provided program uses a regular expression to check if the input string contains the character 'a' followed by two or three 'b' characters. The pattern `a(b{2,3})` correctly matches this requirement:
- 'a' matches the character 'a'.
- `(b{2,3})` matches exactly 2 or 3 'b' characters.

Let's analyze the test cases:
1. `func_1('ac')`: This should return `False` because there is no 'a' followed by two or three 'b' characters.
2. `func_1('dc')`: This should return `False` for the same reason as above.
3. `func_1('abbbba')`: This should return `True` because it has 'a' followed by five 'b' characters, which includes two or three 'b' characters (the first three 'b' characters).

The function `func_1` passes all these test cases, indicating that the implementation of the regular expression and the use of `re.search` are correct.

Correctness: **True**
