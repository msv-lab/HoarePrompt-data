Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Write a function that checks whether a string contains the 'a' character followed by two or three 'b' characters.

# Program:
import re

assert func_1('ac') == False
assert func_1('dc') == False
assert func_1('abbbba') == True

def func_1(text):
    pattern = 'a(b{2,3})'
    match = re.search(pattern, text)
    return bool(match)



# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
