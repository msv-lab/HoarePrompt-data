Reasoning:
The provided code defines a function `func_1` that uses a regular expression to check if a string contains an 'a' character followed by two or three 'b' characters. The regular expression pattern `'a(b{2,3})'` correctly captures this requirement.

- The pattern `'a(b{2,3})'` matches an 'a' character followed by between 2 and 3 'b' characters.
- The `re.search` function searches for this pattern in the input string `text`.
- The `bool(match)` ensures that the function returns `True` if there is a match and `False` otherwise.

Let's verify the correctness with the provided test cases:

1. `assert func_1('ac') == False`: The string 'ac' does not contain 'a' followed by two or three 'b' characters, so the function should return `False`. The code does this correctly.
2. `assert func_1('dc') == False`: The string 'dc' also does not contain 'a' followed by two or three 'b' characters, so the function should return `False`. The code does this correctly.
3. `assert func_1('abbbba') == True`: The string 'abbbba' contains 'a' followed by five 'b' characters (which is more than three), but the pattern `'a(b{2,3})'` only requires between two and three 'b' characters. Therefore, the function should return `False`. However, the provided pattern is incorrect because it will only match exactly two or three 'b' characters following 'a'.

Given the third test case, the function's implementation does not meet the requirement of matching two or three 'b' characters. The pattern should be `'a(b{2,3})'` but the actual implementation matches exactly two or three 'b' characters.

Correctness: **False**
