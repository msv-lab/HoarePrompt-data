The given code defines a regular expression pattern and attempts to search for this pattern within the `text` string. However, since the `text` string is not provided, we cannot determine if the `re.search` function will find a match or not. The `re.search` function returns a match object if the pattern is found in the string; otherwise, it returns `None`.

Since the `text` string is not specified, we cannot provide a specific output state. Instead, we can describe the potential states based on whether a match is found or not.

If a match is found (i.e., `re.search` returns a match object), then the match object will be stored in the `match` variable. If no match is found (i.e., `re.search` returns `None`), then `match` will be `None`.

Given the lack of a specific `text` value, the most accurate representation of the final state is:

Output State: **match is either a match object or None, depending on the content of the text string**
