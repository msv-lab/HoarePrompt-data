Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a string `text` as input and uses a regular expression to search for a specific pattern `'a(b{2,3})'`. If the pattern is found within the input string `text`, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. This function does not modify the input string `text` and only relies on the regular expression matching operation. Potential edge cases include when the input string is empty or does not contain the specified pattern.**

**Missing functionality:** The current implementation does not handle cases where the regular expression pattern is invalid. Additionally, there is no indication that the function handles non-string inputs for the `text` parameter, which could lead to errors if such inputs are provided.
