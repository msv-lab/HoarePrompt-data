You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Write a function to sort a given list of strings of numbers numerically.

- Program:
def func_1(num_strings):
    return sorted([int(num) for num in num_strings])



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `num_strings`, which is a list of strings, where each string can be successfully converted to an integer. It then converts each string in `num_strings` to an integer using a list comprehension. The resulting list of integers is sorted in ascending order, and the function returns this sorted list. Potential edge cases include the presence of non-convertible strings (e.g., strings containing characters other than digits), which would result in a `ValueError`. If such a string is encountered, the function will raise a `ValueError` and not proceed with the conversion and sorting of the remaining strings. If the input list is empty, the function returns an empty list.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program attempts to sort a list of string representations of numbers numerically by first converting each string to an integer and then sorting them. However, this approach will fail if the list contains strings that cannot be converted to integers. For example, if the input list contains the string `"abc"`, the program will raise a `ValueError` because `"abc"` cannot be converted to an integer.

To handle this, the program should include error handling to skip or handle non-numeric strings appropriately. Here's an example of how the program could be modified to handle such cases:

```python
def func_1(num_strings):
    try:
        return sorted([int(num) for num in num_strings if num.isdigit()])
    except ValueError:
        # Handle the case where conversion fails
        return []
```

This modified version ensures that only numeric strings are converted to integers and sorted, while non-numeric strings are ignored. Without such handling, the program is not correct according to the problem description.
