Reasoning:

1. **Problem Description**: The problem requires sorting a list of strings of numbers numerically.
2. **Function Summary**: The function `func_1` takes a list of strings, attempts to convert each string to an integer, sorts the resulting list of integers, and returns it. The summary mentions that the function will raise a `ValueError` if any string is non-numeric, but it does not explicitly mention handling non-convertible strings in the list comprehensions. This implies that if a string is non-numeric, the function will raise a `ValueError`.
3. **Original Assessment**: The original assessment suggests that the function does not handle cases where the input list contains non-numeric strings and may raise a `ValueError`. However, based on the provided function summary, if the input strings are all valid integers as strings, the function will indeed work correctly and sort them.

Given the problem statement and the function summary, let's evaluate the function:

- The function `func_1` takes a list of strings (`num_strings`).
- It uses a list comprehension to convert each string to an integer.
- It then sorts the resulting list of integers.
- The function summary correctly states that if any string is non-numeric, a `ValueError` will be raised.

Based on the provided information and assuming valid inputs, the function will work as expected. Therefore, the original assessment, which suggested that the function does not handle non-numeric strings and may raise a `ValueError`, is partially correct but incomplete. The function summary clarifies that the function will raise a `ValueError` if any string is non-numeric.

Final: **True**
