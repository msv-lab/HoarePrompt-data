### Reasoning:

The original assessment suggests that the provided program is incorrect due to the potential `ValueError` raised when attempting to convert non-numeric strings to integers. The assessment also proposes a modification to handle non-numeric strings by using a condition within the list comprehension to filter out non-numeric strings before conversion.

However, the provided function summary contradicts this assessment. According to the function summary, the program will raise a `ValueError` if any string in the input list cannot be converted to an integer. This implies that the program does not attempt to handle or ignore non-numeric strings; instead, it stops execution immediately upon encountering a non-numeric string, ensuring that only convertible strings are processed.

Given this information, the program's behavior aligns with the problem description and the provided function summary. The program correctly identifies and raises an error when it encounters non-numeric strings, thus not proceeding with the conversion and sorting of those strings. Therefore, the original assessment, which suggests the need for additional error handling, is inaccurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is correct according to the problem description and the provided function summary.
