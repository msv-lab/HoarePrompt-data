Reasoning:
Let's analyze the given function `func_1` step-by-step using the annotated version and the provided original assessment.

### Given Function:
```python
def func_1(num_strings):
    return sorted([int(num) for num in num_strings])
```

### Annotated Code:
1. **State before function call**: `num_strings` is a list of strings, where each string can be converted to an integer.
2. **Function behavior**: The function converts each string in `num_strings` to an integer using a list comprehension. The resulting list of integers is sorted in ascending order, and the function returns this sorted list.
3. **Potential issues**: If the input list contains non-numeric strings, a `ValueError` will be raised during the conversion. If such a string is encountered, the function will stop and raise an exception.

### Original Assessment:
The original assessment correctly identifies two main issues:
1. The function does not handle cases where the input list contains non-numeric strings.
2. If the input list contains empty strings or strings that cannot be converted to integers, it will raise a `ValueError`.

However, the original assessment concludes that the function is incorrect because it assumes valid inputs. This is where the original assessment is somewhat misleading. The problem description does not explicitly mention handling invalid inputs, so the function can be considered correct under the assumption that all inputs are valid.

### Re-evaluation:
- **Function Behavior**: The function correctly sorts a list of numeric strings after converting them to integers.
- **Input Assumption**: The problem description states to assume valid inputs, meaning all strings are numeric.
- **Error Handling**: While the function does not handle invalid inputs, it adheres to the problem statement when valid inputs are given.

Given these points, the function `func_1` is correct under the assumption of valid inputs as specified in the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The function `func_1` is correct when assuming all inputs are valid numeric strings.
