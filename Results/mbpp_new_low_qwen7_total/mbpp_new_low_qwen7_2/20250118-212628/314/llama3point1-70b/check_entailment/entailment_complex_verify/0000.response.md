### Reasoning:
Let's analyze the provided code and the annotated version to determine the correctness of the function `func_1`.

#### Given Code:
```python
def func_1(num_strings):
    return sorted([int(num) for num in num_strings])
```

#### Annotated Code:
The annotated code explains that the function converts each string in `num_strings` to an integer using a list comprehension and then sorts the resulting list of integers. It also mentions potential issues with non-convertible strings, which would cause a `ValueError`.

However, the original assessment suggests that the function should include error handling to skip or handle non-numeric strings appropriately. This is a valid point, but it is not necessarily the only way to address the issue. 

In the given implementation:
1. The function directly raises a `ValueError` if any string in `num_strings` cannot be converted to an integer.
2. The function does not explicitly handle non-numeric strings, but it also does not ignore them either. Instead, it simply fails and raises an exception.

If we consider the problem statement, which requires the function to sort a list of string representations of numbers numerically, the current implementation meets this requirement. The function attempts to convert each string to an integer and then sorts the resulting list. While it does not handle non-numeric strings gracefully, it does not modify the behavior of the function in a way that would produce incorrect results. The function simply fails if non-numeric strings are present.

#### Evaluation:
Given that the problem description does not explicitly require error handling for non-numeric strings, and the function does convert the numeric strings to integers and sort them, the function is technically correct according to the provided problem description.

#### Final Decision:
Final: **True**

### Explanation:
The original assessment suggested that the function should include error handling to skip or handle non-numeric strings, which is indeed a best practice. However, the current implementation, while not perfect, still correctly sorts the numeric strings and raises an exception when encountering non-numeric strings. Since the problem statement does not specify that the function should handle non-numeric strings, the current implementation is considered correct.
