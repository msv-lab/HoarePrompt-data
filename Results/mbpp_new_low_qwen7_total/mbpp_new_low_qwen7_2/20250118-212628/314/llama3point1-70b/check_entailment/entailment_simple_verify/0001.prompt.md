You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Write a function to sort a given list of strings of numbers numerically.

- Program: 
def func_1(num_strings):
    return sorted([int(num) for num in num_strings])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: num_strings is a list of strings, where each string can be converted to an integer.
def func_1(num_strings):
    return sorted([int(num) for num in num_strings])
    #The program returns a sorted list of integers, where each integer is obtained by converting a string from the list `num_strings` to an integer



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
The given function `func_1` takes a list of strings representing numbers and returns a sorted list of those numbers converted to integers. However, there are a few issues with this approach:

1. The function does not handle cases where the input list contains non-numeric strings.
2. If the input list contains empty strings or strings that cannot be converted to integers, it will raise a `ValueError`.

To properly sort the list of numeric strings, you should ensure that only valid numeric strings are converted and sorted. Here's an improved version of the function that includes error handling:

```python
def func_1(num_strings):
    try:
        # Convert each string to an integer if possible, otherwise ignore it
        nums = [int(num) for num in num_strings if num.strip().isdigit()]
        return sorted(nums)
    except ValueError:
        # Handle the case where conversion fails
        return []
```

Given the original problem statement without additional constraints, the provided function might still be considered "correct" if we assume valid inputs (i.e., all strings are numeric). However, considering real-world scenarios and robust programming practices, the improved version is more appropriate.

Since the problem statement does not specify handling of invalid inputs, I will evaluate the given function based on the assumption of valid inputs.

Correctness: **False**
