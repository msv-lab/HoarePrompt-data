### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies potential issues with the given function, especially when dealing with invalid inputs. However, since the problem description explicitly states to assume valid inputs, we do not need to consider error handling for non-numeric strings.

Let's re-evaluate the function `func_1` under the assumption that all strings in the input list `num_strings` are valid numeric strings.

1. **Function Logic**: The function uses a list comprehension to convert each string in the input list to an integer. This ensures that the resulting list consists only of integers.
2. **Sorting**: The `sorted()` function is then used to sort these integers in ascending order.
3. **Input Assumption**: Given that the problem description assumes valid inputs, we can assume that the list `num_strings` contains only strings that can be successfully converted to integers.

Given this analysis, the function behaves as expected under the specified assumptions. It converts each string to an integer and sorts the resulting list of integers.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The given function `func_1` is correct under the assumption of valid inputs, as it correctly converts each string to an integer and sorts the resulting list of integers.
