### Reasoning:
- The function `func_1` takes a list of strings (`num_strings`) as input.
- It uses a list comprehension to convert each string in the list to an integer.
- The `sorted` function is then used to sort the list of integers.
- The result is a sorted list of integers derived from the original list of strings.

Given the problem description, the goal is to sort the list of strings numerically. Since each string in `num_strings` can be converted to an integer and the resulting integers are sorted, the function correctly achieves this.

### Correctness:
**True**
