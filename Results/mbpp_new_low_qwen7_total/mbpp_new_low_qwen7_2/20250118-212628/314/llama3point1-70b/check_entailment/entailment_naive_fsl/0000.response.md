Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program attempts to sort a list of string representations of numbers numerically by first converting each string to an integer and then sorting them. However, this approach will fail if the list contains strings that cannot be converted to integers. For example, if the input list contains the string `"abc"`, the program will raise a `ValueError` because `"abc"` cannot be converted to an integer.

To handle this, the program should include error handling to skip or handle non-numeric strings appropriately. Here's an example of how the program could be modified to handle such cases:

```python
def func_1(num_strings):
    try:
        return sorted([int(num) for num in num_strings if num.isdigit()])
    except ValueError:
        # Handle the case where conversion fails
        return []
```

This modified version ensures that only numeric strings are converted to integers and sorted, while non-numeric strings are ignored. Without such handling, the program is not correct according to the problem description.
