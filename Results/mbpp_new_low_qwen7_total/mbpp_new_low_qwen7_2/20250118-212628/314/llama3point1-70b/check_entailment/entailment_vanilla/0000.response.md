Reasoning:
The given function `func_1` takes a list of strings representing numbers and returns a sorted list of those numbers converted to integers. However, there are a few issues with this approach:

1. The function does not handle cases where the input list contains non-numeric strings.
2. If the input list contains empty strings or strings that cannot be converted to integers, it will raise a `ValueError`.

To properly sort the list of numeric strings, you should ensure that only valid numeric strings are converted and sorted. Here's an improved version of the function that includes error handling:

```python
def func_1(num_strings):
    try:
        # Convert each string to an integer if possible, otherwise ignore it
        nums = [int(num) for num in num_strings if num.strip().isdigit()]
        return sorted(nums)
    except ValueError:
        # Handle the case where conversion fails
        return []
```

Given the original problem statement without additional constraints, the provided function might still be considered "correct" if we assume valid inputs (i.e., all strings are numeric). However, considering real-world scenarios and robust programming practices, the improved version is more appropriate.

Since the problem statement does not specify handling of invalid inputs, I will evaluate the given function based on the assumption of valid inputs.

Correctness: **False**
