Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Write a function to sort a given list of strings of numbers numerically.

# Program:
def func_1(num_strings):
    return sorted([int(num) for num in num_strings])





# Execution Summary:
The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `num_strings`, which is a list of strings, where each string can be successfully converted to an integer. It then converts each string in `num_strings` to an integer using a list comprehension. The resulting list of integers is sorted in ascending order, and the function returns this sorted list. Potential edge cases include the presence of non-convertible strings (e.g., strings containing characters other than digits), which would result in a `ValueError`. If such a string is encountered, the function will raise a `ValueError` and not proceed with the conversion and sorting of the remaining strings. If the input list is empty, the function returns an empty list.


# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
