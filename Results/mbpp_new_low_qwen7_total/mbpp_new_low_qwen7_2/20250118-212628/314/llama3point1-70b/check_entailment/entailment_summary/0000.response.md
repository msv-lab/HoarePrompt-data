Reasoning: 
The provided program does not correctly handle lists that contain non-numeric strings. According to the problem description, the goal is to sort a list of strings of numbers numerically. However, the current implementation attempts to convert all strings to integers simultaneously within a single list comprehension, which means it will fail if any string cannot be converted to an integer. This approach does not allow for the sorting of only the numeric strings while ignoring non-numeric ones.

Moreover, the program returns a list of integers rather than strings, which may not be the desired output according to the problem statement unless explicitly mentioned. However, based on the problem description, the expectation seems to be a list of strings sorted numerically.

Given these points, the program fails to meet the requirement of handling non-numeric strings gracefully and does not return a list of strings as expected.

Correctness: **False**
