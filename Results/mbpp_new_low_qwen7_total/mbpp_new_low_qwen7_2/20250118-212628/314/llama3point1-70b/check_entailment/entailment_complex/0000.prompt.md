Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Write a function to sort a given list of strings of numbers numerically.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: num_strings is a list of strings, where each string can be converted to an integer.
def func_1(num_strings):
    return sorted([int(num) for num in num_strings])
    #The program returns a sorted list of integers, where each integer is obtained by converting a string from the list `num_strings` to an integer
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `num_strings`, which is a list of strings, where each string can be successfully converted to an integer. It then converts each string in `num_strings` to an integer using a list comprehension. The resulting list of integers is sorted in ascending order, and the function returns this sorted list. Potential edge cases include the presence of non-convertible strings (e.g., strings containing characters other than digits), which would result in a `ValueError`. If such a string is encountered, the function will raise a `ValueError` and not proceed with the conversion and sorting of the remaining strings. If the input list is empty, the function returns an empty list.

# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
