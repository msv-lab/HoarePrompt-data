Reasoning:
The annotated program describes a function that attempts to convert a list of strings to a list of integers and then sorts them. However, the actual code snippet provided does not include any error handling for non-convertible strings. If any string in the list cannot be converted to an integer, the function will raise a `ValueError`.

Given this, the function will only work correctly if all strings in the list can be converted to integers without any issues. The annotation suggests that the function should handle non-convertible strings, but the code does not do so.

Therefore, the function as provided is not fully correct because it does not handle cases where strings are not convertible to integers.

Correctness: **False**
