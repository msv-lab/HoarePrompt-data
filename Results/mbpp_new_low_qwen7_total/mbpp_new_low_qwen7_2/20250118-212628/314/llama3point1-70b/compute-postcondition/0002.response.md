Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `num_strings`, which is a list of strings, where each string can be successfully converted to an integer. It then converts each string in `num_strings` to an integer using a list comprehension. The resulting list of integers is sorted in ascending order, and the function returns this sorted list. Potential edge cases include the presence of non-convertible strings (e.g., strings containing characters other than digits), which would result in a `ValueError`. If such a string is encountered, the function will raise a `ValueError` and not proceed with the conversion and sorting of the remaining strings. If the input list is empty, the function returns an empty list.**
