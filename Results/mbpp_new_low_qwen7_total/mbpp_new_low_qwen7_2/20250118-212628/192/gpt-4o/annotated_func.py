#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string.
def func_1(s):
    return ''.join([s[i] for i in range(len(s)) if i % 2 != 0])
    #The program returns a string containing characters from 's' at odd indices
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` as a parameter and returns a new string containing only the characters from `s` that are located at odd indices (i.e., 1, 3, 5, ...). The function correctly processes strings of any length, including empty strings. If the input string is empty, the function returns an empty string. There are no edge cases or missing functionalities in the provided code.
