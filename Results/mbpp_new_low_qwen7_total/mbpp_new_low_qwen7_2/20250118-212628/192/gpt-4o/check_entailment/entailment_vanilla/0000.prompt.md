Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Write a function to remove odd characters in a string.

# Program:
assert func_1('python') == 'yhn'
assert func_1('program') == 'rga'
assert func_1('language') == 'agae'

def func_1(s):
    return ''.join([s[i] for i in range(len(s)) if i % 2 != 0])



# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
