Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly removes odd characters from a string by keeping only the characters at even indices. The function iterates over the string using a list comprehension and includes characters where the index is even (i.e., `i % 2 == 0`). This matches the requirement to remove odd characters, which implies keeping even-indexed characters.

Given the assertions:
- `func_1('python') == 'yhn'` (Correct: Characters at positions 1, 3, and 5 are 'y', 'h', and 'n')
- `func_1('program') == 'rga'` (Correct: Characters at positions 1, 3, and 5 are 'r', 'g', and 'a')
- `func_1('language') == 'agae'` (Correct: Characters at positions 1, 3, 5, and 7 are 'a', 'g', 'a', and 'e')

Since the function works correctly for these examples and the logic aligns with the problem description, the program is correct.
