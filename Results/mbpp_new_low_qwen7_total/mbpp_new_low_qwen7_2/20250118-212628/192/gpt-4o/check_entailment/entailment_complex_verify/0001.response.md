Reasoning: 
The original assessment accurately describes the functionality of the `func_1` function and correctly interprets the assertions. The function `func_1` indeed removes characters from the input string `s` that are located at odd indices (considering the first character at index 0). The provided assertions test the function with three different strings and confirm that the returned values match the expected results.

However, there is a small point to consider: the original assessment states that the function includes only characters at even indices, which is not entirely accurate. The function actually includes characters at odd indices relative to their position in the list (i.e., 1, 3, 5, etc.), not even indices starting from index 0. Despite this minor clarification, the core logic and the correctness of the function remain intact.

Given that the function behaves as intended and the assertions pass, the program is correct.

Final: **True**
