Reasoning:
- The function `func_1` is intended to remove odd characters (i.e., characters at even indices) from the input string and return the resulting string.
- The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the string `s`, selecting characters at odd indices (i.e., indices that are not divisible by 2).
- The expression `i % 2 != 0` checks if the index `i` is odd, which is the correct condition for selecting odd-indexed characters.
- The function then joins these selected characters back into a string using `''.join()`.
- Given the provided test cases:
  - `func_1('python')` should return `'yhn'` (removing characters at indices 0, 2, 4, which are 'p', 't', 'h').
  - `func_1('program')` should return `'rga'` (removing characters at indices 0, 2, 4, which are 'p', 'r', 'g').
  - `func_1('language')` should return `'agae'` (removing characters at indices 0, 2, 4, 6, which are 'l', 'g', 'u', 'n').

Based on the provided code and the test cases, the function appears to be correctly implemented and meets the requirement of removing characters at even indices.

Correctness: **True**
