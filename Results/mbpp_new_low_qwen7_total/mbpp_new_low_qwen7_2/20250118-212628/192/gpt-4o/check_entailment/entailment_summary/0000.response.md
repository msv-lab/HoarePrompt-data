Reasoning: 
The provided program aims to remove odd characters from a string, which implies removing characters located at odd indices (considering index starting from 0). The given function `func_1` iterates through the string and uses a list comprehension to select characters at even indices (`if i % 2 != 0` checks for odd indices since the condition should be `i % 2 == 0` for even indices). However, the provided assertions suggest that the function should actually remove characters at odd indices, not even indices. The execution summary also confirms this understanding, stating that the function returns characters from odd indices, not even ones.

Given this understanding, let's correct the function to match the requirement:

```python
def func_1(s):
    return ''.join([s[i] for i in range(len(s)) if i % 2 == 0])
```

Now, re-evaluating the original program with the correct logic:

- The provided assertions are:
  - `assert func_1('python') == 'pyth'`
  - `assert func_1('program') == 'prgm'`
  - `assert func_1('language') == 'langua'`

- The function should indeed return characters at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...).

Thus, the original implementation does not match the requirement. The correct implementation would involve checking for even indices.

Correctness: **False**
