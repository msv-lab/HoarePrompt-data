Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Write a function to remove odd characters in a string.

# Program:
assert func_1('python') == 'yhn'
assert func_1('program') == 'rga'
assert func_1('language') == 'agae'

def func_1(s):
    return ''.join([s[i] for i in range(len(s)) if i % 2 != 0])





# Execution Summary:
The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` as a parameter and returns a new string containing only the characters from `s` that are located at odd indices (i.e., 1, 3, 5, ...). The function correctly processes strings of any length, including empty strings. If the input string is empty, the function returns an empty string. There are no edge cases or missing functionalities in the provided code.


# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
