Reasoning: 
The provided function `func_1` aims to remove odd characters from a string, which implies it should return characters at even indices (0-based index). However, the code given iterates over the string using `range(len(s))` and includes characters where `i % 2 != 0`, meaning it picks characters at odd indices (1-based index). This results in characters being selected from positions 1, 3, 5, etc., instead of the intended even positions (0, 2, 4, etc.).

Given the test cases provided:
- `func_1('python')` should ideally return `'pto'` if removing odd characters means removing characters at odd indices (1, 3, 5), but it returns `'yhn'`.
- `func_1('program')` should return `'prg'` but it returns `'rga'`.
- `func_1('language')` should return `'lagu'` but it returns `'agae'`.

The actual behavior of the function matches removing characters from odd indices rather than even indices. Therefore, the function does not correctly implement the requirement to remove odd characters in the context of the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
