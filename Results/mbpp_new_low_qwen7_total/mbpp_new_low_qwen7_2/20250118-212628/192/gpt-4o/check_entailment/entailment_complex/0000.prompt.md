Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Write a function to remove odd characters in a string.

# Annotated Program:
assert func_1('python') == 'yhn'
assert func_1('program') == 'rga'
assert func_1('language') == 'agae'

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string.
def func_1(s):
    return ''.join([s[i] for i in range(len(s)) if i % 2 != 0])
    #The program returns a string containing characters from 's' at odd indices
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` as a parameter and returns a new string containing only the characters from `s` that are located at odd indices (i.e., 1, 3, 5, ...). The function correctly processes strings of any length, including empty strings. If the input string is empty, the function returns an empty string. There are no edge cases or missing functionalities in the provided code.

# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
