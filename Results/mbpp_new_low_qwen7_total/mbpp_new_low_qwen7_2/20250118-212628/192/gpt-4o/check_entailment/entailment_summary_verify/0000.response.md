### Reasoning:
The original assessment incorrectly stated that the function `func_1` removes odd characters by keeping even-indexed characters. However, based on the problem description and the function summary, the function should actually keep characters at odd indices (1, 3, 5, ...) and remove those at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...).

Let's analyze the code and the provided assertions:

- The function `func_1` uses a list comprehension to iterate over the string `s` and includes characters where `i % 2 != 0`, meaning it keeps characters at odd indices.
- The assertions provided show that the function is indeed removing characters at even indices, not odd indices.

Here are the correct interpretations of the assertions:
- `func_1('python') == 'yhn'` (Correct: Characters at positions 1, 3, and 5 are 'y', 'h', and 'n', which are at odd indices)
- `func_1('program') == 'rga'` (Correct: Characters at positions 1, 3, and 5 are 'r', 'g', and 'a', which are at odd indices)
- `func_1('language') == 'agae'` (Correct: Characters at positions 1, 3, 5, and 7 are 'a', 'g', 'a', and 'e', which are at odd indices)

Given this analysis, the function `func_1` is correctly implemented according to the problem description and the provided function summary. It removes characters at even indices and keeps characters at odd indices.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
