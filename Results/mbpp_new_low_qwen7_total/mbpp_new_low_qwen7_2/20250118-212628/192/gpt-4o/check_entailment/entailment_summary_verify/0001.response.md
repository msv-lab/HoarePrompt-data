Reasoning: 
The original assessment correctly identifies the behavior of the function `func_1`. However, there is a subtle issue with the function's implementation. The problem description asks to remove "odd characters" in a string, which implies removing characters at odd indices (1, 3, 5, ...), not even indices (0, 2, 4, ...).

The function `func_1` uses the condition `if i % 2 != 0` in its list comprehension, which indeed removes characters at odd indices. This means the function is actually removing characters at positions 1, 3, 5, etc., which is the opposite of what the problem description asks for.

Given the function summary provided, the function correctly processes the characters at odd indices, but this does not align with the problem description. Therefore, the function should be modified to remove characters at even indices instead.

For example, the function should use `if i % 2 == 0` to correctly implement the requirement of removing odd characters (characters at even indices).

Despite this issue with the function summary being slightly misleading, the provided code meets the criteria of the problem description after correcting the logic. The assertions provided are correct and confirm the function's behavior.

Final: **False**
