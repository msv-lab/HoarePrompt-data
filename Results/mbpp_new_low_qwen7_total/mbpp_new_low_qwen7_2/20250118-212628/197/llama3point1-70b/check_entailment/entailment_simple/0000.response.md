Reasoning:
- The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `tup` (a tuple) and `lst` (a list).
- The function aims to count the occurrence of each element in `lst` within the tuple `tup`.
- The given implementation uses a generator expression inside the `sum` function to count the occurrences. Specifically, `tup.count(element)` returns the number of times `element` appears in `tup`, and this is summed up for all elements in `lst`.

Given the problem description, this approach correctly sums up the counts of each element in `lst` that appears in `tup`. There is no apparent logical error in the provided code.

Correctness: **True**
