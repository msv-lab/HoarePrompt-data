Reasoning: 
The original assessment accurately describes the behavior of the function `func_1`. Let's review the annotated code and the original assessment to ensure the correctness of the program:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` takes a tuple `tup` and a list `lst` as parameters. This aligns with the problem description which asks for counting the occurrences of elements from a list in a tuple.

2. **Generator Expression**: The generator expression `(tup.count(element) for element in lst)` iterates over each element in `lst` and calls `tup.count(element)` for each element. This counts the number of occurrences of each element in the tuple `tup`.

3. **Sum Function**: The `sum` function adds up all the counts returned by the generator expression. This ensures that the total count of all elements from `lst` that are present in `tup` is returned.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Empty Inputs**: If either `tup` or `lst` is empty, the generator expression will not produce any counts, and `sum` will return `0`.
   - **Non-Hashable Elements**: The function correctly handles non-hashable elements in `lst` because `tuple.count()` only works with hashable types. Non-hashable elements will simply not be counted.

5. **Example**: For `tup = (1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 2)` and `lst = [2, 3]`, the generator expression yields `2` (for `2`) and `1` (for `3`), and the `sum` function correctly returns `3 + 1 = 4`.

The original assessment correctly identifies that the function works efficiently and handles all valid cases, provided the elements in `lst` are hashable and present in `tup`.

Final: **True**
