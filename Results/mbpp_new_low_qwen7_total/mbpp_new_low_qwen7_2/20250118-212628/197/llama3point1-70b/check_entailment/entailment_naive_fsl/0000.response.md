Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The given program does not correctly count the occurrences of all elements of the list `lst` within the tuple `tup`. The program only returns the count of the first element of the list `lst` in the tuple `tup` because the generator expression `(tup.count(element) for element in lst)` generates a sequence of counts for each element in `lst`, but `sum()` adds up these counts from the first element onwards without resetting the count for subsequent elements. 

For example, consider the following input:
- Tuple: `tup = (1, 2, 3, 2)`
- List: `lst = [2, 3]`

The expected output would be a tuple of counts `(0, 1)` since the number `2` appears once and the number `3` does not appear in the tuple. However, the program will output `(1, 1)` because it sums up the counts of the first element `2` and then the second element `3`.

To fix this, the program should return a tuple of counts corresponding to each element in `lst`, which can be achieved using a list comprehension or similar approach. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(tup, lst):
    return tuple(tup.count(element) for element in lst)
```

This corrected version will return the correct counts for each element in `lst` as a tuple.
