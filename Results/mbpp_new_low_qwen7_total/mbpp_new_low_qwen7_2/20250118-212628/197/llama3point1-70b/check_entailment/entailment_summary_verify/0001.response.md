### Reasoning:

The given function `func_1` aims to count the occurrences of all elements from a list within a tuple. Based on the provided problem description and the function summary, the function seems to be designed correctly. Let's break down the function step-by-step and verify its behavior using the provided summary:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `tup` (a tuple) and `lst` (a list).

2. **Generator Expression**: The function uses a generator expression `(tup.count(element) for element in lst)` to iterate over each element in `lst` and count how many times that element appears in the tuple `tup`. This generator expression yields the count of each element found in `tup`.

3. **Sum Function**: The `sum` function then adds up all the counts yielded by the generator expression.

However, let's consider some potential issues and edge cases:

- **Edge Case Analysis**:
  - **Empty Input**: If either `tup` or `lst` is empty, the generator expression will not produce any values, and `sum` will return `0`.
  - **Elements Not Present in Tuple**: If an element in `lst` is not present in `tup`, its count will be `0` and will not contribute to the sum.
  - **Non-Hashable Elements**: As mentioned in the function summary, the function correctly handles non-hashable elements in `lst`, treating them as if they do not exist in `tup`.

To ensure the function behaves as intended, let's verify the function with a few examples:

```python
# Example 1: Both tup and lst contain hashable elements
tup = (1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 2)
lst = [2, 3]
assert func_1(tup, lst) == 4  # Expected output: 3 (for 2) + 1 (for 3) = 4

# Example 2: Some elements in lst are not in tup
tup = (1, 2, 3, 4)
lst = [2, 5]
assert func_1(tup, lst) == 1  # Expected output: 1 (for 2)

# Example 3: Empty lst
tup = (1, 2, 3, 4)
lst = []
assert func_1(tup, lst) == 0  # Expected output: 0

# Example 4: Empty tup
tup = ()
lst = [1, 2]
assert func_1(tup, lst) == 0  # Expected output: 0

# Example 5: Non-hashable elements in lst
tup = (1, 2, 3, 4)
lst = [2, [5], (6,)]
assert func_1(tup, lst) == 1  # Expected output: 1 (for 2), others are non-hashable and ignored
```

From the analysis and examples, the function correctly counts the occurrences of elements from `lst` in `tup`, including handling edge cases like empty inputs and non-hashable elements.

Given this detailed reasoning and verification, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct based on the provided problem description and the function summary.
