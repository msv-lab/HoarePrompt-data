### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` aims to count the occurrences of all elements from a list within a tuple. Let's analyze the code and the provided annotations step-by-step:

1. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `tup` (a tuple) and `lst` (a list). This matches the problem description.

2. **Generator Expression**:
   - The generator expression `(tup.count(element) for element in lst)` iterates over each element in `lst` and calls `tup.count(element)` to count the number of occurrences of that element in `tup`. This is accurate as per the annotations.

3. **Sum Function**:
   - The `sum` function then adds up all the counts returned by the generator expression. This is also accurate as per the annotations.

However, there is one important consideration that the original assessment did not address:

- **Non-Hashable Elements**: The function assumes that the elements in `lst` are hashable and can be counted using `tup.count()`. If `lst` contains elements that are not hashable (e.g., lists, dictionaries), `tup.count()` will raise a `TypeError`.

For example, if `tup = (1, 2, [3], 2, [3])` and `lst = [[3]]`, calling `tup.count([3])` will raise a `TypeError` because lists are not hashable.

To handle non-hashable elements, additional logic would need to be added to the function, such as converting the elements to a string representation or handling specific types of non-hashable objects.

### Conclusion:

While the function is generally correct for hashable elements, it may fail for non-hashable elements in `lst`. Therefore, the original assessment should include this caveat.

**Final: False**
