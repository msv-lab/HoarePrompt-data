### Reasoning:

The given function `func_1` aims to count the occurrences of all elements from a list within a tuple. Let's break down the function step-by-step:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `tup` (a tuple) and `lst` (a list).

2. **Generator Expression**: Inside the function, there is a generator expression `(tup.count(element) for element in lst)`. This expression will iterate over each element in the list `lst` and for each element, it will call the method `count` on the tuple `tup` to count how many times that element appears in the tuple.

3. **Sum Function**: The generator expression is passed to the `sum` function. The `sum` function adds up all the counts returned by the generator expression.

Let's consider an example:
- Suppose `tup = (1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 2)` and `lst = [2, 3]`.
- The generator expression will yield `2` (since `tup.count(2)` returns `3`) and `1` (since `tup.count(3)` returns `1`).
- The `sum` function will add these values: `3 + 1 = 4`.

This approach is efficient and correctly counts the occurrences of each element from `lst` in `tup`. It works for any valid input tuples and lists, provided that the elements in `lst` are hashable and present in `tup`.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct based on the provided problem description.

**Correctness: True**
