Reasoning:
The provided program aims to count the occurrences of elements from the list `lst` within the tuple `tup`. The function `func_1` uses a generator expression inside the `sum()` function to iterate over each element in `lst` and count how many times it appears in `tup`. This approach works correctly for hashable elements, which includes most common data types like integers, strings, and tuples.

However, the execution summary highlights an important edge case: the function does not handle unhashable elements in `lst` (e.g., lists, dictionaries). Since these elements cannot be used as arguments to `tup.count()`, they will not be counted and effectively treated as non-existent in the context of this function.

Given that the problem statement does not explicitly mention handling unhashable elements, we can assume that the function should only handle hashable elements as intended. Therefore, the provided implementation meets the requirements of the problem for the intended input types.

Correctness: **True**
