Reasoning:
The provided function `func_1(tup, lst)` aims to count the occurrences of elements from the list `lst` within the tuple `tup`. The function achieves this by using a generator expression inside the `sum()` function, which iterates over each element in `lst` and counts its occurrences in `tup` using the `count()` method. The `count()` method returns the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the element in the tuple.

The function's behavior is as follows:
- It correctly handles the case where the tuple or list is empty, returning 0.
- It properly sums up the counts of elements from `lst` that are present in `tup`.
- It does not count elements in `lst` that are not hashable (like lists or dictionaries), as these cannot be used with `tuple.count()`.

Given the problem statement and the annotated program, the function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to count the occurrences of elements from a list within a tuple.

Correctness: **True**
