Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks if the given element `x` appears more than `n/2` times in the sorted array `arr`. Given that the array is sorted and the definition of a majority element (appearing more than `n/2` times), this approach is correct. The function uses the `.count()` method to count the occurrences of `x` in `arr` and returns whether this count is greater than `n/2`.

Since the array is sorted, no additional logic is required to handle the sorted nature of the array explicitly for this specific problem. The function will correctly identify if `x` is a majority element based on the given problem description for all potential cases.
