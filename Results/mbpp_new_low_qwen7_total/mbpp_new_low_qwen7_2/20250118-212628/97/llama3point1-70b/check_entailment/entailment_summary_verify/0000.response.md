Reasoning:

The original assessment claims that the function `func_1` is correct because it checks if the given element `x` appears more than `n/2` times in the sorted array `arr`. While this is a correct approach in theory, there are a few issues with the implementation:

1. **Efficiency**: The use of `arr.count(x)` is inefficient for large arrays because it scans the entire array each time it is called. For a sorted array of length `n`, this operation has a time complexity of O(n).

2. **Sorted Array Optimization**: Since the array is sorted, we can use binary search to find the first and last occurrence of `x` and then calculate the number of occurrences. This would reduce the time complexity to O(log n + k), where `k` is the number of occurrences of `x`.

3. **Termination Early**: As mentioned in the function summary, the function can terminate early if it finds a different element after finding more than `n/2` occurrences of `x`. This is a valid optimization, but it is not implemented in the current version of the function.

However, even though the current implementation is not optimized, it still meets the problem requirements as stated. The function will correctly identify if `x` is a majority element based on the given problem description. The provided solution does not handle the sorted nature of the array explicitly, but it works correctly within the context of the problem.

Given these points, while the implementation is not the most efficient, it is still correct according to the problem description.

Final: **True**
