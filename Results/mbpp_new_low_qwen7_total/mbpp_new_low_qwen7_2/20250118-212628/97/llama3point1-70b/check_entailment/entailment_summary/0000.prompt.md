Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Write a function that takes in a sorted array, its length (n), and an element and returns whether the element is the majority element in the given sorted array. (The majority element is the element that occurs more than n/2 times.)

# Program:
def func_1(arr, n, x):
    count = arr.count(x)
    return count > n / 2





# Execution Summary:
The function `func_1` accepts a sorted list of integers `arr`, a positive integer `n` representing its length, and an integer `x`. It counts the occurrences of `x` in `arr` and checks if this count is greater than `n / 2`. If `x` appears more than `n / 2` times in `arr`, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. This function aims to determine if `x` is a majority element in `arr`. Note that since `arr` is already sorted, the function can terminate early if it finds a different element after finding more than `n / 2` occurrences of `x`, thus potentially reducing unnecessary iterations. However, the current implementation does not include this optimization and simply counts the occurrences.
