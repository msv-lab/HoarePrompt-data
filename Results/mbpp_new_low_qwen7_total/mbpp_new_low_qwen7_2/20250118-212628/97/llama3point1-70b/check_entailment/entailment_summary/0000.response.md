Reasoning:
The given program attempts to determine if an element `x` is a majority element in a sorted array `arr`. The logic implemented in the function `func_1` is straightforward and correct:

1. It uses the `count` method to count the occurrences of `x` in the array `arr`.
2. It checks if this count is greater than `n / 2` (where `n` is the length of the array).
3. It returns `True` if `x` occurs more than `n / 2` times, and `False` otherwise.

However, the program does not take advantage of the fact that the array is sorted. While sorting is not necessary for determining the majority element, the execution summary suggests that an optimization could be applied by terminating early once the required count is exceeded. Despite this potential optimization, the core logic of the program is correct.

Since the problem statement does not require the use of the sorted property of the array and the given implementation correctly implements the required functionality, we can conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
