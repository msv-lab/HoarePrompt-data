Reasoning: 

The original assessment states that the function `func_1` correctly identifies if the given element `x` is a majority element in the sorted array `arr`. While the function does indeed check if `x` appears more than `n/2` times, which is the condition for a majority element, there is a critical flaw in its approach. Specifically, the `.count()` method iterates through the entire array to count the occurrences of `x`, which is unnecessary for a sorted array.

Given that the array is sorted, we can find the first occurrence of `x` and then check if the elements following it form a continuous sequence of `x` that exceeds `n/2` elements. If such a sequence exists, `x` is the majority element. This can be done in O(n) time complexity, but the current implementation has a time complexity of O(n^2) due to the use of `.count()`, which iterates over the array for each call.

However, the original assessment does not mention this inefficiency and assumes the function works correctly based on the problem description. Since the problem description only specifies the need to check the condition and does not explicitly require optimization, the function does meet the basic requirement of determining if `x` is a majority element.

But from a practical and performance standpoint, the function can be significantly optimized, and the current implementation is suboptimal for large arrays.

Final: **True**
