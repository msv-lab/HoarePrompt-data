Reasoning:
The given function `func_1` aims to check if `x` is the majority element in the sorted array `arr`. The function uses the built-in `count` method to count the occurrences of `x` in `arr` and compares this count with `n / 2` to determine if `x` is a majority element.

However, the problem statement mentions that the array is sorted and suggests that there might be an opportunity to optimize the function to terminate early if a different element is found after the count exceeds `n / 2`. The current implementation does not take advantage of this optimization, but the core logic of checking the count remains correct.

Despite the lack of the optimization, the provided function will still correctly identify if `x` is a majority element in the array. Therefore, the function meets the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
