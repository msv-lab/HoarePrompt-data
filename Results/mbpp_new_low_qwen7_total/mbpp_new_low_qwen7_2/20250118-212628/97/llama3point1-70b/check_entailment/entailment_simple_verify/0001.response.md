### Reasoning:

The original assessment claims that the given program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases and that it does not leverage the sorted property of the array. However, let's analyze the code step-by-step and compare it with the problem requirements.

1. **Problem Requirements**: We need to determine if the element `x` appears more than `n/2` times in a sorted array `arr`.
2. **Given Code**: The code counts the occurrences of `x` in the array using `arr.count(x)` and checks if this count is greater than `n/2`.

Let's consider the sorted property:
- In a sorted array, if an element appears more than `n/2` times, it must be the middle element. This is because the majority element, by definition, will occupy more than half of the positions in the array.

Given this insight, the function `func_1` will work correctly under the following conditions:
- The input array `arr` is indeed sorted.
- The function `arr.count(x)` accurately counts the occurrences of `x`.

While the `arr.count(x)` method has a time complexity of O(n), the original assessment suggests that a more efficient solution could use binary search. However, the requirement is to determine if the element is a majority element in a sorted array, and leveraging the sorted property directly confirms the presence of the majority element at the middle index.

The provided code:
```python
count = arr.count(x)
return count > n / 2
```
is correct for the given problem because:
- It counts the occurrences of `x` in the array.
- It checks if this count is greater than `n/2`.

Since the array is sorted, if `x` appears more than `n/2` times, it must be at the middle position, and `arr.count(x)` will correctly identify this.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is overly critical of the code without fully considering the implications of the sorted array. The provided code correctly identifies if `x` is the majority element in a sorted array.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
