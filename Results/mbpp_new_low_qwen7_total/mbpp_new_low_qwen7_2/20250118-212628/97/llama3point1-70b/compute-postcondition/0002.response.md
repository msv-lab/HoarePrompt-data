The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `arr`, `n`, and `x`. 

- `arr` is a sorted list of integers.
- `n` is a positive integer representing the length of `arr`.
- `x` is an integer.

The function returns `True` if `x` appears more than `n/2` times in `arr`, otherwise it returns `False`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a sorted list of integers `arr`, a positive integer `n` representing its length, and an integer `x`, and return `True` if `x` appears more than `n/2` times in `arr`, otherwise it returns `False`.
