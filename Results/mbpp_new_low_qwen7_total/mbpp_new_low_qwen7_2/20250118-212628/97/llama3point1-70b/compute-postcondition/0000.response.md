The code counts the occurrences of the integer `x` in the list `arr`. The variable `count` is assigned the number of times `x` appears in `arr`. The length of `arr` and its sorted nature remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `count`.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is a positive integer representing the length of `arr`, `x` is an integer, `count` is the number of times `x` appears in `arr`.**
