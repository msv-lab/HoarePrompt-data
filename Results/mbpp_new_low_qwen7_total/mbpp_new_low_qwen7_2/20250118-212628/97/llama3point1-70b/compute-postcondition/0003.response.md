Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a sorted list of integers `arr`, a positive integer `n` representing its length, and an integer `x`. It counts the occurrences of `x` in `arr` and checks if this count is greater than `n / 2`. If `x` appears more than `n / 2` times in `arr`, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. This function aims to determine if `x` is a majority element in `arr`. Note that since `arr` is already sorted, the function can terminate early if it finds a different element after finding more than `n / 2` occurrences of `x`, thus potentially reducing unnecessary iterations. However, the current implementation does not include this optimization and simply counts the occurrences.**

**Potential edge cases and missing functionality:**
- The function assumes that `arr` is sorted, but it does not verify this condition. If `arr` is not sorted, the function may produce incorrect results.
- The function does not handle the case where `arr` is empty. In such a case, the function should return `False` because no element can appear more than `n / 2` times in an empty list.
- The function does not check for potential floating-point arithmetic issues when computing `n / 2`. Although in practice this is unlikely to cause problems, it could be mentioned as a consideration.
