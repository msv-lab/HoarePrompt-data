The function `func_1` accepts a sorted list of integers `arr`, a positive integer `n` representing its length, and an integer `x`. It counts the occurrences of `x` in `arr` and checks if this count is greater than `n / 2`. If `x` appears more than `n / 2` times in `arr`, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. This function aims to determine if `x` is a majority element in `arr`. Note that since `arr` is already sorted, the function can terminate early if it finds a different element after finding more than `n / 2` occurrences of `x`, thus potentially reducing unnecessary iterations. However, the current implementation does not include this optimization and simply counts the occurrences.
