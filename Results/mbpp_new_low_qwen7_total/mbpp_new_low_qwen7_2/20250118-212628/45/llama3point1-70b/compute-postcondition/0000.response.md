Initial State: n is a positive integer.
```
```
n = str(n)
undulating = True
```

The first line converts the positive integer `n` to a string and assigns it back to `n`. After this line, `n` is now a string representation of the original integer value.

The second line initializes the variable `undulating` to `True`.

No other variables are affected, and the initial value of `n` (a positive integer) is lost as it is now represented as a string.

Output State: **n is a string, undulating is True**
