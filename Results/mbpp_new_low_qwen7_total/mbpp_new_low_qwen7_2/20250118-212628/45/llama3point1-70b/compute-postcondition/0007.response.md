Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` is a string with at least 3 characters.
- `i` is 1.
- `undulating` is True if the character at index `i-1` in `n` is less than the character at index `i` and the character at index `i` is less than the character at index `i+1` or if the character at index `i-1` is greater than the character at index `i` and the character at index `i` is greater than the character at index `i+1`. Otherwise, `undulating` is False.

### For Loop:
```python
for i in range(1, len(n) - 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`:**
   - The loop starts from `i = 1`.
   - The loop condition is `range(1, len(n) - 1)`, which means `i` should be less than `len(n) - 1`.

2. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.

3. **Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the next iteration, `i` must be incremented by 1 (i.e., `i` becomes 2).
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < len(n) - 1`.

4. **Other Variables:**
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `undulating` remains the same because it is based on the current value of `i`, and we haven't determined its new value yet.

### Adjusting the States:
- Since `i` must be incremented by 1 for the next iteration, `i` will become 2.
- The value of `n` and `undulating` remain unchanged unless the loop body changes them, but since the loop body is omitted, we assume they stay the same.

### Final State:
State: **`n` is a string with at least 3 characters, `i` is 2, and `undulating` is True if the character at index `i-1` in `n` is less than the character at index `i` and the character at index `i` is less than the character at index `i+1` or if the character at index `i-1` is greater than the character at index `i` and the character at index `i` is greater than the character at index `i+1`. Otherwise, `undulating` is False.**

This is the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.
