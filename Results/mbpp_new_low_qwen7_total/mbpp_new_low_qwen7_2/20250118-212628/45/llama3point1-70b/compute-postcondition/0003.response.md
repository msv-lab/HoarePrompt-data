The code `pass` does nothing and simply skips to the next line without performing any operations. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a string with at least 3 characters, `i` is 1, `undulating` is True, and the character at index `i-1` in `n` is less than the character at index `i`, and the character at index `i` is less than the character at index `i+1` or the character at index `i-1` is greater than the character at index `i`, and the character at index `i` is greater than the character at index `i+1`**
