Output State: **n must be a string with at least 3 characters, i is 1, undulating is False**

Explanation:
- Initially, `undulating` is set to `True`.
- The code snippet sets `undulating` to `False`.
- There are no other changes to variables or values.
- The condition `(n[i - 1] >= n[i] or n[i] >= n[i + 1])` is not relevant to the final state since it is not used in the code execution.
- The `break` statement is not applicable here as there is no loop or conditional block it would terminate.

Thus, the only change is that `undulating` is now `False`.
