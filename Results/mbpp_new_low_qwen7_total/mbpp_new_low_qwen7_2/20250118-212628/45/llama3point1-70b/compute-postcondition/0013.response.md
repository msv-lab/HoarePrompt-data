Output State: **n is a string with at least 3 characters, i is 3, undulating is False**

Explanation:
1. The line `undulating = False` sets the boolean variable `undulating` to `False`.
2. The line `break` is used within a loop context (which is not shown here), but since it's the last statement in the given code block, it does not affect the variables outside of the loop scope. It simply exits the loop if it were present, which is not relevant to the final state of the variables.

Given the initial conditions and the code provided, the only change is that `undulating` is explicitly set to `False`. The strings `n` and the integer `i` remain unchanged.
