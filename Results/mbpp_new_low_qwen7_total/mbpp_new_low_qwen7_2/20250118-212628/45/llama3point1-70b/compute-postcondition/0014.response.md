Postcondition: ***`n` is a string with at least 3 characters, `i` is 3, and `undulating` is True if the character at index `i-1` in `n` is less than the character at index `i` and the character at index `i` is less than the character at index `i+1` or if the character at index `i-1` is greater than the character at index `i` and the character at index `i` is greater than the character at index `i+1`. Otherwise, `undulating` is False.***
