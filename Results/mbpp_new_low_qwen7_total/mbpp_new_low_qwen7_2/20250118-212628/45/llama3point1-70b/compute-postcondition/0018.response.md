Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and converts it into a string. It then checks if none of the pairs of consecutive elements in `n` violate the undulating condition (either `n[i-1] < n[i] < n[i+1]` or `n[i-1] > n[i] > n[i+1]`). If no such violations exist, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function handles edge cases such as when `n` is a single digit or has fewer than three digits by setting `undulating` to `False` since these cannot form an undulating sequence.**

**The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the variable `undulating` is either `True` or `False`, indicating whether the input number `n` meets the undulating condition.**
