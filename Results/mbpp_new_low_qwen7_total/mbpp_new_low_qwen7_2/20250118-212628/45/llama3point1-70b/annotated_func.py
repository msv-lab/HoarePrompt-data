    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a string with at least 3 characters, `i` is `len(n) - 2`, and `undulating` is True if none of the pairs of consecutive elements in `n` violate the undulating condition (either `n[i-1] < n[i] < n[i+1]` or `n[i-1] > n[i] > n[i+1]`), otherwise `undulating` is False.
    return undulating
    #`undulating` is True if none of the pairs of consecutive elements in `n` violate the undulating condition (either `n[i-1] < n[i] < n[i+1]` or `n[i-1] > n[i] > n[i+1]`), otherwise `undulating` is False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and converts it into a string. It then checks if none of the pairs of consecutive elements in `n` violate the undulating condition (either `n[i-1] < n[i] < n[i+1]` or `n[i-1] > n[i] > n[i+1]`). If no such violations exist, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function handles edge cases such as when `n` is a single digit or has fewer than three digits by setting `undulating` to `False` since these cannot form an undulating sequence.
