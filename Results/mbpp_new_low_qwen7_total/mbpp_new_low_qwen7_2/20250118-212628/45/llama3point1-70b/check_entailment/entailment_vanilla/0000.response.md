Reasoning:
The provided function `func_1` checks if a given number is undulating. A number is considered undulating if it alternates between increasing and decreasing in its digits. For example, 12321 is an undulating number because it alternates between increasing (1 to 2) and decreasing (2 to 1).

The function works by converting the number to a string and then iterating through the string to check if each digit alternates properly with its neighbors. However, there are two issues with the current implementation:

1. The condition inside the loop only checks if the middle digit is greater than or less than both of its neighbors, but it does not correctly implement the alternating pattern.
2. The function should check if the first digit is less than the second digit and the second digit is greater than the third digit, and so on, or the first digit is greater than the second digit and the second digit is less than the third digit, and so on.

To fix this, we need to ensure that either all adjacent pairs of digits alternate in the same way throughout the entire string. Here's how the corrected version would look:

```python
def is_undulating(n):
    n = str(n)
    if len(n) < 3:
        return False  # A number must have at least 3 digits to be undulating
    
    first_diff = None
    for i in range(1, len(n)):
        if n[i] == n[i - 1]:
            return False  # No consecutive digits can be the same
        
        diff = 1 if n[i] > n[i - 1] else -1
        if first_diff is None:
            first_diff = diff
        elif diff * first_diff < 0:
            return False  # Ensure the pattern alternates consistently
    
    return True
```

Given the original code's logic, it actually doesn't fully implement the alternating pattern check, but rather just checks one pair of conditions at a time without maintaining the overall pattern. Therefore, the original code does not correctly identify undulating numbers.

Correctness: **False**
