Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Write a function to check whether the given number is undulating or not.

# Program:
def func_1(n):
    n = str(n)
    undulating = True
    for i in range(1, len(n) - 1):
        if n[i - 1] < n[i] and n[i] < n[i + 1] or (n[i - 1] > n[i] and n[i] > n[i + 1]):
            pass
        else:
            undulating = False
            break
    return undulating





# Execution Summary:
The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and converts it into a string. It then checks if none of the pairs of consecutive elements in `n` violate the undulating condition (either `n[i-1] < n[i] < n[i+1]` or `n[i-1] > n[i] > n[i+1]`). If no such violations exist, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function handles edge cases such as when `n` is a single digit or has fewer than three digits by setting `undulating` to `False` since these cannot form an undulating sequence.


# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
