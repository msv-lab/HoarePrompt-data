Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly identify all undulating numbers. An undulating number is defined as a number which has the form ABABAB... (where A and B are its digits and A is not equal to B). The current implementation checks only up to the second last digit and does not ensure that the alternating pattern continues throughout the entire number. 

For example, consider the number 1212121. According to the definition, this should be an undulating number because it follows the ABABAB... pattern. However, the current program will fail to detect this pattern correctly. To fix this, we need to check each pair of adjacent digits throughout the entire length of the number.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def is_undulating(n):
    n = str(n)
    if len(n) < 3 or n[0] == n[1]:  # Early return for edge cases
        return False
    for i in range(2, len(n)):
        if (i % 2 == 0 and n[i] == n[i-2]) or (i % 2 != 0 and n[i] == n[i-2]):
            continue
        else:
            return False
    return True
```

This corrected function ensures that the alternating pattern holds true for every pair of adjacent digits in the number.
