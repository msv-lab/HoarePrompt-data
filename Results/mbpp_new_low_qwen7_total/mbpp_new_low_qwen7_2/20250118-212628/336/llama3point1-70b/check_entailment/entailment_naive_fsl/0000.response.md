Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` checks whether every odd index contains an odd number in the given list. The program iterates through the list and checks if the element at each odd index is even. If it finds an even number at an odd index, it immediately returns `False`. If it completes the loop without finding any such case, it returns `True`.

The logic in the program seems correct. It correctly identifies if any odd index contains an even number, which would make the function return `False`. If no such case is found, it correctly returns `True`.

Given the problem description and the logic implemented, the program works as expected for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
