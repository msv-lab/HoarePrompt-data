Reasoning: 
The provided program checks whether every odd index in the given list `lst` contains an odd number. Let's analyze the logic:

1. The function iterates over each index `i` in the list using a `for` loop.
2. For each index `i`, it checks two conditions:
   - If the index `i` is odd (`i % 2 != 0`).
   - If the value at that index `lst[i]` is even (`lst[i] % 2 == 0`).

3. If both conditions are true for any index, the function immediately returns `False`, indicating that not all odd indices contain odd numbers.
4. If the loop completes without finding any index that violates the condition, the function returns `True`, indicating that all odd indices contain odd numbers.

This logic correctly implements the requirement. If any odd-indexed element is even, the function will return `False`. If all odd-indexed elements are odd, the function will return `True`.

Given this analysis, the program is logically correct based on the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
