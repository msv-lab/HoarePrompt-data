Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to verify whether every odd index in a given list contains an odd number.
2. **Program Code**: The function `func_1` iterates through the list using a `for` loop. For each index `i`, it checks if `i` is odd (`i % 2 != 0`) and if the element at that index is even (`lst[i] % 2 == 0`). If it finds an even number at an odd index, it returns `False`. If it completes the loop without finding any even number at an odd index, it returns `True`.
3. **Function Summary**: The summary accurately describes the function's behavior, stating that it returns `True` only if every odd index contains an odd number, and returns `False` otherwise.

Given this, the program indeed checks the condition specified in the problem description. The logic in the program correctly implements the requirement to ensure that all elements at odd indices are odd. The function iterates through the list, and if it finds an even number at any odd index, it immediately returns `False`. If it completes the iteration without finding any such cases, it returns `True`.

The original assessment is correct because the program correctly implements the required logic to determine if every odd index contains an odd number.

Final: **True**
