You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Write a python function to check whether every odd index contains odd numbers of a given list.

- Program:
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
    return True



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns `True` if for every odd index `i`, the element at that index is also odd. Otherwise, it returns `False`. The function iterates through the list, checking if the element at each odd index is even. If it finds such an element, it immediately returns `False`. If it completes the iteration without finding any such elements, it returns `True`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` checks whether every odd index contains an odd number in the given list. The program iterates through the list and checks if the element at each odd index is even. If it finds an even number at an odd index, it immediately returns `False`. If it completes the loop without finding any such case, it returns `True`.

The logic in the program seems correct. It correctly identifies if any odd index contains an even number, which would make the function return `False`. If no such case is found, it correctly returns `True`.

Given the problem description and the logic implemented, the program works as expected for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
