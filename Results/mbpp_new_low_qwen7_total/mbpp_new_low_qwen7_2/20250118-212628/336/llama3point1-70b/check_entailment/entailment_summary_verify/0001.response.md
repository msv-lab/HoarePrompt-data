Reasoning: 

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the function and its logic based on the provided problem description and function summary.

1. **Function Description**: The function `func_1` checks if every odd index in the list contains an odd number. It returns `True` only if all odd indices have odd numbers; otherwise, it returns `False`.

2. **Function Logic**:
   - The function uses a `for` loop to iterate through the list with index `i`.
   - For each index `i`, it checks two conditions:
     - Whether the index `i` is odd (`i % 2 != 0`).
     - Whether the value at that index `lst[i]` is even (`lst[i] % 2 == 0`).
   
3. **Behavior Analysis**:
   - If the index `i` is odd and the value at that index is even, the function immediately returns `False`, indicating that not all odd indices contain odd numbers.
   - If the function does not find any such case during the entire iteration, it returns `True`, indicating that all odd indices contain odd numbers.

Given the problem description and the provided function summary, the logic implemented in the function matches the requirement perfectly. The function correctly identifies when any odd-indexed element is even and immediately returns `False`. If no such case is found, it correctly returns `True`.

The original assessment accurately describes the function's behavior and confirms its correctness.

Final: **True**
