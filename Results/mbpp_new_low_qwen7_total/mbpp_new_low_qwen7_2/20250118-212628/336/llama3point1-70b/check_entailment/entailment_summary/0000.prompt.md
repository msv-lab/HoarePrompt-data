Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Write a python function to check whether every odd index contains odd numbers of a given list.

# Program:
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
    return True





# Execution Summary:
The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns `True` if for every odd index `i`, the element at that index is also odd. Otherwise, it returns `False`. The function iterates through the list, checking if the element at each odd index is even. If it finds such an element, it immediately returns `False`. If it completes the iteration without finding any such elements, it returns `True`.


# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
