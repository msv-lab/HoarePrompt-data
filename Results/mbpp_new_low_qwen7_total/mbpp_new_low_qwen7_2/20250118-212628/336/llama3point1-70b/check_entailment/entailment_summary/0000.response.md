Reasoning: 
The provided program does not correctly check whether every odd index contains an odd number. Instead, it checks whether every odd index contains an even number. This is evident from the condition in the if statement: `if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0`. 

To properly check if every odd index contains an odd number, the condition should be:

- Check if the index `i` is odd (`i % 2 != 0`).
- Then check if the number at that index is odd (`lst[i] % 2 != 0`).

The current condition will only return `False` if it encounters an even number at an odd index, which is not what the problem requires. Therefore, the program needs to be corrected to ensure it checks for odd numbers at odd indices.

Correctness: **False**
