Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Write a python function to check whether every odd index contains odd numbers of a given list.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: lst is a list of integers, the length of lst is unchanged, and the function returns True if no index i satisfies the condition i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0, otherwise it returns False.
    return True
    #The program returns True


# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
