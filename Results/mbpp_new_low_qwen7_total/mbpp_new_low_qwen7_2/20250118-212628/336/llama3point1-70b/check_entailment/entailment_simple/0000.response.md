Reasoning:

The given function `func_1` aims to check whether every odd index in the list `lst` contains an odd number. Let's break down the function step-by-step:

1. The function iterates over each index `i` in the list using a `for` loop.
2. For each index `i`, it checks if `i` is an odd index (i.e., `i % 2 != 0`).
3. If the current index `i` is odd and the value at that index `lst[i]` is even (`lst[i] % 2 == 0`), the function immediately returns `False`.
4. If the loop completes without finding any such index where the conditions `i % 2 != 0` and `lst[i] % 2 == 0` are both true, the function returns `True`.

This logic ensures that if any odd index contains an even number, the function will return `False`. Otherwise, it will return `True`. The provided annotation also correctly describes the state of the program before and after the function call, stating that the function returns `True` only if no index `i` satisfies the condition `i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0`.

Given the problem description and the provided code, the function appears to be logically sound and should behave as intended.

Correctness: **True**
