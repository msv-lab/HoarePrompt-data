You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Write a python function to check whether every odd index contains odd numbers of a given list.

- Program: 
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
    return True



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: lst is a list of integers, the length of lst is unchanged, and the function returns True if no index i satisfies the condition i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0, otherwise it returns False.
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns `True` if for every odd index `i`, the element at that index is also odd. Otherwise, it returns `False`. The function iterates through the list, checking if the element at each odd index is even. If it finds such an element, it immediately returns `False`. If it completes the iteration without finding any such elements, it returns `True`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` checks whether every odd index contains an odd number in the given list. The program iterates through the list and checks if the element at each odd index is even. If it finds an even number at an odd index, it immediately returns `False`. If it completes the loop without finding any such case, it returns `True`.

The logic in the program seems correct. It correctly identifies if any odd index contains an even number, which would make the function return `False`. If no such case is found, it correctly returns `True`.

Given the problem description and the logic implemented, the program works as expected for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
