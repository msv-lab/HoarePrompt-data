Reasoning: 
The original assessment accurately describes the logic of the program. However, let's break down the program and the annotated version step-by-step to ensure the reasoning holds.

1. **Function Definition and Loop Initialization**: 
   - The function `func_1` iterates through each index `i` in the list `lst` using a `for` loop.

2. **Condition Check**:
   - Inside the loop, it checks two conditions for each index `i`:
     - `i % 2 != 0`: This checks if the index `i` is odd.
     - `lst[i] % 2 == 0`: This checks if the value at index `i` is even.
   - If both conditions are true, the function immediately returns `False`, indicating that the current odd-indexed element is even.

3. **Loop Completion**:
   - If the loop completes without finding any index `i` where `i % 2 != 0` and `lst[i] % 2 == 0` are both true, the function returns `True`, indicating that all odd-indexed elements are odd.

The annotated version correctly captures these points and explains the behavior of the function. The program does indeed check whether every odd index contains an odd number as per the problem description. The original assessment correctly identifies that the logic implemented in the function matches the requirement.

Given this detailed analysis, the program is logically correct based on the problem statement.

Final: **True**
