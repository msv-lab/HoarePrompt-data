Reasoning: 

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step using the provided annotations:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a function that checks if every odd index in a given list contains an odd number.

2. **Program Code**:
   ```python
   def func_1(lst):
       for i in range(len(lst)):
           if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
               return False
       return True
   ```

3. **Annotated Code**:
   - Before entering the function, `lst` is a list of integers.
   - Inside the for loop, the program checks if the current index `i` is odd (i.e., `i % 2 != 0`) and if the element at that index is even (i.e., `lst[i] % 2 == 0`). If both conditions are met, the function returns `False`.
   - After the for loop, if the loop completes without returning `False`, the function returns `True`.

4. **Original Assessment**:
   - The original assessment states that the program works as expected and correctly identifies if any odd index contains an even number, leading to an immediate return of `False`. If no such case is found, it correctly returns `True`.

5. **Evaluation Based on Annotations**:
   - The annotations confirm that the function correctly iterates over the list and checks the conditions for odd indices.
   - The logic within the loop ensures that if an even number is found at an odd index, the function will return `False` immediately.
   - If the loop completes without finding any even numbers at odd indices, the function correctly returns `True`.

Based on the above analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to verify that every odd index contains an odd number.

Final: **True**
