### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct. Let's analyze the program step-by-step using the provided annotations:

1. **Function Definition and Loop Initialization:**
   - The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` as input.
   - A `for` loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = len(lst) - 1`.

2. **Condition Check:**
   - Inside the loop, the condition `if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:` is evaluated.
     - `i % 2 != 0` checks if the index `i` is odd.
     - `lst[i] % 2 == 0` checks if the element at the current index is even.
   - If both conditions are true (i.e., the index is odd and the element is even), the function immediately returns `False`.
   - If the loop completes without encountering such a case, the function returns `True`.

3. **Annotations Analysis:**
   - The annotation states that if the loop completes without returning `False`, the function returns `True`. This aligns with the logic of the program: if no even number is found at an odd index, the function correctly returns `True`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases properly:
     - An empty list will not trigger the loop, so the function implicitly returns `True` (since there are no odd indices to check).
     - Lists with only one element (which is an odd index in this context) will also be checked correctly.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It checks each odd index to ensure that the element at that index is odd, and returns `False` if any even number is found at an odd index.
   - The annotations support the correctness of the program's behavior.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate, and the program correctly checks whether every odd index contains an odd number in the given list.
