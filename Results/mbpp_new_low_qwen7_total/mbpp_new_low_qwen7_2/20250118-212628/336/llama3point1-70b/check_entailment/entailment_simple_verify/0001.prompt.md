You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Write a python function to check whether every odd index contains odd numbers of a given list.

- Program: 
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
    return True



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: lst is a list of integers, the length of lst is unchanged, and the function returns True if no index i satisfies the condition i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0, otherwise it returns False.
    return True
    #The program returns True



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning: 
The provided program checks whether every odd index in the given list `lst` contains an odd number. Let's analyze the logic:

1. The function iterates over each index `i` in the list using a `for` loop.
2. For each index `i`, it checks two conditions:
   - If the index `i` is odd (`i % 2 != 0`).
   - If the value at that index `lst[i]` is even (`lst[i] % 2 == 0`).

3. If both conditions are true for any index, the function immediately returns `False`, indicating that not all odd indices contain odd numbers.
4. If the loop completes without finding any index that violates the condition, the function returns `True`, indicating that all odd indices contain odd numbers.

This logic correctly implements the requirement. If any odd-indexed element is even, the function will return `False`. If all odd-indexed elements are odd, the function will return `True`.

Given this analysis, the program is logically correct based on the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
