Reasoning: 
Let's review the original assessment step-by-step using the annotated code.

1. The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` as input.
2. It iterates over each index `i` in the list using a `for` loop.
3. For each index `i`, it checks two conditions:
   - If the index `i` is odd (`i % 2 != 0`).
   - If the value at that index `lst[i]` is even (`lst[i] % 2 == 0`).
4. If both conditions are true for any index, the function immediately returns `False`, indicating that not all odd indices contain odd numbers.
5. If the loop completes without finding any index that violates the condition, the function returns `True`, indicating that all odd indices contain odd numbers.

However, upon closer inspection of the logic:
- The condition `i % 2 != 0` checks if the index is odd, which is correct.
- The condition `lst[i] % 2 == 0` checks if the value at that index is even, which is the opposite of what the problem description requires (odd numbers at odd indices).

The annotated code confirms that the function will return `True` only if no odd-indexed element is even, which is incorrect according to the problem statement. The function should return `False` if any odd-indexed element is even, and `True` only if all odd-indexed elements are odd.

Given this analysis, the program does not meet the requirement of checking whether every odd index contains an odd number.

Final: **False**
