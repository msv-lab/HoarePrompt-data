The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`. `lst` is a list of integers. The function has multiple return points, but regardless of the cases, it only returns `False` in three of them and `True` in one. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `lst` of integers and return `True` under specific conditions, while returning `False` in other scenarios. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter lst (a list of integers) and returns `True` under specific conditions, while returning `False` in other scenarios.**
