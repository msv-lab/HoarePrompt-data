Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns `True` if for every odd index `i`, the element at that index is also odd. Otherwise, it returns `False`. The function iterates through the list, checking if the element at each odd index is even. If it finds such an element, it immediately returns `False`. If it completes the iteration without finding any such elements, it returns `True`.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If the list is empty, the function will not execute the loop and will implicitly return `True` since there are no odd indices to check.
- If the list contains only one element, the function will return `True` because there are no odd indices to check.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The provided annotations and return postconditions do not cover the case where the list is empty. Although the function will implicitly return `True` in this scenario, it is not explicitly stated in the annotations.
