To determine the state of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's break down the given information and the loop itself.

### Given Information:
- The state before the loop starts: `lst` is a list of integers.
- The for loop statement: 
  ```python
  for i in range(len(lst)):
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables and Conditions:**
   - The loop variable is `i`, which is generated by the `range(len(lst))`.
   - The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(lst)`.

2. **Determine the Initial Condition for the Loop to Execute:**
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be in the range from `0` to `len(lst) - 1`.
   - Specifically, for the first iteration of the loop, `i` should be `0`.

3. **List Length Check:**
   - Since the loop generates `i` from `0` to `len(lst) - 1`, the list `lst` must contain at least one element (i.e., `len(lst) > 0`).

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute the first time, the following conditions must hold true:
- The list `lst` must have at least one element (i.e., `len(lst) > 0`).
- The index `i` must be `0`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`lst` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `i` is 0**
