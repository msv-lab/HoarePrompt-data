Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `lst`.

2. **Understand the postcondition at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `lst` is a list of integers with at least one element.
   - `i` is 0.
   - Either `i` is even or the element at index `i` in `lst` is odd.

3. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `len(lst)`.
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, the next value of `i` will be 1.

4. **Check the postcondition for the next iteration**:
   - For `i` to be 1, the loop must continue if `lst` still has at least one element and either `i` is even (which it won't be since it will be 1) or the element at index `i` (which is now index 1) is odd.
   - Therefore, `lst` must have at least one element, and the element at index 1 in `lst` must be odd.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` will be 1.
   - The element at index 1 in `lst` must be odd.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`lst` is a list of integers with at least one element, `i` is 1, and the element at index 1 in `lst` is odd**.
