Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The variables in the loop head are `i` and `lst`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than the length of `lst`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**: 
   - `lst` is a list of integers with at least one element.
   - `i` is 1.

4. **Condition Analysis**: 
   - Since `i` starts at 1, the condition `i < len(lst)` will be true if the length of `lst` is greater than 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` (which is currently 1) needs to be incremented by 1 in the next iteration.

5. **Adjust the State**: 
   - `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - The length of `lst` remains the same since it does not change within the loop body (the problem does not specify any modifications to `lst`).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `lst` is a list of integers with at least one element.
- `i` is 2.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`lst` is a list of integers with at least one element, `i` is 2**
