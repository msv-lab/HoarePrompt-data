Postcondition: ***`lst` is a list of integers with at least one element, `i` is 2. If `i % 2 != 0` and `lst[i] % 2 == 0`, the function returns False. Otherwise, the function returns True (since the else part does not specify a return value, we assume it continues with the original logic which would be True).***
