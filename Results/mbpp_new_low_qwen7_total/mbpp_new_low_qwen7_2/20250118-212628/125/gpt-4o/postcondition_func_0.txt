The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`. It returns a list of `n` sublists, where each sublist contains elements from `lst` starting from an index `j` (with `j` ranging from 0 to `n-1`) and stepping by `n`. Specifically, `result[j]` contains elements from `lst` starting from index `j` and then every `n`th element thereafter until the end of the list is reached. If the length of `lst` is not a multiple of `n`, the last sublist may contain fewer than `n` elements.
