### Reasoning:

Let's revisit the given problem and the annotated code to evaluate the original assessment.

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a function that takes a list and an integer `n` and splits the list into sublists at every `nth` element.

2. **Program Code**: The provided code does not actually split the list at every `nth` element as described in the problem. Instead, it groups elements based on their index modulo `n`.

   - The `result` list is initialized with `n` empty sublists.
   - The `for` loop iterates over the elements of the input list `lst` using `enumerate`.
   - Each element is appended to the sublist in `result` at the position determined by `i % n`. This means that elements are grouped in a circular manner rather than splitting at every `nth` element.

3. **Annotated Code Explanation**:
   - The comment "each `result[j]` (where `j` ranges from 0 to `n-1`) contains elements from `lst` starting from `j` and stepping by `n`" is incorrect because the elements are not stepped by `n` but rather grouped in a circular manner.

4. **Assertions**:
   - The provided assertions are misleading because they do not accurately reflect the behavior of the function. For example:
     - `func_1(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n'], 3)` results in [['a', 'd', 'g', 'j', 'm'], ['b', 'e', 'h', 'k', 'n'], ['c', 'f', 'i', 'l']] which looks like grouping, but it is not splitting.
     - Similarly, the other assertions also group elements instead of splitting them.

Given these observations, the function does not correctly implement the intended behavior of splitting the list at every `nth` element.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The original assessment incorrectly concluded that the function is correct. The actual behavior of the function is to group elements in a circular manner rather than splitting the list at every `nth` element.
