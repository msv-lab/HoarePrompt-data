Reasoning:

The given program is intended to split a list into sublists where each sublist contains elements at intervals of `n`. The provided code uses the modulo operation (`i % n`) to determine which sublist each element should be added to. This approach ensures that the elements are distributed across `n` sublists, with each sublist containing elements at intervals of `n`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initialization**: The variable `result` is initialized as a list of empty lists, each corresponding to one of the `n` sublists.

2. **Iteration**: The `for` loop iterates over each element in the input list `lst` using `enumerate` to get both the index `i` and the element itself.

3. **Appending Elements**: The element is appended to the sublist at position `i % n`. This means:
   - For `n = 3`, elements will be placed in the order: `0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> ...`
   - For `n = 2`, elements will be placed in the order: `0 -> 1 -> 0 -> 1 -> ...`

4. **Result**: After the loop, `result` contains the sublists as required.

Given the provided test cases, the implementation correctly splits the list into sublists based on the specified interval `n`. Therefore, the program is functioning as intended.

Correctness: **True**
