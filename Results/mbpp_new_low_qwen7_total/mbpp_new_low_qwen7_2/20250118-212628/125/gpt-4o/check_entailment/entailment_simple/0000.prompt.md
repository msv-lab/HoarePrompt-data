Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Write a function that takes in a list and an integer n and splits a list for every nth element, returning a list of the resulting lists.

# Annotated Program:
assert func_1(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n'], 3) == [['a', 'd', 'g', 'j', 'm'], ['b', 'e', 'h', 'k', 'n'], ['c', 'f', 'i', 'l']]
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 3) == [[1, 4, 7, 10, 13], [2, 5, 8, 11, 14], [3, 6, 9, 12]]
assert func_1(['python', 'java', 'C', 'C++', 'DBMS', 'SQL'], 2) == [['python', 'C', 'DBMS'], ['java', 'C++', 'SQL']]

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of any type, and n is a positive integer such that n > 0.
def func_1(lst, n):
    result = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for (i, element) in enumerate(lst):
        result[i % n].append(element)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is equal to the length of `lst`; each `result[j]` (where `j` ranges from 0 to `n-1`) contains elements from `lst` starting from `j` and stepping by `n`.
    return result
    #`result` is a list of sublists from `lst`, where `result[j]` contains elements from `lst` starting from index `j` and stepping by `i`


# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
