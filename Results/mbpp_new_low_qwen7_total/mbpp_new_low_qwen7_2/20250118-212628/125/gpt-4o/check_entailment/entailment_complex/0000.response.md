Reasoning:

The annotated program describes a function `func_1` that aims to split the input list `lst` into `n` sublists, with each sublist containing every `n`th element starting from different indices. However, the current implementation of the function does not achieve this goal correctly. Instead, the code places each element into a sublist based on its index modulo `n`, which means the sublists will not contain every `n`th element but rather a cyclic distribution of the elements.

Let's analyze the given assertions to understand the intended behavior:

1. `func_1(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n'], 3)` should produce `[['a', 'd', 'g', 'j', 'm'], ['b', 'e', 'h', 'k', 'n'], ['c', 'f', 'i', 'l']]`. This indicates that the first sublist contains every 3rd element starting from index 0, the second sublist from index 1, and so on.
2. `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 3)` should produce `[[1, 4, 7, 10, 13], [2, 5, 8, 11, 14], [3, 6, 9, 12]]`. This further confirms that the sublists are formed by taking every 3rd element starting from their respective starting indices.
3. `func_1(['python', 'java', 'C', 'C++', 'DBMS', 'SQL'], 2)` should produce `[['python', 'C', 'DBMS'], ['java', 'C++', 'SQL']]`. This indicates that the sublists are formed by taking every 2nd element starting from their respective starting indices.

Given these requirements, the correct approach would be to create `n` sublists and place elements in them by iterating through the original list and using the index to determine which sublist the current element belongs to. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(lst, n):
    result = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for i, element in enumerate(lst):
        result[i % n].append(element)
    return result
```

However, based on the problem statement and the expected behavior, the function should actually place elements in sublists based on their position in a stepped manner, not just by their index modulo `n`.

A corrected implementation would be:

```python
def func_1(lst, n):
    result = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for i, element in enumerate(lst):
        result[i // n].append(element)
    return result
```

This corrected function will ensure that each sublist contains every `n`th element starting from the appropriate index.

Since the given function does not match the expected behavior as described in the problem statement, the initial function provided is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
