Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly splits the input list into sublists every nth element. The examples given cover various scenarios, including different list lengths and values, and different values of n. The function uses the modulus operator `%` to distribute elements across the resulting sublists, ensuring that each element is placed in the correct sublist based on its index. Given the examples and the logic of the function, it appears to handle all cases as described in the problem statement without any issues. Therefore, the program is correct.
