Reasoning:
Let's re-evaluate the function step-by-step based on the provided annotated code and assertions.

1. **Function Initialization**:
   - The function initializes `result` as a list of `n` empty lists. This means there will be `n` sublists in the final result.

2. **Loop Over Elements**:
   - The function uses `enumerate(lst)` to iterate over each element in `lst` along with its index `i`.
   - For each element, it appends the element to the sublist in `result` at the position determined by `i % n`.

3. **Result Analysis**:
   - After the loop, each `result[j]` will contain elements from `lst` starting from index `j` and stepping by `n`.

Now, let's check the assertions with this understanding:

- **Assertion 1**: `func_1(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n'], 3)`
  - Expected output: [['a', 'd', 'g', 'j', 'm'], ['b', 'e', 'h', 'k', 'n'], ['c', 'f', 'i', 'l']]
  - Explanation: The first sublist starts at index 0 and steps by 3, the second sublist starts at index 1 and steps by 3, and the third sublist starts at index 2 and steps by 3.
  - Actual output matches the expected output.

- **Assertion 2**: `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 3)`
  - Expected output: [[1, 4, 7, 10, 13], [2, 5, 8, 11, 14], [3, 6, 9, 12]]
  - Explanation: Similar to the previous example, the function correctly splits the list into sublists starting at indices 0, 1, and 2, respectively.
  - Actual output matches the expected output.

- **Assertion 3**: `func_1(['python', 'java', 'C', 'C++', 'DBMS', 'SQL'], 2)`
  - Expected output: [['python', 'C', 'DBMS'], ['java', 'C++', 'SQL']]
  - Explanation: The function correctly groups the elements as described, starting at indices 0 and 1.
  - Actual output matches the expected output.

Based on the provided annotations and the verification of the assertions, the function indeed splits the list into sublists at every nth element as required. The function's logic and the results of the assertions align perfectly.

Final: **True**
