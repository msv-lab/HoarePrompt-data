Reasoning:
The provided function `func_1` aims to split the input list into sublists, where each sublist contains elements from the original list at intervals of `n`. However, the current implementation of the function does not achieve this goal correctly. Instead, it distributes elements across sublists based on their index modulo `n`, which does not align with the desired behavior of splitting the list every nth element.

For example, according to the problem statement, the expected behavior should be to split the list into `n` sublists such that the first sublist contains the 1st, 4th, 7th, etc., elements, the second sublist contains the 2nd, 5th, 8th, etc., elements, and so on.

However, the current implementation uses `i % n` to determine which sublist to append the current element to, which means the first sublist will contain elements at indices 0, 1, 2, etc., the second sublist will contain elements at indices 1, 2, 3, etc., and so forth. This results in a different distribution of elements than what is required.

Given this analysis, the provided implementation does not match the intended behavior as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
