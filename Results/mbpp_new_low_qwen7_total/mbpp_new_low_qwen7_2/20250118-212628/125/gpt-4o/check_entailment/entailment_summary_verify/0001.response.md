### Reasoning:

Let's carefully review the problem description and the function's behavior using the provided assertions and the function summary.

#### Problem Description:
The function `func_1` should take a list and an integer `n` and split the list into sublists such that every nth element forms a new sublist. The first sublist starts with the 0th element, the second sublist starts with the 1st element, and so on.

#### Function Summary:
- The function `func_1` creates a list of `n` empty sublists.
- It iterates through each element in the input list using `enumerate` to get both the index `i` and the element.
- Each element is appended to the sublist in `result` at the position determined by `i % n`.
- The function returns the list of sublists.

#### Provided Assertions:
1. `func_1(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n'], 3)` should produce `[['a', 'd', 'g', 'j', 'm'], ['b', 'e', 'h', 'k', 'n'], ['c', 'f', 'i', 'l']]`.
2. `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 3)` should produce `[[1, 4, 7, 10, 13], [2, 5, 8, 11, 14], [3, 6, 9, 12]]`.
3. `func_1(['python', 'java', 'C', 'C++', 'DBMS', 'SQL'], 2)` should produce `[['python', 'C', 'DBMS'], ['java', 'C++', 'SQL']]`.

#### Analysis:
- The function indeed uses `i % n` to determine which sublist to append the current element to. This is consistent with the function summary.
- However, the provided assertions suggest that the function is grouping elements in a different way than intended by the problem description. Instead of splitting the list every nth element, the function is grouping elements in a circular manner based on their indices modulo `n`.

For example, in the first assertion:
- `['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n']` is grouped as:
  - `['a', 'd', 'g', 'j', 'm']`
  - `['b', 'e', 'h', 'k', 'n']`
  - `['c', 'f', 'i', 'l']`

This grouping is not splitting the list every nth element but rather distributing the elements across `n` sublists based on their indices modulo `n`.

Given the function summary and the provided assertions, the function does not achieve the desired behavior of splitting the list every nth element. Therefore, the original assessment is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The function `func_1` does not correctly implement the problem description. It distributes elements across sublists in a circular manner based on their indices modulo `n`, rather than splitting the list every nth element.
