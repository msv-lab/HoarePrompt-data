### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identified the function's purpose and behavior. However, let's systematically verify the function using the provided function summary and additional reasoning:

1. **Function Summary Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` indeed splits the list into `n` sublists.
   - Each element from the input list `lst` is placed into one of the `n` sublists based on its index `i % n`.
   - This means that the first `n` elements will be distributed among the `n` sublists, and the next `n` elements will follow this pattern.

2. **Examples Verification**:
   - For `func_1(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n'], 3)`:
     - Index 0: ['a', 'd', 'g', 'j', 'm']
     - Index 1: ['b', 'e', 'h', 'k', 'n']
     - Index 2: ['c', 'f', 'i', 'l']
   - For `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 3)`:
     - Index 0: [1, 4, 7, 10, 13]
     - Index 1: [2, 5, 8, 11, 14]
     - Index 2: [3, 6, 9, 12]
   - For `func_1(['python', 'java', 'C', 'C++', 'DBMS', 'SQL'], 2)`:
     - Index 0: ['python', 'C', 'DBMS']
     - Index 1: ['java', 'C++', 'SQL']

These examples confirm that the function is correctly distributing the elements according to the given rules. 

3. **Edge Cases Consideration**:
   - If the length of `lst` is not a multiple of `n`, the last sublist may indeed contain fewer than `n` elements. This is handled correctly by the current implementation since the distribution is based on the modulus operation.

Given the examples and the detailed analysis, the function `func_1` behaves as expected and matches the provided function summary.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The given program is correct based on the provided problem description and the function summary.
