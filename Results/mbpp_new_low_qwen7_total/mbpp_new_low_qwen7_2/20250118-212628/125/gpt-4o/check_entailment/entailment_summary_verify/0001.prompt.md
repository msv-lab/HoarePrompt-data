You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Write a function that takes in a list and an integer n and splits a list for every nth element, returning a list of the resulting lists.

- Program:
assert func_1(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n'], 3) == [['a', 'd', 'g', 'j', 'm'], ['b', 'e', 'h', 'k', 'n'], ['c', 'f', 'i', 'l']]
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 3) == [[1, 4, 7, 10, 13], [2, 5, 8, 11, 14], [3, 6, 9, 12]]
assert func_1(['python', 'java', 'C', 'C++', 'DBMS', 'SQL'], 2) == [['python', 'C', 'DBMS'], ['java', 'C++', 'SQL']]

def func_1(lst, n):
    result = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for (i, element) in enumerate(lst):
        result[i % n].append(element)
    return result



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`. It returns a list of `n` sublists, where each sublist contains elements from `lst` starting from an index `j` (with `j` ranging from 0 to `n-1`) and stepping by `n`. Specifically, `result[j]` contains elements from `lst` starting from index `j` and then every `n`th element thereafter until the end of the list is reached. If the length of `lst` is not a multiple of `n`, the last sublist may contain fewer than `n` elements.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
The given function `func_1` aims to split the input list into sublists at every nth element. Let's analyze the logic:

1. The function initializes a list of empty lists (`result`) with length `n`.
2. It iterates over each element in the input list `lst` using `enumerate` to get both the index `i` and the element.
3. For each element, it appends the element to the sublist in `result` at the position determined by `i % n`.
4. Finally, it returns the list of sublists.

Given the provided assertions, let's verify the function:

- For `func_1(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n'], 3)`, the output should be [['a', 'd', 'g', 'j', 'm'], ['b', 'e', 'h', 'k', 'n'], ['c', 'f', 'i', 'l']]. The function correctly groups elements as expected.
- For `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 3)`, the output should be [[1, 4, 7, 10, 13], [2, 5, 8, 11, 14], [3, 6, 9, 12]]. Again, the function works as intended.
- For `func_1(['python', 'java', 'C', 'C++', 'DBMS', 'SQL'], 2)`, the output should be [['python', 'C', 'DBMS'], ['java', 'C++', 'SQL']]. The function also handles this case correctly.

Since the function produces the correct outputs for the given assertions, the implementation appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
