Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop is defined as `for (i, element) in enumerate(lst):`. This means that `i` and `element` are the variables being updated in each iteration.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `element` is the second element of `lst`
   - `result[1]` contains the second element of `lst`
   - `result[2]` contains the second element of `lst` and the `element`

3. **Determine the next values**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration of `enumerate`, the next value of `i` will be 3.
   - The `element` in the next iteration will be the third element of `lst`.

4. **Update the result list**:
   - `result[1]` should still contain the second element of `lst` (since it hasn't changed yet).
   - `result[2]` should now contain the second element of `lst` and the new `element` (which is the third element of `lst`).

So, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `i` is 3
- `element` is the third element of `lst`
- `result[1]` contains the second element of `lst`
- `result[2]` contains the second element of `lst` and the third element of `lst`

Therefore, the final state is:

State: **`i` is 3, `element` is the third element of `lst`, `result[1]` contains the second element of `lst`, `result[2]` contains the second element of `lst` and the third element of `lst`**
