The code initializes `result` as a list of `n` empty lists. This means that each element in `result` is an empty list. The value of `lst` and `n` remain unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of any type, and n is a positive integer such that n > 0; `result` is a list of `n` empty lists**
