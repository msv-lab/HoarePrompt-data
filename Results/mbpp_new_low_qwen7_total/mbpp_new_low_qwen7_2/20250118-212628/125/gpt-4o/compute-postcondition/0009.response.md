The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst`, which is a list of any type, and `n`, which is a positive integer such that `n > 0`. The function returns a list of sublists from `lst`, where each sublist `result[j]` contains elements from `lst` starting from index `j` and stepping by `i`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, and returns a list of sublists from `lst`, where each sublist starts from an index `j` and steps by `i`.**
