`i` is incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1. The `result` list is accessed using `i % n` (which is `1 % n`), and the `element` is appended to this sublist. The initial state also tells us that `lst` must have at least one element, and `element` is the first element of `lst`. However, the exact structure of `result` and the value of `n` are not specified, so we can only say that `result[1 % n]` (which simplifies to `result[1]` if `n > 1`) receives the `element`.

Output State: **`i` is 1; `element` is the first element of `lst`; `result[1 % n]` (or `result[1]` if `n > 1`) contains `element`.**
