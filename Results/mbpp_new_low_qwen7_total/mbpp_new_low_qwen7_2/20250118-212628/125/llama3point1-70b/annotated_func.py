#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list, and n is a positive integer such that 0 < n <= len(lst).
def func_1(lst, n):
    return [lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]
    #The program returns a list of sublists, where each sublist is created by slicing `lst` starting from index `i` to the end of the list, with a step of `n`. The first sublist starts at index 0, the second at index 1, and so on, up to the nth-1 index.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`. It returns a list of sublists, where each sublist is created by slicing `lst` starting from index `i` to the end of the list, with a step of `n`, for \(i\) ranging from 0 to \(n-1\). The function handles the case when `n` is equal to 1, which would result in a list containing the original `lst` as the only sublist. If `n` is greater than the length of `lst`, the function will still attempt to create slices according to the given step size, though some slices might be empty due to the range exceeding the list length.
