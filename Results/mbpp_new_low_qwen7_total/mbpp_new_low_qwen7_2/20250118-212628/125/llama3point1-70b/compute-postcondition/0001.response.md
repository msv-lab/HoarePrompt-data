The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst`, which is a list, and `n`, which is a positive integer such that \(0 < n \leq \text{len}(lst)\). The function returns a list of sublists, where each sublist is created by slicing `lst` starting from index `i` to the end of the list, with a step of `n`. The first sublist starts at index 0, the second at index 1, and so on, up to the \(n-1\) index.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`. It returns a list of sublists, where each sublist is a slice of `lst` starting from index `i` to the end of the list, with a step of `n`, for \(i\) ranging from 0 to \(n-1\).**
