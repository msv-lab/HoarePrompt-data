Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`. It returns a list of sublists, where each sublist is created by slicing `lst` starting from index `i` to the end of the list, with a step of `n`, for \(i\) ranging from 0 to \(n-1\). The function handles the case when `n` is equal to 1, which would result in a list containing the original `lst` as the only sublist. If `n` is greater than the length of `lst`, the function will still attempt to create slices according to the given step size, though some slices might be empty due to the range exceeding the list length.**

This summary covers the core functionality of the function, including the typical case where `n` is less than or equal to the length of `lst`, as well as edge cases such as when `n` equals 1 or exceeds the length of `lst`.
