### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem description and the provided function `func_1` to determine the accuracy of the original assessment.

#### Problem Description:
The task is to write a function that takes in a list and an integer \( n \) and splits the list for every \( n \)th element, returning a list of the resulting sublists.

#### Given Program:
```python
def func_1(lst, n):
    return [lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]
```

#### Function Summary:
The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`. It returns a list of sublists, where each sublist is created by slicing `lst` starting from index `i` to the end of the list, with a step of `n`, for \( i \) ranging from 0 to \( n-1 \).

#### Analysis:
To verify the correctness of the given program, we need to understand what the function does based on its implementation and the provided summary.

1. **Given Program Implementation:**
   ```python
   def func_1(lst, n):
       return [lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]
   ```
   - This function uses a list comprehension to generate sublists.
   - For each index `i` in the range `0` to `n-1`, it creates a slice starting at `i` with a step of `n`.
   - Therefore, for `lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` and `n = 2`, the function will produce:
     - Slice starting at index 0 with step 2: `[1, 3, 5]`
     - Slice starting at index 1 with step 2: `[2, 4, 6]`
   - The output will be `[[1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6]]`, which matches the expected output for the given example.

2. **Function Summary:**
   - The summary correctly describes how the function works, stating that it creates sublists by slicing the list starting from index `i` with a step of `n`.
   - It also mentions the special cases for when `n` is 1 or greater than the length of the list, which is consistent with the implementation.

Based on this analysis, the original assessment that the program does not split the list every \( n \)-th element as described is incorrect. The given program indeed splits the list correctly according to the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
