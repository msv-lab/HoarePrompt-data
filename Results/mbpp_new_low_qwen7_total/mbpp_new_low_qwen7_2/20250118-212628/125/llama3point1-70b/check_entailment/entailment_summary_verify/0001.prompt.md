You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Write a function that takes in a list and an integer n and splits a list for every nth element, returning a list of the resulting lists.

- Program:
def func_1(lst, n):
    return [lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`. It returns a list of sublists, where each sublist is created by slicing `lst` starting from index `i` to the end of the list, with a step of `n`, for \(i\) ranging from 0 to \(n-1\). The function handles the case when `n` is equal to 1, which would result in a list containing the original `lst` as the only sublist. If `n` is greater than the length of `lst`, the function will still attempt to create slices according to the given step size, though some slices might be empty due to the range exceeding the list length.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:
The given function `func_1` aims to split the input list `lst` into sublists every `n` elements. The function uses a list comprehension to create these sublists. Here's how it works:

- The expression `[lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]` generates `n` sublists.
- `lst[i::n]` starts from index `i` and takes every `n`th element from `lst`.
- `range(n)` ensures that we start slicing from each of the first `n` indices (0 through `n-1`).

For example, if `lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]` and `n = 3`, the output will be:
- `lst[0::3]` -> `[1, 4, 7]`
- `lst[1::3]` -> `[2, 5, 8]`
- `lst[2::3]` -> `[3, 6]`

This approach correctly splits the list into sublists starting at each of the first `n` indices and taking every `n`th element thereafter.

### Correctness:
**True**

The given program is correct based on the problem description.
