Reasoning: 

Let's analyze the provided program and function summary against the problem description and the original assessment.

1. **Problem Description**: The function should take a list and an integer `n`, and split the list into sublists such that each sublist contains every `n`th element starting from each of the first `n` indices.

2. **Function Summary**: The function `func_1` does indeed generate sublists by slicing the input list `lst` starting from each of the first `n` indices with a step of `n`. However, there is a potential issue with the slicing logic when `n` is greater than the length of the list. In such cases, the slices might not be meaningful as they could include indices that exceed the list bounds.

3. **Original Assessment**: The original assessment correctly notes that the function creates sublists by slicing the list starting from each of the first `n` indices. However, it fails to address the edge case where `n` is greater than the length of the list. In this scenario, the slices might contain fewer elements than expected, or even no elements at all, leading to incorrect results.

To illustrate the edge case:
- If `lst = [1, 2, 3, 4]` and `n = 5`, the function will still try to create slices:
  - `lst[0::5]` -> `[1]`
  - `lst[1::5]` -> `[2]`
  - `lst[2::5]` -> `[3]`
  - `lst[3::5]` -> `[4]`
  - `lst[4::5]` -> `[]`
  
While the first four slices are correct, the last slice is an empty list, which might not be what the user expects.

Given this edge case, the function's behavior deviates from the typical expectation of properly handling cases where `n` exceeds the list length. Therefore, the function is not entirely correct as per the problem description, which implies that the output should handle such cases gracefully.

Final: **False**
