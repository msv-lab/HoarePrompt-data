Reasoning:
The annotated program correctly describes the behavior of the function `func_1`. The function iterates over a range from `0` to `n-1`, creating a sublist for each starting index `i` by slicing the input list `lst` with a step of `n`. This means it indeed splits the list into sublists every `n`th element, as required by the problem statement. The function also correctly handles edge cases, such as when `n` equals 1 (returning the entire list as one sublist) and when `n` exceeds the length of `lst` (resulting in potentially empty sublists).

Given this analysis, the provided function implementation matches the intended functionality and correctly solves the problem.

Correctness: **True**
