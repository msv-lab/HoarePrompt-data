Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Write a function that takes in a list and an integer n and splits a list for every nth element, returning a list of the resulting lists.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list, and n is a positive integer such that 0 < n <= len(lst).
def func_1(lst, n):
    return [lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]
    #The program returns a list of sublists, where each sublist is created by slicing `lst` starting from index `i` to the end of the list, with a step of `n`. The first sublist starts at index 0, the second at index 1, and so on, up to the nth-1 index.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`. It returns a list of sublists, where each sublist is created by slicing `lst` starting from index `i` to the end of the list, with a step of `n`, for \(i\) ranging from 0 to \(n-1\). The function handles the case when `n` is equal to 1, which would result in a list containing the original `lst` as the only sublist. If `n` is greater than the length of `lst`, the function will still attempt to create slices according to the given step size, though some slices might be empty due to the range exceeding the list length.

# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
