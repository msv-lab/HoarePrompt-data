Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Write a function that takes in a list and an integer n and splits a list for every nth element, returning a list of the resulting lists.

# Program:
def func_1(lst, n):
    return [lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]





# Execution Summary:
The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`. It returns a list of sublists, where each sublist is created by slicing `lst` starting from index `i` to the end of the list, with a step of `n`, for \(i\) ranging from 0 to \(n-1\). The function handles the case when `n` is equal to 1, which would result in a list containing the original `lst` as the only sublist. If `n` is greater than the length of `lst`, the function will still attempt to create slices according to the given step size, though some slices might be empty due to the range exceeding the list length.


# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
