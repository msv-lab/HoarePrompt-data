Reasoning:
The provided program indeed correctly implements the described functionality. Let's break it down:

1. The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `lst`, which is the list to be split, and `n`, which specifies the step size for splitting.
2. The list comprehension `[lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]` creates a new list of sublists. For each index `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`, it slices the original list `lst` starting from `i` and stepping by `n`.
3. This approach ensures that the list is divided into chunks as required. When `n` is 1, it simply returns the original list as the only sublist. When `n` is greater than the length of `lst`, the slicing will produce empty sublists, which is handled correctly by the implementation.

Given this analysis, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
