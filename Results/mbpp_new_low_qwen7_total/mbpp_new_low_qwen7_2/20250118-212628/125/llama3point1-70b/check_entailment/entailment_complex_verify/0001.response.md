### Reasoning:

The given function `func_1` indeed aims to split the input list `lst` into sublists every `n` elements. However, upon closer inspection, there is a flaw in the logic of the function. The issue lies in the fact that the list comprehension iterates over `range(n)`, but the slicing operation `lst[i::n]` may not behave as intended for values of `i` that are greater than or equal to the length of `lst`.

Let's analyze the annotated code step-by-step:

1. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - For `i` in `range(n)`, the function creates sublists by slicing `lst` starting from index `i` with a step of `n`.
   - When `i` is greater than or equal to the length of `lst`, the slice operation will return an empty list. This can lead to unexpected results if `n` is large relative to the length of `lst`.

2. **Example with `lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]` and `n = 5`**:
   - `lst[0::5]` -> `[1, 6]` (correct)
   - `lst[1::5]` -> `[2]` (correct)
   - `lst[2::5]` -> `[3]` (correct)
   - `lst[3::5]` -> `[]` (empty, because 3 + 5 > 8)
   - `lst[4::5]` -> `[]` (empty, because 4 + 5 > 8)

3. **Problematic Cases**:
   - If `n` is greater than the length of `lst`, all slices will be empty.
   - Even if `n` is smaller, the function will produce empty sublists for indices greater than or equal to the length of `lst`.

Given these observations, the function does not correctly handle cases where `i` exceeds the length of `lst`, leading to incorrect or empty sublists.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment incorrectly concluded that the function is correct. The function fails to handle cases where the slicing index `i` is greater than or equal to the length of the list `lst`, resulting in incorrect sublists being generated.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
