Reasoning: 

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the annotated code and verify its behavior step-by-step:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1(lst, n)` is defined to take a list `lst` and an integer `n`.

2. **List Comprehension**: The function uses a list comprehension `[lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]` to generate a list of sublists. Each sublist is created by slicing the original list `lst` starting from index `i` and taking every `n`th element.

3. **Slicing Behavior**: For each `i` in `range(n)`, the slice `lst[i::n]` creates a sublist starting from index `i` and stepping by `n`. This indeed ensures that the function splits the list into sublists starting from each of the first `n` indices and taking every `n`th element thereafter.

4. **Example Verification**: 
   - If `lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]` and `n = 3`:
     - `lst[0::3]` -> `[1, 4, 7]`
     - `lst[1::3]` -> `[2, 5, 8]`
     - `lst[2::3]` -> `[3, 6]`
   - The function returns `[[1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 8], [3, 6]]`, which matches the expected behavior described in the problem statement.

Given the annotations and the example verification, the original assessment is accurate. The function correctly implements the desired functionality of splitting the list into sublists every `n` elements.

Final: **True**
