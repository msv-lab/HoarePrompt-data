You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Write a function that takes in a list and an integer n and splits a list for every nth element, returning a list of the resulting lists.

- Program: 
def func_1(lst, n):
    return [lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list, and n is a positive integer such that 0 < n <= len(lst).
def func_1(lst, n):
    return [lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]
    #The program returns a list of sublists, where each sublist is created by slicing `lst` starting from index `i` to the end of the list, with a step of `n`. The first sublist starts at index 0, the second at index 1, and so on, up to the nth-1 index.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:
The given function `func_1` aims to split the input list `lst` into sublists every `n` elements. The function uses a list comprehension to create these sublists. Here's how it works:

- The expression `[lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]` generates `n` sublists.
- `lst[i::n]` starts from index `i` and takes every `n`th element from `lst`.
- `range(n)` ensures that we start slicing from each of the first `n` indices (0 through `n-1`).

For example, if `lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]` and `n = 3`, the output will be:
- `lst[0::3]` -> `[1, 4, 7]`
- `lst[1::3]` -> `[2, 5, 8]`
- `lst[2::3]` -> `[3, 6]`

This approach correctly splits the list into sublists starting at each of the first `n` indices and taking every `n`th element thereafter.

### Correctness:
**True**

The given program is correct based on the problem description.
