Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not split the list every nth element as described. Instead, it creates sublists starting from every index up to n-1 and then every nth element after that. For example, if `lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` and `n = 2`, the expected output would be `[[1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6]]`, but the program's output would be `[[1, 3, 5], [2], [4], [6]]`.

The correct implementation should group elements such that each sublist contains elements separated by n-1 indices. Here is a corrected version:

```python
def func_1(lst, n):
    result = []
    for i in range(n):
        result.append(lst[i::n])
    return result
```

This version correctly groups the elements into sublists starting from every nth element, meeting the problem description.
