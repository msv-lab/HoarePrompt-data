### Reasoning:
The given function `func_1` aims to split the input list `lst` into sublists every `n` elements. The function uses a list comprehension to create these sublists. Here's how it works:

- The expression `[lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]` generates `n` sublists.
- `lst[i::n]` starts from index `i` and takes every `n`th element from `lst`.
- `range(n)` ensures that we start slicing from each of the first `n` indices (0 through `n-1`).

For example, if `lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]` and `n = 3`, the output will be:
- `lst[0::3]` -> `[1, 4, 7]`
- `lst[1::3]` -> `[2, 5, 8]`
- `lst[2::3]` -> `[3, 6]`

This approach correctly splits the list into sublists starting at each of the first `n` indices and taking every `n`th element thereafter.
