### Reasoning:

The given function `func_1(lst, n)` aims to split the input list `lst` into sublists at every nth element. However, the current implementation of the function does not achieve this goal correctly. Hereâ€™s why:

- The list comprehension `[lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]` generates sublists starting from each index `i` in the range `0` to `n-1`, and slices the list from that index with a step size of `n`.
- For example, if `lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` and `n = 2`, the expected output should be `[[1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6]]`, but the current implementation will incorrectly produce `[[1, 3, 5], [2], [3, 5], [4], [5], [6]]`.

To achieve the correct behavior, we need to slice the list starting from each nth index, ensuring that the slicing respects the step size `n` without including indices out of bounds.

### Correct Implementation:

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(lst, n):
    result = []
    for i in range(0, len(lst), n):
        result.append(lst[i:i + n])
    return result
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Code:

- The loop iterates over the list `lst` with a step size of `n`, ensuring that each start index `i` is a multiple of `n`.
- The slice `lst[i:i + n]` correctly extracts a sublist of length `n` starting from index `i`.
- This approach ensures that the function behaves as intended, splitting the list into sublists every nth element.

Given the provided code, the function does not meet the requirements as described. Therefore, the provided function is incorrect.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**
