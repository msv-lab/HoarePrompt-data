Initial State: `arr` is a list of non-negative integers, and `n` is a positive integer such that `0 <= n == len(arr)`.

Code Block:
```
odd_count = sum(1 for num in arr if num % 2 != 0)
even_count = n - odd_count
```

Analysis:
- The first line calculates the number of odd numbers in the list `arr` using a generator expression within the `sum()` function. This value is stored in `odd_count`.
- The second line calculates the number of even numbers in the list `arr` by subtracting the count of odd numbers (`odd_count`) from the total length of the list `n`. This result is stored in `even_count`.

Since no changes are made to `arr` or `n` in the code block, these variables retain their initial values. The new variables `odd_count` and `even_count` are introduced and calculated based on the given conditions.

Final Output State: **arr is a list of non-negative integers, n is a positive integer such that 0 <= n == len(arr), odd_count is the count of odd numbers in arr, even_count is n - odd_count**
