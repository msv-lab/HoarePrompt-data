The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr`, which is a list of non-negative integers, and `n`, which is a positive integer such that `0 <= n == len(arr)`. The function returns the value calculated by the formula `odd_count * even_count + odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2`, where `odd_count` is the count of odd numbers in the list `arr` and `even_count` is the count of even numbers in the list `arr`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `arr` of non-negative integers and a positive integer `n` (where `n` is the length of `arr`), and return the value calculated by the given formula based on the counts of odd and even numbers in `arr`.
