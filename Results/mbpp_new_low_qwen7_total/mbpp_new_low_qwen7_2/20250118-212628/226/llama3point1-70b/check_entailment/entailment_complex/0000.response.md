Reasoning:

The provided function `func_1` aims to count the number of pairs whose XOR value is odd in a list of non-negative integers. To achieve this, the function correctly identifies two key aspects:
1. Count the number of odd numbers in the list (`odd_count`).
2. Compute the number of even numbers in the list (`even_count`).

The formula used in the function:
\[ \text{result} = \text{odd\_count} \times \text{even\_count} + \text{odd\_count} \times (\text{odd\_count} - 1) // 2 \]

This formula can be broken down as follows:
- \(\text{odd\_count} \times \text{even\_count}\): This term counts pairs where one number is odd and the other is even, because the XOR of an odd and an even number is always odd.
- \(\text{odd\_count} \times (\text{odd\_count} - 1) // 2\): This term counts the number of ways to choose 2 odd numbers from the list, because the XOR of two odd numbers is always even. We only need the pairs where the result is odd, so we exclude these combinations.

The edge cases are handled correctly:
1. If the list is empty, `odd_count` is 0, resulting in a return value of 0.
2. If all numbers are even, `odd_count` is 0, resulting in a return value of 0.
3. If all numbers are odd, `even_count` is 0, resulting in a return value of \(\text{odd\_count} \times (\text{odd\_count} - 1) // 2\), which is correct.

Given the provided explanation and the formula, the function seems to meet the requirements accurately without any apparent logical errors or missing parts.

Correctness: **True**
