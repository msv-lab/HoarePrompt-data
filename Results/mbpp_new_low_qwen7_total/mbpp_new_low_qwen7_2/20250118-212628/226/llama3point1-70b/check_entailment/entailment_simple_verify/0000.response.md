### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step using the annotated version provided.

1. **Initialization**:
   - `arr` is a list of non-negative integers.
   - `n` is a positive integer such that `n == len(arr)`.

2. **Counting Odd and Even Numbers**:
   - `odd_count = sum(1 for num in arr if num % 2 != 0)`: This line counts the number of odd numbers in the array `arr`.
   - `even_count = n - odd_count`: This line calculates the number of even numbers in the array `arr`.

3. **Calculating the Number of Pairs**:
   - The formula used is: `odd_count * even_count + odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2`.
     - `odd_count * even_count`: This part of the formula calculates the number of pairs consisting of one odd and one even number.
     - `odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2`: This part of the formula calculates the number of pairs consisting of two odd numbers.

### Analysis of the Formula:
- For the XOR of two numbers to be odd, one number must be odd and the other must be even. Therefore, the first term `odd_count * even_count` correctly counts these pairs.
- However, the second term `odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2` does not correctly account for the number of pairs of odd numbers. The correct way to count pairs of odd numbers would be `odd_count * (odd_count - 1) / 2`, which should be an integer division if we want an exact count of pairs.

### Example:
Consider the following example:
- `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]`
- `n = 4`
- `odd_count = 2` (since 1 and 3 are odd)
- `even_count = 2` (since 2 and 4 are even)

Using the provided formula:
- `odd_count * even_count + odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2 = 2 * 2 + 2 * (2 - 1) // 2 = 4 + 1 = 5`

However, the correct pairs of odd numbers should be:
- (1, 3)
- (1, 3)

So, there are actually only 1 pair of odd numbers, not 5.

### Conclusion:
The formula in the program is incorrect because it overcounts the number of pairs of odd numbers. The correct formula should be `odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2`.

Since the original assessment overlooked this error and incorrectly assumed the formula was correct, the original assessment is inaccurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the overcounting of pairs of odd numbers.
