### Reasoning:

To solve the problem of counting pairs whose XOR value is odd, we need to understand the properties of XOR:
- The XOR of two numbers is odd if and only if one number is odd and the other is even.

Given this, let's analyze the provided function `func_1`:

1. **Odd Count Calculation:**
   ```python
   odd_count = sum(1 for num in arr if num % 2 != 0)
   ```
   This line correctly counts the number of odd elements in the array `arr`.

2. **Even Count Calculation:**
   ```python
   even_count = n - odd_count
   ```
   This line calculates the number of even elements in the array `arr`. Since the total length of the array is `n`, the number of even elements can be derived by subtracting the number of odd elements from `n`.

3. **Return Statement:**
   ```python
   return odd_count * even_count + odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2
   ```
   - `odd_count * even_count` gives the number of pairs where one element is odd and the other is even.
   - `odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2` calculates the number of pairs where both elements are odd, but since the XOR of two odd numbers is even, these pairs do not contribute to the count of odd XOR values.

Therefore, the function correctly counts the pairs with an odd XOR value.

### Conclusion:
The given function `func_1` is correct according to the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**
