Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Write a python function to count the number of pairs whose xor value is odd.

# Program:
def func_1(arr, n):
    odd_count = sum((1 for num in arr if num % 2 != 0))
    even_count = n - odd_count
    return odd_count * even_count + odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2





# Execution Summary:
The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of non-negative integers and a positive integer `n` (where `n` is the length of `arr`). It calculates the number of odd and even numbers in the list `arr`. Specifically, it counts the number of odd numbers (`odd_count`) and computes the number of even numbers (`even_count` as `n - odd_count`). The function then returns the value calculated by the formula `odd_count * even_count + odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2`. This formula represents the product of the count of odd numbers and the count of even numbers plus the number of ways to choose 2 odd numbers from the total odd numbers. 

Potential edge cases include:
1. If the list `arr` is empty, `odd_count` will be 0, and thus the returned value will also be 0.
2. If all numbers in `arr` are even, `odd_count` will be 0, and the returned value will also be 0.
3. If all numbers in `arr` are odd, `even_count` will be 0, and the returned value will be `odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2`.

There is no missing functionality noted in the provided code.
