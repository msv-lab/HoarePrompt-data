Reasoning:
The provided program aims to count the number of pairs whose XOR value is odd. For two numbers, their XOR is odd if and only if one number is odd and the other is even. 

The program correctly calculates:
1. The number of odd numbers in the array (`odd_count`).
2. The number of even numbers in the array (`even_count`).

The formula used:
\[ \text{odd\_count} \times \text{even\_count} + \text{odd\_count} \times (\text{odd\_count} - 1) // 2 \]

- \(\text{odd\_count} \times \text{even\_count}\): This term accounts for pairs where one number is odd and the other is even.
- \(\text{odd\_count} \times (\text{odd\_count} - 1) // 2\): This term accounts for pairs where both numbers are odd. However, since the XOR of two odd numbers is always even, this part of the formula is not needed for counting pairs with an odd XOR value.

Therefore, the correct formula should only include:
\[ \text{odd\_count} \times \text{even\_count} \]

Given the current implementation, the extra term \(\text{odd\_count} \times (\text{odd\_count} - 1) // 2\) incorrectly counts pairs of odd numbers, which leads to an overestimation of the number of pairs with an odd XOR value.

Based on the reasoning above, the given program does not correctly implement the logic to count pairs with an odd XOR value.

Correctness: **False**
