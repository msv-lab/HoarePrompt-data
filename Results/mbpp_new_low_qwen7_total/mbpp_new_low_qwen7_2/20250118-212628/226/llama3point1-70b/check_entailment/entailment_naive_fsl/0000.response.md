Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` calculates the number of pairs in the array whose XOR value is odd. For the XOR of two numbers to be odd, one number must be even and the other must be odd. 

The function correctly counts the number of odd and even numbers in the array:
- `odd_count` stores the count of odd numbers.
- `even_count` stores the count of even numbers.

The formula used to calculate the number of pairs whose XOR is odd is:
- `odd_count * even_count`: Pairs consisting of one odd and one even number.
- `odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2`: Pairs consisting of two odd numbers (since the XOR of two odd numbers is also odd).

This approach covers all potential cases and handles the problem as described. Therefore, the program is correct.
