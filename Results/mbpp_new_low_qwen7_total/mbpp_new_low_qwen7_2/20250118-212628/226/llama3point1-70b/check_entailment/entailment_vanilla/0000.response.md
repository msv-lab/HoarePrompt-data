### Reasoning:

To determine if the given program correctly counts the number of pairs whose XOR value is odd, let's break down the logic and verify it against the problem statement.

The XOR of two numbers is odd if and only if one of the numbers is odd and the other is even. This means we need to count pairs where one number is from the set of odd numbers and the other is from the set of even numbers.

1. **Odd Count Calculation**: The code calculates the number of odd numbers in the array using `odd_count = sum((1 for num in arr if num % 2 != 0))`. This is correct because it increments the counter for each odd number.

2. **Even Count Calculation**: The code calculates the number of even numbers in the array using `even_count = n - odd_count`, which is also correct since `n` is the total number of elements in the array, and subtracting the odd count from `n` gives the even count.

3. **Counting Pairs**: 
   - The term `odd_count * even_count` correctly counts all pairs where one element is odd and the other is even.
   - The term `odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2` incorrectly counts the number of pairs where both elements are odd. It should be zero because we are looking for pairs with an odd XOR, not pairs with an even XOR.

Given this, the correct formula to count the number of pairs with an odd XOR should only include the product of the number of odd and even elements.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly count the number of pairs with an odd XOR because it includes the incorrect term for counting pairs of odd elements.

**Correctness:** **False**
