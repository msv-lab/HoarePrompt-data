Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Write a python function to count the number of pairs whose xor value is odd.

# Program:
def func_1(arr, n):
    odd_count = sum((1 for num in arr if num % 2 != 0))
    even_count = n - odd_count
    return odd_count * even_count + odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2



# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
