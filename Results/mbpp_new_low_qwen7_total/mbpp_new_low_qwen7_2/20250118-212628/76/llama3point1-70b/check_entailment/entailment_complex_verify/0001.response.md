### Reasoning:

1. **Original Implementation Analysis**:
   - The original function `func_1(tup)` uses `''.join(tup)` to concatenate all elements of the tuple `tup` into a single string.
   - The `join` method in Python expects an iterable (like a list or tuple) of strings. If `tup` contains non-string elements, these elements will be automatically converted to strings when used in the `join` method due to Python's dynamic typing.
   - The function does not modify the original tuple; it operates on a copy of the elements.

2. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The annotated code correctly explains that the function concatenates all elements in the tuple `tup` into a single string.
   - It also mentions that non-string elements are automatically converted to strings, which is true in Python.
   - The annotation correctly notes that the function does not modify the original tuple.

3. **Original Assessment Analysis**:
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that the `join` method works with strings and that non-string elements in the tuple will be automatically converted to strings.
   - The original assessment suggests modifying the function to explicitly convert each item to a string, but this is unnecessary because Python's `join` method already handles this conversion implicitly.
   - The original assessment concludes that the function is incorrect unless the tuple always contains only strings, which is not guaranteed by the problem statement.

4. **Verification Using Annotated Code**:
   - The annotated code confirms that the original function works as intended without needing explicit type conversions.
   - The behavior described in the annotated code matches the behavior of the `join` method in Python.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis and the annotated code, the original function `func_1(tup)` is correct because Python's `join` method will handle the conversion of non-string elements to strings automatically. Therefore, the original assessment was overly cautious and did not fully account for Python's behavior.

### Final:
**True**
