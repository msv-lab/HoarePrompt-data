Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Write a function to convert a tuple to a string.

# Program:
def func_1(tup):
    return ''.join(tup)





# Execution Summary:
The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `tup` as a parameter and returns a string that is the concatenation of all elements in the tuple. The function simply joins all elements of the tuple into a single string using the `join` method. This operation handles all elements within the tuple, including any nested strings or other iterables. If the tuple contains non-string elements, they are automatically converted to strings during the concatenation process. The function does not modify the original tuple and operates on a copy of its elements.


# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
