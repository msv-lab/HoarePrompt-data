Reasoning:
The function `func_1` takes a tuple `tup` as input and uses the `join` method to concatenate all elements of the tuple into a single string. However, the `join` method requires that the elements of the tuple be an iterable of strings. When you pass a tuple directly to `join`, it will attempt to call the `join` method on each element of the tuple, which is not what is intended. The `join` method should be called on a string, and the tuple's elements should be passed as an iterable (like a list of strings).

To correctly concatenate the elements of a tuple into a single string, the elements need to be converted to strings individually and then collected into a list or another iterable before passing it to `join`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(tup):
    return ''.join(str(item) for item in tup)
```

This version of the function converts each element of the tuple to a string and then joins them together.

Given the provided program, since it does not properly convert the tuple elements to strings before joining, the current implementation is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
