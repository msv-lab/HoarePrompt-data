Reasoning: The provided function `func_1` attempts to convert a tuple to a string by using the `join` method. However, the `join` method works with an iterable of strings. In Python, a tuple can contain any type of elements, not just strings. If the tuple contains non-string elements, the `join` method will raise a `TypeError`. 

To correctly convert a tuple to a string, each element in the tuple should first be converted to a string. Here's how you could modify the function:

```python
def func_1(tup):
    return ''.join(str(item) for item in tup)
```

This modified function iterates over each item in the tuple, converts it to a string, and then joins them together into a single string.

Given the original implementation, the correctness of the program depends on whether the input tuple always contains only string elements. If it does, the original implementation would work. However, since the problem statement does not specify that the tuple will only contain strings, we must consider the general case where it might contain other types.

Correctness: **False**
