Reasoning:
The given function `func_1` takes a tuple `tup` as an argument and uses the `join` method to concatenate all elements in the tuple into a single string. The `join` method requires an iterable (such as a list) of strings. If the tuple contains non-string elements, a `TypeError` will be raised when attempting to join them.

However, based on the problem statement and the annotated program, we are to assume that the input tuple contains only string elements. Therefore, the function should work correctly under this assumption.

Given the problem description and the annotated program, which both indicate that `tup` contains only string elements, the function is correct under these assumptions.

Correctness: **True**
