Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Write a function to convert a tuple to a string.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup is a tuple.
def func_1(tup):
    return ''.join(tup)
    #The program returns a string that is the concatenation of all elements in the tuple 'tup'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `tup` as a parameter and returns a string that is the concatenation of all elements in the tuple. The function simply joins all elements of the tuple into a single string using the `join` method. This operation handles all elements within the tuple, including any nested strings or other iterables. If the tuple contains non-string elements, they are automatically converted to strings during the concatenation process. The function does not modify the original tuple and operates on a copy of its elements.

# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
