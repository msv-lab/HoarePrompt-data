### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the function summary step-by-step:

1. **Problem Description**: Convert a tuple to a string.
2. **Function Summary**: The function `func_1` takes a tuple `tup` and returns a string that is the concatenation of all elements in the tuple. It handles elements by converting them to strings if necessary.

From the function summary, we understand that the function should convert all elements of the tuple to strings before joining them. The key point here is that the summary indicates that the function will automatically handle non-string elements by converting them to strings.

Now, let's look at the provided program:
```python
def func_1(tup):
    return ''.join(tup)
```

In Python, the `str.join(iterable)` method only works with an iterable of strings. When you pass a tuple containing non-string elements to `str.join`, Python attempts to iterate over the tuple and convert each element to a string implicitly. This means that if the tuple contains non-string elements, they will be converted to strings automatically before being concatenated.

Given the function summary, the provided program is correct because it will indeed handle the conversion of non-string elements to strings before joining them. The summary confirms that the function will join all elements, including those that need to be converted, which aligns with the behavior of the provided code.

Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate because the provided program does not raise a `TypeError` and works as intended according to the function summary.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
