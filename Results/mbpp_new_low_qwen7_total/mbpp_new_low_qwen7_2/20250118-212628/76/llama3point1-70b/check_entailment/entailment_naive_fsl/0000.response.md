Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program attempts to convert a tuple to a string using `''.join(tup)`. However, this will raise a `TypeError` because tuples in Python are immutable and cannot be directly joined with `str.join()`. Instead, we need to first convert the tuple to a list of strings or join the elements after converting them to strings individually. Here is a corrected version:

```python
def func_1(tup):
    return ''.join(str(item) for item in tup)
```

This corrected version will handle each element in the tuple by converting it to a string before joining them together, ensuring that the program works correctly for all potential cases.
