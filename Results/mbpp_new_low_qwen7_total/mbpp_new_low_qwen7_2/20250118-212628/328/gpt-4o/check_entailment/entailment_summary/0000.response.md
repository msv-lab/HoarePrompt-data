Reasoning:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for finding the nth polite number as described. A polite number is defined as a positive integer that can be written as the sum of two or more consecutive positive integers. For example, 5 is polite because it can be written as 2 + 3. The nth polite number is the nth such number when all polite numbers are listed in increasing order.

However, the program provided is attempting to find the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to `n + 1`, minus 1. This is not the definition of a polite number. Let's analyze the provided assertions:

- `func_1(7) == 11`: This would imply that the 7th polite number is 11. However, the 7th polite number is actually 16 (the sequence starts with 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, ...).
- `func_1(4) == 7`: This would imply that the 4th polite number is 7. However, the 4th polite number is actually 9.
- `func_1(9) == 13`: This would imply that the 9th polite number is 13. However, the 9th polite number is actually 17.

The code provided is incorrectly identifying numbers that are not polite numbers. Therefore, the program is not implementing the correct logic for finding the nth polite number.

Correctness: **False**
