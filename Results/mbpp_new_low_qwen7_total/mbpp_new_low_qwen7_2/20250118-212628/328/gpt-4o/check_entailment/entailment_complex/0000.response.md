Reasoning:

The function `func_1` is intended to find the \(n\)-th polite number. A polite number is defined as a positive integer that can be expressed as the sum of two or more consecutive positive integers. However, the current implementation of `func_1` does not correctly identify polite numbers; instead, it returns the smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to \(n + 1\) minus 1. This logic does not align with the definition of polite numbers.

To determine correctness, we need to check if the provided assertions match the expected behavior of finding the \(n\)-th polite number.

Let's analyze the assertions:
- `assert func_1(7) == 11`: The 7th polite number should be 11 because the sequence of polite numbers starts as follows: 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, ... The 7th number in this sequence is indeed 11.
- `assert func_1(4) == 7`: The 4th polite number should be 7 because the sequence is: 3, 5, 6, 7, ... The 4th number in this sequence is 7.
- `assert func_1(9) == 13`: The 9th polite number should be 13 because the sequence is: 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, ... The 9th number in this sequence is 13.

These assertions are consistent with the definition of polite numbers, so the function should correctly identify these values. However, the implementation itself is flawed as it does not correctly generate polite numbers.

Correctness: **False**
