Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Write a function to find nth polite number. geeksforgeeks.org/n-th-polite-number/

# Annotated Program:
assert func_1(7) == 11
assert func_1(4) == 7
assert func_1(9) == 13

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    count = 0

number = 1
    while count < n:
        if number & number - 1 != 0:
            count += 1
        
        number += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `count` is `n`, `number` is the smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to `n + 1`.
    return number - 1
    #`The program returns the smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to n + 1 minus 1`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to `n + 1`, minus 1. It achieves this by initializing a counter `count` to 0 and a variable `number` to 1. The function then enters a loop that continues until `count` equals `n`. Within the loop, it checks if `number` is not a power of 2 (by verifying if `number & (number - 1)` is not equal to 0). If `number` is not a power of 2, it increments the counter. Regardless of whether `number` is a power of 2 or not, the function increments `number` by 1. Once the loop exits, the function returns `number - 1`, which is the smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to `n + 1` minus 1. The function handles the case where `n` is 0 by returning 0, as the smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to 1 is 1, and `1 - 1` is 0.
