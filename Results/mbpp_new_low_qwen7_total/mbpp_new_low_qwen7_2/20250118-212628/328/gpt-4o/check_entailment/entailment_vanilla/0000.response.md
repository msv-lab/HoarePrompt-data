Reasoning:
- The problem is about finding the nth polite number. A polite number is defined as a positive integer that can be expressed as the sum of two or more consecutive positive integers.
- The given code checks if a number is polite by using a bitwise operation. Specifically, it checks if a number has only one '1' bit in its binary representation (which would mean it's a power of 2 and thus not polite), and if not, it counts such numbers until it reaches the nth polite number.
- The code increments `number` starting from 1 and uses the condition `if number & number - 1 != 0` to check if `number` is not a power of 2. If this condition is true, it means the number is polite. The `count` is incremented for each polite number found.
- Once the count reaches `n`, the function returns the current `number - 1` which is the nth polite number.
- The provided test cases assert that `func_1(7)` should return `11`, `func_1(4)` should return `7`, and `func_1(9)` should return `13`. These assertions are consistent with the definition of polite numbers.

Given the above reasoning, the provided function seems to correctly implement the logic for finding the nth polite number.

Correctness: **True**
