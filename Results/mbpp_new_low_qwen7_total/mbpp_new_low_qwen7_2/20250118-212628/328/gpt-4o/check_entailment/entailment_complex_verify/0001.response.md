### Reasoning:

The original assessment is incorrect. Let's break down the problem and the code to understand why.

#### Problem Description:
A polite number is defined as a positive integer that can be expressed as the sum of two or more consecutive positive integers. For example:
- 6 is polite because \(6 = 1 + 2 + 3\)
- 8 is not polite because it cannot be expressed as the sum of two or more consecutive positive integers.
- 15 is polite because \(15 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5\)

#### Code Analysis:
- The function `func_1` aims to find the nth polite number.
- The bitwise operation `number & (number - 1) != 0` is used to check if `number` is not a power of 2. However, this operation alone does not determine if a number is polite.
- The code increments `number` starting from 1 and checks if `number` is not a power of 2. If `number` is not a power of 2, it is considered polite, and the `count` is incremented.
- Once the `count` reaches `n`, the function returns `number - 1`.

#### Test Cases Analysis:
Let's analyze the provided test cases:
- `func_1(7)` should return `11`. This is correct because the 7th polite number is 11 (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11).
- `func_1(4)` should return `7`. This is incorrect because the 4th polite number is actually 5 (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7).
- `func_1(9)` should return `13`. This is incorrect because the 9th polite number is actually 11 (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11).

From the test cases, we can see that the code is not correctly identifying the nth polite number. The logic of checking if a number is not a power of 2 does not ensure that the number is polite. Instead, we need to check if a number can be expressed as the sum of two or more consecutive positive integers.

#### Correct Approach:
To find the nth polite number, we can use the following approach:
1. Start with the number `n`.
2. Check if the number can be expressed as the sum of two or more consecutive positive integers.
3. If not, increment the number and repeat the check.
4. Stop when we find the nth such number.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def is_polite(number):
    for start in range(1, number // 2 + 1):
        end = start + (number - 1) // 2
        if start + end * (end - start + 1) // 2 == number:
            return True
    return False

def func_1(n):
    count = 0
    number = 1
    while count < n:
        if is_polite(number):
            count += 1
        number += 1
    return number - 1
```

With this corrected approach, the function should correctly identify the nth polite number.

### Final:
Final: **False**
