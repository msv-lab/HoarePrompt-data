Reasoning: 

Let's analyze the given function `func_1` and compare it with the correct approach for finding the nth polite number.

### Problem Description
A polite number is defined as a positive integer that can be written as the sum of two or more consecutive positive integers.

### Correct Approach
The correct way to determine the nth polite number involves understanding the pattern of polite numbers. Polite numbers are those that are not powers of 2. This is because any number that is a power of 2 cannot be expressed as the sum of two or more consecutive positive integers.

### Given Function Summary
The function `func_1` is described as follows:
- It accepts a positive integer `n`.
- It returns the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to `n + 1`, minus 1.
- It uses bit manipulation to check if `number` is not a power of 2 (`number & (number - 1)` is not equal to 0).

### Analysis
1. **Bit Manipulation Check**: The check `number & (number - 1) != 0` is indeed used to determine if a number is not a power of 2. However, the function does not correctly handle the sequence of polite numbers. It only checks if the number is a power of 2, which is not sufficient to generate the nth polite number.
2. **Loop Logic**: The loop increments `number` until `count` reaches `n`. While this ensures that we find the nth number, the logic inside the loop is flawed. It simply increments `number` without considering whether it is a polite number.
3. **Return Value**: The function returns `number - 1`, which is the smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to `n + 1` minus 1. This is not the correct approach for generating polite numbers.

Given the examples in the problem description:
- For `n = 1`, the expected polite number is 3 (1+2), but the function returns 2.
- For `n = 2`, the expected polite number is 5 (2+3), but the function returns 3.

The function summary and the provided assertions clearly indicate that the function is not correctly implementing the logic for finding polite numbers.

### Conclusion
The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic to find the nth polite number.

Final: **False**
