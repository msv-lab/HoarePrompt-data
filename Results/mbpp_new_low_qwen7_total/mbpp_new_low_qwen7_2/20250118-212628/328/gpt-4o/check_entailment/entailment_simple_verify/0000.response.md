### Reasoning:

Let's revisit the problem and the annotated code step-by-step to understand its behavior and validate the original assessment.

#### Problem Description:
A polite number is defined as a positive integer that can be written as the sum of two or more consecutive positive integers. The task is to find the nth polite number.

#### Given Code:
```python
def func_1(n):
    count = 0
    number = 1
    while count < n:
        if number & number - 1 != 0:
            count += 1
        number += 1
    return number - 1
```

#### Annotations:
- Before the function call, `n` is a positive integer.
- Inside the function, it checks if `number` is not a power of 2 using the condition `if number & number - 1 != 0`. This condition is true if `number` is not a power of 2.
- After the loop, `count` equals `n`, and `number` is the smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to `n + 1`. The function then returns `number - 1`.

#### Correctness Analysis:
1. **Understanding the Condition**: The condition `number & number - 1 != 0` checks if `number` is not a power of 2. This is because powers of 2 have exactly one bit set in their binary representation, and subtracting 1 from them flips all bits up to and including the first set bit. For example, `8 (1000)` becomes `7 (0111)`, so `8 & 7` equals `0`.

2. **Behavior of the Loop**:
   - The loop increments `number` until `count` reaches `n`.
   - During each iteration, it checks if `number` is not a power of 2.
   - Once `count` reaches `n`, `number` is the smallest number that is not a power of 2 and is greater than or equal to `n + 1`.

3. **Returning the Result**:
   - The function returns `number - 1`, which is the nth polite number.

#### Test Cases:
- `func_1(7)` should return the 7th polite number.
- `func_1(4)` should return the 4th polite number.
- `func_1(9)` should return the 9th polite number.

Let's manually verify the results:
- The first few polite numbers are: 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, ...
  - 1st polite number: 3 (1+2)
  - 2nd polite number: 5 (2+3)
  - 3rd polite number: 6 (1+2+3)
  - 4th polite number: 7 (3+4)
  - 5th polite number: 9 (4+5)
  - 6th polite number: 10 (2+3+5)
  - 7th polite number: 11 (5+6)
  - 8th polite number: 12 (1+2+3+6)
  - 9th polite number: 13 (6+7)

From the test cases provided:
- `func_1(7) == 11` (Correct)
- `func_1(4) == 7` (Correct)
- `func_1(9) == 13` (Correct)

The function seems to produce the correct results for these test cases. The annotated code also correctly describes the behavior of the function.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment stated that the function is incorrect, but upon re-evaluation, the function appears to correctly implement the logic for finding the nth polite number based on the provided test cases and the annotated code.

#### Final:
**True**
