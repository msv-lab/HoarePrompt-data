### Reasoning:

The original assessment claims that the function correctly finds the nth polite number by incrementally checking each number to see if it is not a power of 2 (since powers of 2 cannot be expressed as the sum of two or more consecutive positive integers). This approach is fundamentally flawed because the definition of a polite number does not solely rely on whether a number is a power of 2.

A polite number is defined as a positive integer that can be expressed as the sum of two or more consecutive positive integers. For example, 6 is a polite number because \(6 = 2 + 3\). However, 8 is not a polite number because it cannot be expressed as the sum of two or more consecutive positive integers.

The given code incorrectly determines if a number is polite by checking if it is not a power of 2. This does not align with the actual definition of a polite number. Instead, a correct approach would involve checking if a number can be expressed as the sum of consecutive integers.

To verify this, let's look at the provided test cases:

1. `func_1(7)` should return `11`. The 7th polite number is indeed `11` because it can be expressed as \(5 + 6\) or \(11\) itself.
2. `func_1(4)` should return `7`. The 4th polite number is `7` because it can be expressed as \(3 + 4\).
3. `func_1(9)` should return `13`. The 9th polite number is `13` because it can be expressed as \(6 + 7\).

However, the provided code does not correctly identify these polite numbers. For instance, the number `8` is a power of 2, so the code incorrectly considers it a polite number, but it is not. Similarly, other numbers like `12` (which can be expressed as \(3 + 4 + 5\)) would not be correctly identified.

Given this analysis, the code does not correctly implement the logic for finding polite numbers.

### Final:
**False**
