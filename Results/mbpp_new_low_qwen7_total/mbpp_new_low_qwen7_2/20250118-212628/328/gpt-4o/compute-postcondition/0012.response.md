Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 2, and `count` is 3.*** 

Explanation: Given the if condition `number & number - 1 != 0`, this implies that `n` is not a power of 2 (since the expression checks for the presence of at least one bit set in the binary representation of `n-1`). According to the if part, if the condition is true, `count` is set to 3. Since there is no else part, the only case we need to consider is when the if condition evaluates to true, leading to the specified postcondition.
