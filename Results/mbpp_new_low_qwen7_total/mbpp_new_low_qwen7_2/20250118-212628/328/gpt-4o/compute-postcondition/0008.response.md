Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `count` is 2, and `number` is 2 if initially `number` was 1, otherwise `number` is 3. Since the condition `number & number - 1 != 0` checks if `number` is not a power of 2, and both 2 and 3 are not powers of 2, the condition always evaluates to true in this context. Therefore, the postcondition is the same as the if part's postcondition.***
