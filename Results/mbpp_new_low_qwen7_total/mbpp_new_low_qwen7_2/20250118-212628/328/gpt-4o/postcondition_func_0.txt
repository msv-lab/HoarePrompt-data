The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to `n + 1`, minus 1. It achieves this by initializing a counter `count` to 0 and a variable `number` to 1. The function then enters a loop that continues until `count` equals `n`. Within the loop, it checks if `number` is not a power of 2 (by verifying if `number & (number - 1)` is not equal to 0). If `number` is not a power of 2, it increments the counter. Regardless of whether `number` is a power of 2 or not, the function increments `number` by 1. Once the loop exits, the function returns `number - 1`, which is the smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to `n + 1` minus 1. The function handles the case where `n` is 0 by returning 0, as the smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to 1 is 1, and `1 - 1` is 0.
