Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes two tuples, `tuple1` and `tuple2`, both of the same length, and returns a new tuple where each element is the result of the logical AND operation between the corresponding elements of `tuple1` and `tuple2`. This means that for each pair of elements `(a, b)` from `tuple1` and `tuple2` respectively, the function computes `a & b` and includes the result in the returned tuple. There are no edge cases mentioned or implied in the provided code; the function assumes that `tuple1` and `tuple2` are of the same length. If the tuples are empty, the returned tuple will also be empty. The function does not handle cases where the input tuples are of different lengths or contain non-boolean values, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.**
