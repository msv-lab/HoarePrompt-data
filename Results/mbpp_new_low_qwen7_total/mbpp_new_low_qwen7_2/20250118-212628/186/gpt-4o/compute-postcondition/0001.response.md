The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `tuple1` and `tuple2`. Both `tuple1` and `tuple2` are tuples of the same length. The function returns a tuple where each element is the result of the logical AND operation between the corresponding elements of `tuple1` and `tuple2`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters tuple1 and tuple2, both tuples of the same length, and returns a tuple where each element is the result of the logical AND operation between the corresponding elements of tuple1 and tuple2.**
