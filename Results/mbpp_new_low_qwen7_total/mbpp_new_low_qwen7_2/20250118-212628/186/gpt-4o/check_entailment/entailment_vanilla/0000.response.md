Reasoning:
The provided function `func_1` takes two tuples as input and returns a new tuple. The function uses a generator expression inside the `tuple` constructor to compute the bitwise AND of corresponding elements from the two input tuples.

Let's analyze the given assertions:

1. `func_1((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3)) == (0, 0, 2, 1)`
   - \(10 \& 5 = 0\)
   - \(4 \& 2 = 0\)
   - \(6 \& 3 = 2\)
   - \(9 \& 3 = 1\)
   - This assertion is correct.

2. `func_1((1, 2, 3, 4), (5, 6, 7, 8)) == (1, 2, 3, 0)`
   - \(1 \& 5 = 1\)
   - \(2 \& 6 = 2\)
   - \(3 \& 7 = 3\)
   - \(4 \& 8 = 0\)
   - This assertion is correct.

3. `func_1((8, 9, 11, 12), (7, 13, 14, 17)) == (0, 9, 10, 0)`
   - \(8 \& 7 = 0\)
   - \(9 \& 13 = 9\)
   - \(11 \& 14 = 10\)
   - \(12 \& 17 = 0\)
   - This assertion is correct.

The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to perform the bitwise AND operation on corresponding elements of the two input tuples. All the provided test cases pass without any errors.

Correctness: **True**
