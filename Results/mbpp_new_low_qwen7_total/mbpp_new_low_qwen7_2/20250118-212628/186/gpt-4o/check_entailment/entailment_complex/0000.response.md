Reasoning:
The annotated program explains that the function `func_1` should perform a bitwise AND operation on corresponding elements of the two input tuples and return the results as a new tuple. The provided test cases correctly demonstrate the expected behavior of the function. Each test case shows that the function is returning the correct results based on the bitwise AND operation:

1. For `(10, 4, 6, 9)` and `(5, 2, 3, 3)`, the bitwise AND results are `(0, 0, 2, 1)`.
2. For `(1, 2, 3, 4)` and `(5, 6, 7, 8)`, the bitwise AND results are `(1, 2, 3, 0)`.
3. For `(8, 9, 11, 12)` and `(7, 13, 14, 17)`, the bitwise AND results are `(0, 9, 10, 0)`.

Given that the function implementation matches the problem description and the provided assertions pass, the function is correct.

Correctness: **True**
