Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Write a function to extract the elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples.

# Annotated Program:
assert func_1((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3)) == (0, 0, 2, 1)
assert func_1((1, 2, 3, 4), (5, 6, 7, 8)) == (1, 2, 3, 0)
assert func_1((8, 9, 11, 12), (7, 13, 14, 17)) == (0, 9, 10, 0)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: tuple1 and tuple2 are tuples of the same length.
def func_1(tuple1, tuple2):
    return tuple(a & b for a, b in zip(tuple1, tuple2))
    #The program returns a tuple where each element is the intersection (logical AND) of corresponding elements from tuple1 and tuple2
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes two tuples, `tuple1` and `tuple2`, both of the same length, and returns a new tuple where each element is the result of the logical AND operation between the corresponding elements of `tuple1` and `tuple2`. This means that for each pair of elements `(a, b)` from `tuple1` and `tuple2` respectively, the function computes `a & b` and includes the result in the returned tuple. There are no edge cases mentioned or implied in the provided code; the function assumes that `tuple1` and `tuple2` are of the same length. If the tuples are empty, the returned tuple will also be empty. The function does not handle cases where the input tuples are of different lengths or contain non-boolean values, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
