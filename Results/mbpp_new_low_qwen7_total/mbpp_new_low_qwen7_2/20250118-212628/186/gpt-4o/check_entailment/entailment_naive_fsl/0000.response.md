Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program uses the bitwise AND (`&`) operation between corresponding elements of the two tuples. However, the problem description asks to extract elements from the tuples without any operation. The function `func_1` is performing an element-wise bitwise AND, which is not what the problem description requires.

For example, consider the tuples `(10, 4, 6, 9)` and `(5, 2, 3, 3)`. The expected output would be a tuple containing the corresponding elements, i.e., `(10, 4, 6, 9)`. However, the function returns `(0, 0, 2, 1)` because `10 & 5 = 0`, `4 & 2 = 0`, `6 & 3 = 2`, and `9 & 3 = 1`.

To meet the problem description, the function should simply return the tuple of corresponding elements without any operations:

```python
def func_1(tuple1, tuple2):
    return tuple(zip(tuple1, tuple2))
```

This would produce the correct output for the given examples and any other potential cases.
