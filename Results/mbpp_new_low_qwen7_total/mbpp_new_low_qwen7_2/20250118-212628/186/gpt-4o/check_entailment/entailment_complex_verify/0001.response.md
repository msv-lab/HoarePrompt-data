### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given function and the provided assertions step-by-step.

#### Function Analysis:
The function `func_1` is defined as follows:
```python
def func_1(tuple1, tuple2):
    return tuple(a & b for a, b in zip(tuple1, tuple2))
```
This function:
1. Uses `zip` to iterate over pairs of elements from `tuple1` and `tuple2`.
2. Computes the bitwise AND (`&`) of each pair of elements.
3. Returns a new tuple containing these results.

#### Assertions Analysis:
We need to verify if the function produces the expected results for the given assertions.

1. **Assertion:**
   ```python
   assert func_1((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3)) == (0, 0, 2, 1)
   ```
   - Compute each element:
     - \(10 \& 5 = 0\)
     - \(4 \& 2 = 0\)
     - \(6 \& 3 = 2\)
     - \(9 \& 3 = 1\)
   - The result is indeed `(0, 0, 2, 1)`.

2. **Assertion:**
   ```python
   assert func_1((1, 2, 3, 4), (5, 6, 7, 8)) == (1, 2, 3, 0)
   ```
   - Compute each element:
     - \(1 \& 5 = 1\)
     - \(2 \& 6 = 2\)
     - \(3 \& 7 = 3\)
     - \(4 \& 8 = 0\)
   - The result is indeed `(1, 2, 3, 0)`.

3. **Assertion:**
   ```python
   assert func_1((8, 9, 11, 12), (7, 13, 14, 17)) == (0, 9, 10, 0)
   ```
   - Compute each element:
     - \(8 \& 7 = 0\)
     - \(9 \& 13 = 9\)
     - \(11 \& 14 = 10\)
     - \(12 \& 17 = 0\)
   - The result is indeed `(0, 9, 10, 0)`.

All the assertions are verified to be correct. The function `func_1` is correctly implementing the bitwise AND operation on corresponding elements of the input tuples.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` performs the intended operation and the provided test cases pass without any errors.

### Final:
**True**
