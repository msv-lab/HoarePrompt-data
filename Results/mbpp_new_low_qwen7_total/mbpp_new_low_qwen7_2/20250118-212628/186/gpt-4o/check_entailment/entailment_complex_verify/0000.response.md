### Reasoning:

The original assessment is incorrect. Let's analyze the problem and the provided code step-by-step:

1. **Problem Description**: Extract the element-wise and tuples from the given two tuples. This suggests that the function should simply return a tuple containing the corresponding elements from the input tuples.

2. **Provided Code**:
   ```python
   def func_1(tuple1, tuple2):
       return tuple(a & b for a, b in zip(tuple1, tuple2))
   ```
   - The function uses the `zip` function to iterate over pairs of elements from `tuple1` and `tuple2`.
   - It then applies the bitwise AND (`&`) operation to each pair and returns the result as a tuple.

3. **Function Behavior**:
   - For the test case `(10, 4, 6, 9)` and `(5, 2, 3, 3)`, the function correctly returns `(0, 0, 2, 1)` because:
     - `10 & 5 = 0`
     - `4 & 2 = 0`
     - `6 & 3 = 2`
     - `9 & 3 = 1`
   - Similarly, for the test case `(1, 2, 3, 4)` and `(5, 6, 7, 8)`, the function correctly returns `(1, 2, 3, 0)` because:
     - `1 & 5 = 1`
     - `2 & 6 = 2`
     - `3 & 7 = 3`
     - `4 & 8 = 0`
   - For the test case `(8, 9, 11, 12)` and `(7, 13, 14, 17)`, the function correctly returns `(0, 9, 10, 0)` because:
     - `8 & 7 = 0`
     - `9 & 13 = 9`
     - `11 & 14 = 10`
     - `12 & 17 = 0`

4. **Expected Behavior vs. Given Behavior**:
   - The provided code performs the desired operation, which is to compute the bitwise AND of corresponding elements.
   - The original assessment incorrectly states that the function should just return the tuples themselves without any operation. This is not aligned with the provided test cases or the logical AND operation performed by the function.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is correct because it performs the intended operation of computing the bitwise AND of corresponding elements from the input tuples, which is consistent with the provided test cases. The original assessment is inaccurate as it misinterprets the problem requirements.
