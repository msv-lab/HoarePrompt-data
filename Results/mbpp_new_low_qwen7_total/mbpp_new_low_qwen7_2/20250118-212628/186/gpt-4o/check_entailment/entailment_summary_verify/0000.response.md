### Reasoning:

The original assessment is incorrect. Let's break down the problem and the provided solution step-by-step:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to extract the element-wise and tuples from the given two tuples. This implies that the function should return a tuple where each element is the corresponding element from the input tuples, without performing any operations like AND, OR, etc.

2. **Function Summary**: The function `func_1` is documented to perform a bitwise AND operation between corresponding elements of the two input tuples. This means for each pair of elements `(a, b)` from `tuple1` and `tuple2` respectively, the function computes `a & b` and includes the result in the returned tuple.

3. **Original Code**:
   ```python
   def func_1(tuple1, tuple2):
       return tuple((a & b for (a, b) in zip(tuple1, tuple2)))
   ```
   This code correctly implements the described behavior of performing a bitwise AND operation between corresponding elements of the two tuples. The use of `zip` ensures that elements are paired correctly, and the generator expression inside `tuple()` constructs the resulting tuple.

4. **Assertions**:
   - For `(10, 4, 6, 9)` and `(5, 2, 3, 3)`, the expected output is `(0, 0, 2, 1)` because `10 & 5 = 0`, `4 & 2 = 0`, `6 & 3 = 2`, and `9 & 3 = 1`.
   - For `(1, 2, 3, 4)` and `(5, 6, 7, 8)`, the expected output is `(1, 2, 3, 0)` because `1 & 5 = 1`, `2 & 6 = 2`, `3 & 7 = 3`, and `4 & 8 = 0`.
   - For `(8, 9, 11, 12)` and `(7, 13, 14, 17)`, the expected output is `(0, 9, 10, 0)` because `8 & 7 = 0`, `9 & 13 = 9`, `11 & 14 = 10`, and `12 & 17 = 0`.

Given the problem description and the function summary, the provided code is correct. It performs the intended operation (bitwise AND) as documented, and the assertions pass.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The original assessment was inaccurate because the function correctly performs the specified bitwise AND operation, which aligns with the problem description and the provided test cases.
