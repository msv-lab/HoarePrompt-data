Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` performs the bitwise AND operation on corresponding elements of the two input tuples. The provided assertions are all correct, and the function appears to behave as expected according to the given summaries.

However, there is a critical point that the original assessment might have overlooked: the function `func_1` does not handle the case where the input tuples contain non-integer values. Since the problem description and function summary imply that the function should operate on integer values, this should be considered. Nevertheless, the provided test cases and the function implementation itself only use integers, so the function is correct under these assumptions.

The original assessment correctly concludes that the function is correct based on the provided assertions and the logical AND operation performed.

Final: **True**
