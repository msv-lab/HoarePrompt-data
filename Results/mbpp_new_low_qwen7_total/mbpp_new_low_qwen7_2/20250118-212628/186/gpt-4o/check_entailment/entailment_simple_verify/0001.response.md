### Reasoning:

The original assessment claims that the function `func_1` correctly performs the bitwise AND operation on corresponding elements of the two input tuples and that all provided test cases pass without any errors. However, let's carefully analyze the function and the test cases to ensure its correctness.

The function `func_1` is defined as follows:
```python
def func_1(tuple1, tuple2):
    return tuple(a & b for a, b in zip(tuple1, tuple2))
```
This function takes two tuples, `tuple1` and `tuple2`, and returns a new tuple where each element is the result of the bitwise AND operation between the corresponding elements of the input tuples.

Now, let's re-examine the provided test cases:

1. `func_1((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3)) == (0, 0, 2, 1)`
   - \(10 \& 5 = 0\)
   - \(4 \& 2 = 0\)
   - \(6 \& 3 = 2\)
   - \(9 \& 3 = 1\)
   - This assertion is correct.

2. `func_1((1, 2, 3, 4), (5, 6, 7, 8)) == (1, 2, 3, 0)`
   - \(1 \& 5 = 1\)
   - \(2 \& 6 = 2\)
   - \(3 \& 7 = 3\)
   - \(4 \& 8 = 0\)
   - This assertion is correct.

3. `func_1((8, 9, 11, 12), (7, 13, 14, 17)) == (0, 9, 10, 0)`
   - \(8 \& 7 = 0\)
   - \(9 \& 13 = 9\)
   - \(11 \& 14 = 10\)
   - \(12 \& 17 = 0\)
   - This assertion is correct.

Upon re-evaluation, it appears that the original assessment is indeed accurate. The function correctly implements the bitwise AND operation, and all provided test cases are verified to be correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
