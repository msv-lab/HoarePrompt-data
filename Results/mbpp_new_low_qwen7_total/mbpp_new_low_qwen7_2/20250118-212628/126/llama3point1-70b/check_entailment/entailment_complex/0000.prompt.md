Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Write a function to find the lateral surface area of a cube given its side length.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: side_length is a positive real number.
def func_1(side_length):
    return 4 * side_length ** 2
    #The program returns 4 times the square of side_length
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `side_length`, which should be a positive real number. It calculates and returns the value 4 times the square of `side_length`. There are no edge cases or missing functionalities in the provided code. The function always computes \(4 \times \text{side\_length}^2\) and returns this value.

# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
