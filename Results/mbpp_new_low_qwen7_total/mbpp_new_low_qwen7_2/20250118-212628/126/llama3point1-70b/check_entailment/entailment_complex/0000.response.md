Reasoning:
The problem requires calculating the lateral surface area of a cube. The formula for the lateral surface area of a cube (the area of the four side faces) is \(4 \times \text{side\_length}^2\). 

Given the annotated program:

```python
def func_1(side_length):
    return 4 * side_length ** 2
    #The program returns 4 times the square of side_length
```

The function `func_1` correctly implements the formula \(4 \times \text{side\_length}^2\) for any positive real number input `side_length`. Since there are no edge cases or missing functionalities that could lead to incorrect results, and the implementation matches the required formula, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
