Reasoning: 
The problem requires calculating the lateral surface area of a cube given its side length. The formula for the lateral surface area of a cube is \(4 \times \text{side\_length}^2\). 

The provided function `func_1` correctly implements this formula by returning \(4 \times \text{side_length}^2\). Since there are no edge cases or missing functionalities mentioned, and the execution summary confirms that the function behaves as expected, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
