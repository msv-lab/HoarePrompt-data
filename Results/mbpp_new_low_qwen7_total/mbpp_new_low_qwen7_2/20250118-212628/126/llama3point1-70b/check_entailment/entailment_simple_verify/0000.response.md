### Reasoning:
Let's analyze the provided function `func_1` against the problem description and the given annotations:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to find the lateral surface area of a cube given its side length. For a cube, the lateral surface area is the area of the four side faces (excluding the top and bottom faces).

2. **Given Function**:
   ```python
   def func_1(side_length):
       return 4 * side_length ** 2
   ```

3. **Annotated Code**:
   - The function takes a single parameter `side_length`.
   - The function returns \(4 \times \text{side\_length}^2\).
   
   This annotation is correct. The formula used in the function matches the formula for the lateral surface area of a cube.

4. **Initial Assessment**:
   - The assessment states that the function is correct because it implements the formula \(4 \times \text{side\_length}^2\) which is indeed the formula for the lateral surface area of a cube.

However, we need to ensure that this formula is correct for the lateral surface area of a cube. The lateral surface area of a cube is the sum of the areas of the four side faces. Each face of a cube is a square with area \(\text{side\_length}^2\), and since there are four such faces, the total lateral surface area is \(4 \times \text{side\_length}^2\).

The function does appear to be correct as per the standard mathematical definition. However, the initial assessment does not explicitly mention the validity of the formula for the lateral surface area. It is generally good practice to confirm the correctness of the mathematical formulas used in programming problems.

### Final Evaluation:
Given that the function correctly implements the formula for the lateral surface area of a cube and there are no edge cases or issues with the implementation, the original assessment is accurate.

### Conclusion:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct based on the provided problem description and the standard mathematical formula for the lateral surface area of a cube.
