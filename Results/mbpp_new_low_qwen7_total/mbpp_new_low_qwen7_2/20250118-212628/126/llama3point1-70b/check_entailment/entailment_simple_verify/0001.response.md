### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the mathematical formula used in the function and the context in which it applies. However, there is a critical detail that needs to be addressed regarding the term "lateral surface area" for a cube.

- The original assessment states that the lateral surface area of a cube excludes the top and bottom faces. While this is mathematically true for other polyhedra (like a rectangular prism), for a cube, all six faces are identical, and the term "lateral surface area" can be misleading.

- The formula \(4 \times \text{side length}^2\) calculates the area of four of the six faces of the cube. This does indeed correspond to the lateral surface area if we consider it as the area of the four vertical faces, but it does not explicitly exclude the top and bottom faces in a way that the term "lateral surface area" might imply.

- In mathematical contexts, the term "lateral surface area" is often used to refer to the surface area of the sides of a solid shape, excluding the bases. For a cube, this would typically mean the area of the four vertical faces, which is exactly what the given function calculates.

Given these points, the function `func_1` correctly implements the calculation for the lateral surface area of a cube, even though the term might be slightly ambiguous. The original assessment is essentially correct in its conclusion, but there is room for a more precise explanation.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The function correctly implements the formula for the lateral surface area of a cube, and the term "lateral surface area" can be reasonably interpreted to include the four vertical faces of the cube. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
