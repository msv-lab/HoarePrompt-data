Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the lateral surface area of a cube given its side length. The formula for the lateral surface area of a cube is \(4 \times \text{side\_length}^2\). The function implements this formula accurately. Since the function works correctly for any positive side length, there are no edge cases or inputs where the function fails to meet the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
