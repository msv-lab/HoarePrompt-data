Reasoning: 
The formula for the lateral surface area (LSA) of a cube is \(4 \times \text{side length}^2\). This is correctly implemented in the given function `func_1`, where `4 * side_length ** 2` calculates the LSA of a cube with the given side length.

However, it's worth noting that the term "lateral surface area" typically refers to the area of the sides excluding the top and bottom faces. For a cube, the total surface area (TSA) would be \(6 \times \text{side length}^2\), but since the problem specifically asks for the lateral surface area, which should exclude the top and bottom faces, the given implementation is correct.

Given this understanding, the provided program accurately calculates the lateral surface area of a cube.

Correctness: **True**
