Reasoning: 
The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` implements the formula for the lateral surface area of a cube, which is \(4 \times \text{side\_length}^2\). However, the problem description specifically asks for the lateral surface area of a cube, which refers to the area of the four side faces, excluding the top and bottom faces. For a cube, the total surface area is \(6 \times \text{side\_length}^2\), but the lateral surface area is only the sum of the areas of the four side faces, which is indeed \(4 \times \text{side\_length}^2\).

Given that the function summary confirms the function always computes \(4 \times \text{side\_length}^2\) and there are no edge cases or missing functionalities mentioned, the function correctly meets the requirement of calculating the lateral surface area of a cube.

Final: **True**
