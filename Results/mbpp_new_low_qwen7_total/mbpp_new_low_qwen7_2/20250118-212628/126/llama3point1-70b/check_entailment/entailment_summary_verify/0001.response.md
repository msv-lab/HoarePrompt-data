Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the given function `func_1` implements the formula for the lateral surface area (LSA) of a cube, which is \(4 \times \text{side\_length}^2\). However, there is a subtle misunderstanding in the original assessment regarding the definition of "lateral surface area." Typically, the term "lateral surface area" for a cube indeed refers to the sum of the areas of the four side faces, which is exactly what the function `func_1` computes. Therefore, the function correctly implements the intended calculation.

Given this understanding, the provided program accurately calculates the lateral surface area of a cube.

Final: **True**
