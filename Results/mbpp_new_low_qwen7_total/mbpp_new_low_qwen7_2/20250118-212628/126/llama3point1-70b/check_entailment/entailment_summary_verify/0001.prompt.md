You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Write a function to find the lateral surface area of a cube given its side length.

- Program:
def func_1(side_length):
    return 4 * side_length ** 2



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `side_length`, which should be a positive real number. It calculates and returns the value 4 times the square of `side_length`. There are no edge cases or missing functionalities in the provided code. The function always computes \(4 \times \text{side\_length}^2\) and returns this value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning: 
The formula for the lateral surface area (LSA) of a cube is \(4 \times \text{side length}^2\). This is correctly implemented in the given function `func_1`, where `4 * side_length ** 2` calculates the LSA of a cube with the given side length.

However, it's worth noting that the term "lateral surface area" typically refers to the area of the sides excluding the top and bottom faces. For a cube, the total surface area (TSA) would be \(6 \times \text{side length}^2\), but since the problem specifically asks for the lateral surface area, which should exclude the top and bottom faces, the given implementation is correct.

Given this understanding, the provided program accurately calculates the lateral surface area of a cube.

Correctness: **True**
