Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies that the formula used in the function `func_1` is appropriate for calculating the lateral surface area (LSA) of a cube. The LSA of a cube, which excludes the top and bottom faces, is indeed given by the formula \(4 \times \text{side length}^2\).

Let's break down the program and the annotations:

1. **Problem Description**: Calculate the lateral surface area of a cube given its side length.
2. **Program Code**:
   ```python
   def func_1(side_length):
       return 4 * side_length ** 2
   ```
3. **Annotated Code**:
   - The function `func_1` takes `side_length` as a positive real number.
   - It returns \(4 \times \text{side\_length}^2\).
4. **Original Assessment**:
   - The formula \(4 \times \text{side length}^2\) is correctly implemented.
   - The term "lateral surface area" for a cube refers to the area of the four side faces, which matches the given implementation.
   - Therefore, the program accurately calculates the lateral surface area.

Since the program correctly implements the formula for the lateral surface area of a cube, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
