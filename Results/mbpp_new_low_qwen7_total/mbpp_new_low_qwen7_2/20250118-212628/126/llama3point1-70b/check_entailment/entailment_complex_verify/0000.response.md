Reasoning: 
The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly implements the formula for the lateral surface area of a cube, which is indeed \(4 \times \text{side\_length}^2\). The function takes a positive real number as input and returns the correct result based on the formula. There are no edge cases mentioned in the problem statement that would cause the function to fail, such as zero or negative side lengths, which are not valid for a cube. Given that the problem description only requires valid inputs (positive real numbers), the function handles these inputs correctly.

Final: **True**
