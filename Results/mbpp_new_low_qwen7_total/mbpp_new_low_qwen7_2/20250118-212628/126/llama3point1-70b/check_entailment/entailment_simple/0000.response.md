Reasoning:
The problem statement asks for a function that calculates the lateral surface area of a cube given its side length. The formula for the lateral surface area of a cube is \(4 \times \text{side\_length}^2\).

Let's analyze the provided code:

```python
def func_1(side_length):
    return 4 * side_length ** 2
    #The program returns 4 times the square of side_length
```

- The function `func_1` takes one parameter `side_length`.
- It correctly uses the formula \(4 \times \text{side\_length}^2\) to calculate the lateral surface area.
- The comment accurately describes what the code does, which is returning 4 times the square of `side_length`.

Given that the code correctly implements the formula for the lateral surface area of a cube and there are no other conditions or logic errors, the function is correct according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
