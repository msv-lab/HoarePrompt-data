Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst` and calculates the sum of the number of unique pairs where both elements are even (`even_pairs`) and the number of unique pairs where both elements are odd (`odd_pairs`). It returns this total sum. The function first counts the number of even and odd numbers in the list, then uses these counts to determine the possible unique pairs of even and odd numbers. Any potential edge cases, such as an empty list or a list with only even or odd numbers, are handled correctly.**
