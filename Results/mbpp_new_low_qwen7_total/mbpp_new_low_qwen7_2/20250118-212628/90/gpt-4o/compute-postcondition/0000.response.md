Initial State: `lst` is a list of integers.

Code Execution:
1. `even_count = sum(1 for x in lst if x % 2 == 0)`
   - This line counts the number of even integers in `lst` and stores it in `even_count`.

2. `odd_count = len(lst) - even_count`
   - This line calculates the number of odd integers in `lst` by subtracting the count of even integers from the total length of `lst` and stores it in `odd_count`.

3. `even_pairs = even_count * (even_count - 1) // 2`
   - This line calculates the number of unique pairs that can be formed from the even integers in `lst` using the combination formula \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \) and stores it in `even_pairs`.

4. `odd_pairs = odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2`
   - This line calculates the number of unique pairs that can be formed from the odd integers in `lst` using the combination formula \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \) and stores it in `odd_pairs`.

Final State: **even_count is the count of even numbers in lst, odd_count is the count of odd numbers in lst, even_pairs is the number of unique even pairs, odd_pairs is the number of unique odd pairs**

Since the actual list `lst` is not provided, we cannot provide specific numeric values for `even_count`, `odd_count`, `even_pairs`, and `odd_pairs`. However, these variables now hold the values calculated based on the list `lst`. 

Output State: **even_count is the count of even numbers in lst, odd_count is the count of odd numbers in lst, even_pairs is the number of unique even pairs, odd_pairs is the number of unique odd pairs**
