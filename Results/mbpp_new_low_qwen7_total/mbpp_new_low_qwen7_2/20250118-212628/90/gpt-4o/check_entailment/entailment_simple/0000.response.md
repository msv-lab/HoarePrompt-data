### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code step by step:

1. **Count of Even Numbers (`even_count`)**:
   - `even_count` correctly counts the number of even numbers in the list.

2. **Count of Odd Numbers (`odd_count`)**:
   - `odd_count` calculates the number of odd numbers in the list by subtracting the count of even numbers from the total length of the list.

3. **Even Pairs Calculation**:
   - The formula `even_pairs = even_count * (even_count - 1) // 2` is used to calculate the number of unique pairs of even numbers. This formula is derived from the combination formula \( \binom{n}{2} \), which correctly gives the number of ways to choose 2 items from `n` items.

4. **Odd Pairs Calculation**:
   - Similarly, the formula `odd_pairs = odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2` is used to calculate the number of unique pairs of odd numbers.

5. **Total Pairs Calculation**:
   - The final result is obtained by adding `even_pairs` and `odd_pairs`.

However, the code does not actually check for pairs whose XOR results in an even number. Instead, it assumes that pairs of even numbers and pairs of odd numbers will have an even XOR result, which is incorrect. 

- **XOR of Two Even Numbers**: Results in an even number.
- **XOR of Two Odd Numbers**: Also results in an even number.
- **XOR of One Even and One Odd Number**: Results in an odd number.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate through the list and count the pairs where the XOR of the two numbers is even. The current logic does not achieve this.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the functionality required by the problem statement. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
