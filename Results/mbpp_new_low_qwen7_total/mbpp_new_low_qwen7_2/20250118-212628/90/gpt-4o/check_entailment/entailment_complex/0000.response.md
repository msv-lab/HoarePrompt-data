Reasoning:

The provided function `func_1` attempts to count the number of pairs of integers in a list that XOR to an even number. However, there is a fundamental flaw in its logic. The function currently counts the number of unique pairs where both elements are either even or both are odd. This approach does not account for pairs where one element is even and the other is odd, which would result in an even XOR value. 

For two integers to XOR to an even number, they can either both be even, both be odd, or one can be even and the other odd. Therefore, the function should also consider pairs where one integer is even and the other is odd.

Let's correct the logic:

1. Count the number of even numbers in the list.
2. Count the number of odd numbers in the list.
3. Calculate the number of pairs where both numbers are even.
4. Calculate the number of pairs where both numbers are odd.
5. Calculate the number of pairs where one number is even and the other is odd.

Given the current implementation, it only accounts for the first two points but misses the third point. Therefore, the current implementation is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
