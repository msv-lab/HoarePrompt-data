Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Write a function that counts the number of pairs of integers in a list that xor to an even number.

# Program:
assert func_1([5, 4, 7, 2, 1]) == 4
assert func_1([7, 2, 8, 1, 0, 5, 11]) == 9
assert func_1([1, 2, 3]) == 1

def func_1(lst):
    even_count = sum((1 for x in lst if x % 2 == 0))
    odd_count = len(lst) - even_count
    even_pairs = even_count * (even_count - 1) // 2
    odd_pairs = odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2
    return even_pairs + odd_pairs





# Execution Summary:
The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst` and calculates the sum of the number of unique pairs where both elements are even (`even_pairs`) and the number of unique pairs where both elements are odd (`odd_pairs`). It returns this total sum. The function first counts the number of even and odd numbers in the list, then uses these counts to determine the possible unique pairs of even and odd numbers. Any potential edge cases, such as an empty list or a list with only even or odd numbers, are handled correctly.


# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
