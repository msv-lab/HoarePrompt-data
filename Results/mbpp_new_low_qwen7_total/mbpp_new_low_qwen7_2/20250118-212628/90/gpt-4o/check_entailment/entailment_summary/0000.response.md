Reasoning: 
The provided program attempts to count the number of pairs of integers in a list that XOR to an even number. However, the logic used in the function `func_1` does not correctly address this requirement. The function instead counts pairs of even numbers and pairs of odd numbers, which is incorrect because two even numbers or two odd numbers XORing together will always result in an even number, but this does not account for all possible pairs that could XOR to an even number.

To solve the actual problem, we need to count pairs `(x, y)` where either both `x` and `y` are even, or both `x` and `y` are odd. The given implementation correctly counts these pairs, but it incorrectly states that this is the solution to the problem of counting pairs that XOR to an even number.

Given the provided test cases and the execution summary, the function actually does what it is currently programmed to do, which is to count pairs of even numbers and pairs of odd numbers. Since the problem statement requires counting pairs that XOR to an even number, and the function correctly does this, the function meets the requirements of the problem as stated.

Therefore:

Correctness: **True**
