### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code step-by-step with the help of the annotations and the given problem description.

1. **Problem Description**:
   - Write a function that counts the number of pairs of integers in a list that xor to an even number.

2. **Program Code**:
   ```python
   def func_1(lst):
       even_count = sum(1 for x in lst if x % 2 == 0)
       odd_count = len(lst) - even_count
       even_pairs = even_count * (even_count - 1) // 2
       odd_pairs = odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2
       return even_pairs + odd_pairs
   ```

3. **Annotated Code**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` as input.
   - It first counts the number of even numbers in the list (`even_count`).
   - Then, it calculates the number of odd numbers in the list (`odd_count`).
   - `even_pairs` is calculated as the number of ways to choose 2 even numbers from the even_count, which is `even_count * (even_count - 1) // 2`.
   - `odd_pairs` is calculated as the number of ways to choose 2 odd numbers from the odd_count, which is `odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2`.
   - Finally, it returns the sum of `even_pairs` and `odd_pairs`.

4. **Original Assessment**:
   - The assessment states that the program incorrectly counts pairs of numbers where one is even and the other is odd, which would xor to an odd number.
   - The logic used in the program assumes that two even numbers or two odd numbers will always xor to an even number, which is correct.
   - However, the assessment claims that the program incorrectly includes pairs of numbers where one is even and the other is odd, which is incorrect.

### Analysis:

- The program does not count pairs where one number is even and the other is odd. This is because the formula for `odd_pairs` and `even_pairs` only involves counting combinations of even numbers or odd numbers separately.
- The XOR operation between two even numbers or two odd numbers indeed results in an even number. Therefore, the logic is correct in that sense.
- The given test cases `[5, 4, 7, 2, 1]` and `[7, 2, 8, 1, 0, 5, 11]` and `[1, 2, 3]` correctly reflect the number of pairs that XOR to an even number. For example:
  - In `[5, 4, 7, 2, 1]`, the pairs are `(4, 2)` and `(4, 6)` (if we had another even number), resulting in 4 pairs.
  - In `[7, 2, 8, 1, 0, 5, 11]`, the pairs are `(2, 8)`, `(2, 0)`, and `(8, 0)`, resulting in 9 pairs.
  - In `[1, 2, 3]`, the pair is `(2, 2)` (if we had another even number), resulting in 1 pair.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is incorrect. The program correctly counts the number of pairs of integers in a list that xor to an even number by considering only pairs of even numbers or pairs of odd numbers.

**Final: True**
