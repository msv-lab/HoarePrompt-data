### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the function `func_1` and its logic step-by-step, using the annotated version and the provided test cases.

1. **Count Even and Odd Numbers**:
   - The function correctly counts the number of even numbers using `even_count = sum((1 for x in lst if x % 2 == 0))`.
   - It then calculates the number of odd numbers as `odd_count = len(lst) - even_count`.

2. **Calculate Pairs**:
   - The number of pairs of even numbers is calculated using the combination formula \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \), where `n` is the number of even numbers. This is stored in `even_pairs`.
   - Similarly, the number of pairs of odd numbers is calculated using the same formula, stored in `odd_pairs`.

3. **Total Pairs**:
   - The total number of pairs that XOR to an even number is the sum of `even_pairs` and `odd_pairs`.

The logic in the function is sound. However, let's verify the test cases provided:

- **First Test Case**: `func_1([5, 4, 7, 2, 1])`
  - Even numbers: `4, 2` (2 even numbers)
  - Odd numbers: `5, 7, 1` (3 odd numbers)
  - Even pairs: \( \frac{2(2-1)}{2} = 1 \)
  - Odd pairs: \( \frac{3(3-1)}{2} = 3 \)
  - Total pairs: \( 1 + 3 = 4 \)
  - Expected result: 4
  - The function returns 4, which is correct.

- **Second Test Case**: `func_1([7, 2, 8, 1, 0, 5, 11])`
  - Even numbers: `2, 8, 0` (3 even numbers)
  - Odd numbers: `7, 1, 5, 11` (4 odd numbers)
  - Even pairs: \( \frac{3(3-1)}{2} = 3 \)
  - Odd pairs: \( \frac{4(4-1)}{2} = 6 \)
  - Total pairs: \( 3 + 6 = 9 \)
  - Expected result: 9
  - The function returns 9, which is correct.

- **Third Test Case**: `func_1([1, 2, 3])`
  - Even numbers: `2` (1 even number)
  - Odd numbers: `1, 3` (2 odd numbers)
  - Even pairs: \( \frac{1(1-1)}{2} = 0 \)
  - Odd pairs: \( \frac{2(2-1)}{2} = 1 \)
  - Total pairs: \( 0 + 1 = 1 \)
  - Expected result: 1
  - The function returns 1, which is correct.

All the test cases provided in the original assessment are consistent with the function's logic. Therefore, the function `func_1` is indeed correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
