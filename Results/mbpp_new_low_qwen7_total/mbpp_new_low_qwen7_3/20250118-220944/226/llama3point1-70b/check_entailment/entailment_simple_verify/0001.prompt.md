You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Write a python function to count the number of pairs whose xor value is odd.

- Program: 
def func_1(arr, n):
    odd_count = sum((1 for num in arr if num % 2 != 0))
    even_count = n - odd_count
    return odd_count * even_count + odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of non-negative integers, and n is the length of the list such that 2 <= n.
def func_1(arr, n):
    odd_count = sum(1 for num in arr if num % 2 != 0)

even_count = n - odd_count
    return odd_count * even_count + odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2
    #`odd_count * even_count + odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2`



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

The problem requires counting the number of pairs in an array whose XOR value is odd. For the XOR of two numbers to be odd, one of the numbers must be even and the other must be odd. 

Let's break down the given program:
- `odd_count` is calculated as the count of odd numbers in the array.
- `even_count` is calculated as the total number of elements minus the count of odd numbers.
- The return statement computes the number of valid pairs using the formula: 
  - `odd_count * even_count`: This accounts for pairs where one number is odd and the other is even.
  - `odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2`: This accounts for pairs where both numbers are odd. Since we only want pairs with an odd XOR, this term should not be included as it represents pairs of odd numbers which result in an even XOR.

However, the second term (`odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2`) is incorrectly included in the calculation, which will count pairs of odd numbers, resulting in an incorrect count of pairs with an odd XOR.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly count the number of pairs whose XOR value is odd.

### Correctness:
**False**
