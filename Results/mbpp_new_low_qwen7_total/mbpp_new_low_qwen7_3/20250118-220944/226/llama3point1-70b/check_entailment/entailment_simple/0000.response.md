### Reasoning:

The goal of the function `func_1` is to count the number of pairs in the list `arr` whose XOR value is odd. 

For the XOR of two numbers to be odd, one of the numbers must be odd and the other must be even. Therefore, we need to count the number of odd and even numbers in the array. Let's break down the given code:

1. `odd_count = sum(1 for num in arr if num % 2 != 0)`:
   - This line correctly counts the number of odd numbers in the array.

2. `even_count = n - odd_count`:
   - This line calculates the number of even numbers in the array, which is correct because the total number of elements minus the number of odd elements gives the number of even elements.

3. The return statement `return odd_count * even_count + odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2`:
   - `odd_count * even_count`: This part correctly counts pairs where one element is odd and the other is even.
   - `odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2`: This part is meant to count pairs where both elements are odd. However, this is not necessary because we only need pairs where one is odd and the other is even to get an odd XOR value. Counting pairs of odd numbers would be relevant if we were counting the number of pairs with an even XOR value.

Given that the problem only requires counting pairs with an odd XOR value, the term `odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2` is unnecessary and incorrect.

### Correctness:
- The function should only return `odd_count * even_count` to correctly count the number of pairs with an odd XOR value.

Therefore, the given implementation is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
