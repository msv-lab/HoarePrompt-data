Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Write a python function to count the number of pairs whose xor value is odd.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of non-negative integers, and n is the length of the list such that 2 <= n.
def func_1(arr, n):
    odd_count = sum(1 for num in arr if num % 2 != 0)

even_count = n - odd_count
    return odd_count * even_count + odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2
    #`odd_count * even_count + odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of non-negative integers and its length `n`, and returns the value calculated as `odd_count * even_count + odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2`, where `odd_count` is the count of odd numbers in the list and `even_count` is the count of even numbers in the list. The function first calculates the count of odd numbers (`odd_count`) by iterating through the list `arr`. Then, it calculates the count of even numbers (`even_count`) as `n - odd_count`. Finally, it computes and returns the value based on these counts. Potential edge cases include an empty list (which would result in `odd_count` and `even_count` being 0), a list with only one element (which would violate the condition `2 <= n`), and a list with no odd or even numbers (though this is handled by the logic).
