### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the issue with the formula used in the return statement. Let's analyze the logic step-by-step:

1. **Odd and Even Counts**:
   - `odd_count` is correctly calculated as the count of odd numbers in the array.
   - `even_count` is correctly calculated as the count of even numbers in the array.

2. **Formula Breakdown**:
   - `odd_count * even_count`: This term correctly counts the number of pairs where one number is odd and the other is even, which will always result in an odd XOR.
   - `odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2`: This term attempts to count the number of pairs where both numbers are odd, but this is incorrect because such pairs will result in an even XOR, not an odd XOR.

Given that the goal is to count pairs with an odd XOR, the term `odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2` is redundant and incorrect. The formula should only include `odd_count * even_count`.

Let's verify the logic with some examples:

- **Example 1**: `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]`
  - `odd_count = 3` (1, 3)
  - `even_count = 1` (2)
  - Expected output: `3 * 1 = 3` (pairs: (1, 2), (3, 2))
  - Actual output: `3 * 1 + 3 * (3 - 1) // 2 = 3 + 3 = 6` (incorrect due to the extra term)

- **Example 2**: `arr = [1, 3, 5]`
  - `odd_count = 3` (all elements are odd)
  - `even_count = 0`
  - Expected output: `0` (no pairs with an odd XOR)
  - Actual output: `3 * 0 + 3 * (3 - 1) // 2 = 0 + 3 = 3` (incorrect due to the extra term)

The original assessment is accurate in identifying the mistake and concluding that the given program does not correctly count the number of pairs whose XOR value is odd.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly count the number of pairs whose XOR value is odd.

### Final:
**False**
