### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given problem and the program step-by-step to verify the correctness of the provided solution.

#### Problem Description:
We need to count the number of pairs in the array `arr` whose XOR value is odd. A pair's XOR value is odd if and only if one of the numbers in the pair is odd and the other is even.

#### Given Program:
```python
def func_1(arr, n):
    odd_count = sum(1 for num in arr if num % 2 != 0)
    even_count = n - odd_count
    return odd_count * even_count + odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2
```

#### Annotated Code Analysis:
1. **Odd Count Calculation:**
   ```python
   odd_count = sum(1 for num in arr if num % 2 != 0)
   ```
   This line correctly counts the number of odd numbers in the list `arr`.

2. **Even Count Calculation:**
   ```python
   even_count = n - odd_count
   ```
   This line correctly calculates the number of even numbers in the list `arr`.

3. **Return Value Calculation:**
   ```python
   return odd_count * even_count + odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2
   ```
   - `odd_count * even_count`: This term counts pairs where one number is odd and the other is even.
   - `odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2`: This term counts pairs where both numbers are odd. However, since the XOR of two odd numbers is even, this term should not be included in the count of pairs with odd XOR values.

#### Correctness Analysis:
The formula `odd_count * even_count + odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2` incorrectly includes pairs of two odd numbers, which do not contribute to the count of pairs with an odd XOR value. 

To correctly count the pairs with an odd XOR value, we should only consider pairs where one number is odd and the other is even. Thus, the correct formula should be:
```python
return odd_count * even_count
```

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment incorrectly includes the term `odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2` in the return value, which leads to an incorrect count of pairs. The correct approach is to only consider pairs where one number is odd and the other is even.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Final:
Final: **False**
