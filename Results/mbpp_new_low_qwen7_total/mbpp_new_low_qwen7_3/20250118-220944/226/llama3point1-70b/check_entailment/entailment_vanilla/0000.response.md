### Reasoning:

The problem requires counting the number of pairs in an array whose XOR value is odd. For the XOR of two numbers to be odd, one of the numbers must be even and the other must be odd. 

Let's break down the given program:
- `odd_count` is calculated as the count of odd numbers in the array.
- `even_count` is calculated as the total number of elements minus the count of odd numbers.
- The return statement computes the number of valid pairs using the formula: 
  - `odd_count * even_count`: This accounts for pairs where one number is odd and the other is even.
  - `odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2`: This accounts for pairs where both numbers are odd. Since we only want pairs with an odd XOR, this term should not be included as it represents pairs of odd numbers which result in an even XOR.

However, the second term (`odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2`) is incorrectly included in the calculation, which will count pairs of odd numbers, resulting in an incorrect count of pairs with an odd XOR.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly count the number of pairs whose XOR value is odd.

### Correctness:
**False**
