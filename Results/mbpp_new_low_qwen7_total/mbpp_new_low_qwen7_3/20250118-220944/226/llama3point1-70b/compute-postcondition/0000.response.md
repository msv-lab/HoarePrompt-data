Initial State: `arr` is a list of non-negative integers, and `n` is the length of the list such that 2 <= n.

Code Execution:
1. `odd_count = sum(1 for num in arr if num % 2 != 0)`
   - This line calculates the number of odd numbers in the list `arr` and assigns it to `odd_count`.
2. `even_count = n - odd_count`
   - This line calculates the number of even numbers in the list `arr` (since `n` is the total number of elements and `odd_count` is the count of odd numbers) and assigns it to `even_count`.

Final Output State: **arr is a list of non-negative integers, n is the length of the list, odd_count is the number of odd numbers in arr, and even_count is the number of even numbers in arr**
