The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr`, which is a list of non-negative integers, and `n`, which is the length of the list and satisfies the condition that 2 <= n. The function returns the value of `odd_count * even_count + odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2`, where `odd_count` is the count of odd numbers in the list and `even_count` is the count of even numbers in the list.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `arr` of non-negative integers and its length `n`, and return the value calculated based on the counts of odd and even numbers in the list.
