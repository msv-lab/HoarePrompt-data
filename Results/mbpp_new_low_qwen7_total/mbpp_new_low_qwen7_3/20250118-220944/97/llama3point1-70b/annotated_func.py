#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a sorted list of integers, n is a positive integer representing the length of arr, and x is an integer.
def func_1(arr, n, x):
    count = arr.count(x)
    return count > n / 2
    #`The program returns True if the count of integer `x` in list `arr` is more than half the length of `arr`, otherwise it returns False`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a sorted list of integers `arr`, a positive integer `n` representing the length of `arr`, and an integer `x`. It counts the occurrences of `x` in `arr` and returns `True` if the count is greater than half the length of `arr`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. This means that if `x` appears more than `n/2` times in the list, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function does not modify the input list `arr`.
