Reasoning:

The provided function `func_1` attempts to solve the problem by counting the occurrences of the element `x` in the array `arr` and checking if this count is greater than `n / 2`. However, there are a few issues with this approach:

1. **Efficiency**: The line `count = arr.count(x)` has a time complexity of O(n) because it iterates through the entire array to count the occurrences of `x`. This is not efficient for large arrays.

2. **Correctness**: While the logic to check if the count is greater than `n / 2` is correct, the use of `arr.count(x)` does not ensure that `x` is the majority element if it is present. For example, if `arr` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]` and `x` is `1`, `arr.count(x)` will return `1` (since `1` only appears once), which is not more than `n / 2` (which would be `3.5` in this case).

A more efficient and correct approach would be to directly check the middle index of the array since a majority element, if it exists, must appear at the middle index in a sorted array due to its frequency being more than half.

Given these points, the provided solution is not fully correct as it relies on the less efficient `count` method. However, for the purpose of determining correctness based on the logic and expected behavior, we can evaluate the logical correctness of the given code.

Correctness: **False**
