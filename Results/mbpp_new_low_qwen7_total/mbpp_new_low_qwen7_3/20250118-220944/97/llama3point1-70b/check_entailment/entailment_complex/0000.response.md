Reasoning:
1. The function `func_1` correctly checks if the element `x` appears more than `n/2` times in the sorted array `arr`.
2. It uses the `count` method to determine the number of occurrences of `x` in `arr`.
3. If the count of `x` is greater than `n/2`, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.
4. The function correctly implements the logic for identifying a majority element in a sorted array as per the problem statement.

Given the above points, the provided implementation of the function is correct according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
