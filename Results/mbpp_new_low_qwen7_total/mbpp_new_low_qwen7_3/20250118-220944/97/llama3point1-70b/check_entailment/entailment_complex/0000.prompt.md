Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Write a function that takes in a sorted array, its length (n), and an element and returns whether the element is the majority element in the given sorted array. (The majority element is the element that occurs more than n/2 times.)

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a sorted list of integers, n is a positive integer representing the length of arr, and x is an integer.
def func_1(arr, n, x):
    count = arr.count(x)
    return count > n / 2
    #`The program returns True if the count of integer `x` in list `arr` is more than half the length of `arr`, otherwise it returns False`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a sorted list of integers `arr`, a positive integer `n` representing the length of `arr`, and an integer `x`. It counts the occurrences of `x` in `arr` and returns `True` if the count is greater than half the length of `arr`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. This means that if `x` appears more than `n/2` times in the list, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function does not modify the input list `arr`.

# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
