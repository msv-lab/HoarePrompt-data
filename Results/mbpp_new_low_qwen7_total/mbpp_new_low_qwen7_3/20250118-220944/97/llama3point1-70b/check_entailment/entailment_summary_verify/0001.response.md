Reasoning:
- The function summary accurately describes the behavior of `func_1`: it counts the occurrences of `x` in `arr` and returns `True` if the count is greater than `n / 2`.
- However, the problem description specifies that the majority element must appear more than `n/2` times in the array, which means it must occupy more than half of the array's positions. The function summary correctly captures this requirement.
- The original assessment correctly points out that the `count` method simply counts the occurrences of `x` without considering its position in the sorted array. This means that even if `x` appears more than `n/2` times, the `count` method alone cannot ensure that `x` occupies more than half of the array's positions.
- To correctly determine if `x` is the majority element in a sorted array, we would need to check the position of `x` in the array, not just its count. For example, in a sorted array, if `x` appears in more than `n/2` positions, it must be the middle element or one of the middle elements.
- The original assessment is accurate in stating that the current implementation does not correctly identify if the element is the majority element based on the provided logic. Therefore, the program as written does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.

Final: **False**
