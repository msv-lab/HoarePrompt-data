### Reasoning:

The original assessment is **inaccurate**. The provided function `func_1` actually correctly implements the logic required to determine if an element is the majority element in a sorted array. The function summary accurately describes the behavior of the function. 

Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Function Behavior**: The function `func_1` uses the `count` method to determine how many times the element `x` appears in the array `arr`. If the count is greater than `n / 2`, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

2. **Majority Element Definition**: An element is considered the majority element if it appears more than `n / 2` times in the array. The function checks exactly this condition.

3. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - **Array**: `[1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5]`
   - **Length**: `7`
   - **Element**: `5`

   In this case, `5` appears twice, which is not more than `7 / 2 = 3.5`. The function `func_1` will correctly return `False` for this test case.

The provided example and test case demonstrate that the function works as intended. The function correctly identifies that `5` is not a majority element. Therefore, the original assessment's claim that the function is incorrect is based on a misunderstanding of the function's implementation and logic.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The given program is correct according to the problem description and the provided function summary.
