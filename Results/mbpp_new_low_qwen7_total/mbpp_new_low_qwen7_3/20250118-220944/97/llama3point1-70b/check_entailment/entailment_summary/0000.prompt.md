Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Write a function that takes in a sorted array, its length (n), and an element and returns whether the element is the majority element in the given sorted array. (The majority element is the element that occurs more than n/2 times.)

# Program:
def func_1(arr, n, x):
    count = arr.count(x)
    return count > n / 2





# Execution Summary:
The function `func_1` accepts a sorted list of integers `arr`, a positive integer `n` representing the length of `arr`, and an integer `x`. It counts the occurrences of `x` in `arr` and returns `True` if the count is greater than half the length of `arr`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. This means that if `x` appears more than `n/2` times in the list, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function does not modify the input list `arr`.


# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
