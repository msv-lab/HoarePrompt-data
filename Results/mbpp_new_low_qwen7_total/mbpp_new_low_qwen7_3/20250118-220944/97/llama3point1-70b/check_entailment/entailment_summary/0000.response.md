Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to check if the element `x` is the majority element in the sorted array `arr`. The function `func_1` uses the `count` method to find how many times `x` appears in `arr` and compares this count with `n / 2` to determine if `x` is a majority element. Given the problem description and the execution summary, the function should return `True` if the count of `x` is greater than `n / 2`, and `False` otherwise. The function does not have any issues with logic or implementation based on the provided information.

Correctness: **True**
