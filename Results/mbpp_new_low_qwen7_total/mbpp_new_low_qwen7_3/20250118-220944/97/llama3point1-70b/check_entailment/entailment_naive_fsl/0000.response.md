Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program uses the `count` method to determine the number of occurrences of the element `x` in the array `arr`. However, this approach does not guarantee that the program works correctly for every potential case. Specifically, the problem requires finding out if the element is the majority element, which means it needs to occur more than `n/2` times.

Consider the following test case:
- Array: `[1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5]`
- Length: `7`
- Element: `5`

In this case, the element `5` appears twice, which is not more than `7/2 = 3.5`. Therefore, `5` is not a majority element. However, the program will incorrectly return `True` because it only checks the count and does not verify if the count is greater than `n/2`.

To fix this, the program should ensure that the element `x` appears more than `n/2` times. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(arr, n, x):
    count = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == x:
            count += 1
    return count > n // 2
```

This version iterates through the array to count the occurrences of `x` and then checks if the count is greater than `n//2`.
