Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a sorted list of integers `arr`, a positive integer `n` representing the length of `arr`, and an integer `x`. It counts the occurrences of `x` in `arr` and returns `True` if the count is greater than half the length of `arr`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. This means that if `x` appears more than `n/2` times in the list, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function does not modify the input list `arr`.**

Potential Edge Cases:
- If `x` is not present in `arr`, the function will return `False`.
- If `n` is 1, the function will return `True` only if `x` is the single element in `arr`.
- If `n` is even, the function checks if `x` appears strictly more than `n/2` times, not including exactly `n/2` times.

Missing Functionality:
- The code does not handle cases where `arr` contains duplicate elements in a way that could affect the count (though the `count` method should correctly handle duplicates). However, since the code does not explicitly address this, no additional functionality is needed beyond what is described.
