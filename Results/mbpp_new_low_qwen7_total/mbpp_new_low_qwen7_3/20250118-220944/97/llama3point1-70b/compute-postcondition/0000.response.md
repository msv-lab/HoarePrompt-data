`count` is assigned the value of `arr.count(x)`, which counts how many times the integer `x` appears in the list `arr`. Since `arr` is a sorted list of integers and `x` is an integer, `count` will store the number of occurrences of `x` in `arr`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is a positive integer representing the length of `arr`, `x` is an integer, and `count` is the number of times `x` appears in `arr`.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is a positive integer representing the length of `arr`, `x` is an integer, `count` is the number of times `x` appears in `arr`.**
