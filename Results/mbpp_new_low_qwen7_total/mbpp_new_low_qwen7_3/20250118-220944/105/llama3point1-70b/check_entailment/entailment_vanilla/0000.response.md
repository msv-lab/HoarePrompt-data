### Reasoning:

To determine if the provided program correctly sets all even bits of a given number, we need to understand what "setting all even bits" means and verify if the function `func_1` achieves this.

1. **Understanding Even Bits**: In binary representation, even bits are the bits at positions that are multiples of 2 (i.e., 0th, 2nd, 4th, etc.). For example, for the number 0b101010 (which is 42 in decimal), the even bits are 0th and 2nd positions.

2. **Binary Representation of the Magic Number**: The magic number used in the function is `2863311530`. Let's convert this number to its binary form:
   - `2863311530` in binary is `0b10101010101010101010101010101010`.

3. **Function Operation**: The function uses the bitwise OR (`|`) operation between the input number `n` and `2863311530`. This operation sets the corresponding bits in `n` where `2863311530` has 1s. Since `2863311530` has 1s only in the even bit positions, performing `n | 2863311530` will set all even bits of `n`.

4. **Verification**: To ensure correctness, consider an example:
   - If `n = 42` (binary `0b101010`), setting all even bits would result in `0b111111` (decimal `63`).
   - Applying the function: `42 | 2863311530` results in `63` in decimal, which matches the expected output.

Given the above reasoning, the function `func_1` correctly sets all even bits of the input number.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
