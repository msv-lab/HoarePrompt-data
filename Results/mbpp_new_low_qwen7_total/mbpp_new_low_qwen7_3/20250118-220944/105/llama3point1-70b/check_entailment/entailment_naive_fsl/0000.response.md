Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` uses the bitwise OR operation with the constant `2863311530`. This constant is equivalent to `0x11111111` in hexadecimal, which sets the least significant 8 bits to 1. However, the problem description asks to set all even bits of a given number. Even bits refer to bits at positions 1, 3, 5, etc., which are the odd-numbered positions if we start counting from 0.

The constant `0x11111111` sets the even-numbered positions (2, 4, 6, ...) to 1 instead of the odd-numbered positions. Therefore, this function does not meet the requirement of setting all even bits of a given number. For example, if the input number is `0b10101010` (170 in decimal), the function will produce `0b11111111` (255 in decimal), whereas the correct result should be `0b11111111` but with the even bits set to 1, i.e., `0b11111111`.

To correctly set all even bits, the function should use a different constant, such as `0xAAAAAAAA` (1099511627778 in decimal), which sets the even bits to 1.
