Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Write a python function to set all even bits of a given number.

# Program:
def func_1(n):
    return n | 2863311530





# Execution Summary:
The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and returns the result of performing a bitwise OR operation between `n` and the constant value `2863311530`. This means that each bit of the returned value is `1` if either the corresponding bit of `n` or the constant value is `1`, and `0` otherwise. There are no edge cases or missing functionalities in the provided code, as it accurately performs the described operation for any valid integer input.


# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
