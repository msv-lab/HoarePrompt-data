Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Write a python function to set all even bits of a given number.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer.
def func_1(n):
    return n | 2863311530
    #The program returns the bitwise OR of 'n' and 2863311530
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and returns the result of performing a bitwise OR operation between `n` and the constant value `2863311530`. This means that each bit of the returned value is `1` if either the corresponding bit of `n` or the constant value is `1`, and `0` otherwise. There are no edge cases or missing functionalities in the provided code, as it accurately performs the described operation for any valid integer input.

# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
