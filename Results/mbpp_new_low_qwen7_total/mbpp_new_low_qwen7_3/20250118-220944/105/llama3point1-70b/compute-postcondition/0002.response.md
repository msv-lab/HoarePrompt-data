Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and returns the result of performing a bitwise OR operation between `n` and the constant value `2863311530`. This means that each bit of the returned value is `1` if either the corresponding bit of `n` or the constant value is `1`, and `0` otherwise. There are no edge cases or missing functionalities in the provided code, as it accurately performs the described operation for any valid integer input.**
