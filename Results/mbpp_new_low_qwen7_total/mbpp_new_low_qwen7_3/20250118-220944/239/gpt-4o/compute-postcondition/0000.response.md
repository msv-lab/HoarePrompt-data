Initial State: `lst` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers.

Given Code:
```
count = Counter(lst)
result = [num for num in lst if count[num] == 1]
```

Let's break down the effects of the code:

1. `count = Counter(lst)` creates a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each integer across all sublists in `lst`.
2. `result = [num for num in lst if count[num] == 1]` generates a new list `result` containing only those integers from `lst` that appear exactly once.

Since we don't have the specific content of `lst`, let's assume an example to illustrate the process:

Assume `lst` is:
```
[[1, 2, 3], [4, 1, 5], [3, 6]]
```

- `Counter(lst)` will count the occurrences of each number:
  - 1 appears twice (in the first and second sublists).
  - 2 appears once (only in the first sublist).
  - 3 appears twice (in the first and third sublists).
  - 4 appears once (only in the second sublist).
  - 5 appears once (only in the second sublist).
  - 6 appears once (only in the third sublist).

- The list comprehension `[num for num in lst if count[num] == 1]` will filter out numbers that appear exactly once:
  - 2, 4, 5, and 6 are included in `result`.

Thus, the `result` list will be `[2, 4, 5, 6]`.

Final Output State: **lst is [[1, 2, 3], [4, 1, 5], [3, 6]], result is [2, 4, 5, 6]**
