#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers.
def func_1(lst):
    count = Counter(lst)

result = [num for num in lst if count[num] == 1]
    return result
    #The program returns the list [2, 4, 5, 6]
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`, which is expected to be a list of lists containing integers. It then creates a counter object `count` to count the occurrences of each integer across all sublists. After that, it constructs a new list `result` containing only those integers that appear exactly once in the entire `lst`. Finally, it returns the `result` list. The function does not modify the original `lst` and always returns a list of integers that meet the specified criteria. Potential edge cases include scenarios where no elements appear exactly once, in which case the returned list would be empty. If the input `lst` is empty, the function also returns an empty list.
