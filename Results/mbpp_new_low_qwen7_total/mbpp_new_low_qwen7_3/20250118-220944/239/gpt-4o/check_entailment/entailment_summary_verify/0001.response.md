Reasoning:
Let's carefully analyze the given function `func_1` and its behavior based on the provided function summary and the problem description.

1. **Function Behavior**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a single list `lst` as input.
   - It uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in the list.
   - It then filters the list to keep only those elements that appear exactly once.
   - The function returns this filtered list.

2. **Function Summary Analysis**:
   - The summary states that `func_1` accepts a list of lists, but the actual implementation only processes a single list. This is a contradiction because the function signature matches a single list input.
   - The summary mentions that the function creates a counter object `count` to count the occurrences of each integer across all sublists, but the function only counts occurrences within the given single list.
   - The function correctly filters out elements that appear more than once, returning only those that appear exactly once.

3. **Test Cases**:
   - The provided test cases confirm that the function works as intended for a single list, removing duplicates correctly.
   - Given the problem description and the function's behavior, the function meets the requirement to remove duplicates from a single list.

4. **Problem Statement**:
   - The problem statement asks to remove duplicate numbers from a given number of lists. However, the function `func_1` only processes a single list. Despite this, the function correctly performs the task of removing duplicates within the single list.

Since the function correctly handles the task of removing duplicates from a single list, even though it does not explicitly handle multiple lists, it still fulfills the core requirement of the problem statement. The original assessment incorrectly assumes that the function cannot handle a single list, which is a misunderstanding of the function's behavior.

Final: **True**
