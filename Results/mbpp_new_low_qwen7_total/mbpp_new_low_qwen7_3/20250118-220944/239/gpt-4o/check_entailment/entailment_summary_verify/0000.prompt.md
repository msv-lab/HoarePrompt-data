You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Write a python function to remove duplicate numbers from a given number of lists.

- Program:
from collections import Counter

assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == [1, 4, 5]
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 5]) == [1, 3, 4, 5]
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

def func_1(lst):
    count = Counter(lst)
    result = [num for num in lst if count[num] == 1]
    return result



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`, which is expected to be a list of lists containing integers. It then creates a counter object `count` to count the occurrences of each integer across all sublists. After that, it constructs a new list `result` containing only those integers that appear exactly once in the entire `lst`. Finally, it returns the `result` list. The function does not modify the original `lst` and always returns a list of integers that meet the specified criteria. Potential edge cases include scenarios where no elements appear exactly once, in which case the returned list would be empty. If the input `lst` is empty, the function also returns an empty list.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program uses a `Counter` to count occurrences of each number in the list and then filters out numbers that appear more than once. However, this approach only removes duplicates within the given list and does not consider the scenario where multiple lists are provided as input. According to the problem description, the function should remove duplicate numbers from a given number of lists, implying that the input could be a list of lists. 

For example, if the input is `[[1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4], [3, 4, 5]]`, the program will treat it as a single list `[1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 3, 4, 5]` and remove duplicates accordingly. This will incorrectly remove the common elements across different sublists, which is not the intended behavior.

To handle multiple lists, the function should flatten the list of lists before removing duplicates or process each sublist separately and then combine the results.
