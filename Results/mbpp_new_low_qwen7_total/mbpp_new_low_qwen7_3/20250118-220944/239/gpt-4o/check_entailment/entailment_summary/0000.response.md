Reasoning: 
The provided code snippet contains a misunderstanding of the problem statement. The function `func_1` is designed to take a single list as an argument, not a list of lists. However, the provided test cases assume that the function will handle multiple lists. Therefore, the current implementation is incorrect because it does not match the intended functionality as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
