Reasoning:
- The annotated program states that `func_1` should remove duplicates from a single list, not multiple lists. However, the implementation counts all elements from the entire `lst` and checks against this counter.
- The comment at the end shows that the program is actually treating `lst` as a flat list (all elements concatenated), rather than processing each sublist separately.
- The test cases provided in the comments do not match the behavior of the current implementation, which processes a single list.

Given the problem description requires removing duplicates from multiple lists, the current implementation is incorrect because it does not process each sublist separately.

Correctness: **False**
