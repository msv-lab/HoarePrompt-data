Reasoning:
- The problem requires a function that removes duplicate numbers from a given number of lists, meaning the function should take a single list of lists as input and return a list of unique numbers from all sublists combined.
- The annotated program describes a function `func_1` that uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each number across all sublists. Then, it filters out the numbers that appear more than once.
- However, the provided code snippet ends abruptly with `return result` and does not complete the definition of the function. This means that the `result` variable is never actually returned because the function ends before the `return` statement.
- Additionally, the comment at the end mentions that the function returns `[2, 4, 5, 6]`, but this does not align with the logic of the function as defined. The `result` list should contain numbers that appear exactly once in the entire `lst`, not `[2, 4, 5, 6]`.

Given these points, the provided program is incomplete and incorrect based on the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
