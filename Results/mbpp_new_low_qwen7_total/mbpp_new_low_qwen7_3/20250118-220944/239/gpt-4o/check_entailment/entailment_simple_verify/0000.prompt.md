You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Write a python function to remove duplicate numbers from a given number of lists.

- Program: 
from collections import Counter

assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == [1, 4, 5]
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 5]) == [1, 3, 4, 5]
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

def func_1(lst):
    count = Counter(lst)
    result = [num for num in lst if count[num] == 1]
    return result



- Annotated Code: 
from collections import Counter

assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == [1, 4, 5]
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 5]) == [1, 3, 4, 5]
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers.
def func_1(lst):
    count = Counter(lst)

result = [num for num in lst if count[num] == 1]
    return result
    #The program returns the list [2, 4, 5, 6]



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program uses a `Counter` to count occurrences of each number in the list and then filters out numbers that appear more than once. However, this approach only removes duplicates within the given list and does not consider the scenario where multiple lists are provided as input. According to the problem description, the function should remove duplicate numbers from a given number of lists, implying that the input could be a list of lists. 

For example, if the input is `[[1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4], [3, 4, 5]]`, the program will treat it as a single list `[1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 3, 4, 5]` and remove duplicates accordingly. This will incorrectly remove the common elements across different sublists, which is not the intended behavior.

To handle multiple lists, the function should flatten the list of lists before removing duplicates or process each sublist separately and then combine the results.
