### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the current implementation of `func_1` treats the input as a flat list and removes duplicates from it. This means that if the input is a list of lists, the duplicates are removed based on the entire flattened list rather than considering each sublist independently.

Given the problem description, the function should remove duplicates across all sublists collectively, but the current implementation only removes duplicates within the single flattened list. This leads to incorrect behavior when dealing with nested lists.

Let's analyze the annotated code step-by-step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - The `lst` parameter is expected to be a list of lists (e.g., `[[1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4], [3, 4, 5]]`).

2. **Count Calculation:**
   - `count = Counter(lst)` calculates the frequency of each element in the flattened list.

3. **Result Construction:**
   - The list comprehension `[num for num in lst if count[num] == 1]` constructs a new list containing only the numbers that appear exactly once in the flattened list.

4. **Return Statement:**
   - The function returns the constructed list.

For example, if `lst` is `[[1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4], [3, 4, 5]]`, the flattened list is `[1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 3, 4, 5]`. The function will return `[1, 4, 5]`, which is incorrect because it doesn't preserve the original sublists' structure.

To fix this, the function should either:
- Flatten the list of lists and then remove duplicates, or
- Process each sublist separately and then combine the results while ensuring no common elements are duplicated.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it fails to handle the scenario where the input is a list of lists. It treats the input as a flat list and removes duplicates based on the entire list, rather than considering each sublist independently.
