### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Description Analysis**:
   - The problem requires a function to remove duplicate numbers from a given number of lists. This implies that the function should take multiple lists as input and return a list of unique elements across all the given lists.

2. **Program Code Analysis**:
   - The provided function `func_1` only takes a single list (`lst`) as input.
   - The function uses a `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each element in the given list.
   - It then constructs a new list `result` containing only those elements that appear exactly once in the entire list.
   - The function does not handle multiple lists; it processes a single list at a time.

3. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The annotation correctly identifies that the function only processes a single list and does not handle multiple lists as specified in the problem description.
   - The function returns a list of elements that appear exactly once in the given list, but it does not address the scenario where multiple lists are involved.

4. **Original Assessment Evaluation**:
   - The original assessment correctly points out that the function only processes a single list and does not handle multiple lists. Therefore, it fails to meet the requirements of the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**

**Explanation**: The original assessment accurately identified that the function `func_1` is not designed to handle multiple lists as required by the problem statement. The function only processes a single list and removes duplicates within that single list. Therefore, the assessment is correct, and the final evaluation remains **False**.
