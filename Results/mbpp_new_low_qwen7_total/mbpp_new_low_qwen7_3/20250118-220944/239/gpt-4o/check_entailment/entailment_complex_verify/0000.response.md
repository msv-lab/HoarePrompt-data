Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies the flaw in the current implementation. The function `func_1` treats the input `lst` as a flat list and removes duplicates based on the entire list. However, the problem description specifies that the function should remove duplicate numbers from a given number of lists, implying that the input could be a list of lists.

To properly address this, the function should either:
1. Flatten the list of lists and then remove duplicates, or
2. Process each sublist separately and then combine the results after ensuring no duplicates exist across the combined result.

The annotated code provides a clear understanding of the program's behavior. It correctly states that the function counts the occurrences of each number in the entire list and then filters out numbers that appear more than once. This confirms that the function does not consider the intended behavior of handling multiple lists independently.

Given the problem description and the annotated code, the function does not meet the requirement of handling multiple lists correctly. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **False**
