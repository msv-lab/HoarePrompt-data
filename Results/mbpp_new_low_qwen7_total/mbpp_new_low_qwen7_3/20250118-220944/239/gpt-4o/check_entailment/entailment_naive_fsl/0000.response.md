Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program uses a `Counter` to count occurrences of each number in the list and then filters out numbers that appear more than once. However, this approach only removes duplicates within the given list and does not consider the scenario where multiple lists are provided as input. According to the problem description, the function should remove duplicate numbers from a given number of lists, implying that the input could be a list of lists. 

For example, if the input is `[[1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4], [3, 4, 5]]`, the program will treat it as a single list `[1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 3, 4, 5]` and remove duplicates accordingly. This will incorrectly remove the common elements across different sublists, which is not the intended behavior.

To handle multiple lists, the function should flatten the list of lists before removing duplicates or process each sublist separately and then combine the results.
