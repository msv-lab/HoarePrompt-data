Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Write a python function to remove duplicate numbers from a given number of lists.

# Program:
from collections import Counter

assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == [1, 4, 5]
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 5]) == [1, 3, 4, 5]
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

def func_1(lst):
    count = Counter(lst)
    result = [num for num in lst if count[num] == 1]
    return result



# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
