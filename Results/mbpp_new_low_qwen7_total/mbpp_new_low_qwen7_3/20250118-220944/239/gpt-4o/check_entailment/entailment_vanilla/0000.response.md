Reasoning:
The provided function `func_1` is designed to remove duplicate numbers from a single list. However, the problem statement specifies that the function should operate on "a given number of lists." The provided test cases only include a single list, which means the function might not be handling multiple lists as expected. 

To check the correctness, we need to see how the function behaves with multiple lists and ensure it removes duplicates correctly within each list independently. Since the function only processes one list at a time, it does not meet the requirement of handling multiple lists. Therefore, the function is not fully compliant with the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
