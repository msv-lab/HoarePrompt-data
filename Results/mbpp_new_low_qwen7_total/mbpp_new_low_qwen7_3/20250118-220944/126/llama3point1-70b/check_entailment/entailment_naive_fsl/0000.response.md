Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the lateral surface area of a cube given its side length. The formula used, \(4 \times \text{side\_length}^2\), is accurate for finding the lateral surface area of a cube. Since the function works correctly for all positive side lengths and zero (as the lateral surface area would be zero in that case), there are no edge cases or inputs where this function fails to meet the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
