Reasoning:
The formula for the lateral surface area (LSA) of a cube is given by \(4 \times \text{side length}^2\). The provided function `func_1` correctly implements this formula by taking the side length of the cube as an argument and returning \(4 \times \text{side length}^2\).

However, it's important to note that the term "lateral surface area" typically refers to the area of the sides of a three-dimensional object excluding the top and bottom faces. For a cube, since all six faces are equivalent, the lateral surface area would be the area of four of these faces, which is exactly what the given formula and function compute.

Given that the function accurately computes the area as specified by the formula, the provided program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
