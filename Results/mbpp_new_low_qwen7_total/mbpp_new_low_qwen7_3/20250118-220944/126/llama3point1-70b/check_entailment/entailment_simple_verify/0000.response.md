### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem description, the program code, and the annotated version to verify the original assessment.

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a function to find the lateral surface area of a cube given its side length. The lateral surface area of a cube is calculated as \(4 \times \text{side\_length}^2\).

2. **Program Code**:
   ```python
   def func_1(side_length):
       return 4 * side_length ** 2
   ```

3. **Annotated Code**:
   - Before the function call, `side_length` is a positive floating-point or integer number.
   - After executing the function, the returned value is \(4 \times \text{side\_length}^2\).

4. **Original Assessment**:
   - **Correctness**: **True**
   - Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the lateral surface area of a cube given its side length. The formula used, \(4 \times \text{side\_length}^2\), is accurate for finding the lateral surface area of a cube. Since the function works correctly for all positive side lengths and zero (as the lateral surface area would be zero in that case), there are no edge cases or inputs where this function fails to meet the problem description.

### Evaluation:

The original assessment is correct. Here's why:

- The function `func_1` uses the correct formula \(4 \times \text{side\_length}^2\) to calculate the lateral surface area of a cube.
- The function works correctly for any positive floating-point or integer value of `side_length`.
- The function also handles the edge case where `side_length` is zero, returning 0 as the lateral surface area, which is mathematically correct since a cube with side length zero has no surface area.
- The annotated code correctly describes the state of the program before and after the function call.

### Final Decision:

Final: **True**

The program is correct based on the problem description and the given annotations.
