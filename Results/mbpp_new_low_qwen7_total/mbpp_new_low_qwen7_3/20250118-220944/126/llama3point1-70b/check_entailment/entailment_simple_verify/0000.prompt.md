You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Write a function to find the lateral surface area of a cube given its side length.

- Program: 
def func_1(side_length):
    return 4 * side_length ** 2



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: side_length is a positive floating-point or integer number.
def func_1(side_length):
    return 4 * side_length ** 2
    #The program returns 4 times the square of the side_length, where side_length is a positive floating-point or integer number



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the lateral surface area of a cube given its side length. The formula used, \(4 \times \text{side\_length}^2\), is accurate for finding the lateral surface area of a cube. Since the function works correctly for all positive side lengths and zero (as the lateral surface area would be zero in that case), there are no edge cases or inputs where this function fails to meet the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
