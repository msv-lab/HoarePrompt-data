### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to calculate the lateral surface area of a cube given its side length.
2. **Annotated Code**: The annotated code indicates that the function `func_1` correctly computes \(4 \times \text{side length}^2\), which matches the mathematical formula for the lateral surface area of a cube.
3. **Original Assessment**: The original assessment correctly states that the formula used in the function is accurate and matches the definition of the lateral surface area of a cube.

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly implements the formula for the lateral surface area of a cube, and the annotations support this reasoning.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
