Reasoning:
The problem requires calculating the lateral surface area of a cube. The formula for the lateral surface area (LSA) of a cube with side length \( s \) is given by \( 4s^2 \).

Let's analyze the provided function:

```python
def func_1(side_length):
    return 4 * side_length ** 2
```

- The function `func_1` takes one argument `side_length`.
- It correctly implements the formula for the lateral surface area of a cube by returning \( 4 \times \text{side\_length}^2 \).

Given that the function correctly applies the formula and there are no constraints or edge cases mentioned in the problem statement that would affect the correctness of the function, the function appears to be correct under the given conditions.

Therefore, the provided program meets the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
