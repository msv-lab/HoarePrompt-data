### Reasoning:

The problem requires a function that calculates the lateral surface area of a cube given its side length. The lateral surface area of a cube is calculated by the formula \(4 \times \text{side\_length}^2\), which is exactly what the given function does.

Let's break down the steps:
1. The function `func_1` takes one parameter, `side_length`.
2. It computes the lateral surface area using the formula \(4 \times \text{side\_length}^2\).
3. The function returns this computed value.

Given that the problem statement and the annotated comments match the formula and the implementation of the function, the provided code is correct.

### Conclusion:
- The function correctly implements the formula for the lateral surface area of a cube.
- The comments accurately describe the state and the expected output of the program.

### Response:
Correctness: **True**
