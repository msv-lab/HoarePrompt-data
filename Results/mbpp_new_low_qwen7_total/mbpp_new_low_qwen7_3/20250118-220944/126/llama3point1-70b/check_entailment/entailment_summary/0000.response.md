Reasoning: 
The given function `func_1` is designed to calculate the lateral surface area of a cube. The formula for the lateral surface area of a cube is \(4 \times \text{side\_length}^2\). The function correctly implements this formula by returning `4 * side_length ** 2`.

Since the provided execution summary indicates that the function accurately performs the described operation without any issues or missing functionalities, and there are no edge cases mentioned as problematic, we can conclude that the function works as intended for valid inputs (positive floating-point or integer numbers).

Correctness: **True**
