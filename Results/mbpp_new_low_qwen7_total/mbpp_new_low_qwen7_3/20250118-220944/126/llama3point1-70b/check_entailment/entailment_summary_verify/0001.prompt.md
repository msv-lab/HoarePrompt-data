You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Write a function to find the lateral surface area of a cube given its side length.

- Program:
def func_1(side_length):
    return 4 * side_length ** 2



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `side_length`, which must be a positive floating-point or integer number. It calculates and returns 4 times the square of `side_length`. There are no missing functionalities or edge cases mentioned in the annotations, and the code accurately performs the described operation without any issues.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
The formula for the lateral surface area (LSA) of a cube is given by \(4 \times \text{side length}^2\). The provided function `func_1` correctly implements this formula by taking the side length of the cube as an argument and returning \(4 \times \text{side length}^2\).

However, it's important to note that the term "lateral surface area" typically refers to the area of the sides of a three-dimensional object excluding the top and bottom faces. For a cube, since all six faces are equivalent, the lateral surface area would be the area of four of these faces, which is exactly what the given formula and function compute.

Given that the function accurately computes the area as specified by the formula, the provided program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
