Reasoning:
The original assessment is accurate in stating that the function `func_1` correctly implements the formula for the lateral surface area of a cube. However, there is a subtle but important point to consider regarding the terminology used in the problem description.

The problem description specifically asks to find the lateral surface area of a cube. While mathematically, the lateral surface area of a cube can indeed be interpreted as the area of the four side faces (which is what the formula \(4 \times \text{side length}^2\) represents), the term "lateral surface area" in common mathematical usage does not apply to cubes. This is because a cube has no "top" and "bottom" faces to distinguish from the sides in the context of a cylinder or prism, where "lateral surface area" typically excludes the bases.

Nonetheless, the provided function `func_1` correctly follows the formula \(4 \times \text{side length}^2\), which is mathematically sound for the given problem statement. Since the function meets the requirement as stated, the program is technically correct according to the problem description and the function summary provided.

Final: **True**
