Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly implements the formula for calculating the lateral surface area of a cube, which is \(4 \times \text{side\_length}^2\). The function summary also correctly states that the function calculates and returns 4 times the square of `side_length`. 

However, the original assessment could have been more precise by noting that the formula \(4 \times \text{side\_length}^2\) actually calculates the total surface area of a cube, not just the lateral surface area. For a cube, the lateral surface area is the area of the four side faces, while the total surface area includes the top and bottom faces as well. Therefore, the correct formula for the lateral surface area should be \(4 \times \text{side\_length}^2\), which is indeed what the function does.

Given that the function correctly implements the formula for the total surface area of a cube, and there are no edge cases or issues mentioned in the function summary, the program is correct according to the problem description.

Final: **True**
