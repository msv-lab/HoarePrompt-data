### Reasoning:
The original assessment states that the function `func_1` correctly calculates the lateral surface area of a cube given its side length. However, let's review the provided code and annotations to ensure the accuracy of this statement.

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to find the lateral surface area of a cube given its side length.
   - The lateral surface area of a cube is the sum of the areas of the four sides, which can be calculated as \(4 \times \text{side\_length}^2\).

2. **Program Code**:
   ```python
   def func_1(side_length):
       return 4 * side_length ** 2
   ```

3. **Annotated Code**:
   - The code accurately describes the operation performed: returning \(4 \times \text{side\_length}^2\).
   - The annotations mention that `side_length` is a positive floating-point or integer number, which is correct for the lateral surface area calculation.

4. **Original Assessment**:
   - Correctness: True
   - Explanation: The function works correctly for all positive side lengths and zero.

5. **Evaluation**:
   - The function `func_1` indeed calculates the lateral surface area correctly using the formula \(4 \times \text{side\_length}^2\).
   - The annotations correctly state that the function operates on positive floating-point or integer numbers, which is appropriate for calculating the lateral surface area.
   - The original assessment is accurate as it correctly identifies that the function meets the requirements and works as intended for all valid inputs.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program correctly implements the function to find the lateral surface area of a cube, and the original assessment is accurate.
