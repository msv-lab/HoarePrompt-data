You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Write a function to find the lateral surface area of a cube given its side length.

- Program: 
def func_1(side_length):
    return 4 * side_length ** 2



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: side_length is a positive floating-point or integer number.
def func_1(side_length):
    return 4 * side_length ** 2
    #The program returns 4 times the square of the side_length, where side_length is a positive floating-point or integer number
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `side_length`, which must be a positive floating-point or integer number. It calculates and returns 4 times the square of `side_length`. There are no missing functionalities or edge cases mentioned in the annotations, and the code accurately performs the described operation without any issues.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
The formula for the lateral surface area (LSA) of a cube is given by \(4 \times \text{side length}^2\). The provided function `func_1` correctly implements this formula by taking the side length of the cube as an argument and returning \(4 \times \text{side length}^2\).

However, it's important to note that the term "lateral surface area" typically refers to the area of the sides of a three-dimensional object excluding the top and bottom faces. For a cube, since all six faces are equivalent, the lateral surface area would be the area of four of these faces, which is exactly what the given formula and function compute.

Given that the function accurately computes the area as specified by the formula, the provided program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
