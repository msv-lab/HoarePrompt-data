Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided function `func_1` implements the formula for the lateral surface area (LSA) of a cube. However, there is a subtle but important detail that needs to be considered regarding the terminology and the context of the problem description.

The problem description specifically states: "Write a function to find the lateral surface area of a cube given its side length." Typically, the lateral surface area of a cube refers to the area of the four sides of the cube, excluding the top and bottom faces. This matches the given formula and the implementation in the function `func_1`.

Given that the function accurately computes the area as specified by the formula and the term "lateral surface area" in this context refers to the area of the four sides, the provided program is correct.

Final: **True**
