### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary to verify the correctness of the original assessment.

#### Function Analysis:

1. **Function Summary**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to find the \( n \)-th polite number.
   - It initializes `count` to 0 and `number` to 1.
   - The loop continues until `count` reaches `n`.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if `number` is not a power of 2 using the condition `number & (number - 1) != 0`.
   - If the condition is true, `count` is incremented.
   - Finally, it returns `number - 1`.

2. **Given Assertions**:
   - `func_1(7) == 11`
   - `func_1(4) == 7`
   - `func_1(9) == 13`

3. **Correct Definition of Polite Numbers**:
   - A polite number is defined as a positive integer that can be expressed as the sum of two or more consecutive positive integers.
   - Powers of 2 are not polite numbers because they cannot be expressed as the sum of two or more consecutive positive integers.

4. **Correct Logic**:
   - To determine if a number is polite, we should check if it is not a power of 2.
   - The function should increment `count` whenever `number` is not a power of 2.

#### Verification:

- The provided function uses the condition `number & (number - 1) != 0` to check if `number` is not a power of 2, which is correct.
- The function correctly counts the number of non-powers-of-two up to the given index `n` and returns the correct result.

Given the assertions and the logic used in the function, the provided function indeed finds the \( n \)-th polite number correctly.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The given program is correct according to the problem description and the function summary. The original assessment was inaccurate.
