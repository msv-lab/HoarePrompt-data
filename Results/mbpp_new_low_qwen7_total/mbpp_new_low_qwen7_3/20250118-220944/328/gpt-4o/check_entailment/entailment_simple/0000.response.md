### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to find the `n`-th polite number. A polite number is defined as a positive integer that can be expressed as the sum of two or more consecutive positive integers.

2. **Function Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` iterates through numbers starting from 1.
   - For each number, it checks if the number is a power of 2 (i.e., `number & (number - 1) != 0`). If it is not a power of 2, it counts it as a polite number.
   - The loop continues until the count reaches `n`.
   - Finally, it returns the last counted number, which is `number - 1`.

3. **Bitwise Check**:
   - The condition `number & (number - 1) != 0` checks if `number` is not a power of 2. This works because a power of 2 in binary representation has exactly one '1' bit, and subtracting 1 from it flips all bits after the '1' bit (including the '1' bit itself), making the result `0` when AND-ed with the original number.

4. **Assertions Verification**:
   - `func_1(7)` should return 11, which is the 8th non-pow-of-2 number.
   - `func_1(4)` should return 7, which is the 5th non-pow-of-2 number.
   - `func_1(9)` should return 13, which is the 10th non-pow-of-2 number.

Given these observations, let's verify the logic with the assertions:

- For `n=7`, the 7th non-pow-of-2 number is indeed 11.
- For `n=4`, the 4th non-pow-of-2 number is indeed 7.
- For `n=9`, the 9th non-pow-of-2 number is indeed 13.

The logic seems correct and matches the expected results.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly finds the `n`-th polite number based on the problem description and the provided test cases.
