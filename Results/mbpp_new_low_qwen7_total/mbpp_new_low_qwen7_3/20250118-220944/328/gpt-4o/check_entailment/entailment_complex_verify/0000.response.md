### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem description, the program code, and the annotations to evaluate the correctness of the given function.

1. **Problem Description**: The goal is to find the \( n \)-th polite number. A polite number is defined as a positive integer that can be expressed as the sum of two or more consecutive positive integers.

2. **Function Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` iterates through positive integers starting from 1.
   - For each integer, it checks if the integer is not a power of 2 using the condition `number & (number - 1) != 0`.
   - If the condition is true, it increments the `count`.
   - The loop continues until `count` equals the input `n`.
   - Finally, it returns `number - 1`.

3. **Annotated Code**:
   - The annotations suggest that the function correctly identifies non-powers-of-two numbers, which aligns with the definition of polite numbers (since powers of 2 cannot be expressed as the sum of two or more consecutive positive integers).
   - The examples provided in the tests (e.g., `func_1(7) == 11`, `func_1(4) == 7`, `func_1(9) == 13`) are consistent with the expected polite numbers.

4. **Original Assessment**:
   - The original assessment claims the function is incorrect because it checks for odd numbers of set bits in the binary representation, which is not the correct condition for a polite number.
   - The assessment provides a corrected version of the function, but the analysis in the original assessment is incorrect because it misinterprets the problem.

5. **Correctness Evaluation**:
   - The provided function correctly identifies non-powers-of-two numbers, which matches the definition of polite numbers.
   - The function passes the given test cases, indicating that it works as intended for the problem.

Given the above reasoning, the original assessment is inaccurate. The function correctly implements the logic to find the \( n \)-th polite number.

### Final:
**True**
