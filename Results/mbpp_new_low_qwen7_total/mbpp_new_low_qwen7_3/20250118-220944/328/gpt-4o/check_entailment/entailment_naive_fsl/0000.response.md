Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks if a number is polite by verifying if it has an odd number of set bits (1s) in its binary representation. However, this logic is incorrect because a polite number is defined as a positive integer that can be expressed as the sum of two or more consecutive positive integers. The function should check if a number is not a power of 2, as powers of 2 do not have this property.

For example, consider finding the 8th polite number. According to the definition, the sequence of polite numbers starts as follows: 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, ... The 8th polite number is 12. However, the provided function will incorrectly identify 15 as the 8th polite number because it does not check the correct condition for being a polite number.

To correctly implement the function, you would need to count the number of non-powers-of-two up to the given index `n`. Here's a corrected version:

```python
def func_1(n):
    count = 0
    number = 1
    while count < n:
        # Check if the number is not a power of 2
        if number & (number - 1) != 0:
            count += 1
        number += 1
    return number - 1
```

This corrected function correctly identifies polite numbers based on the definition.
