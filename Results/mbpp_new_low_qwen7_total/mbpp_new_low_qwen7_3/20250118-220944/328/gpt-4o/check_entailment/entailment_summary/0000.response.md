Reasoning: 
The provided program aims to find the nth polite number. A polite number is defined as a positive integer that can be expressed as the sum of two or more consecutive positive integers. According to the problem statement, the function should count numbers that are not powers of 2 (since powers of 2 cannot be expressed as the sum of consecutive integers).

However, the current implementation of `func_1` does not correctly identify polite numbers. Instead, it increments a counter every time `number` is not a power of 2 (i.e., `number & (number - 1)` is not 0). This means it counts the number of non-powers-of-2 numbers encountered until reaching the nth such number. This logic is incorrect for finding polite numbers.

To find the nth polite number, we need to count the number of non-powers-of-2 up to a certain point. But the definition of a polite number requires a different approach: it involves counting numbers that can be expressed as the sum of two or more consecutive integers.

Given the provided assertions, the function does not match the expected behavior of identifying polite numbers. Therefore, the program is not correct according to the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
