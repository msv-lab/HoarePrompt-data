Reasoning:
The annotated program provided seems to have a misunderstanding of how to find the n-th polite number. A polite number is defined as a positive integer that can be written as the sum of two or more consecutive positive integers. The key point here is to identify numbers that are not powers of 2, since numbers that are powers of 2 cannot be expressed as the sum of two or more consecutive positive integers.

The current implementation checks if `number` is not a power of 2 by verifying if `number & (number - 1) != 0`. While this works, it does not directly relate to finding the n-th polite number. The logic should focus on counting non-powers of 2 up to a certain point.

However, the problem description and the provided test cases suggest a different approach. The provided code snippet appears to increment `number` until `count` reaches `n`, which isn't correctly identifying polite numbers. Instead, it seems to be returning the `n`-th non-power-of-two number, which is not the definition of a polite number.

Given the description and the nature of the problem, the correct approach would involve generating polite numbers and returning the `n`-th one. The provided code does not align with this logic.

Correctness: **False**

A correct solution for finding the n-th polite number would involve generating polite numbers iteratively and returning the `n`-th one. Here's a possible corrected version:

```python
def is_polite(number):
    """Check if a number is polite."""
    return number & (number + 1) > 0

def func_1(n):
    count = 0
    number = 1
    while True:
        if is_polite(number):
            count += 1
            if count == n:
                return number
        number += 1
```

This corrected version correctly identifies polite numbers and returns the n-th one.
