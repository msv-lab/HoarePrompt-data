Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Write a function to find nth polite number. geeksforgeeks.org/n-th-polite-number/

# Annotated Program:
assert func_1(7) == 11
assert func_1(4) == 7
assert func_1(9) == 13

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    count = 0

number = 1
    while count < n:
        if number & number - 1 != 0:
            count += 1
        
        number += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: n is a positive integer, count is n, number is n + 1.
    return number - 1
    #The program returns n
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns `n`. It does this by initializing a counter `count` to 0 and a variable `number` to 1. The function then enters a loop that increments `count` each time `number` is a power of 2 (i.e., `number & (number - 1)` equals 0). Once `count` reaches `n`, the loop exits, and the function returns `number - 1`. This means the function effectively counts the number of iterations until `count` reaches `n`, and the returned value is the last `number` before the condition is met.
