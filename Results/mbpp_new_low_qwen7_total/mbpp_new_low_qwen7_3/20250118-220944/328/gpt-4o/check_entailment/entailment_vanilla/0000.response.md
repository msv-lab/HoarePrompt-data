Reasoning:

A polite number is defined as a positive integer that can be written as the sum of two or more consecutive positive integers. The function `func_1` is supposed to find the nth polite number. 

Let's analyze the provided test cases and the code logic:

1. **Test Cases:**
   - `func_1(7)` should return `11`. The first few polite numbers are 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, ... (where 11 is the 7th polite number).
   - `func_1(4)` should return `7`. The first four polite numbers are 3, 5, 6, 7.
   - `func_1(9)` should return `13`. The first nine polite numbers are 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13.

2. **Code Logic:**
   - The function starts with `count = 0` and `number = 1`.
   - It uses a while loop to find the nth polite number.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if `number & (number - 1) != 0`. This condition checks if `number` is a power of 2 because powers of 2 have only one '1' bit in their binary representation (e.g., 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc.), and subtracting 1 from them flips all bits after the leading '1' bit to '1'. For example, 8 (1000) - 1 = 7 (0111). The bitwise AND operation between these two numbers results in zero if `number` is a power of 2.
   - If the condition is false, it means `number` is not a power of 2, so it increments the `count`.
   - Once `count` equals `n`, it returns `number - 1`.

The logic correctly identifies non-power-of-2 numbers, which are polite numbers. The test cases provided also validate the correctness of this logic.

Given the analysis, the function appears to be correctly implemented for finding the nth polite number based on the provided problem description and test cases.

Correctness: **True**
