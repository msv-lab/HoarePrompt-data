#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    count = 0

number = 1
    while count < n:
        if number & number - 1 != 0:
            count += 1
        
        number += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: n is a positive integer, count is n, number is n + 1.
    return number - 1
    #The program returns n
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns `n`. It does this by initializing a counter `count` to 0 and a variable `number` to 1. The function then enters a loop that increments `count` each time `number` is a power of 2 (i.e., `number & (number - 1)` equals 0). Once `count` reaches `n`, the loop exits, and the function returns `number - 1`. This means the function effectively counts the number of iterations until `count` reaches `n`, and the returned value is the last `number` before the condition is met.
