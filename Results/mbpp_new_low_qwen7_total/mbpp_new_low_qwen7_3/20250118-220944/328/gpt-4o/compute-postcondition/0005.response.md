The code `number += 1` increments the value of `number` by 1. Initially, `number` is 1, so after the increment, `number` becomes 2. The other variables (`n` and `count`) remain unchanged because they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `count` is 1, `number` is 2**
