Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `count` is 1, `number` is 1. If `number & number - 1` is not equal to 0, the function continues with the updated `number` as `number + 1` and increments `count` by 1. Otherwise, the function terminates with the same values of `n`, `count`, and `number`.***
