Postcondition: ***`count` is 3, `n` must be greater than 2.***

Explanation:
Given the precondition that `count` is 2 and `n` must be greater than 2, the if condition checks whether `number & number - 1 != 0`. According to the if part, if this condition is true, `count` becomes 3. Since there is no else part, the value of `n` remains unchanged and still must be greater than 2. Therefore, the overall postcondition is that `count` is 3 and `n` must be greater than 2.
