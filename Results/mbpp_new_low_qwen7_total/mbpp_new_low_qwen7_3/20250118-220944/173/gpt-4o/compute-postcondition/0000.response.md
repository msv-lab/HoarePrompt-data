The code creates a new list `int_values` which contains only the integer elements from the original list `lst`. The original list `lst` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `lst` is a list containing elements of various types, `int_values` is a list containing only the integer elements from `lst`.

Output State: **`lst` is a list containing elements of various types, `int_values` is a list containing only the integer elements from `lst`**
