Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` containing elements of various types and returns the minimum integer value from the list after filtering out non-integer elements. If the list contains no integer elements, the function will return `None`. Additionally, if the list is empty, the function will also return `None`.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If the list `lst` contains no integer elements, the function will return `None`.
- If the list `lst` is empty, the function will return `None`.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not handle cases where the list `lst` contains non-comparable elements (e.g., mixing different numeric types like integers and floats). In such cases, the `min` function would raise a `TypeError`. However, the function does not account for or handle this scenario.
