#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list containing elements of various types (e.g., integers, floats, strings, etc.). However, all elements in the list must be comparable to each other using the < operator.
def func_1(lst):
    int_values = [x for x in lst if isinstance(x, int)]
    return min(int_values)
    #The program returns the minimum value from the list 'int_values' which contains only the integer elements from 'lst'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` containing elements of various types and returns the minimum integer value from the list after filtering out non-integer elements. If the list contains no integer elements, the function will return `None`. Additionally, if the list is empty, the function will also return `None`.
