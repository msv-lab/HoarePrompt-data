### Reasoning:

The original assessment is partially accurate but could benefit from further clarification and detailed examination. Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to find the minimum value in a given heterogeneous list. This means the list can contain elements of different types such as integers, strings, floats, etc.

2. **Function Behavior**: The provided function `func_1` uses a list comprehension to filter out non-integer elements and then applies the `min()` function to the remaining integer elements. This results in ignoring any non-integer values in the list.

3. **Test Cases**: The provided test cases all involve lists with integer values, and the function correctly identifies the minimum integer value. For example:
   - `['Python', 3, 2, 4, 5, 'version']` returns `2`.
   - `['Python', 15, 20, 25]` returns `15`.
   - `['Python', 30, 20, 40, 50, 'version']` returns `20`.

4. **Assessment Analysis**:
   - The original assessment correctly notes that the function only considers integer values and ignores non-integer values.
   - It also correctly points out that if the intention was to find the minimum value among all elements (including non-integers), the function would be incorrect.
   - The original assessment assumes the goal is to find the minimum among only the integer values based on the provided test cases.

5. **Comprehensive Evaluation**:
   - While the test cases do suggest that the function works as intended for the given inputs, the problem description does not explicitly specify whether non-integer values should be considered or ignored.
   - The function behaves as specified in the provided test cases, which are all homogeneous in terms of integer values.

Given that the problem description does not clearly state whether non-integer values should be included in the search for the minimum value, and the function is designed to handle only integer values as demonstrated in the test cases, the function can be considered correct within the context provided.

### Conclusion:
The function `func_1` correctly finds the minimum value among the integer elements in the list, and this aligns with the implied requirements based on the provided test cases.

### Final:
Final: **True**

This conclusion is based on the assumption that the function's behavior is aligned with the intended purpose as indicated by the test cases, even though the problem statement does not explicitly mention handling non-integer values.
