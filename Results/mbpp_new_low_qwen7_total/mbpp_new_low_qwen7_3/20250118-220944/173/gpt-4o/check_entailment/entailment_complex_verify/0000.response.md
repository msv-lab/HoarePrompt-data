### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program indeed only considers integer values in the list when finding the minimum value. This violates the problem description, which specifies that the list can be heterogeneous and that all elements must be considered when determining the minimum value.

Let's break down the program and the provided assertions:

1. **Program Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` filters out all non-integer elements from the input list `lst`.
   - It then returns the minimum value from the filtered list of integers.

2. **Assertions**:
   - `assert func_1(['Python', 3, 2, 4, 5, 'version']) == 2`: This works correctly because the function filters out non-integers and returns the minimum integer.
   - `assert func_1(['Python', 15, 20, 25]) == 15`: This also works correctly for the same reason.
   - `assert func_1(['Python', 30, 20, 40, 50, 'version']) == 20`: This again works correctly as non-integers are filtered out.

However, these assertions do not cover cases where the list contains elements that can be converted to integers but are not explicitly integers. For instance, the assertion provided in the original assessment:

```python
assert func_1(['Python', 3, 2, 4, 5, '30']) == 2
```

In this case, the string `'30'` should be considered as an integer, and the minimum value should be `2`. But the current implementation does not handle this correctly because it filters out non-integers.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is correct. The function `func_1` does not handle the case where non-integer elements in the list can be converted to integers, and thus fails to meet the requirements of the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
