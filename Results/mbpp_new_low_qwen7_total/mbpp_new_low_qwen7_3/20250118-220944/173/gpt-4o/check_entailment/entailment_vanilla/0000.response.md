### Reasoning:
The given function `func_1` aims to find the minimum value in a heterogeneous list. However, the function only considers integer values in the list and ignores non-integer values. This approach will work correctly if the requirement is to find the minimum among only the integers present in the list. 

However, the problem statement does not explicitly mention that the function should ignore non-integer values. If the intention was to find the minimum value in the entire list, including both integers and strings, the function would be incorrect because it filters out all non-integer values before finding the minimum.

Given the provided test cases, they all involve lists where the smallest element is an integer. Therefore, the function appears to pass these specific tests, but this does not necessarily mean it is fully correct without additional context or more comprehensive testing.

### Conclusion:
If the goal is to find the minimum among only the integer values, the function is correct based on the provided test cases. If the goal is to find the minimum value in the entire list, the function is incorrect because it ignores non-integer values.

Since the problem description is not clear about whether non-integer values should be considered, we assume the goal is to find the minimum among only the integer values.

### Response:
Correctness: **True**
