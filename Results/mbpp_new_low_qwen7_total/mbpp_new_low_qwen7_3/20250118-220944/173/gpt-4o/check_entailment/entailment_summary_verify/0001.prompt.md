You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Write a function to find the minimum value in a given heterogeneous list.

- Program:
assert func_1(['Python', 3, 2, 4, 5, 'version']) == 2
assert func_1(['Python', 15, 20, 25]) == 15
assert func_1(['Python', 30, 20, 40, 50, 'version']) == 20

def func_1(lst):
    int_values = [x for x in lst if isinstance(x, int)]
    return min(int_values)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` containing elements of various types and returns the minimum integer value from the list after filtering out non-integer elements. If the list contains no integer elements, the function will return `None`. Additionally, if the list is empty, the function will also return `None`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:
The given function `func_1` aims to find the minimum value in a heterogeneous list. However, the function only considers integer values in the list and ignores non-integer values. This approach will work correctly if the requirement is to find the minimum among only the integers present in the list. 

However, the problem statement does not explicitly mention that the function should ignore non-integer values. If the intention was to find the minimum value in the entire list, including both integers and strings, the function would be incorrect because it filters out all non-integer values before finding the minimum.

Given the provided test cases, they all involve lists where the smallest element is an integer. Therefore, the function appears to pass these specific tests, but this does not necessarily mean it is fully correct without additional context or more comprehensive testing.

### Conclusion:
If the goal is to find the minimum among only the integer values, the function is correct based on the provided test cases. If the goal is to find the minimum value in the entire list, the function is incorrect because it ignores non-integer values.

Since the problem description is not clear about whether non-integer values should be considered, we assume the goal is to find the minimum among only the integer values.

### Response:
Correctness: **True**
