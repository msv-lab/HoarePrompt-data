### Reasoning:
The given function `func_1` indeed finds the minimum value among the integer elements in the list. The function summary correctly states that the function filters out non-integer elements before finding the minimum. Given the provided assertions, which all involve lists with at least one integer, the function passes these specific tests.

However, the original assessment makes an assumption that the problem statement might imply finding the minimum value in the entire list, including non-integer values. Since the problem description explicitly states to find the minimum value in a given heterogeneous list, and the function correctly filters out non-integer values before finding the minimum, the function aligns with the problem statement.

The provided test cases do not include any non-integer values, but they do not negate the correctness of the function either. The function behaves as expected for the given inputs. There is no indication that the function should consider non-integer values for the minimum computation.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate in its interpretation of the problem, but the conclusion is not entirely necessary since the function's behavior matches the problem statement and test cases provided.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct based on the problem description and the function's behavior.
