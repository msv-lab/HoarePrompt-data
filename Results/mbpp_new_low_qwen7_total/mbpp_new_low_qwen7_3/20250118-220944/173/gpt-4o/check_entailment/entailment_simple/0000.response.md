Reasoning:
The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that aims to find the minimum value in a given list. However, the current implementation filters out non-integer values before finding the minimum, which means it will only consider the integer elements in the list, potentially ignoring any non-integer elements.

Given the assertions:
1. `func_1(['Python', 3, 2, 4, 5, 'version']) == 2`
2. `func_1(['Python', 15, 20, 25]) == 15`
3. `func_1(['Python', 30, 20, 40, 50, 'version']) == 20`

The first assertion is correct because the function correctly identifies `2` as the minimum among the integers `[3, 2, 4, 5]`. However, the second and third assertions are problematic. The function should ideally handle the entire list and not just filter out non-integer values.

For example, in the second assertion:
- If the input is `['Python', 15, 20, 25]`, the function will only consider `15` as part of `int_values`, and thus return `15`.

However, for a heterogeneous list like `['Python', 30, 20, 40, 50, 'version']`, the function should also consider non-integer values if they can be compared (which is not possible in Python without type conversion or special handling).

Since the function currently does not handle non-integer values correctly, it may not work as intended for all cases.

Correctness: **False**
