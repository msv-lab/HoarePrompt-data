Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program only considers integer values in the list when finding the minimum value. However, the problem description specifies that the list can be heterogeneous, meaning it can contain elements of different types such as strings, integers, floats, etc. 

The program will fail for cases where non-integer values are present and should still consider them when determining the minimum value. For example, if the list contains a string that can be converted to an integer, the program should include it in the calculation of the minimum value.

Here is an example where the program does not work correctly:
```
assert func_1(['Python', 3, 2, 4, 5, '30']) == 2
```

In this case, the string `'30'` can be converted to an integer, and the minimum value should be `2`, but the current implementation will not consider `'30'` because it filters out non-integers. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
