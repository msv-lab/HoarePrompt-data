### Reasoning:

The original assessment states that the program is incorrect because it only considers integer values in the list when finding the minimum value. This is true based on the given problem description and the provided assertions.

Let's break down the annotated code and the behavior of the program:

1. **Annotated Code Explanation:**
   - The program uses a list comprehension to filter out only the integer values from the input list `lst`.
   - It then finds the minimum value from the filtered list of integers.
   
2. **Problem Description Analysis:**
   - The problem requires finding the minimum value in a **heterogeneous** list, which means the list can contain elements of different types such as strings, integers, floats, etc.
   - The minimum value should be determined based on the comparison rules for all possible data types in Python. For instance, in Python, strings can be compared lexicographically, and numbers (integers and floats) can be compared numerically.

3. **Original Assertions Evaluation:**
   - `assert func_1(['Python', 3, 2, 4, 5, 'version']) == 2`: This assertion is correct because the minimum value among `3, 2, 4, 5` is `2`.
   - `assert func_1(['Python', 15, 20, 25]) == 15`: This assertion is correct because the minimum value among `15, 20, 25` is `15`.
   - `assert func_1(['Python', 30, 20, 40, 50, 'version']) == 20`: This assertion is correct because the minimum value among `30, 20, 40, 50` is `20`.

However, the original assessment mentions a specific case that highlights the issue with the current implementation:
   - `assert func_1(['Python', 3, 2, 4, 5, '30']) == 2`: This case is problematic because the string `'30'` can be converted to an integer `30`. According to Python's comparison rules, the minimum value among `3, 2, 4, 5, 30` should be `2`. But since the program filters out non-integer values, it only considers `3, 2, 4, 5` and returns `2`, which is incorrect.

The program should handle all elements in the list, including those that can be implicitly converted to integers, to find the correct minimum value.

### Conclusion:

Given the above analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle all elements in the list, particularly those that can be implicitly converted to integers.

**Final: False**
