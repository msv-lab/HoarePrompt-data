### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` only considers integer values and ignores non-integer values. Given the problem description, the goal is to find the minimum value in a given heterogeneous list. The original assessment assumes that the function should find the minimum among only the integer values present in the list, as this is the behavior demonstrated by the provided test cases.

The annotations support this interpretation, as they indicate that the function creates a list of integers (`int_values`) and then finds the minimum value in that list. The test cases provided also align with this behavior, showing that the smallest integer value is returned when the list contains both integers and non-integers.

While the problem statement does not explicitly mention ignoring non-integer values, the behavior of the function and the test cases suggest that this is the intended behavior. Since the function consistently returns the minimum integer value in the list and passes the given test cases, we can conclude that the function meets the implicit requirement of the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

This conclusion is based on the consistent behavior of the function and the provided test cases, which align with the assumption that the function should find the minimum among only the integer values in the list.
