You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Write a function to find the minimum value in a given heterogeneous list.

- Program: 
assert func_1(['Python', 3, 2, 4, 5, 'version']) == 2
assert func_1(['Python', 15, 20, 25]) == 15
assert func_1(['Python', 30, 20, 40, 50, 'version']) == 20

def func_1(lst):
    int_values = [x for x in lst if isinstance(x, int)]
    return min(int_values)



- Annotated Code: 
assert func_1(['Python', 3, 2, 4, 5, 'version']) == 2
assert func_1(['Python', 15, 20, 25]) == 15
assert func_1(['Python', 30, 20, 40, 50, 'version']) == 20

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list containing elements of various types (e.g., integers, floats, strings, etc.). However, all elements in the list must be comparable to each other using the < operator.
def func_1(lst):
    int_values = [x for x in lst if isinstance(x, int)]
    return min(int_values)
    #The program returns the minimum value from the list 'int_values' which contains only the integer elements from 'lst'



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program only considers integer values in the list when finding the minimum value. However, the problem description specifies that the list can be heterogeneous, meaning it can contain elements of different types such as strings, integers, floats, etc. 

The program will fail for cases where non-integer values are present and should still consider them when determining the minimum value. For example, if the list contains a string that can be converted to an integer, the program should include it in the calculation of the minimum value.

Here is an example where the program does not work correctly:
```
assert func_1(['Python', 3, 2, 4, 5, '30']) == 2
```

In this case, the string `'30'` can be converted to an integer, and the minimum value should be `2`, but the current implementation will not consider `'30'` because it filters out non-integers. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
