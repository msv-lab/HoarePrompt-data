#State of the program right berfore the function call: num_strings is a list of strings, where each string can be converted to an integer.
def func_1(num_strings):
    return sorted([int(num) for num in num_strings])
    #The program returns a sorted list of integers, where each integer is obtained by converting a string from the list `num_strings` to an integer
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of strings `num_strings`, where each string can be converted to an integer. It converts each string to an integer, sorts the resulting list of integers in ascending order, and returns the sorted list. Potential edge cases include empty lists, lists containing non-convertible strings (which would result in a `ValueError`), and lists containing duplicate integers (which would be handled by the sorting mechanism).
