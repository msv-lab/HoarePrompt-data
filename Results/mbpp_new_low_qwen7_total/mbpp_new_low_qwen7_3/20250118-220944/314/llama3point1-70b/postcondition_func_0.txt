The function `func_1` accepts a list of strings `num_strings`, where each string can be converted to an integer. It converts each string to an integer, sorts the resulting list of integers in ascending order, and returns the sorted list. Potential edge cases include empty lists, lists containing non-convertible strings (which would result in a `ValueError`), and lists containing duplicate integers (which would be handled by the sorting mechanism).
