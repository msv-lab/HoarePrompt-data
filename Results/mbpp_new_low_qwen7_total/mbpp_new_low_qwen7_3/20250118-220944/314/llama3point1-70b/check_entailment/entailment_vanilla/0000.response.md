Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to sort a list of strings representing numbers. However, there are a few issues with the implementation:

1. The function name `func_1` does not match the problem statement which asks for a function named `sort_num_strings`.
2. The list comprehension converts each string to an integer and then the `sorted` function sorts these integers.
3. The result of `sorted` is a list of integers, but the problem specifies that the input is a list of strings, so the output should also be a list of strings.

Given the above points, the program does not fully meet the requirements because it outputs a list of integers instead of strings.

Correctness: **False**
