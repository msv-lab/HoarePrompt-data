### Reasoning:
The provided function `func_1` takes a list of strings (`num_strings`) as input, converts each string to an integer using a list comprehension, and then sorts the resulting list of integers. The sorted list is returned.

However, there is a potential issue with the function's logic. The comment suggests that the function should return a sorted list of integers, but the function actually returns a list of integers (not sorted). The `sorted()` function should be called explicitly before returning the result to ensure that the list is sorted.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(num_strings):
    return sorted([int(num) for num in num_strings])
```

The function as provided does not include the call to `sorted()`, which means it will return a list of integers without sorting them. To fix this, we need to ensure that `sorted()` is called explicitly.

Given the current implementation, the function does not correctly sort the list of integers.

### Correctness:
**False**
