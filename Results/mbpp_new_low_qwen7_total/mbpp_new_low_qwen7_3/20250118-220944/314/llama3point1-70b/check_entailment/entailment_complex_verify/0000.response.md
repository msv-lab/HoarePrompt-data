### Reasoning:
Let's evaluate the given program step-by-step based on the problem description and the annotated code.

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a function that sorts a given list of strings of numbers numerically.

2. **Program Code**:
   ```python
   def func_1(num_strings):
       return sorted([int(num) for num in num_strings])
   ```

3. **Annotated Code**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a list of strings (`num_strings`).
   - Each string in the list is converted to an integer using `int(num)`.
   - The list of integers is then sorted in ascending order using the `sorted()` function.
   - The function returns the sorted list of integers.

4. **Original Assessment**:
   - The assessment states that the function is correct because it handles all potential cases correctly, including empty lists, lists with a single element, and lists with multiple elements.

5. **Systematic Evaluation**:
   - **Empty List**: `func_1([])` returns `[]`. This is correct.
   - **Single Element**: `func_1(["123"])` returns `[123]`. This is correct.
   - **Multiple Elements**: `func_1(["3", "1", "2"])` returns `[1, 2, 3]`. This is correct.
   - **Edge Case: Non-Convertible Strings**: The annotated code mentions that lists containing non-convertible strings (e.g., `"abc"`) would result in a `ValueError`. This is a valid edge case that should be considered.
   
6. **Potential Issues**:
   - The function does not handle non-numeric strings gracefully. If the list contains any string that cannot be converted to an integer, the function will raise a `ValueError`.
   - For example, `func_1(["1", "two", "3"])` will raise a `ValueError` because "two" cannot be converted to an integer.

7. **Final Evaluation**:
   - While the function correctly handles the problem for valid input cases, it fails to handle invalid input cases (i.e., non-convertible strings) which are part of the problem description. Therefore, the function is not fully correct according to the given problem requirements.

### Final:
**False**
