Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Write a function to sort a given list of strings of numbers numerically.

# Program:
def func_1(num_strings):
    return sorted([int(num) for num in num_strings])





# Execution Summary:
The function `func_1` accepts a list of strings `num_strings`, where each string can be converted to an integer. It converts each string to an integer, sorts the resulting list of integers in ascending order, and returns the sorted list. Potential edge cases include empty lists, lists containing non-convertible strings (which would result in a `ValueError`), and lists containing duplicate integers (which would be handled by the sorting mechanism).


# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
