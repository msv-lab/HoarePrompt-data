Reasoning:
The provided function `func_1` attempts to convert each string in the input list `num_strings` to an integer, sorts the resulting list of integers, and returns it. However, there are a few issues with the current implementation:

1. The function directly returns the sorted list without any error handling. If any string in `num_strings` cannot be converted to an integer, a `ValueError` will be raised, and the program will crash.
2. The problem description specifies that the function should return a list of strings sorted numerically, but the function currently returns a list of integers.

Given these points, the function does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem statement. To fix these issues, the function should:
- Convert each string to an integer and catch potential `ValueError` exceptions.
- Sort the resulting list of integers.
- Convert the sorted list back to a list of strings before returning it.

Despite these issues, the function does correctly convert and sort integers if all strings can be successfully converted. Therefore, the function's logic for conversion and sorting is correct, but it needs additional error handling and proper formatting.

However, based strictly on the annotated program and without considering these potential improvements, the function does execute the necessary steps to achieve the desired outcome if no errors occur.

Correctness: **False**
