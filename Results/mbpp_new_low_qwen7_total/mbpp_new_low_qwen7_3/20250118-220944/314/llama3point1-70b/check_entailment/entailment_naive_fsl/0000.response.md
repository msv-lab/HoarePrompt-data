Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes a list of strings representing numbers and returns a sorted list of those numbers as integers. The function correctly converts each string to an integer using `int(num)` and then sorts the resulting list using Python's built-in `sorted()` function.

Given the problem description, the function appears to handle all potential cases correctly. It works for empty lists, lists with a single element, and lists with multiple elements. Here are a few test cases:

- For an empty list: `func_1([])` returns `[]`.
- For a list with a single element: `func_1(["123"])` returns `[123]`.
- For a list with multiple elements: `func_1(["3", "1", "2"])` returns `[1, 2, 3]`.

Since the function correctly sorts the list of strings numerically in all tested cases, the program is correct.
