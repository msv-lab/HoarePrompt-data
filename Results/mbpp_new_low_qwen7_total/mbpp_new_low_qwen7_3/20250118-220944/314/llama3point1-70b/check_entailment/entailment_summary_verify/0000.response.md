Reasoning:
The original assessment is accurate in its conclusion that the function `func_1` is correct. However, there are a few points to consider that support this conclusion:

1. **Function Behavior**: The function `func_1` correctly converts each string in the input list to an integer and then sorts the resulting list of integers in ascending order. This matches the problem description perfectly.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Empty List**: When given an empty list `[]`, the function returns an empty list `[]`, which is the expected behavior.
   - **Single Element**: When given a list with a single string `"123"`, the function returns `[123]`, which is also correct.
   - **Multiple Elements**: For a list like `["3", "1", "2"]`, the function returns `[1, 2, 3]`, demonstrating the correct numerical sort order.

3. **Error Handling**: The function does not explicitly handle cases where the strings cannot be converted to integers. While the function will raise a `ValueError` for such inputs, the problem statement did not specify how to handle these cases. Therefore, we can assume that the function should raise an error, and this behavior is consistent with the typical use of list comprehensions and the `int()` function in Python.

4. **Function Summary**: The provided function summary accurately describes the function's behavior and potential edge cases, including the handling of non-convertible strings, which would indeed result in a `ValueError`.

Given these points, the original assessment is correct. The function `func_1` behaves as intended and handles all specified edge cases appropriately.

Final: **True**
