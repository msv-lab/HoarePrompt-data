You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Write a function to sort a given list of strings of numbers numerically.

- Program:
def func_1(num_strings):
    return sorted([int(num) for num in num_strings])



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a list of strings `num_strings`, where each string can be converted to an integer. It converts each string to an integer, sorts the resulting list of integers in ascending order, and returns the sorted list. Potential edge cases include empty lists, lists containing non-convertible strings (which would result in a `ValueError`), and lists containing duplicate integers (which would be handled by the sorting mechanism).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to sort a list of strings representing numbers. However, there are a few issues with the implementation:

1. The function name `func_1` does not match the problem statement which asks for a function named `sort_num_strings`.
2. The list comprehension converts each string to an integer and then the `sorted` function sorts these integers.
3. The result of `sorted` is a list of integers, but the problem specifies that the input is a list of strings, so the output should also be a list of strings.

Given the above points, the program does not fully meet the requirements because it outputs a list of integers instead of strings.

Correctness: **False**
