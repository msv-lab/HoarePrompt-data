Reasoning:

1. **Function Name**: The original assessment correctly points out that the function name `func_1` does not match the problem statement which asks for a function named `sort_num_strings`. This is indeed an issue, as the function name should reflect the functionality of the program.

2. **Conversion and Sorting**: The program correctly converts each string in the input list to an integer using a list comprehension and then sorts the resulting list of integers. However, the original assessment incorrectly states that the output should be a list of strings. The problem description does not explicitly state that the output must be a list of strings; it only mentions sorting a list of strings of numbers numerically. Therefore, converting the strings to integers, sorting them, and returning the sorted list of integers is a valid approach.

3. **Edge Cases**: The function summary mentions potential edge cases such as empty lists and non-convertible strings, which could result in a `ValueError`. To handle this, the function could include error handling, but this is not addressed in the original assessment.

4. **Assumption of Valid Inputs**: The original assessment assumes valid inputs, which means we assume the input list contains only strings that can be converted to integers. In this case, the program works as intended without raising exceptions.

Based on the above analysis, the main issue is the function name mismatch, but the core functionality of the program meets the requirements of sorting the list of strings of numbers numerically. Since the original assessment did not address the validity of the conversion and sorting process itself, it overstates the problems with the program.

Final: **False**
