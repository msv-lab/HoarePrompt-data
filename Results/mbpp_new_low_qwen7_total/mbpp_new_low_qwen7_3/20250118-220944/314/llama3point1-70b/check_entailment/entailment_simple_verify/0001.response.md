### Reasoning:

1. **Function Name Mismatch**: The function name `func_1` does not match the problem statement, which asks for a function named `sort_num_strings`. This is indeed a mismatch and should be corrected. However, this alone does not make the program incorrect, as long as the functionality works correctly when renamed appropriately.

2. **Conversion and Sorting**: The list comprehension correctly converts each string in `num_strings` to an integer and then the `sorted` function sorts these integers. This part of the assessment is correct.

3. **Output Type**: The original assessment states that the output should be a list of strings, but the program actually outputs a list of integers. This is a critical issue because the problem description explicitly states that the input is a list of strings and the output should also be a list of strings. 

However, the annotated code shows that the final output is a list of integers, which is different from the expected output format. This suggests that the program does not meet the requirement of returning a list of strings.

### Final Evaluation:
Based on the above analysis, the program does not correctly implement the sorting of a list of strings numerically while maintaining the output as a list of strings. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

**Final: False**
