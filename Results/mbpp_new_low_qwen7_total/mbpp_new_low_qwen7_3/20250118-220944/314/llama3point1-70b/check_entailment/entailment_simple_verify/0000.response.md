### Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` converts each string in the input list to an integer and then sorts these integers. However, there are some edge cases and potential issues that the original assessment might have overlooked:

1. **Handling of Non-Integer Strings**: The function assumes that all strings in `num_strings` can be successfully converted to integers using `int()`. If any string cannot be converted (e.g., contains non-numeric characters), a `ValueError` will be raised. This means the function does not handle such cases gracefully.

2. **Empty List Handling**: The function handles an empty list correctly by returning an empty list. This is accurate.

3. **Single Element List**: The function also handles a list with a single element correctly by converting it to an integer and returning the list containing that integer.

4. **Multiple Elements List**: The function correctly sorts a list with multiple elements as demonstrated by the example provided.

However, the original assessment does not address the issue of handling non-integer strings in the input list. To ensure the function is robust, we should add error handling for cases where the conversion fails.

### Evaluation:
To properly handle all cases, we should modify the function to include error handling for non-integer strings. Here's a revised version of the function with added error handling:

```python
def func_1(num_strings):
    try:
        return sorted([int(num) for num in num_strings])
    except ValueError:
        raise ValueError("One or more strings in the list cannot be converted to integers.")
```

With this modification, the function will raise a `ValueError` if any string in the input list cannot be converted to an integer, making it more robust.

### Final Decision:
Since the original assessment did not account for the possibility of non-integer strings in the input list, which could cause the function to fail, the original assessment is incomplete. Therefore, the final evaluation is:

Final: **False**
