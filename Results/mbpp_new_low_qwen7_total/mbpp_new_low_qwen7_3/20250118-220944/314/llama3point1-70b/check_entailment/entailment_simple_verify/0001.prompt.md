You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Write a function to sort a given list of strings of numbers numerically.

- Program: 
def func_1(num_strings):
    return sorted([int(num) for num in num_strings])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: num_strings is a list of strings, where each string can be converted to an integer.
def func_1(num_strings):
    return sorted([int(num) for num in num_strings])
    #The program returns a sorted list of integers, where each integer is obtained by converting a string from the list `num_strings` to an integer



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to sort a list of strings representing numbers. However, there are a few issues with the implementation:

1. The function name `func_1` does not match the problem statement which asks for a function named `sort_num_strings`.
2. The list comprehension converts each string to an integer and then the `sorted` function sorts these integers.
3. The result of `sorted` is a list of integers, but the problem specifies that the input is a list of strings, so the output should also be a list of strings.

Given the above points, the program does not fully meet the requirements because it outputs a list of integers instead of strings.

Correctness: **False**
