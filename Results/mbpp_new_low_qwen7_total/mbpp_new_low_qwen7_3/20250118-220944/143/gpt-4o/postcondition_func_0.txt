The function `func_1` accepts a string `text` and searches for a specific pattern `'a(b{2,3})'` within it using regular expressions. If the pattern is found in the string, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations, but it is worth noting that the function will always return `False` if the string `text` is empty or does not contain the specified pattern. The function does not handle any missing functionality beyond these basic behaviors.
