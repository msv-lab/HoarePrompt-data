### Reasoning:

1. **Pattern Explanation**:
   - The pattern `a(b{2,3})` correctly matches the character 'a' followed by exactly 2 or 3 'b's.
   - This means the function `func_1` will return `True` only if there is a substring in the input string that starts with 'a' and is immediately followed by either 2 or 3 'b's.

2. **Function Behavior**:
   - The function uses `re.search` to search for the pattern in the input string.
   - If a match is found, `re.search` returns a match object, and `bool(match)` returns `True`.
   - If no match is found, `re.search` returns `None`, and `bool(None)` returns `False`.

3. **Test Cases**:
   - `func_1('ac')`: The string does not contain 'a' followed by 2 or 3 'b's, so it should return `False`. The test case is correct.
   - `func_1('dc')`: The string does not contain 'a' followed by 2 or 3 'b's, so it should return `False`. The test case is correct.
   - `func_1('abbbba')`: The string contains 'a' followed by 4 'b's, which exceeds the allowed range (2 to 3). Therefore, the pattern `a(b{2,3})` will not match the entire sequence, and the function should return `False`. The test case is incorrect, as it expects `True` but the function correctly returns `False`.

4. **Annotated Code**:
   - The annotations correctly describe the function's behavior and its use of regular expressions.
   - The annotations also highlight that the function does not handle empty strings or strings that do not contain the specified pattern, which is consistent with the function's implementation.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The function behaves as expected based on the pattern definition.
   - The test cases provided in the problem statement are incorrect for the given pattern, but they do not affect the correctness of the function itself.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
