Reasoning:
- The problem requires a function that checks whether a string contains the character 'a' followed by two or three 'b' characters.
- The provided regular expression pattern `a(b{2,3})` correctly matches the required pattern.
- The function uses `re.search` to find the pattern in the input string. If the pattern is found, `re.search` returns a match object, which `bool(match)` converts to `True`.
- The provided test cases check various scenarios:
  - `'ac'` should return `False` because there is no 'a' followed by two or three 'b's.
  - `'dc'` should return `False` for the same reason.
  - `'abbbba'` should return `True` because it contains an 'a' followed by five 'b's (which satisfies the condition of two to three 'b's).
- Based on the test cases and the implementation, the function appears to be correctly implemented according to the problem statement and the expected behavior.

Correctness: **True**
