### Reasoning:

1. **Pattern Explanation**:
   - The pattern `a(b{2,3})` can be broken down as follows:
     - `a`: Matches the character 'a'.
     - `(b{2,3})`: Matches between 2 and 3 occurrences of 'b'.

2. **Function Behavior**:
   - The function `func_1` uses `re.search` to find the pattern in the input string.
   - If the pattern is found, `re.search` returns a match object, which is truthy.
   - If the pattern is not found, `re.search` returns `None`, which is falsy.
   - `bool(match)` converts the match object (or `None`) to a boolean value (`True` if a match is found, `False` otherwise).

3. **Test Cases**:
   - `func_1('ac')`: The string does not contain 'a' followed by 2 or 3 'b's, so it should return `False`. The test case is correct.
   - `func_1('dc')`: The string does not contain 'a' followed by 2 or 3 'b's, so it should return `False`. The test case is correct.
   - `func_1('abbbba')`: The string contains 'a' followed by 4 'b's, which exceeds the allowed range (2 to 3), but the pattern correctly identifies the 'a' followed by at least 2 'b's, so it should return `True`. The test case is incorrect because it expects `True` but the function would actually return `False`.

### Conclusion:

The function itself is logically correct according to the pattern definition. However, the third test case provided in the problem statement is incorrect, as it expects `True` for `func_1('abbbba')`, but the function will return `False` due to the pattern matching only 2 to 3 'b's following 'a'. Therefore, the provided test cases do not fully validate the function's correctness.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**
