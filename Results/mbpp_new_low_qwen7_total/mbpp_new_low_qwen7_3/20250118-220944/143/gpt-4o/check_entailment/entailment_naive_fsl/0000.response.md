Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` uses a regular expression to check if a string contains the character 'a' followed by two or three 'b' characters. The regular expression `a(b{2,3})` correctly matches the required pattern. The function uses `re.search` to find the pattern in the input string and returns `True` if the pattern is found, otherwise `False`. 

Based on the provided test cases:
- `func_1('ac')` returns `False`, which is correct because there is no 'a' followed by two or three 'b' characters.
- `func_1('dc')` returns `False`, which is correct because there is no 'a' followed by two or three 'b' characters.
- `func_1('abbbba')` returns `True`, which is correct because there is an 'a' followed by four 'b' characters.

The function works correctly for these test cases and the described problem. There doesn't seem to be any edge case that the provided code does not handle properly. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
