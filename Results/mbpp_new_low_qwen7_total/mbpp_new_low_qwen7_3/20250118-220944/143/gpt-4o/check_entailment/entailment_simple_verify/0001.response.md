### Reasoning:

1. **Pattern Explanation**:
   - The pattern `a(b{2,3})` correctly matches a single 'a' followed by between 2 and 3 'b's.
   - This means the pattern will only match strings like 'abb', 'abbb', but not 'abbbb' or any other string with fewer than 2 'b's after 'a'.

2. **Function Behavior**:
   - The function `func_1` uses `re.search` to search for the specified pattern in the input string.
   - If a match is found, `re.search` returns a match object, which is truthy when converted to a boolean using `bool()`.
   - If no match is found, `re.search` returns `None`, which is falsy when converted to a boolean using `bool()`.

3. **Test Cases Analysis**:
   - `func_1('ac')`: The string does not contain 'a' followed by 2 or 3 'b's, so `re.search` will return `None`. The function correctly returns `False`.
   - `func_1('dc')`: The string does not contain 'a' followed by 2 or 3 'b's, so `re.search` will return `None`. The function correctly returns `False`.
   - `func_1('abbbba')`: The string contains 'a' followed by 4 'b's, which exceeds the allowed range (2 to 3). Therefore, `re.search` will return `None`. The function correctly returns `False`.

4. **Annotated Code Validation**:
   - The annotated code correctly explains that `match` is `None` for all provided test cases, and the function returns `False` as expected.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Based on the pattern definition and the behavior of the function, the function is logically correct for the problem statement.
   - The test cases provided are consistent with the function's logic and the pattern definition.

### Final Answer:

Final: **True**

The function `func_1` is correct according to the given problem description and the provided test cases.
