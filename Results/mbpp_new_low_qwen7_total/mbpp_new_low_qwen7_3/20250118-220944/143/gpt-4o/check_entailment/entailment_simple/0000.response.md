Reasoning:
1. The function `func_1` is designed to check if a string contains the character 'a' followed by two or three 'b' characters.
2. The regular expression pattern `'a(b{2,3})'` correctly captures this requirement:
   - 'a' matches the character 'a'.
   - '(b{2,3})' ensures that there are exactly two or three 'b' characters following the 'a'.

3. Let's verify the provided test cases with the function:
   - `assert func_1('ac') == False`: This is correct because 'ac' does not match the pattern 'a(b{2,3})'.
   - `assert func_1('dc') == False`: This is correct because 'dc' does not match the pattern 'a(b{2,3})'.
   - `assert func_1('abbbba') == True`: This is incorrect according to the function implementation because 'abbbba' should be considered invalid (only 'abbb' would be valid).

4. The function logic is correct for the first two test cases but fails for the third one. The function should return `False` for 'abbbba' because it expects exactly two or three 'b' characters following 'a', not more.

Correctness: **False**
