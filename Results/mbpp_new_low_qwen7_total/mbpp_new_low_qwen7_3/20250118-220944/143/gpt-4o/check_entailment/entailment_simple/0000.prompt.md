Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Write a function that checks whether a string contains the 'a' character followed by two or three 'b' characters.

# Annotated Program:
import re

assert func_1('ac') == False
assert func_1('dc') == False
assert func_1('abbbba') == True

#State of the program right berfore the function call: text is a string.
def func_1(text):
    pattern = 'a(b{2,3})'

match = re.search(pattern, text)
    return bool(match)
    #The program returns False since match is None


# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
