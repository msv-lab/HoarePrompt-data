### Reasoning:

1. **Pattern Explanation**:
   - The pattern `a(b{2,3})` indeed matches a single 'a' character followed by exactly 2 or 3 'b' characters. This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Function Behavior**:
   - The function `func_1` uses `re.search` to find the pattern in the input string.
   - If the pattern is found, `re.search` returns a match object, which is truthy.
   - If the pattern is not found, `re.search` returns `None`, which is falsy.
   - `bool(match)` converts the match object (or `None`) to a boolean value (`True` if a match is found, `False` otherwise).

3. **Test Cases**:
   - `func_1('ac')`: The string does not contain 'a' followed by 2 or 3 'b's, so it should return `False`. The test case is correct.
   - `func_1('dc')`: The string does not contain 'a' followed by 2 or 3 'b's, so it should return `False`. The test case is correct.
   - `func_1('abbbba')`: The string contains 'a' followed by 5 'b's, which does not match the pattern of exactly 2 or 3 'b's following 'a', so it should return `False`. The test case is correct.

Based on the function summary and the test cases, the function behaves as expected and correctly implements the logic to check for the presence of 'a' followed by exactly 2 or 3 'b' characters. The provided test cases are valid and correctly assess the function's behavior.

### Conclusion:

The function itself is logically correct according to the pattern definition. The test cases provided accurately reflect the function's intended behavior.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**

Final: **True**
