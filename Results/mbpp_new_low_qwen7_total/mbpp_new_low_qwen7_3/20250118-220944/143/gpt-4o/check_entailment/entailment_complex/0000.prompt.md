Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Write a function that checks whether a string contains the 'a' character followed by two or three 'b' characters.

# Annotated Program:
import re

assert func_1('ac') == False
assert func_1('dc') == False
assert func_1('abbbba') == True

#State of the program right berfore the function call: text is a string.
def func_1(text):
    pattern = 'a(b{2,3})'

match = re.search(pattern, text)
    return bool(match)
    #The program returns False since match is None
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `text` and searches for a specific pattern `'a(b{2,3})'` within it using regular expressions. If the pattern is found in the string, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations, but it is worth noting that the function will always return `False` if the string `text` is empty or does not contain the specified pattern. The function does not handle any missing functionality beyond these basic behaviors.

# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
