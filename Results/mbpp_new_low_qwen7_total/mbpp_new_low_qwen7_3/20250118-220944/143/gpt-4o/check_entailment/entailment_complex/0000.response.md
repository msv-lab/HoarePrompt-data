Reasoning:
The provided function `func_1` uses a regular expression to check if the input string contains the character 'a' followed by two or three 'b' characters. Let's analyze the function step by step:

1. **Pattern Definition**: The pattern `a(b{2,3})` is defined correctly. This pattern matches:
   - The character 'a'
   - Followed by either 2 or 3 'b' characters (denoted by `{2,3}`)

2. **Regular Expression Search**: The `re.search` function is used to find the pattern in the input string `text`. If the pattern is found, `re.search` returns a match object, which will be truthy when converted to a boolean. If the pattern is not found, `re.search` returns `None`, which is falsy when converted to a boolean.

3. **Return Value**: The function returns `bool(match)`, where `match` is the result of `re.search`. Since `match` is `None` if the pattern is not found, `bool(None)` is `False`. If the pattern is found, `bool(match)` is `True`.

4. **Assertions**:
   - `assert func_1('ac') == False`: Correct because 'ac' does not match the pattern 'a(b{2,3})'.
   - `assert func_1('dc') == False`: Correct because 'dc' does not match the pattern 'a(b{2,3})'.
   - `assert func_1('abbbba') == True`: Correct because 'abbbba' matches the pattern 'a(b{2,3})'.

Given that the function behaves as expected according to the provided test cases and the pattern definition is correct, the function appears to be working as intended.

Correctness: **True**
