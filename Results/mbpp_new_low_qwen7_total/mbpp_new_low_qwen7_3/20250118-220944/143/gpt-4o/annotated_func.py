#State of the program right berfore the function call: text is a string.
def func_1(text):
    pattern = 'a(b{2,3})'

match = re.search(pattern, text)
    return bool(match)
    #The program returns False since match is None
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `text` and searches for a specific pattern `'a(b{2,3})'` within it using regular expressions. If the pattern is found in the string, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations, but it is worth noting that the function will always return `False` if the string `text` is empty or does not contain the specified pattern. The function does not handle any missing functionality beyond these basic behaviors.
