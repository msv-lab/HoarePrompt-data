Reasoning:
The function `func_1` is intended to perform a bitwise AND operation on the corresponding elements of the two input tuples. However, the provided code uses the bitwise AND operator (`&`) instead of the logical AND operator (`and`). In Python, the bitwise AND operator works on the binary representation of integers, while the logical AND operator returns a boolean value based on the truthiness of the operands.

Given the test cases:

1. `func_1((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3))` should return `(0, 0, 6, 1)` because:
   - `10 & 5 = 10` (binary: `1010 & 0101 = 0000`)
   - `4 & 2 = 0` (binary: `0100 & 0010 = 0000`)
   - `6 & 3 = 6` (binary: `0110 & 0011 = 0010`)
   - `9 & 3 = 1` (binary: `1001 & 0011 = 0001`)

2. `func_1((1, 2, 3, 4), (5, 6, 7, 8))` should return `(1, 2, 3, 4)` because:
   - `1 & 5 = 1` (binary: `0001 & 0101 = 0001`)
   - `2 & 6 = 2` (binary: `0010 & 0110 = 0010`)
   - `3 & 7 = 3` (binary: `0011 & 0111 = 0011`)
   - `4 & 8 = 4` (binary: `0100 & 1000 = 0000`)

3. `func_1((8, 9, 11, 12), (7, 13, 14, 17))` should return `(8, 1, 14, 12)` because:
   - `8 & 7 = 8` (binary: `1000 & 0111 = 0000`)
   - `9 & 13 = 1` (binary: `1001 & 1101 = 0001`)
   - `11 & 14 = 14` (binary: `1011 & 1110 = 1110`)
   - `12 & 17 = 12` (binary: `1100 & 10001 = 0000`)

The provided test cases in the annotations do not match the expected results based on the bitwise AND operation. The function should use the logical AND operator (`and`) to check if both elements are non-zero. However, the provided implementation uses the bitwise AND operator, which is incorrect for this problem.

Correctness: **False**
