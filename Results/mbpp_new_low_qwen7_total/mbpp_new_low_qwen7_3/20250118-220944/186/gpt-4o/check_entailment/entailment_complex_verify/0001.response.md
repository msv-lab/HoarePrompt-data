### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` is supposed to perform an element-wise bitwise AND operation between the two input tuples. However, the function does not perform a bitwise AND operation as the original assessment suggests; instead, it performs a logical AND operation, which is different from a bitwise AND operation.

Here's the breakdown of the provided test cases:

1. **Test Case 1:** `func_1((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3))`
   - `10 & 5 = 0` (Bitwise AND, but the output is `0` because `10` and `5` in binary are `1010` and `0101`, respectively, and their AND is `0000`, which is `0` in decimal)
   - `4 & 2 = 0` (Bitwise AND, and the output is `0`)
   - `6 & 3 = 2` (Bitwise AND, and the output is `2` because `6` and `3` in binary are `0110` and `0011`, respectively, and their AND is `0010`, which is `2` in decimal)
   - `9 & 3 = 1` (Bitwise AND, and the output is `1`)
   - Result: `(0, 0, 2, 1)` (This is actually the expected output for logical AND, not bitwise AND)

2. **Test Case 2:** `func_1((1, 2, 3, 4), (5, 6, 7, 8))`
   - `1 & 5 = 1` (Logical AND, and the output is `1` because `1` is `0001` in binary and `5` is `0101`, and their AND is `0001`, which is `1` in decimal)
   - `2 & 6 = 2` (Logical AND, and the output is `2` because `2` is `0010` in binary and `6` is `0110`, and their AND is `0010`, which is `2` in decimal)
   - `3 & 7 = 3` (Logical AND, and the output is `3` because `3` is `0011` in binary and `7` is `0111`, and their AND is `0011`, which is `3` in decimal)
   - `4 & 8 = 0` (Logical AND, and the output is `0` because `4` is `0100` in binary and `8` is `1000`, and their AND is `0000`, which is `0` in decimal)
   - Result: `(1, 2, 3, 0)` (This is actually the expected output for logical AND, not bitwise AND)

3. **Test Case 3:** `func_1((8, 9, 11, 12), (7, 13, 14, 17))`
   - `8 & 7 = 0` (Logical AND, and the output is `0` because `8` is `1000` in binary and `7` is `0111`, and their AND is `0000`, which is `0` in decimal)
   - `9 & 13 = 9` (Logical AND, and the output is `9` because `9` is `1001` in binary and `13` is `1101`, and their AND is `1001`, which is `9` in decimal)
   - `11 & 14 = 10` (Logical AND, and the output is `10` because `11` is `1011` in binary and `14` is `1110`, and their AND is `1010`, which is `10` in decimal)
   - `12 & 17 = 0` (Logical AND, and the output is `0` because `12` is `1100` in binary and `17` is `10001`, and their AND is `00000`, which is `0` in decimal)
   - Result: `(0, 9, 10, 0)` (This is actually the expected output for logical AND, not bitwise AND)

Given that the tests are correct according to logical AND operations, and the function correctly implements these logical AND operations, the function is indeed correct according to the problem description.
