Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the code and the requirements to understand why:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to extract the element-wise and tuples from the given two tuples. This means the function should return a tuple of tuples where each inner tuple contains the corresponding elements from both input tuples.

2. **Program Code**:
   ```python
   def func_1(tuple1, tuple2):
       return tuple(a & b for a, b in zip(tuple1, tuple2))
   ```
   - The function uses the `zip` function to pair elements from `tuple1` and `tuple2`.
   - The expression `a & b` applies the bitwise AND operation between the paired elements.
   - The result is a generator expression that is converted to a tuple.

3. **Annotated Code**:
   - The annotation explains that the function returns a tuple where each element is the result of the logical AND operation between the corresponding elements of `tuple1` and `tuple2`.
   - This aligns with the bitwise AND operation, not the element-wise pairing of tuples.

Given these observations, the function does not meet the requirement specified in the problem description. The problem asks for a tuple of tuples where each inner tuple contains the corresponding elements from both input tuples. However, the function simply performs a bitwise AND operation on the paired elements.

For example:
- `func_1((1, 2), (3, 4))` should return `((1, 3), (2, 4))`, but the function returns `(1 & 3, 2 & 4) = (1, 0)`.

Therefore, the original assessment is correct.

Final: **False**
