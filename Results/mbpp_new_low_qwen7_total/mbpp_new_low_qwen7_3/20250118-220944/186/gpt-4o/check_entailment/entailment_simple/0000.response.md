Reasoning:
- The function `func_1` is intended to perform an element-wise logical AND operation between two tuples.
- The logical AND operation (`&`) between two boolean values results in `True` (or `1`) if both values are `True`, otherwise it results in `False` (or `0`).
- The `zip` function pairs elements from the two input tuples, and the generator expression `(a & b for a, b in zip(tuple1, tuple2))` applies the logical AND operation to each pair of elements.
- The `tuple()` function then converts this generator into a tuple.

Let's verify the provided test cases:

1. For the first test case:
   - `tuple1 = (10, 4, 6, 9)`
   - `tuple2 = (5, 2, 3, 3)`
   - The logical AND operations are:
     - `10 & 5` -> `0`
     - `4 & 2` -> `0`
     - `6 & 3` -> `2` (since `0b0110 & 0b0011` is `0b0010`)
     - `9 & 3` -> `1` (since `0b1001 & 0b0011` is `0b0001`)
   - The expected output is `(0, 0, 2, 1)` which matches the provided assertion.

2. For the second test case:
   - `tuple1 = (1, 2, 3, 4)`
   - `tuple2 = (5, 6, 7, 8)`
   - The logical AND operations are:
     - `1 & 5` -> `1` (since `0b0001 & 0b0101` is `0b0001`)
     - `2 & 6` -> `2` (since `0b0010 & 0b0110` is `0b0010`)
     - `3 & 7` -> `3` (since `0b0011 & 0b0111` is `0b0011`)
     - `4 & 8` -> `0` (since `0b0100 & 0b1000` is `0b0000`)
   - The expected output is `(1, 2, 3, 0)` which matches the provided assertion.

3. For the third test case:
   - `tuple1 = (8, 9, 11, 12)`
   - `tuple2 = (7, 13, 14, 17)`
   - The logical AND operations are:
     - `8 & 7` -> `0` (since `0b1000 & 0b0111` is `0b0000`)
     - `9 & 13` -> `9` (since `0b1001 & 0b1101` is `0b1001`)
     - `11 & 14` -> `10` (since `0b1011 & 0b1110` is `0b1010`)
     - `12 & 17` -> `0` (since `0b1100 & 0b10001` is `0b0000`)
   - The expected output is `(0, 9, 10, 0)` which matches the provided assertion.

Given that all the assertions hold true, the function `func_1` correctly implements the desired behavior.

Correctness: **True**
