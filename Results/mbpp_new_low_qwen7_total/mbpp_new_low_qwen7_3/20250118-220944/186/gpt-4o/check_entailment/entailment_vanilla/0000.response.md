Reasoning:

The `func_1` function is supposed to perform an element-wise bitwise AND operation between the two input tuples and return the result as a tuple.

Let's break down the function:
- It uses a generator expression inside the `tuple` constructor.
- The generator expression iterates over pairs of elements from the two input tuples using `zip`.
- For each pair `(a, b)`, it performs the bitwise AND operation (`a & b`).

Now let's verify this with the provided test cases:

1. `func_1((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3))`
   - `10 & 5 = 0`
   - `4 & 2 = 0`
   - `6 & 3 = 2`
   - `9 & 3 = 1`
   - Result: `(0, 0, 2, 1)` (Correct)

2. `func_1((1, 2, 3, 4), (5, 6, 7, 8))`
   - `1 & 5 = 1`
   - `2 & 6 = 2`
   - `3 & 7 = 3`
   - `4 & 8 = 0`
   - Result: `(1, 2, 3, 0)` (Correct)

3. `func_1((8, 9, 11, 12), (7, 13, 14, 17))`
   - `8 & 7 = 0`
   - `9 & 13 = 9`
   - `11 & 14 = 10`
   - `12 & 17 = 0`
   - Result: `(0, 9, 10, 0)` (Correct)

All the provided test cases are correctly handled by the function.

Therefore, the function is correct according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
