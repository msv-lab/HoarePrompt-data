Reasoning: 

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the provided program and the requirements:

1. **Problem Description**: Extract element-wise and tuples from the given two tuples. This means that the output should be a tuple where each element is itself a tuple, containing one element from each of the input tuples.

2. **Given Program**:
   ```python
   def func_1(tuple1, tuple2):
       return tuple(a & b for a, b in zip(tuple1, tuple2))
   ```
   This function uses the bitwise AND (`&`) operator between corresponding elements of the two input tuples and returns a single tuple containing the results of these operations. It does not return a tuple of tuples as required.

3. **Annotated Code**:
   - The annotated code confirms that the function returns a single tuple with each element being the result of the bitwise AND operation between corresponding elements of the input tuples.
   - This is consistent with the behavior observed in the assertions.

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - For `func_1((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3))`:
     - `10 & 5 = 0`
     - `4 & 2 = 0`
     - `6 & 3 = 2`
     - `9 & 3 = 1`
     - Result: `(0, 0, 2, 1)` (as per the assertion)
   - For `func_1((1, 2, 3, 4), (5, 6, 7, 8))`:
     - `1 & 5 = 1`
     - `2 & 6 = 2`
     - `3 & 7 = 3`
     - `4 & 8 = 0`
     - Result: `(1, 2, 3, 0)` (as per the assertion)
   - For `func_1((8, 9, 11, 12), (7, 13, 14, 17))`:
     - `8 & 7 = 0`
     - `9 & 13 = 9`
     - `11 & 14 = 10`
     - `12 & 17 = 0`
     - Result: `(0, 9, 10, 0)` (as per the assertion)

These results show that the program indeed performs the bitwise AND operation, which is not what the problem description asks for. The expected output format is a tuple of tuples, where each inner tuple contains the corresponding elements from the input tuples.

Therefore, the original assessment is correct, and the program does not meet the requirements.

Final: **False**
