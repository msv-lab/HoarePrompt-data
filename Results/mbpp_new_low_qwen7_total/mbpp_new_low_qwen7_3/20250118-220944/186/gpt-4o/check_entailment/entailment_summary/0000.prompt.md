Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Write a function to extract the elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples.

# Program:
assert func_1((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3)) == (0, 0, 2, 1)
assert func_1((1, 2, 3, 4), (5, 6, 7, 8)) == (1, 2, 3, 0)
assert func_1((8, 9, 11, 12), (7, 13, 14, 17)) == (0, 9, 10, 0)

def func_1(tuple1, tuple2):
    return tuple((a & b for (a, b) in zip(tuple1, tuple2)))





# Execution Summary:
The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `tuple1` and `tuple2`, which are tuples of the same length. It returns a new tuple where each element is the result of the logical AND operation between the corresponding elements of `tuple1` and `tuple2`. This means that if both corresponding elements in `tuple1` and `tuple2` are non-zero (True), the resulting element in the returned tuple will be 1 (True); otherwise, it will be 0 (False). The function handles the case where the input tuples are of equal length and performs the logical AND operation correctly for all pairs of elements.


# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
