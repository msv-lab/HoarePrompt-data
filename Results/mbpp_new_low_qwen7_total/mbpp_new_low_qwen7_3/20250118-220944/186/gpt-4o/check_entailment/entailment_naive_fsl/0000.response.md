Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program uses the bitwise AND operator (`&`) between elements of the two tuples and returns a new tuple containing the results. However, the problem description asks to extract the element-wise and tuples from the given two tuples, which implies returning a tuple of tuples where each inner tuple contains the corresponding elements from both input tuples.

The program does not meet this requirement. For example, consider the input `func_1((1, 2), (3, 4))`. The expected output would be `((1, 3), (2, 4))`, but the program will return `(1 & 3, 2 & 4) = (1, 0)`.

Therefore, the program does not handle the requirement correctly and is thus incorrect.
