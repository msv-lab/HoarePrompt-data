Reasoning: 

The original assessment is accurate. Let's analyze the provided function and the problem description step by step.

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a function to extract the element-wise and tuples from the given two tuples. This means that for each pair of elements from the two input tuples, we should form a tuple containing those elements, and then return a tuple of such tuples.

2. **Function Code**: The function `func_1` uses the `zip` function to iterate over pairs of elements from `tuple1` and `tuple2`, and applies the bitwise AND operator (`&`) to each pair. The result is a generator expression that generates a single tuple with the results of these operations.

3. **Function Summary**: The summary describes the function as performing a logical AND operation on corresponding elements of the input tuples and returning a single tuple with the results. This aligns with the use of the bitwise AND operator in the function code.

Given the above, the function does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Specifically, the problem requires forming a tuple of tuples where each inner tuple contains the corresponding elements from both input tuples, while the function instead forms a single tuple with the results of the bitwise AND operation.

To illustrate:
- Input: `func_1((1, 2), (3, 4))`
- Expected output: `((1, 3), (2, 4))`
- Actual output: `(1 & 3, 2 & 4) = (1, 0)`

Therefore, the original assessment is correct in identifying the program as incorrect.

Final: **False**
