The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `tuple1` and `tuple2`. Both `tuple1` and `tuple2` are tuples with the same length. After executing the function body, the function returns a tuple where each element is the result of the logical AND operation between the corresponding elements of `tuple1` and `tuple2`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two tuples `tuple1` and `tuple2` of the same length, and return a tuple with each element being the result of the logical AND operation between the corresponding elements of `tuple1` and `tuple2`.
