Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `tuple1` and `tuple2`, which are tuples of the same length. It returns a new tuple where each element is the result of the logical AND operation between the corresponding elements of `tuple1` and `tuple2`. This means that if both corresponding elements in `tuple1` and `tuple2` are non-zero (True), the resulting element in the returned tuple will be 1 (True); otherwise, it will be 0 (False). The function handles the case where the input tuples are of equal length and performs the logical AND operation correctly for all pairs of elements.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If either `tuple1` or `tuple2` is empty, the function will still work correctly, returning an empty tuple.
- If the input tuples have different lengths, the function will raise a `ValueError` because the `zip` function requires the iterables to have the same length. The annotations do not account for this edge case, but the code itself enforces this requirement.
