#State of the program right berfore the function call: tuple1 and tuple2 are tuples with the same length.
def func_1(tuple1, tuple2):
    return tuple(a & b for a, b in zip(tuple1, tuple2))
    #The program returns a tuple where each element is the result of the logical AND operation between the corresponding elements of tuple1 and tuple2
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `tuple1` and `tuple2`, which are tuples of the same length. It returns a new tuple where each element is the result of the logical AND operation between the corresponding elements of `tuple1` and `tuple2`. This means that if both corresponding elements in `tuple1` and `tuple2` are non-zero (True), the resulting element in the returned tuple will be 1 (True); otherwise, it will be 0 (False). The function handles the case where the input tuples are of equal length and performs the logical AND operation correctly for all pairs of elements.
