Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s` (a string) and `pattern` (a valid regular expression pattern). It searches for a match of the regular expression pattern within the string `s`. If a match is found, the function returns a tuple containing three elements: `match.group()` (the matched substring), `match.start()` (the starting index of the match), and `match.end()` (the ending index of the match). If no match is found, the function returns `None`.**

This summary covers the following aspects:
- The function takes a string and a regular expression pattern as inputs.
- It performs a search for the pattern within the string.
- It returns specific details about the match if one is found, or `None` if no match is present.

No additional edge cases or missing functionality were identified based on the provided code and annotations.
