The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s` (a string) and `pattern` (a valid regular expression pattern). It searches for a match of the regular expression pattern within the string `s`. If a match is found, the function returns a tuple containing three elements: `match.group()` (the matched substring), `match.start()` (the starting index of the match), and `match.end()` (the ending index of the match). If no match is found, the function returns `None`.
