Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program uses `re.search` to find the first occurrence of a regex pattern in a string. However, the problem description requires the function to return the matching substring, a start index, and an end index. The current implementation returns `None` if no match is found, which does not provide the required information about the start and end indices. Additionally, if a match is found, it only returns the matched substring and not the start and end indices.

To meet the problem description, the function should be modified to return the start and end indices along with the matched substring. Here is an example of how the function could be corrected:

```python
import re

def func_1(s, pattern):
    match = re.search(pattern, s)
    if match:
        return (match.group(), match.start(), match.end())
    else:
        return None, -1, -1
```

This version of the function ensures that even if no match is found, it will still return a tuple with `None` and two `-1` values, which satisfies the requirement of returning start and end indices.
