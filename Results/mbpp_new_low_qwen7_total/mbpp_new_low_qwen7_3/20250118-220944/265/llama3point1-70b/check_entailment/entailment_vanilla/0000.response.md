Reasoning:
The provided function `func_1` uses the `re.search()` method to find the first occurrence of a pattern within the given string `s`. If a match is found, it returns a tuple containing the matched substring, its start index, and its end index. If no match is found, it returns `None`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the function:

1. `match = re.search(pattern, s)`: This line searches for the pattern in the string `s`. If a match is found, `match` will be a match object; otherwise, it will be `None`.
2. `if match:`: This checks if a match was found.
3. `return (match.group(), match.start(), match.end())`: If a match is found, it returns the matched substring (`match.group()`), the start index (`match.start()`), and the end index (`match.end()`) of the match.
4. `else: return None`: If no match is found, it returns `None`.

Given this logic, the function correctly implements the requirement to return the matching substring along with its indices or return `None` if no match is found.

Correctness: **True**
