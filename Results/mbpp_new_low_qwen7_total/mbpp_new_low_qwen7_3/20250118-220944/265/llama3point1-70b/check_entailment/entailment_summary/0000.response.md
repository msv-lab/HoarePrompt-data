Reasoning:
The provided program appears to be correctly implemented according to the problem description. The function `func_1` does the following:

1. Uses the `re.search` method to find the first occurrence of the regex pattern in the string `s`.
2. Checks if a match is found using an `if` statement.
3. If a match is found, it returns a tuple containing the matched substring (`match.group()`), the start index (`match.start()`), and the end index (`match.end()`).
4. If no match is found, it returns `None`.

This implementation aligns with the provided execution summary, which states that the function behaves as expected: returning the match details if a match is found or `None` if not. Given this analysis, the program matches the problem description accurately.

Correctness: **True**
