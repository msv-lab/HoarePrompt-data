Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Write a function to search a string for a regex pattern. The function should return the matching subtring, a start index and an end index.

# Program:
import re

def func_1(s, pattern):
    match = re.search(pattern, s)
    if match:
        return (match.group(), match.start(), match.end())
    else:
        return None





# Execution Summary:
The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s` (a string) and `pattern` (a valid regular expression pattern). It searches for a match of the regular expression pattern within the string `s`. If a match is found, the function returns a tuple containing three elements: `match.group()` (the matched substring), `match.start()` (the starting index of the match), and `match.end()` (the ending index of the match). If no match is found, the function returns `None`.


# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
