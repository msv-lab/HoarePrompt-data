### Reasoning:

The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes two parameters: a string `s` and a regular expression pattern `pattern`. The function uses the `re.search()` method from the `re` module to find the first occurrence of the pattern within the string `s`.

- If a match is found (`match` is not `None`), the function returns three values:
  - `match.group()`: This returns the substring that matches the pattern.
  - `match.start()`: This returns the starting index of the match in the string `s`.
  - `match.end()`: This returns the ending index (exclusive) of the match in the string `s`.

- If no match is found, the function returns `None`.

Given the problem statement, the function correctly returns the required information (the matched substring along with its start and end indices) if a match is found. If no match is found, it correctly returns `None`.

The comments in the code also accurately describe the behavior of the function.

### Conclusion:

The given program meets the requirements of the problem description and handles all possible cases correctly.

### Response:
Correctness: **True**
