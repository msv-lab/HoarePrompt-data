Reasoning:
1. The function `func_1` correctly uses the `re.search` method to find a match for the given pattern within the string `s`.
2. If a match is found, it returns a tuple containing the matched substring, the start index, and the end index of the match.
3. If no match is found, it returns `None`, which aligns with the requirements of the problem statement.

Given that the function performs the required operations as specified in the problem description, there are no apparent errors in the provided code.

Correctness: **True**
