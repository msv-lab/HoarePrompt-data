Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` uses the `re.search()` method to find the first occurrence of a pattern within the given string `s`. The function checks if a match is found and returns the appropriate information if a match exists, or `None` if no match is found. However, we need to verify this reasoning using the provided function summary to ensure there are no discrepancies.

From the function summary, we can confirm the following:
- The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `s` (a string) and `pattern` (a valid regular expression pattern).
- If a match is found, the function returns a tuple containing the matched substring, its start index, and its end index.
- If no match is found, the function returns `None`.

Let's break down the function again using the provided summary:
1. `match = re.search(pattern, s)`: This line searches for the pattern in the string `s`. If a match is found, `match` will be a match object; otherwise, it will be `None`.
2. `if match:`: This checks if a match was found.
3. `return (match.group(), match.start(), match.end())`: If a match is found, it returns the matched substring (`match.group()`), the start index (`match.start()`), and the end index (`match.end()`) of the match.
4. `else: return None`: If no match is found, it returns `None`.

Based on the function summary and the breakdown, the function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to return the matching substring along with its indices or return `None` if no match is found.

Final: **True**
