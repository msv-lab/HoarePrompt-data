Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided function and the original assessment step-by-step.

### Function Analysis
- **Function Signature**: `func_1(s, pattern)`
  - `s`: a string
  - `pattern`: a valid regular expression pattern

- **Function Behavior**:
  - The function uses `re.search(pattern, s)` to search for the first occurrence of the pattern in the string `s`.
  - If a match is found, it returns a tuple containing:
    - `match.group()`: the matched substring
    - `match.start()`: the starting index of the match
    - `match.end()`: the ending index of the match
  - If no match is found, it returns `None`.

- **Function Summary**:
  - Correctly describes the behavior of the function, including the return value structure when a match is found and the return type (`None`) when no match is found.

### Original Assessment Analysis
- **Correctness**: **False**
- **Explanation**: The current implementation correctly handles the case where no match is found by returning `None`. This aligns with the function summary and the problem description requirements. When a match is found, the function returns the correct tuple containing the matched substring and its indices.

### Evaluation
- The function correctly implements the logic as described in the problem statement and the function summary.
- The function returns `None` when no match is found, which is appropriate and meets the requirement of returning start and end indices as `-1` when no match is found (as implied in the original assessment).
- The function summary accurately reflects the behavior of the function.

Given this analysis, the original assessment seems to be incorrect because the function does meet the requirements specified in the problem description and the function summary.

Final: **True**
