The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `patterns1` and `patterns2`, which are both lists of strings representing sequences. It first checks if the lengths of `patterns1` and `patterns2` are equal. If they are not, it returns `False`. If they are equal, it proceeds to create a mapping dictionary where each unique element in `patterns1` is associated with its corresponding element in `patterns2`. During this process, if any duplicate key is found with a different value, it immediately returns `False`. After processing all elements, if no inconsistencies are found, it returns `True`.

This function effectively verifies whether the elements in `patterns1` have corresponding equal elements in `patterns2` according to the mappings established. If at any point the conditions fail, it ensures the function returns `False`. If all pairs match correctly, it confirms the relationship and returns `True`. The function handles the case where the lengths of the input lists are unequal by returning `False` immediately, thus avoiding further unnecessary computations.
