`mapping` is a dictionary that is updated by assigning `p2` to `mapping[p1]`. Since `patterns1` and `patterns2` both contain at least one element, `p1` is an element from `patterns1` and `p2` is an element from `patterns2`. The specific values of `p1` and `p2` are not provided, but the mapping in the dictionary is established. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`patterns1` and `patterns2` both contain at least one element; `mapping` is a dictionary where `mapping[p1]` is set to `p2`**
