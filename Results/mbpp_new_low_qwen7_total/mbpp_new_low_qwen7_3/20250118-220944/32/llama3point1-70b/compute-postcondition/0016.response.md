Postcondition: ***`patterns1` and `patterns2` both contain at least one element. If `p1` is not in `mapping`, the function does not change the return value. If `p1` is in `mapping` and `mapping[p1]` equals `p2`, the function does not change the return value. If `p1` is in `mapping` and `mapping[p1]` does not equal `p2`, the function returns False.***
