`mapping` is a dictionary where `p1` (an element from `patterns1`) is mapped to `p2` (an element from `patterns2`). After executing the line of code, `p1` is added as a key in the `mapping` dictionary with the corresponding value being `p2`. The states of `patterns1` and `patterns2` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`patterns1` and `patterns2` both contain at least one element; `mapping` is a dictionary with `p1` mapped to `p2`**
