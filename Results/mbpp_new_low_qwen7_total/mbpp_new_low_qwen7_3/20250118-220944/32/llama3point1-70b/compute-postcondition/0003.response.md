The code initializes an empty dictionary called `mapping`. This does not affect the lengths of `patterns1` and `patterns2`, nor does it change their content. The output state should reflect this.

Output State: **patterns1 and patterns2 are lists of strings representing sequences with the same length; `mapping` is an empty dictionary {}**
