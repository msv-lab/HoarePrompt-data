Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**: 
   - `patterns1` and `patterns2` both contain at least one element.

2. **Loop Condition**: 
   - The loop iterates over pairs of elements from `patterns1` and `patterns2` using `zip`.

3. **Loop Head Variables**:
   - The loop variables are `p1` and `p2`, which are pairs of elements from `patterns1` and `patterns2`.

4. **State Adjustments**:
   - Since the loop condition is based on the elements of `patterns1` and `patterns2`, and `zip` ensures that these lists are consumed pair by pair, we need to consider how the consumption of these lists affects the next iteration.
   - After the first iteration, `patterns1` and `patterns2` will each lose their first element.

5. **After the First Iteration**:
   - `patterns1` and `patterns2` will now contain all elements except the first one.
   - Both `patterns1` and `patterns2` must still contain at least one element for the loop to continue.

6. **Final State**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, both `patterns1` and `patterns2` must still contain at least one element.

Thus, the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time are:

**State: **`patterns1` and `patterns2` both contain at least one element**.
