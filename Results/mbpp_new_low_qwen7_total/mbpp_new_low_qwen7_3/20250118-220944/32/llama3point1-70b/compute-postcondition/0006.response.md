The code `mapping[p1] = p2` assigns the value of `p2` to the key `p1` in the dictionary `mapping`. Given the initial conditions, the following changes occur:

- `p1` is not already a key in `mapping`.
- `p2` is assigned to `p1` in `mapping`.

Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`patterns1` must have at least 1 element, `patterns2` must have at least 1 element, and the current value of `p1` is not in `mapping`; now `p1` is a key in `mapping` with the value `p2`.**
