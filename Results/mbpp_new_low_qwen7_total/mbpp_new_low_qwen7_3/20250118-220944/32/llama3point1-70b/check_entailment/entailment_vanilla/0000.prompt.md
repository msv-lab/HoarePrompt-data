Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Write a function to check whether it follows the sequence given in the patterns array.

# Program:
def func_1(patterns1, patterns2):
    if len(patterns1) != len(patterns2):
        return False
    mapping = {}
    for (p1, p2) in zip(patterns1, patterns2):
        if p1 not in mapping:
            mapping[p1] = p2
        elif mapping[p1] != p2:
            return False
    return True



# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
