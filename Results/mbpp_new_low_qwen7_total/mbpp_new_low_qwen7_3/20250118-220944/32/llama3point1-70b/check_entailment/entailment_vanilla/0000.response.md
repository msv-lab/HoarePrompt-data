Reasoning: 
The provided function `func_1` appears to be checking if two lists, `patterns1` and `patterns2`, follow the same sequence. It does this by creating a mapping from elements of `patterns1` to corresponding elements of `patterns2`. The function returns `False` if the lengths of the two lists are not equal or if it finds any inconsistency in the mapping. If no inconsistencies are found, it returns `True`.

To verify the correctness of the function, let's consider its behavior with different inputs:

1. **Case where lengths are unequal**: If the lengths of `patterns1` and `patterns2` are different, the function correctly returns `False`.
2. **Case where there is a mismatch in the mapping**: If any element in `patterns1` maps to a different element in `patterns2` than previously mapped, the function returns `False`.
3. **Case where all elements match the mapping**: If all elements in `patterns1` map correctly to the corresponding elements in `patterns2`, the function returns `True`.

Given the problem statement and the provided function, it seems the function is designed to ensure that the two lists maintain a consistent one-to-one correspondence according to the provided pattern. There are no apparent errors in the logic of the function.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the provided function, the function should work as intended under the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
