Reasoning:
1. The function `func_1` first checks if the lengths of `patterns1` and `patterns2` are equal. If they are not, it immediately returns `False`, which is correct because if the lengths differ, the sequences cannot follow the same pattern.
2. If the lengths are equal, the function proceeds to create a dictionary `mapping` to store the correspondences between elements in `patterns1` and `patterns2`.
3. It then iterates through both lists simultaneously using `zip`. For each pair `(p1, p2)`:
   - If `p1` is not already in `mapping`, it adds an entry with `p1` mapping to `p2`.
   - If `p1` is already in `mapping`, it checks if the current `p2` matches the previously stored value in `mapping`. If it does not match, the function returns `False` immediately, indicating a mismatch in the sequence.
4. After processing all pairs, if no mismatches were found, the function returns `True`.

Given this analysis, the function correctly checks whether the elements in `patterns1` can be mapped to `patterns2` such that every element in `patterns1` corresponds uniquely to an element in `patterns2`. 

Correctness: **True**
