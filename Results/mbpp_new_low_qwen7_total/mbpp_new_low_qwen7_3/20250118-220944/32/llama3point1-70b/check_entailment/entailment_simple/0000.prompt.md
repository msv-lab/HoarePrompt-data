Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Write a function to check whether it follows the sequence given in the patterns array.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: patterns1 and patterns2 are lists of strings representing sequences.
def func_1(patterns1, patterns2):
    if (len(patterns1) != len(patterns2)) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: patterns1 and patterns2 are lists of strings representing sequences, and the length of patterns1 is equal to the length of patterns2
    mapping = {}
    for (p1, p2) in zip(patterns1, patterns2):
        if p1 not in mapping:
            mapping[p1] = p2
        elif mapping[p1] != p2:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: All elements in `patterns1` and `patterns2` have been processed, and `mapping` contains mappings for each unique element in `patterns1`. For any unique `p1` in `patterns1`, `mapping[p1]` will be the corresponding element in `patterns2`. If during any iteration, it is found that `mapping[p1]` is not equal to `p2`, the function will return `False`. Otherwise, the function will return `True` after processing all elements.
    return True
    #The program returns True if all elements in `patterns1` have corresponding equal elements in `patterns2` according to the mappings in `mapping`, otherwise it returns False


# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
