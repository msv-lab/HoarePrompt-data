Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Write a function to check whether it follows the sequence given in the patterns array.

# Program:
def func_1(patterns1, patterns2):
    if len(patterns1) != len(patterns2):
        return False
    mapping = {}
    for (p1, p2) in zip(patterns1, patterns2):
        if p1 not in mapping:
            mapping[p1] = p2
        elif mapping[p1] != p2:
            return False
    return True





# Execution Summary:
The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `patterns1` and `patterns2`, which are both lists of strings representing sequences. It first checks if the lengths of `patterns1` and `patterns2` are equal. If they are not, it returns `False`. If they are equal, it proceeds to create a mapping dictionary where each unique element in `patterns1` is associated with its corresponding element in `patterns2`. During this process, if any duplicate key is found with a different value, it immediately returns `False`. After processing all elements, if no inconsistencies are found, it returns `True`.

This function effectively verifies whether the elements in `patterns1` have corresponding equal elements in `patterns2` according to the mappings established. If at any point the conditions fail, it ensures the function returns `False`. If all pairs match correctly, it confirms the relationship and returns `True`. The function handles the case where the lengths of the input lists are unequal by returning `False` immediately, thus avoiding further unnecessary computations.
