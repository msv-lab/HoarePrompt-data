Reasoning: 
The annotated program accurately describes the behavior of the function `func_1`. The function first checks if the lengths of `patterns1` and `patterns2` are equal. If they are not, it returns `False`. If the lengths are equal, it proceeds to create a mapping dictionary to establish a one-to-one correspondence between elements of `patterns1` and `patterns2`. If any element in `patterns1` maps to a different element in `patterns2` than previously mapped, the function returns `False`. After processing all elements, if no inconsistencies are found, it returns `True`.

The logic described matches the intended behavior of the function to check if the sequences in `patterns1` follow the sequences in `patterns2`. The function correctly handles the length check and the mapping creation to ensure that each element in `patterns1` has a corresponding element in `patterns2` without conflicts.

Therefore, based on the provided annotations and the logical steps within the function, the function behaves as expected.

Correctness: **True**
