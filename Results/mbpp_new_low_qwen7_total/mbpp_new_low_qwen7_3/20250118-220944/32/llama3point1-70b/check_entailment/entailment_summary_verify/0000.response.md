### Reasoning:

The original assessment states that the function `func_1` is correct. Let's break down the function and compare it against the problem description and the provided function summary.

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to check whether the sequences in `patterns1` and `patterns2` follow the same pattern. This means that each element in `patterns1` should correspond to the same element in `patterns2`.

2. **Function Code**:
   - The function first checks if the lengths of `patterns1` and `patterns2` are equal. If not, it returns `False`.
   - It then creates a dictionary `mapping` to store the associations between elements of `patterns1` and `patterns2`.
   - For each pair of elements `(p1, p2)` from `patterns1` and `patterns2`, it checks if `p1` is already in the `mapping`:
     - If `p1` is not in `mapping`, it adds the pair `(p1, p2)` to the `mapping`.
     - If `p1` is already in `mapping` but the current `p2` does not match the previously stored value, it returns `False`.
   - If no inconsistencies are found, it returns `True`.

3. **Function Summary**: The summary accurately describes the function's behavior. It correctly mentions that the function checks for matching elements and returns `False` if any inconsistency is found. The function also returns `False` immediately if the lengths of the input lists are unequal.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - The function correctly handles the case where the lengths of the input lists are unequal.
   - It uses a dictionary to ensure that each element in `patterns1` is correctly mapped to the corresponding element in `patterns2`.
   - The function returns `False` if any inconsistency is found during the mapping process.
   - If no inconsistencies are found after processing all elements, the function returns `True`.

Given the analysis, the function `func_1` correctly implements the required functionality as described in the problem statement and the provided function summary. There are no apparent flaws or edge cases that would make the function incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
