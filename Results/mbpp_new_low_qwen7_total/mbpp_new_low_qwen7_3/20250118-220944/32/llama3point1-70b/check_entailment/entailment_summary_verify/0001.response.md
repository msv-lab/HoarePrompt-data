Reasoning: 
The original assessment is accurate, but we can provide a more detailed validation using the function summary.

From the function summary, we understand that `func_1` is designed to check if two lists, `patterns1` and `patterns2`, follow the same sequence. This is achieved by creating a mapping from elements of `patterns1` to corresponding elements of `patterns2`. The function returns `False` if the lengths of the two lists are different or if it finds any inconsistency in the mapping. If no inconsistencies are found, it returns `True`.

Let's break down the logic of the function with respect to the problem description and the provided summary:

1. **Case where lengths are unequal**: The function correctly checks the length of `patterns1` and `patterns2`. If they are not equal, it returns `False`. This matches the behavior described in the summary and the original assessment.

2. **Case where there is a mismatch in the mapping**: The function uses a dictionary to store the mapping of elements from `patterns1` to `patterns2`. If it finds a duplicate key with a different value, it returns `False`. This ensures that the function correctly identifies any inconsistency in the mapping.

3. **Case where all elements match the mapping**: The function processes all elements without finding any inconsistencies, leading to a return value of `True`. This also aligns with the expected behavior described in the summary and the original assessment.

Given that the function correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and the function summary, and there are no apparent errors in the logic, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
