Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` appears to correctly implement the requirement of checking whether two sequences (`patterns1` and `patterns2`) follow the same pattern. It uses a dictionary to map elements from `patterns1` to `patterns2` and ensures that each element in `patterns1` maps to the corresponding element in `patterns2`. If any element in `patterns1` maps to a different element in `patterns2`, it returns `False`. If the lengths of the two patterns are different, it returns `False` immediately. Given these checks, the function seems to handle all potential cases correctly without any apparent flaws or edge cases that would make it incorrect.
