### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the primary functionality of the function `func_1`. The function aims to verify if two sequences, `patterns1` and `patterns2`, follow the same pattern by ensuring each element in `patterns1` corresponds to the same element in `patterns2`. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initial Length Check**:
   - The function first checks if the lengths of `patterns1` and `patterns2` are equal. If not, it immediately returns `False`.
   - This ensures that only sequences of the same length are compared, which is a necessary condition for meaningful comparison.

2. **Mapping Creation**:
   - A dictionary `mapping` is used to store the mappings between elements of `patterns1` and `patterns2`.
   - For each pair `(p1, p2)` in `zip(patterns1, patterns2)`, the function checks if `p1` is already in the dictionary.
     - If `p1` is not in the dictionary, it adds the mapping `p1 -> p2`.
     - If `p1` is already in the dictionary and the current value (`mapping[p1]`) does not match `p2`, it returns `False`.
       - This ensures that the same element in `patterns1` always maps to the same element in `patterns2`.

3. **Final Return**:
   - After processing all elements, if no inconsistencies are found, the function returns `True`.

Given the above analysis, the function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement of checking whether the elements in `patterns1` have corresponding equal elements in `patterns2` according to the mappings established. The function handles the case where the lengths of the input lists are unequal by returning `False` immediately, thus avoiding unnecessary computations.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final:
**True**
