### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` aims to check if the sequences in `patterns1` and `patterns2` follow the same pattern. Let's break down the logic of the function using the provided annotations:

1. **Length Check**: The function first checks if the lengths of `patterns1` and `patterns2` are equal. If they are not, it immediately returns `False`. This handles one edge case where the sequences have different lengths.
   
2. **Mapping Construction**: A dictionary `mapping` is used to store the mappings from elements in `patterns1` to elements in `patterns2`. For each pair `(p1, p2)` in `zip(patterns1, patterns2)`, it checks if `p1` is already in the dictionary:
   - If `p1` is not in the dictionary, it adds the mapping `p1 -> p2`.
   - If `p1` is already in the dictionary, it checks if the current value stored in the dictionary matches `p2`. If not, it returns `False`.

3. **Final Return**: After processing all pairs, if no mismatches are found, the function returns `True`.

Based on this analysis, the function correctly implements the requirement to check if the sequences follow the same pattern. It handles the length mismatch case and ensures that each element in `patterns1` corresponds to the same element in `patterns2`.

Given the annotations and the logical flow of the function, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final:
**True**
