The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns `True` if every even-indexed element in the list is odd. Otherwise, it returns `False`. The function iterates through the list using a for loop and checks if the index is odd (`i % 2 != 0`) and the element at that index is even (`lst[i] % 2 == 0`). If such an element is found, the function immediately returns `False`. If no such element is found after checking all elements, the function returns `True`.
