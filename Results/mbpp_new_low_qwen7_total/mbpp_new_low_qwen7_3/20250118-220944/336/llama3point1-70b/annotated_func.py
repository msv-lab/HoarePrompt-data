#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of integers with any length, `i` is `len(lst)`.
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns `True` if every even-indexed element in the list is odd. Otherwise, it returns `False`. The function iterates through the list using a for loop and checks if the index is odd (`i % 2 != 0`) and the element at that index is even (`lst[i] % 2 == 0`). If such an element is found, the function immediately returns `False`. If no such element is found after checking all elements, the function returns `True`.
