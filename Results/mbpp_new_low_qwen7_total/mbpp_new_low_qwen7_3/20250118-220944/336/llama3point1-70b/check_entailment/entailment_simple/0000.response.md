### Reasoning:

1. The problem statement requires us to check if every odd index in the list contains an odd number.
2. Let's analyze the code step-by-step:
   - The function `func_1` iterates over the list using a `for` loop with `range(len(lst))`.
   - The loop checks if the index `i` is odd (`i % 2 != 0`).
   - If the index `i` is odd and the value at that index is even (`lst[i] % 2 == 0`), the function immediately returns `False`.
   - If the loop completes without finding any such case, the function returns `True`.

3. This logic correctly implements the requirement to ensure that every odd index contains an odd number:
   - It checks each element at odd indices.
   - If it finds an even number at any odd index, it correctly returns `False`.
   - If all odd indices contain odd numbers, it correctly returns `True`.

4. There are no logical errors in the provided code that would cause it to behave incorrectly according to the problem description.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the required functionality.

### Response:
Correctness: **True**
