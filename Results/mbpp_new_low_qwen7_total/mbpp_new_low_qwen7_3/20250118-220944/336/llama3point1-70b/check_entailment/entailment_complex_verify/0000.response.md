### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the annotations to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Program Analysis:
```python
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
    return True
```

1. **Loop Iteration**: The function uses a for loop to iterate over the indices of the list `lst`.
2. **Condition Check**: Inside the loop, it checks two conditions:
   - `i % 2 != 0`: This condition ensures that `i` is an odd index.
   - `lst[i] % 2 == 0`: This condition checks if the element at the odd index `i` is even.
3. **Return False**: If both conditions are met, the function immediately returns `False`.
4. **Return True**: If the loop completes without finding any even number at an odd index, the function returns `True`.

#### Annotations Analysis:
The annotations correctly summarize the behavior of the function. However, there is a subtle but important detail missing in the annotations which affects the correctness of the function.

- The annotation mentions that the function checks "every even-indexed element in the list is odd," which is not entirely accurate based on the actual implementation. The function actually checks the opposite: it verifies that every odd-indexed element in the list is odd.

#### Correctness Evaluation:
- The function will return `False` if it finds any even number at an odd index.
- The function will return `True` only if no even number is found at any odd index.

This means the function is actually verifying that every odd index contains an odd number, which aligns with the problem description.

However, the original assessment incorrectly states that the function checks whether every even-indexed element is odd. This is misleading and potentially confusing, but the logic itself is correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Given that the function correctly checks whether every odd index contains an odd number, the original assessment's logic is accurate despite the slight misstatement in the explanation.

**Final: True**
