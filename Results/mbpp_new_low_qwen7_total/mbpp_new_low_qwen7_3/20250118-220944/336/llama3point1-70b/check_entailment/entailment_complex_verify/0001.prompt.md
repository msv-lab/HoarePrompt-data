You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Write a python function to check whether every odd index contains odd numbers of a given list.

- Program: 
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
    return True



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of integers with any length, `i` is `len(lst)`.
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns `True` if every even-indexed element in the list is odd. Otherwise, it returns `False`. The function iterates through the list using a for loop and checks if the index is odd (`i % 2 != 0`) and the element at that index is even (`lst[i] % 2 == 0`). If such an element is found, the function immediately returns `False`. If no such element is found after checking all elements, the function returns `True`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
The given program aims to check if every odd index in the list contains an odd number. Let's break down the logic:

- The function `func_1` iterates through the list using a for loop with `range(len(lst))`.
- For each element at index `i`, it checks two conditions:
  - If `i % 2 != 0`, which means the index is odd.
  - If `lst[i] % 2 == 0`, which means the value at that index is even.

If both conditions are met (i.e., the index is odd and the value at that index is even), the function immediately returns `False`.

- If the loop completes without finding any index where the value is even at an odd index, the function returns `True`.

This logic correctly implements the requirement to ensure that all values at odd indices are odd. Therefore, the given program meets the specified criteria.

Correctness: **True**
