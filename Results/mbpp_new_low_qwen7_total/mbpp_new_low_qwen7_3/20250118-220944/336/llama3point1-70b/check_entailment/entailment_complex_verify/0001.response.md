Reasoning:
Let's analyze the provided program and its annotated version step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

1. **Problem Description**: The function should check if every odd index contains an odd number in the list.

2. **Program Code**:
   ```python
   def func_1(lst):
       for i in range(len(lst)):
           if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
               return False
       return True
   ```

3. **Annotated Code**:
   - The function `func_1` iterates through the list using a for loop with `range(len(lst))`.
   - For each element at index `i`, it checks if `i % 2 != 0` (the index is odd) and `lst[i] % 2 == 0` (the value at that index is even).
   - If both conditions are met, it immediately returns `False`.
   - If the loop completes without finding any index where the value is even at an odd index, it returns `True`.

4. **Original Assessment**:
   - The assessment claims the function correctly implements the requirement to ensure that all values at odd indices are odd.

5. **Evaluation**:
   - The function iterates over the list and checks if any odd index contains an even number.
   - If it finds an odd index with an even number, it immediately returns `False`.
   - If no such index is found, it returns `True`.
   - This logic correctly ensures that all values at odd indices are indeed odd, as the function will return `False` as soon as it encounters an even number at an odd index.

Given the above analysis, the original assessment is accurate because the function correctly implements the requirement to check if every odd index contains an odd number.

Final: **True**
