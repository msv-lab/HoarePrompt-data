Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks whether every odd index in the given list contains an odd number. The function iterates through the list and checks if the element at each odd index is even. If it finds any even number at an odd index, it immediately returns `False`. If it completes the loop without finding any even number at an odd index, it returns `True`.

Given the logic of the function, it correctly implements the requirement. Here are a few test cases to verify:

- For `lst = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`, the function returns `True` because all odd indices (1, 3) contain odd numbers.
- For `lst = [1, 2, 5, 7, 9]`, the function returns `False` because the element at index 1 (which is an odd index) is 2, an even number.

Since the function behaves as expected in these and other possible cases, the program is correct.
