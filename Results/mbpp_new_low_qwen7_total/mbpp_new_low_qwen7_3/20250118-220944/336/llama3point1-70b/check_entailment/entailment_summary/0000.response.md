Reasoning:
The provided program is designed to check whether every odd index contains odd numbers in the given list. However, the condition inside the loop checks for even numbers at odd indices, not odd numbers at odd indices. Specifically, the loop checks if the index `i` is odd (`i % 2 != 0`) and if the element at that index is even (`lst[i] % 2 == 0`). This means the function will return `False` if any element at an odd index is even, but it will return `True` if any element at an odd index is odd, which is the opposite of what the problem statement requires.

Given this analysis, the function does not meet the requirement to check if every odd index contains odd numbers. Therefore, the function is incorrect according to the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
