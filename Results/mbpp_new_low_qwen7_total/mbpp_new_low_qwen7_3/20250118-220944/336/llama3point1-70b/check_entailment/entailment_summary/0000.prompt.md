Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Write a python function to check whether every odd index contains odd numbers of a given list.

# Program:
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
    return True





# Execution Summary:
The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns `True` if every even-indexed element in the list is odd. Otherwise, it returns `False`. The function iterates through the list using a for loop and checks if the index is odd (`i % 2 != 0`) and the element at that index is even (`lst[i] % 2 == 0`). If such an element is found, the function immediately returns `False`. If no such element is found after checking all elements, the function returns `True`.


# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
