You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Write a python function to check whether every odd index contains odd numbers of a given list.

- Program: 
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
    return True



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of integers with any length, `i` is `len(lst)`.
    return True
    #The program returns True



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks whether every odd index in the given list contains an odd number. The function iterates through the list and checks if the element at each odd index is even. If it finds any even number at an odd index, it immediately returns `False`. If it completes the loop without finding any even number at an odd index, it returns `True`.

Given the logic of the function, it correctly implements the requirement. Here are a few test cases to verify:

- For `lst = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`, the function returns `True` because all odd indices (1, 3) contain odd numbers.
- For `lst = [1, 2, 5, 7, 9]`, the function returns `False` because the element at index 1 (which is an odd index) is 2, an even number.

Since the function behaves as expected in these and other possible cases, the program is correct.
