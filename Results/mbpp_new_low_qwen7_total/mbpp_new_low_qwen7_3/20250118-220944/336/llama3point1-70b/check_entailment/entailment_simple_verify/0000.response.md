Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the program and the annotated version to confirm this:

1. **Problem Description**: The function should check if every odd index in the given list contains an odd number.
2. **Program Code**:
   ```python
   def func_1(lst):
       for i in range(len(lst)):
           if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
               return False
       return True
   ```
3. **Annotated Code**:
   - The function iterates over the list using `for i in range(len(lst))`.
   - It checks if the current index `i` is odd (`i % 2 != 0`) and if the value at that index is even (`lst[i] % 2 == 0`).
   - If both conditions are met, it immediately returns `False`.
   - If the loop completes without returning `False`, it returns `True`.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - The function correctly identifies if any odd-indexed element is even. This means it satisfies the condition of checking all odd indices.
   - The annotated code correctly reflects the state of the program after the loop execution, noting that `i` will be equal to the length of the list, which is irrelevant to the logic of the function since the loop already exits early upon finding an even number at an odd index.

Given the logical flow of the function and the annotations, the program meets the requirements of the problem statement. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
