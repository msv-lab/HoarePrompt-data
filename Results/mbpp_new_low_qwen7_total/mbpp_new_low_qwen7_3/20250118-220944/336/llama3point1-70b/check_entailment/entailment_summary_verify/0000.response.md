### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program and the given function summary against the problem description.

#### Problem Description:
The task is to write a function that checks whether every odd index contains an odd number in a given list.

#### Program Code:
```python
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
    return True
```

#### Function Summary:
The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns `True` if every even-indexed element in the list is odd. Otherwise, it returns `False`. The function iterates through the list using a for loop and checks if the index is odd (`i % 2 != 0`) and the element at that index is even (`lst[i] % 2 == 0`). If such an element is found, the function immediately returns `False`. If no such element is found after checking all elements, the function returns `True`.

#### Analysis:
1. **Function Logic**: 
   - The function iterates through the list with a for loop.
   - It checks if the current index `i` is odd (`i % 2 != 0`).
   - If the index is odd, it further checks if the element at that index is even (`lst[i] % 2 == 0`).
   - If it finds any even number at an odd index, it returns `False`.
   - If it completes the loop without finding any even number at an odd index, it returns `True`.

2. **Problem Requirement**:
   - We need to ensure that every odd index contains an odd number.
   - This means we should be checking for odd numbers at odd indices, not even indices.

3. **Summary Mismatch**:
   - The function summary incorrectly states that the function checks for even elements at odd indices.
   - In fact, the function checks for even elements at even indices.

4. **Correct Implementation**:
   - To meet the problem requirement, we should change the condition from `if i % 2 != 0` to `if i % 2 == 0`.
   - The corrected code would be:
     ```python
     def func_1(lst):
         for i in range(len(lst)):
             if i % 2 == 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
                 return False
         return True
     ```

Given this analysis, the original implementation does not meet the problem requirements. The function incorrectly checks for even elements at even indices instead of odd elements at odd indices.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not check for odd numbers at odd indices as required by the problem description.
