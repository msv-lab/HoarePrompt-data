You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Write a python function to check whether every odd index contains odd numbers of a given list.

- Program:
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
    return True



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns `True` if every even-indexed element in the list is odd. Otherwise, it returns `False`. The function iterates through the list using a for loop and checks if the index is odd (`i % 2 != 0`) and the element at that index is even (`lst[i] % 2 == 0`). If such an element is found, the function immediately returns `False`. If no such element is found after checking all elements, the function returns `True`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks whether every odd index in the given list contains an odd number. The function iterates through the list and checks if the element at each odd index is even. If it finds any even number at an odd index, it immediately returns `False`. If it completes the loop without finding any even number at an odd index, it returns `True`.

Given the logic of the function, it correctly implements the requirement. Here are a few test cases to verify:

- For `lst = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`, the function returns `True` because all odd indices (1, 3) contain odd numbers.
- For `lst = [1, 2, 5, 7, 9]`, the function returns `False` because the element at index 1 (which is an odd index) is 2, an even number.

Since the function behaves as expected in these and other possible cases, the program is correct.
