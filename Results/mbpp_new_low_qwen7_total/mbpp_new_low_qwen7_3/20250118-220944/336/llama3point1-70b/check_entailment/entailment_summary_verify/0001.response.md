Reasoning: 

Let's carefully analyze the given program and its summary against the problem description.

### Problem Description
The task is to write a function that checks whether every odd index in the list contains an odd number. This implies that we need to verify if the value at each odd index is odd.

### Program Code
```python
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
    return True
```

### Function Summary Analysis
The summary states that the function checks if every even-indexed element in the list is odd. However, the provided code actually checks for odd-indexed elements and returns `False` if an even value is found at an odd index. This is contradictory to the problem description, which requires checking odd indices.

### Detailed Evaluation
1. **Loop and Index Check**:
   - The loop iterates over the entire list.
   - The condition `if i % 2 != 0` checks if the index `i` is odd.
   - The condition `lst[i] % 2 == 0` checks if the value at the current index `i` is even.
   
2. **Return Statement**:
   - If an even value is found at an odd index, the function immediately returns `False`.
   - If the loop completes without finding any even value at an odd index, the function returns `True`.

Given this analysis, the function does not meet the requirement of checking odd indices for odd values. Instead, it incorrectly checks even indices for even values, which is the opposite of what is required.

### Correctness
The original assessment stated that the logic correctly implements the requirement. However, based on the detailed evaluation, the logic is incorrect because it checks even indices instead of odd indices.

Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

Final: **False**
