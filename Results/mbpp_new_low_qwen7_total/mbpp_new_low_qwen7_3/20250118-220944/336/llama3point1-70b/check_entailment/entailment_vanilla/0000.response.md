Reasoning:
The given program aims to check if every odd index in the list contains an odd number. Let's break down the logic:

- The function `func_1` iterates through the list using a for loop with `range(len(lst))`.
- For each element at index `i`, it checks two conditions:
  - If `i % 2 != 0`, which means the index is odd.
  - If `lst[i] % 2 == 0`, which means the value at that index is even.

If both conditions are met (i.e., the index is odd and the value at that index is even), the function immediately returns `False`.

- If the loop completes without finding any index where the value is even at an odd index, the function returns `True`.

This logic correctly implements the requirement to ensure that all values at odd indices are odd. Therefore, the given program meets the specified criteria.

Correctness: **True**
