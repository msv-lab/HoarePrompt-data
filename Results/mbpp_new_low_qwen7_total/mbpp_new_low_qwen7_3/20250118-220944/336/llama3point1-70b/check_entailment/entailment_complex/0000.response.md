Reasoning:
- The function `func_1` aims to check if every odd index in the list contains an odd number.
- However, the current implementation checks if an element at an odd index is even. This means the logic inside the `if` statement is the opposite of what is intended.
- To correctly implement the requirement, the `if` condition should be `if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 != 0` instead of `if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0`.

Given the current implementation, the function will return `True` if there is at least one even number at an odd index, which is not what the problem description requires.

Correctness: **False**
