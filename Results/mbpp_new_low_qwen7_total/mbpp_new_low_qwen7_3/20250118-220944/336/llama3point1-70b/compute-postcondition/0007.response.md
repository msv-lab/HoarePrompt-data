Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**: 
   - `lst` is a list of integers with at least 1 element.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `i` is odd.

2. **Loop Condition**: 
   The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = len(lst) - 1`.

3. **Current Iteration State**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and it is odd.
   - We need to check if the element at index `i` in `lst` is even. If it is, the function returns `False`.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, the next value of `i` would be 2 (because the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration).

5. **Adjusting States**:
   - We need to update `i` to 2.
   - We need to ensure that `i` is still odd before checking the next element. However, since `i` will increment to 2, it will no longer be odd. Therefore, we need to adjust the condition to reflect this change.

6. **Final States for Next Iteration**:
   - `lst` remains the same as it did not change during the loop execution.
   - `i` becomes 2.
   - `i` is no longer odd; it is now even.

Given these considerations, the state for the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`lst` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is 2, `i` is even**.
