Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns `True` if every even-indexed element in the list is odd. Otherwise, it returns `False`. The function iterates through the list using a for loop and checks if the index is odd (`i % 2 != 0`) and the element at that index is even (`lst[i] % 2 == 0`). If such an element is found, the function immediately returns `False`. If no such element is found after checking all elements, the function returns `True`.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If the list is empty (`lst = []`), the function will return `True` since there are no even-indexed elements to check.
- If the list contains only one element, the function will return `True` because there are no even-indexed elements to check (the single element is considered to be at an odd index).

**Missing Functionality:**
- The annotations suggest that the function should return `False` in multiple cases, but the actual code only returns `False` when an even-indexed element is found to be even. There are no explicit return statements for other cases where the function should return `False`. Therefore, the function will incorrectly return `True` in scenarios where it should return `False`. For example, if the list contains an even number at an even index, the function will still return `True`.
