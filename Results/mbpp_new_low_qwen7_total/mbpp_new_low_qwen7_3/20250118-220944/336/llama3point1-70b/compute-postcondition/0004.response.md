Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head:**
   - The loop iterates over `range(len(lst))`.
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `len(lst)`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration:**
   - `lst` is a list of integers with at least 1 element.
   - `i` is 0 (since it starts at 0).
   - `i` is even (which is true when `i` is 0).
   - Alternatively, the first element of `lst` is not even (which would imply that the list could start with an odd number).

3. **Update the state for the next iteration:**
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, if `i` is 0, then `i` will become 1 in the next iteration.
   - The condition `i` is even will no longer hold true because `i` becomes 1, which is odd.
   - The list `lst` remains the same.
   - The length of the list `len(lst)` remains unchanged.

4. **Formulate the new state:**
   - `lst` is still a list of integers with at least 1 element.
   - `i` is now 1.
   - `i` is no longer even; it is odd.

Based on this reasoning, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `lst` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is 1, `i` is odd.**
