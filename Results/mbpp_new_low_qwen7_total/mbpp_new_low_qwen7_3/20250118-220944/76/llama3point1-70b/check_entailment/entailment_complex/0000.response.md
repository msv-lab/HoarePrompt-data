Reasoning:
- The function `func_1` takes a tuple `tup` as input.
- It uses the `''.join(tup)` method to concatenate all elements of the tuple into a single string.
- This approach works correctly for tuples containing string elements, as well as for tuples containing other types of elements that can be converted to strings.
- The function handles potential edge cases such as an empty tuple, which would result in an empty string being returned.
- Given the problem description and the execution state comments, the function appears to fulfill the requirement of converting a tuple to a string correctly.

Correctness: **True**
