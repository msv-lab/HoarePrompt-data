Reasoning: 

The original assessment stated that the function `func_1` is incorrect because it uses `''.join(tup)` which will raise a `TypeError` if the tuple contains non-string elements. However, this reasoning is based on a misunderstanding of how Python's `join` method works. The `join` method in Python converts each element of the iterable to a string and then joins them together. Therefore, even if the tuple contains non-string elements, these elements are first converted to strings before the join operation takes place. As such, the function will not raise a `TypeError` and will instead return a string that includes representations of the non-string elements.

For example, if we have a tuple `(1, 'a', 3.14)`, the `join` method will treat `1` as `'1'`, `3.14` as `'3.14'`, and `'a'` as `'a'`, resulting in the string `'1a3.14'`.

Given this understanding, the function `func_1` correctly converts a tuple to a string, handling any types of elements within the tuple by converting them to strings.

Final: **True**
