Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Write a function to convert a tuple to a string.

# Program:
def func_1(tup):
    return ''.join(tup)





# Execution Summary:
The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `tup` as a parameter and returns a string formed by concatenating all elements of the tuple. The function directly returns the result of `''.join(tup)`, which concatenates all elements of the tuple into a single string. This operation works with any iterable elements within the tuple (e.g., strings, numbers). If the tuple contains non-string elements, they are first converted to strings during the join process. The function handles any tuple input and always returns a string. Potential edge cases include an empty tuple, which would result in an empty string being returned. There are no missing functionalities noted in the provided code.


# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
