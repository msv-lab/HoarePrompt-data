### Reasoning:
1. The function `func_1` is designed to take a tuple as an input parameter.
2. The function uses the `join` method to concatenate all the elements of the tuple into a single string.
3. The `join` method works with strings, so each element in the tuple must be a string for the function to work correctly.
4. Given that the problem statement does not specify any non-string elements in the tuple (and assuming valid inputs), the function should work as expected.
5. The comment at the end correctly describes what the function does.

### Correctness:
**True**

The function `func_1` is correct under the assumption that all elements in the tuple `tup` are strings. If the tuple contains non-string elements, the function would raise a TypeError. However, based on the provided information and the typical interpretation of such problems, it is assumed that the tuple contains only string elements.
