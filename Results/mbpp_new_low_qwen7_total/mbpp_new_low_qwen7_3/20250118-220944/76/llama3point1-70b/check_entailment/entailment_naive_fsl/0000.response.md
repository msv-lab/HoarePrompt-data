Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` attempts to join the elements of a tuple into a string using `''.join(tup)`. However, the `join` method requires its argument to be an iterable of strings, not the tuple itself. Tuples in Python can contain any type of elements, and if the tuple contains non-string elements, the `join` method will raise a `TypeError`.

For example, consider the following input:
```python
tup = (1, 2, 3)
print(func_1(tup))  # Raises TypeError: sequence item 0: expected str instance, int found
```

Since the function does not handle cases where the tuple contains non-string elements, it fails to meet the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
