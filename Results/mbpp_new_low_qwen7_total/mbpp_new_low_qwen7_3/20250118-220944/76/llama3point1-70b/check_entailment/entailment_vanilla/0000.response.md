Reasoning:
The function `func_1` is intended to convert a tuple to a string. However, the current implementation `return ''.join(tup)` will not work as expected because the `join()` method requires an iterable of strings, but it can directly join characters or strings without issues if the tuple contains strings or characters.

If the tuple contains non-string elements (e.g., integers), the `join()` method will raise a `TypeError`. Therefore, for the function to be correct, it should ensure that all elements in the tuple are strings before attempting to join them.

Given the problem statement does not specify that the tuple elements must be strings, and assuming valid inputs are simply any iterable, the current implementation might still pass for tuples containing only strings. But to cover all bases, we should clarify the expected input type.

For simplicity, if we assume the problem intends for the tuple to contain strings, the provided code is correct. If the problem allows for mixed types, we need additional validation.

Correctness: **False**
