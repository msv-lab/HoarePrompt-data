Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`. It returns a list of lists, where each inner list is created by slicing `lst` starting from index `i` to the end of the list, with a step of `n`. Specifically, the outer list includes `n` inner lists, corresponding to the indices 0 through `n-1`. This means that for each index `i` in the range `[0, n)`, an inner list is created starting from `lst[i]` and taking every `n`th element until the end of the list. No edge cases are explicitly handled within the function; however, it is assumed that `lst` is a valid list and `n` is a positive integer greater than 0. If `n` is larger than the length of `lst`, the function will still execute as intended, but the resulting inner lists may contain fewer elements than expected due to the slicing operation.**

**Potential Edge Cases:**
- If `n` is equal to the length of `lst`, each inner list will contain only one element, which is the element at the starting index `i`.
- If `n` is 1, the function will return the original list `lst` as a single inner list.
- If `n` is greater than the length of `lst`, the function will still execute, but the inner lists will be shorter than expected, potentially containing only the last element of `lst`.

**Missing Functionality (if any):**
- The function does not handle cases where `lst` is empty or `n` is less than or equal to 0. In these cases, the function would raise a `TypeError` or `IndexError` depending on the specific conditions. To ensure robustness, additional error handling could be added to manage such scenarios.
