The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst`, which is a list, and `n`, which is a positive integer such that `n > 0`. The function returns a list of lists, where each inner list is created by slicing `lst` starting from index `i` to the end of the list, with a step of `n`. The outer list includes `n` such inner lists, corresponding to the indices 0 through `n-1`.
