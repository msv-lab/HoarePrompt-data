The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`. It returns a list of lists, where each inner list is created by slicing `lst` starting from index `i` to the end of the list, with a step of `n`. Specifically, the outer list includes `n` inner lists, corresponding to the indices 0 through `n-1`. This means that for each index `i` in the range `[0, n)`, an inner list is created starting from `lst[i]` and taking every `n`th element until the end of the list. No edge cases are explicitly handled within the function; however, it is assumed that `lst` is a valid list and `n` is a positive integer greater than 0. If `n` is larger than the length of `lst`, the function will still execute as intended, but the resulting inner lists may contain fewer elements than expected due to the slicing operation.
