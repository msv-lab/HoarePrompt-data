Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to split a list into sublists at every nth element. The list comprehension `[lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]` generates sublists starting from each index `i` in the range `0` to `n-1`, with each sublist containing every nth element starting from index `i`.

Let's break it down:

1. `range(n)` generates indices from `0` to `n-1`.
2. For each index `i` in this range, `lst[i::n]` creates a slice starting from `i` and taking every `n`th element after that.
3. This results in `n` sublists, where each sublist contains elements from the original list starting at different offsets and taken every `n`th element.

However, there's a potential issue with the logic when `n` is greater than the length of the list. In such cases, the list comprehension will still generate up to `n` sublists, but some of them might be empty or not contain enough elements.

To ensure correctness, we need to verify if the program handles all edge cases correctly. Specifically, we should check what happens when `n` is larger than the list length.

Given the problem statement does not specify any constraints or edge case handling requirements, let's assume the input list and `n` are valid as per the typical problem description.

Therefore, under the assumption that the problem allows for such cases and does not require special handling for invalid inputs (e.g., `n > len(lst)`), the program appears to be correct in its core functionality.

Correctness: **True**
