Reasoning:
1. The function `func_1` is designed to split a list into sublists at every nth element.
2. The list comprehension `[lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]` works as follows:
   - For each `i` in the range from `0` to `n-1`, it creates a slice of `lst` starting from index `i` to the end of the list with a step of `n`.
3. This approach ensures that the original list is divided into sublists such that each sublist starts from every nth position.
4. Let's verify this with an example:
   - If `lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]` and `n = 3`, the expected output would be `[[1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 8], [3, 6]]`.
   - The slices generated by the list comprehension will be:
     - `lst[0::3]` -> `[1, 4, 7]`
     - `lst[1::3]` -> `[2, 5, 8]`
     - `lst[2::3]` -> `[3, 6]`
5. The generated output matches the expected result.

Given this analysis, the provided implementation is correct according to the problem statement and the expected behavior.

Correctness: **True**
