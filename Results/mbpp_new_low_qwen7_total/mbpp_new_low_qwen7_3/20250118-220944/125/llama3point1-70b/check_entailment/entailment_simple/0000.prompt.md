Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Write a function that takes in a list and an integer n and splits a list for every nth element, returning a list of the resulting lists.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list, and n is a positive integer such that n > 0.
def func_1(lst, n):
    return [lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]
    #The program returns a list of lists, where each inner list is created by slicing `lst` starting from index `i` to the end of the list, with a step of `n`. The outer list includes `n` such inner lists, corresponding to the indices 0 through `n-1`


# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
