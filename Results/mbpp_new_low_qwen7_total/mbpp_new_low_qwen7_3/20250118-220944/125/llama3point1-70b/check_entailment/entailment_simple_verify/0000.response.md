Reasoning: 

The original assessment is inaccurate. The provided code does indeed correctly implement the described functionality. Let's break down the logic and the expected behavior:

1. **Problem Description**: The function should take a list `lst` and an integer `n`, and return a list of sublists where each sublist contains elements from `lst` starting from every `n`th position.

2. **Annotated Code**: The code uses a list comprehension to create a list of slices. For each index `i` in the range `0` to `n-1`, it creates a slice starting from index `i` and taking every `n`th element thereafter. This ensures that each sublist starts at a different position in the original list and includes elements at intervals of `n`.

3. **Example Analysis**:
   - Consider `lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` and `n = 2`.
   - For `i = 0`: `lst[0::2]` results in `[1, 3, 5]`.
   - For `i = 1`: `lst[1::2]` results in `[2, 4, 6]`.
   - The function returns `[[1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6]]`, which matches the expected output.

The provided code accurately implements the logic required to split the list for every nth element. Therefore, the original assessment is incorrect because the code meets the requirements as described.

Final: **True**
