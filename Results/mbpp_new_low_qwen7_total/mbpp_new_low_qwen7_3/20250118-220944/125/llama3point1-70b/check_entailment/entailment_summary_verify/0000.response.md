Reasoning: 

Let's carefully analyze the problem description and the provided code against the given function summary.

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a function that takes a list and an integer `n`, and splits the list such that each new list contains every nth element starting from each possible starting point (from 0 to n-1).

2. **Function Summary**: The summary states that the function creates a list of lists, where each inner list starts from index `i` and takes every `n`th element until the end of the list. This matches the implementation in the provided code: `return [lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]`.

3. **Code Analysis**: 
   - The list comprehension iterates over `range(n)` to create `n` sublists.
   - For each `i` in `range(n)`, it creates a slice starting from index `i` with a step of `n`.
   - This results in `n` sublists, each containing every nth element starting from the respective index.

4. **Example**: 
   - For `lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` and `n = 2`:
     - `lst[0::2]` gives `[1, 3, 5]`
     - `lst[1::2]` gives `[2, 4, 6]`
   - Thus, the output is `[[1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6]]`, which aligns with the problem description.

Given this analysis, the provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The original assessment mistakenly concluded that the code did not meet the expected requirements, likely due to a misunderstanding of the problem statement. The provided code indeed splits the list for every nth element as specified.

Final: **True**
