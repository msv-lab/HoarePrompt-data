Reasoning:

The original assessment is mostly accurate, but there is a subtle point that needs to be addressed regarding the behavior of the function when `n` is greater than the length of the list.

1. **Function Behavior Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` uses list comprehension to generate sublists.
   - For each index `i` in the range `[0, n)`, it slices the list starting from `i` with a step of `n`.
   - This results in `n` sublists, but the actual number of non-empty sublists depends on the length of the original list and the value of `n`.

2. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - When `n` is greater than the length of the list, the function will still generate `n` sublists, but many of them will be empty.
   - Specifically, for indices `i` where `i >= len(lst)`, the slices `lst[i::n]` will be empty because the starting index exceeds the list length.
   - Therefore, if `n` is larger than the length of `lst`, the function will return more sublists than necessary, with most of them being empty.

3. **Correctness Verification:**
   - Given the problem description does not explicitly state that the function should handle or avoid such edge cases, the original assessment assumes that the function can handle these cases without special handling.
   - However, this behavior might not always be desirable depending on the intended use case. If the function is expected to only return the non-empty sublists, then the current implementation would be considered incorrect.

Since the function returns more sublists than necessary when `n` is larger than the list length, and the problem description does not specify handling this edge case, the function is not entirely correct according to the problem statement.

Final: **False**
