Reasoning:
The given annotated program correctly describes the behavior of the `func_1` function. The function indeed slices the input list `lst` at every `n`th element, starting from each index `i` in the range `[0, n)`, and collects these slices into a list of lists. 

- The function handles the case where `n` is larger than the length of `lst`. In such a scenario, the slices will naturally be smaller, but they will still be included in the returned list. 
- The function assumes that `lst` is a valid list and `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, which aligns with the problem statement.

Given the description and the implementation, the function behaves as intended without any logical errors.

Correctness: **True**
