Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to split a list into sublists at every nth element. The program uses a list comprehension to generate these sublists. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **List Comprehension**: The line `[lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]` generates a new list of lists.
2. **Slicing Operation**: For each `i` in the range `[0, n)`, `lst[i::n]` creates a slice of the original list starting from index `i` with a step of `n`.
3. **Number of Sublists**: The number of sublists generated is `n`, which matches the requirement of splitting the list every nth element.
4. **Edge Cases**: While no explicit edge cases are handled (like when `n` is greater than the list length), the slicing operation still works correctly, just resulting in smaller sublists if necessary.

Given this analysis, the function behaves as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the provided program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
