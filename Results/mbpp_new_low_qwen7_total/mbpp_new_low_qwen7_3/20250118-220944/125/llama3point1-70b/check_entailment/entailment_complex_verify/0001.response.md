### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program and its behavior step-by-step using the provided annotations and the original assessment.

1. **Problem Description**:
   - The function `func_1` should take a list `lst` and an integer `n`, and split the list into sublists every `n` elements.

2. **Program Code**:
   ```python
   def func_1(lst, n):
       return [lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]
   ```

3. **Annotations**:
   - The program returns a list of lists, where each inner list is created by slicing `lst` starting from index `i` to the end of the list, with a step of `n`.
   - The outer list includes `n` such inner lists, corresponding to the indices 0 through `n-1`.

4. **Original Assessment**:
   - The original assessment states that the program is correct under the assumption that the problem allows for such cases and does not require special handling for invalid inputs (e.g., `n > len(lst)`).

5. **Systematic Evaluation**:
   - Let's consider the following scenarios:
     - When `n` is less than or equal to the length of the list (`len(lst) >= n`):
       - The slicing operation `lst[i::n]` will create valid sublists.
     - When `n` is greater than the length of the list (`n > len(lst)`):
       - The slicing operation will still execute, but the resulting sublists may contain fewer elements than expected.
       - For example, if `lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `n = 6`, the output will be `[[1], [2], [3], [4], [5], []]`.

6. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The original assessment mentions that the program does not explicitly handle edge cases. However, it assumes that `lst` is a valid list and `n` is a positive integer greater than 0.
   - Given that the problem description does not specify any constraints or edge case handling requirements, the program can be considered correct if we assume valid inputs.

7. **Conclusion**:
   - While the program works correctly for the general case where `n` is less than or equal to the length of the list, it may produce unexpected results when `n` is greater than the length of the list.
   - However, since the original assessment assumes valid inputs and does not explicitly handle edge cases, the program can be considered correct under those assumptions.

### Final Evaluation:
- Given the original assessment's assumption of valid inputs, the program is correct in its core functionality.
- Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

**Final: True**
