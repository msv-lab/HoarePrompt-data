Reasoning:

The original assessment incorrectly identifies the issue with the provided function. Let's carefully analyze the function and the provided test cases.

The function `func_1` indeed splits the input list into sublists at every nth element, which aligns with the problem description. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Function Summary Recap**:
   - The function creates `n` empty sublists.
   - It iterates over the elements of the input list `lst`.
   - Each element is appended to the sublist corresponding to its index modulo `n`.

2. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - **First Assertion**: The input is `['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n']` with `n=3`.
     - Expected Output: `[['a', 'd', 'g', 'j', 'm'], ['b', 'e', 'h', 'k', 'n'], ['c', 'f', 'i', 'l']]`
     - Explanation: The function correctly groups elements such that every third element forms a new sublist.
   - **Second Assertion**: The input is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]` with `n=3`.
     - Expected Output: `[[1, 4, 7, 10, 13], [2, 5, 8, 11, 14], [3, 6, 9, 12]]`
     - Explanation: Similarly, the function correctly groups elements such that every third element forms a new sublist.
   - **Third Assertion**: The input is `['python', 'java', 'C', 'C++', 'DBMS', 'SQL']` with `n=2`.
     - Expected Output: `[['python', 'C', 'DBMS'], ['java', 'C++', 'SQL']]`
     - Explanation: The function correctly groups elements such that every second element forms a new sublist.

The function works as intended, splitting the list into sublists every nth element. The original assessment mistakenly concluded that the function was distributing elements cyclically across the sublists, which is not the case. The function correctly implements the requirement to split the list every nth element.

Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
