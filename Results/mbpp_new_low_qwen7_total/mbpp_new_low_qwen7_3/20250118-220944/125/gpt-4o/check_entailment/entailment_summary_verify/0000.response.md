Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given function `func_1` and compare it with the problem description and the function summary.

1. **Function Description and Requirement:**
   - The problem requires a function that takes a list `lst` and an integer `n`, and splits the list into `n` sublists such that each sublist contains elements from `lst` at positions that are multiples of `n`.

2. **Function Implementation:**
   - The function `func_1` initializes `n` empty sublists.
   - It then iterates over the elements of `lst` using `enumerate` to get both the index and the element.
   - Each element is appended to the sublist corresponding to its index modulo `n`.

3. **Function Summary:**
   - The function creates `n` empty sublists.
   - Each element from `lst` is appended to the sublist corresponding to its index modulo `n`.
   - The function handles the case where `0 < n <= len(lst)` and ensures that each element from `lst` is placed into one of the `n` sublists based on the specified rule.

4. **Example Analysis:**
   - For `func_1(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n'], 3)`, the function should return `[['a', 'd', 'g', 'j', 'm'], ['b', 'e', 'h', 'k', 'n'], ['c', 'f', 'i', 'l']]`.
   - For `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 3)`, the function should return `[[1, 4, 7, 10, 13], [2, 5, 8, 11, 14], [3, 6, 9, 12]]`.
   - For `func_1(['python', 'java', 'C', 'C++', 'DBMS', 'SQL'], 2)`, the function should return `[['python', 'C', 'DBMS'], ['java', 'C++', 'SQL']]`.

5. **Evaluation Based on Functionality:**
   - The function indeed groups elements from the list into sublists based on their indices modulo `n`, which matches the requirement.
   - The examples provided in the function summaries and test cases are consistent with the function's implementation.
   - The function does not have any apparent logical errors or edge cases that would cause it to fail under different inputs.

Given the analysis above, the original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly implements the required behavior of splitting the list into sublists every nth element.

Final: **True**
