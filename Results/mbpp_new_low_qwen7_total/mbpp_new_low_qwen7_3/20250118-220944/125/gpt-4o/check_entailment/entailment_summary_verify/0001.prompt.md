You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Write a function that takes in a list and an integer n and splits a list for every nth element, returning a list of the resulting lists.

- Program:
assert func_1(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n'], 3) == [['a', 'd', 'g', 'j', 'm'], ['b', 'e', 'h', 'k', 'n'], ['c', 'f', 'i', 'l']]
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 3) == [[1, 4, 7, 10, 13], [2, 5, 8, 11, 14], [3, 6, 9, 12]]
assert func_1(['python', 'java', 'C', 'C++', 'DBMS', 'SQL'], 2) == [['python', 'C', 'DBMS'], ['java', 'C++', 'SQL']]

def func_1(lst, n):
    result = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for (i, element) in enumerate(lst):
        result[i % n].append(element)
    return result



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, and returns a list of `n` sublists where each sublist `result[j]` (for `j` in range `0` to `n-1`) contains elements from `lst` whose indices modulo `n` match `j`. The function creates `n` empty sublists and iterates over the elements of `lst`, appending each element to the sublist corresponding to its index modulo `n`. The original list `lst` and integer `n` remain unchanged after the function execution. The function handles the case where `0 < n <= len(lst)` and ensures that each element from `lst` is placed into one of the `n` sublists based on the specified rule. There are no explicit edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code that need special handling, but the function assumes `n` is within the valid range and `lst` is non-empty.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
The given program aims to split the input list into sublists at every nth element. However, the current implementation does not achieve this goal. Instead, it distributes the elements of the list across `n` sublists based on their index modulo `n`. This means the first element goes to the first sublist, the second element to the second sublist, and so on, cycling back to the first sublist after the nth element.

To correctly split the list every nth element, we should create a new sublist each time we reach a multiple of `n`, starting from the first element. The current implementation does not do this; hence, it needs to be corrected.

Let's analyze the provided test cases:

1. For the first assertion, the expected output is splitting the list every 3rd element:
   - `['a', 'd', 'g', 'j', 'm']`
   - `['b', 'e', 'h', 'k', 'n']`
   - `['c', 'f', 'i', 'l']`

2. For the second assertion, the expected output is also splitting the list every 3rd element:
   - `[1, 4, 7, 10, 13]`
   - `[2, 5, 8, 11, 14]`
   - `[3, 6, 9, 12]`

3. For the third assertion, the expected output is splitting the list every 2nd element:
   - `['python', 'C', 'DBMS']`
   - `['java', 'C++', 'SQL']`

Given these expectations, the current implementation does not produce the desired results because it does not split the list every nth element but instead distributes elements cyclically across the sublists.

Here's the corrected implementation:

```python
def func_1(lst, n):
    result = []
    for i in range(0, len(lst), n):
        result.append(lst[i:i + n])
    return result
```

This corrected function creates a new sublist starting from each multiple of `n` and extends it by `n` elements, ensuring the list is split every nth element as required.

Since the given program does not achieve the intended functionality, the correctness of the provided program is:

Correctness: **False**
