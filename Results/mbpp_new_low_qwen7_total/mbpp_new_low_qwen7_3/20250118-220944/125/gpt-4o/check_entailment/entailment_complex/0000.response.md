Reasoning:
The provided function `func_1` attempts to split the input list `lst` into `n` sublists based on the modulo operation with `n`. However, the logic used in the function does not actually achieve the intended goal of splitting the list at every nth element. Instead, it distributes elements of the list into `n` sublists based on their index modulo `n`.

To correctly implement the required functionality, the function should use slicing to extract every nth element starting from each position. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(lst, n):
    result = []
    for i in range(0, len(lst), n):
        result.append(lst[i:i + n])
    
    return result
```

Explanation:
- The function iterates through the list using a step size of `n`.
- For each starting index `i` (from 0 to `len(lst) - n`), it slices the list from `i` to `i + n` and appends the slice to the result list.
- This approach ensures that every nth element is grouped together into separate sublists.

Given the provided test cases and the expected behavior, the original function does not produce the correct output. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
