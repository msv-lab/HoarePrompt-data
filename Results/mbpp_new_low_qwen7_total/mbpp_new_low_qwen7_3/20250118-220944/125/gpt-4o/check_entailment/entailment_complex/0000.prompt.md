Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Write a function that takes in a list and an integer n and splits a list for every nth element, returning a list of the resulting lists.

# Annotated Program:
assert func_1(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n'], 3) == [['a', 'd', 'g', 'j', 'm'], ['b', 'e', 'h', 'k', 'n'], ['c', 'f', 'i', 'l']]
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 3) == [[1, 4, 7, 10, 13], [2, 5, 8, 11, 14], [3, 6, 9, 12]]
assert func_1(['python', 'java', 'C', 'C++', 'DBMS', 'SQL'], 2) == [['python', 'C', 'DBMS'], ['java', 'C++', 'SQL']]

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list, and n is a positive integer such that 0 < n <= len(lst).
def func_1(lst, n):
    result = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for (i, element) in enumerate(lst):
        result[i % n].append(element)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, and `result` contains `n` sublists where each sublist `result[j]` (for `j` in range `0` to `n-1`) contains elements from `lst` whose indices modulo `n` match `j`.
    return result
    #`result` contains `n` sublists where each sublist `result[j]` (for `j` in range `0` to `n-1`) contains elements from `lst` whose indices modulo `n` match `j`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, and returns a list of `n` sublists where each sublist `result[j]` (for `j` in range `0` to `n-1`) contains elements from `lst` whose indices modulo `n` match `j`. The function creates `n` empty sublists and iterates over the elements of `lst`, appending each element to the sublist corresponding to its index modulo `n`. The original list `lst` and integer `n` remain unchanged after the function execution. The function handles the case where `0 < n <= len(lst)` and ensures that each element from `lst` is placed into one of the `n` sublists based on the specified rule. There are no explicit edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code that need special handling, but the function assumes `n` is within the valid range and `lst` is non-empty.
