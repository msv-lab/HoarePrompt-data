### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to split the input list into `n` sublists based on the modulo operation with `n`. Specifically, it distributes elements of the list into `n` sublists such that elements at indices `i`, where `i % n == j`, go into the `j`th sublist. However, the problem requires splitting the list every `n` elements, not distributing elements based on their index modulo `n`.

To achieve the required functionality, the program should collect every `n` elements starting from the beginning, creating a new sublist for each group of `n` elements. The current implementation incorrectly distributes elements based on their index modulo `n`, which does not align with the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Correct Implementation:

Here's a corrected version of the function that correctly splits the list every `n` elements:

```python
def func_1(lst, n):
    result = []
    for i in range(0, len(lst), n):
        result.append(lst[i:i + n])
    return result
```

This implementation iterates over the list in steps of `n`, slicing the list from `i` to `i + n` and appending each slice to the result list. This ensures that the list is split every `n` elements as required.
