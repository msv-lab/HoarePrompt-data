Reasoning:
The given program aims to split the input list into sublists at every nth element. However, the current implementation does not achieve this goal. Instead, it distributes the elements of the list across `n` sublists based on their index modulo `n`. This means the first element goes to the first sublist, the second element to the second sublist, and so on, cycling back to the first sublist after the nth element.

To correctly split the list every nth element, we should create a new sublist each time we reach a multiple of `n`, starting from the first element. The current implementation does not do this; hence, it needs to be corrected.

Let's analyze the provided test cases:

1. For the first assertion, the expected output is splitting the list every 3rd element:
   - `['a', 'd', 'g', 'j', 'm']`
   - `['b', 'e', 'h', 'k', 'n']`
   - `['c', 'f', 'i', 'l']`

2. For the second assertion, the expected output is also splitting the list every 3rd element:
   - `[1, 4, 7, 10, 13]`
   - `[2, 5, 8, 11, 14]`
   - `[3, 6, 9, 12]`

3. For the third assertion, the expected output is splitting the list every 2nd element:
   - `['python', 'C', 'DBMS']`
   - `['java', 'C++', 'SQL']`

Given these expectations, the current implementation does not produce the desired results because it does not split the list every nth element but instead distributes elements cyclically across the sublists.

Here's the corrected implementation:

```python
def func_1(lst, n):
    result = []
    for i in range(0, len(lst), n):
        result.append(lst[i:i + n])
    return result
```

This corrected function creates a new sublist starting from each multiple of `n` and extends it by `n` elements, ensuring the list is split every nth element as required.

Since the given program does not achieve the intended functionality, the correctness of the provided program is:

Correctness: **False**
