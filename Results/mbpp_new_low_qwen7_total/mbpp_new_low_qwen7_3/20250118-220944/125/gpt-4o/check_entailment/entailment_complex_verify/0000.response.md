Reasoning: 

The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` splits the input list into sublists every nth element. However, upon closer inspection of the annotated code and the function itself, it appears that the function does not split the list as intended based on the problem description. Instead, it groups elements by their index modulo `n`, which is not the same as splitting the list every nth element.

Let's analyze the function step-by-step using the annotated code:

1. **Initialization**: The function initializes a list `result` with `n` empty sublists.
2. **Iteration**: It then iterates over the elements of the input list `lst` using `enumerate` to get both the index `i` and the element.
3. **Applying Modulo Operation**: For each element, it appends the element to the sublist `result[i % n]`.

This means that the function will group elements based on their index modulo `n`. For example:
- If `n = 3`, the first sublist will contain elements at indices 0, 3, 6, etc., the second sublist will contain elements at indices 1, 4, 7, etc., and the third sublist will contain elements at indices 2, 5, 8, etc.

Given the problem description, the function should split the list every nth element, meaning the first sublist would contain the first element, the second element, ..., the nth element; the second sublist would contain the (n+1)th element, the (n+2)th element, ..., the (2n)th element, and so on.

For instance, for the first assertion:
```python
assert func_1(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n'], 3) == [['a', 'd', 'g', 'j', 'm'], ['b', 'e', 'h', 'k', 'n'], ['c', 'f', 'i', 'l']]
```

The function will actually produce:
```python
[['a', 'b', 'c'], ['d', 'e', 'f'], ['g', 'h', 'i'], ['j', 'k', 'l'], ['m', 'n']]
```

This is because the function groups elements based on their index modulo `n`, which is not the same as splitting every nth element. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements of the problem description.

Final: **False**
