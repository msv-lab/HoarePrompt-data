### Reasoning:

The original assessment incorrectly states that the given program does not achieve the intended functionality. Let's re-evaluate the program and the annotated version step-by-step to determine if the program meets the requirements.

#### Problem Description:
The function should take a list and an integer \( n \), and return a list of sublists where each sublist contains every \( n \)-th element of the original list.

#### Program Code:
```python
def func_1(lst, n):
    result = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for (i, element) in enumerate(lst):
        result[i % n].append(element)
    return result
```

#### Annotated Code:
The annotation explains that the function creates `n` empty sublists and then iterates over the elements of the input list `lst`, appending each element to the sublist corresponding to its index modulo `n`. This means:
- If `n` is 3, the first three elements go into the first sublist, the next three elements go into the second sublist, and so on.

Let's verify the behavior with the provided test cases:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   ```python
   assert func_1(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n'], 3) == [['a', 'd', 'g', 'j', 'm'], ['b', 'e', 'h', 'k', 'n'], ['c', 'f', 'i', 'l']]
   ```
   - The function correctly splits the list every 3rd element:
     - First sublist: `['a', 'd', 'g', 'j', 'm']`
     - Second sublist: `['b', 'e', 'h', 'k', 'n']`
     - Third sublist: `['c', 'f', 'i', 'l']`

2. **Test Case 2:**
   ```python
   assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 3) == [[1, 4, 7, 10, 13], [2, 5, 8, 11, 14], [3, 6, 9, 12]]
   ```
   - The function correctly splits the list every 3rd element:
     - First sublist: `[1, 4, 7, 10, 13]`
     - Second sublist: `[2, 5, 8, 11, 14]`
     - Third sublist: `[3, 6, 9, 12]`

3. **Test Case 3:**
   ```python
   assert func_1(['python', 'java', 'C', 'C++', 'DBMS', 'SQL'], 2) == [['python', 'C', 'DBMS'], ['java', 'C++', 'SQL']]
   ```
   - The function correctly splits the list every 2nd element:
     - First sublist: `['python', 'C', 'DBMS']`
     - Second sublist: `['java', 'C++', 'SQL']`

From the above analysis, the annotated version correctly describes how the function works. The function indeed splits the list into sublists every \( n \)-th element, as required by the problem description.

Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct according to the problem description and the provided test cases.
