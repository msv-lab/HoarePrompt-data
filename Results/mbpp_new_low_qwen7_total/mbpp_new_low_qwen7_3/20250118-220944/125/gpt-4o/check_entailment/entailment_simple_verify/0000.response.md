### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` is intended to split a list into sublists every nth element. Let's break down the function step-by-step using the annotations provided:

1. **Function Definition:**
   ```python
   def func_1(lst, n):
       result = [[] for _ in range(n)]
       for (i, element) in enumerate(lst):
           result[i % n].append(element)
       return result
   ```

2. **Initial State:**
   - `lst` is a list.
   - `n` is a positive integer such that `0 < n <= len(lst)`.

3. **Key Logic:**
   - `result = [[] for _ in range(n)]` initializes `n` empty lists.
   - The `for` loop iterates over each element in `lst`, with `i` being the index and `element` being the value.
   - `result[i % n].append(element)` appends the current element to the sublist indexed by `i % n`.

4. **Annotations Analysis:**
   - After the `for` loop, `result` will contain `n` sublists, each containing elements from `lst` whose indices modulo `n` match the corresponding index of the sublist.
   - The examples provided in the assertions show that the function correctly groups elements every nth element.

Given the analysis and the provided examples, the function indeed splits the list correctly into sublists every nth element. There are no edge cases or logical errors indicated in the code or the provided examples.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The function `func_1` is correct according to the problem description and the provided examples. The original assessment accurately reflects this conclusion.
