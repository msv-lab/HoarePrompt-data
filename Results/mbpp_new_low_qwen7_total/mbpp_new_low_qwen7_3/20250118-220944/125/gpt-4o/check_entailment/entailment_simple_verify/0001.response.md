### Reasoning:
The original assessment incorrectly concluded that the given program does not achieve the intended functionality. Let's carefully analyze the given program and the provided assertions to understand why the original assessment is inaccurate.

#### Given Program:
```python
def func_1(lst, n):
    result = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for (i, element) in enumerate(lst):
        result[i % n].append(element)
    return result
```

#### Annotated Code:
The annotated code explains that the program creates `n` sublists and distributes the elements of the input list `lst` based on their index modulo `n`. Specifically:
- Each element at index `i` is appended to the sublist `result[i % n]`.
- This means the first `n` elements go into the first sublist, the next `n` elements go into the second sublist, and so on, cycling back to the first sublist after every `n` elements.

#### Test Cases Analysis:
1. **First Assertion:**
   ```python
   assert func_1(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n'], 3) == [['a', 'd', 'g', 'j', 'm'], ['b', 'e', 'h', 'k', 'n'], ['c', 'f', 'i', 'l']]
   ```
   - The elements are distributed as follows:
     - Index 0, 3, 6, 9, 12 go into the first sublist: `['a', 'd', 'g', 'j', 'm']`
     - Index 1, 4, 7, 10, 13 go into the second sublist: `['b', 'e', 'h', 'k', 'n']`
     - Index 2, 5, 8, 11, 14 go into the third sublist: `['c', 'f', 'i', 'l']`

2. **Second Assertion:**
   ```python
   assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 3) == [[1, 4, 7, 10, 13], [2, 5, 8, 11, 14], [3, 6, 9, 12]]
   ```
   - The elements are distributed as follows:
     - Index 0, 3, 6, 9, 12 go into the first sublist: `[1, 4, 7, 10, 13]`
     - Index 1, 4, 7, 10, 13 go into the second sublist: `[2, 5, 8, 11, 14]`
     - Index 2, 5, 8, 11, 14 go into the third sublist: `[3, 6, 9, 12]`

3. **Third Assertion:**
   ```python
   assert func_1(['python', 'java', 'C', 'C++', 'DBMS', 'SQL'], 2) == [['python', 'C', 'DBMS'], ['java', 'C++', 'SQL']]
   ```
   - The elements are distributed as follows:
     - Index 0, 2, 4 go into the first sublist: `['python', 'C', 'DBMS']`
     - Index 1, 3, 5 go into the second sublist: `['java', 'C++', 'SQL']`

#### Correctness of the Program:
The given program correctly implements the logic to split the list every `n`th element. The distribution is done based on the index modulo `n`, which ensures that elements are grouped every `n` elements. Therefore, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment incorrectly concluded that the program does not split the list every `n`th element. The program actually achieves this by distributing elements based on their index modulo `n`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
