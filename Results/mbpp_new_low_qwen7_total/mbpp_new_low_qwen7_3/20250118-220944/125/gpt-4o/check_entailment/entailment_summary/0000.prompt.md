Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Write a function that takes in a list and an integer n and splits a list for every nth element, returning a list of the resulting lists.

# Program:
assert func_1(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n'], 3) == [['a', 'd', 'g', 'j', 'm'], ['b', 'e', 'h', 'k', 'n'], ['c', 'f', 'i', 'l']]
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 3) == [[1, 4, 7, 10, 13], [2, 5, 8, 11, 14], [3, 6, 9, 12]]
assert func_1(['python', 'java', 'C', 'C++', 'DBMS', 'SQL'], 2) == [['python', 'C', 'DBMS'], ['java', 'C++', 'SQL']]

def func_1(lst, n):
    result = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for (i, element) in enumerate(lst):
        result[i % n].append(element)
    return result





# Execution Summary:
The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, and returns a list of `n` sublists where each sublist `result[j]` (for `j` in range `0` to `n-1`) contains elements from `lst` whose indices modulo `n` match `j`. The function creates `n` empty sublists and iterates over the elements of `lst`, appending each element to the sublist corresponding to its index modulo `n`. The original list `lst` and integer `n` remain unchanged after the function execution. The function handles the case where `0 < n <= len(lst)` and ensures that each element from `lst` is placed into one of the `n` sublists based on the specified rule. There are no explicit edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code that need special handling, but the function assumes `n` is within the valid range and `lst` is non-empty.
