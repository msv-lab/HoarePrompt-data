Reasoning:
The given program appears to be designed to split the input list into `n` sublists based on the modulo operation with `n`. The provided assertions correctly demonstrate the expected behavior of the function. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Initialization**: The function initializes a list of `n` empty sublists.
2. **Iteration**: It iterates over each element in the input list `lst`.
3. **Placement**: Each element is appended to the sublist determined by the index of the element modulo `n`.

This approach ensures that the elements are distributed evenly across the `n` sublists. The assertions provided cover various cases, including different types of elements (strings and integers), different lengths of the list, and different values of `n`. Given these considerations and the correctness of the provided test cases, we can conclude that the function behaves as intended.

Correctness: **True**
