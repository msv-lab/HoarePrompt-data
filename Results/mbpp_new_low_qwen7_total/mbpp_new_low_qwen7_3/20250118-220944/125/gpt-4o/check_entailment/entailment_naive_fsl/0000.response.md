Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly splits the input list into sublists every nth element. The function works by iterating through the list and appending each element to a sublist based on its index modulo n. This ensures that every nth element is grouped together. The examples provided also correctly demonstrate the functionality of the function for different inputs and values of n. Since the function behaves as expected in all the tested cases and there is no indication of missing edge cases or logical errors, the program is correct.
