The code `result = [[] for _ in range(n)]` creates a list of `n` empty lists and assigns it to the variable `result`. The length of `lst` and the value of `n` are known from the initial state, but the exact content of `lst` is not specified. The value of `n` determines the number of empty lists in `result`.

Output State: **`lst` is a list, `n` is a positive integer such that 0 < n <= len(lst), `result` is a list containing `n` empty lists**
