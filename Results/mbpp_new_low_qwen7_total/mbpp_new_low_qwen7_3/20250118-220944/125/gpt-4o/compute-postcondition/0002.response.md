The code snippet `result[i % n].append(element)` impacts the `result` list. Given the initial state where `lst` must have at least one element, `i` is 0, `element` is the first element in `lst`, and `n` must be at least 1, we can determine the following:

- `i % n` will be `0 % n`, which is `0`.
- `result[0]` will be appended with `element`.

Therefore, the first element of `result` will be `element`. The values of `lst`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`lst` must have at least one element, `i` is 0, `n` must be at least 1; `element` is the first element in `lst`; `result[0]` contains `element`.**
