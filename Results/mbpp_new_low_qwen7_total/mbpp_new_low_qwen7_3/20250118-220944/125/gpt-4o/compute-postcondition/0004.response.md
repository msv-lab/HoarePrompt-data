`result[i % n]` is assigned the value of `element`. Given that `i` is 1 and `n` is at least 1, `i % n` evaluates to 1. Therefore, `result[1]` is appended with `element`. The previous value of `result[1]` was already containing the `element`, so now it will contain `element` twice.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`lst` must have at least one element, `i` is 1, `n` must be at least 1, `element` is the second element in `lst`, `result[1]` contains `element` and an additional `element`.**
