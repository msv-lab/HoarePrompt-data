The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst`, which is a list, and `n`, which is a positive integer such that `0 < n <= len(lst)`. The function returns a new list `result` containing `n` sublists. Each sublist `result[j]` (for `j` in range `0` to `n-1`) contains elements from `lst` whose indices modulo `n` match `j`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, and return a list of `n` sublists where each sublist contains elements from `lst` based on their index modulo `n`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, and returns a list of `n` sublists where each sublist contains elements from `lst` based on their index modulo `n`.**
