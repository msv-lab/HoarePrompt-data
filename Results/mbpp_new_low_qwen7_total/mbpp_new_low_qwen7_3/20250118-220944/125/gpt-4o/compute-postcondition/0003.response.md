The loop head consists of the variables `i`, `element`, and `lst`. The state of these variables needs to be adjusted for the next iteration of the loop.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `lst` must have at least one element.
- `i` is 0.
- `n` must be at least 1.
- `element` is the first element in `lst`.
- `result[0]` contains `element`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` should be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1.
- `element` should be the second element in `lst`.
- `lst` must still have at least one element.
- `n` must be at least 1.
- `result[1]` will contain the second element from `lst`.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`lst` must have at least one element, `i` is 1, `n` must be at least 1, `element` is the second element in `lst`, `result[1]` contains `element`**.
