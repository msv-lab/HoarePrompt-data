Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `element`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over the enumerated elements of `lst`. The loop condition is based on the length of `lst` and the value of `i`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `lst` must have at least one element.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` must be at least 1.
   - `element` is the second element in `lst`.
   - `result[1]` contains `element` and an additional `element`.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` is 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented to 2.
   - The `element` will now be the third element in `lst` because the loop increments `i` by 1.
   - The `lst` must still have at least one element for the loop to execute.
   - `n` is a placeholder for the length of `lst`, so it should be adjusted accordingly.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` should be incremented to 2.
   - `element` should now be the third element in `lst`.
   - `lst` must still have at least one element.
   - `n` should be the length of `lst`.

Therefore, the adjusted states for the start of the next iteration are:

**State: **`lst` must have at least one element, `i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, `element` is the third element in `lst`, `result[1]` contains `element` and an additional `element`**.
