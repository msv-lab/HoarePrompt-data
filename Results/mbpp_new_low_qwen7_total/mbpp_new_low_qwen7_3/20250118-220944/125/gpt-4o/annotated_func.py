#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list, and n is a positive integer such that 0 < n <= len(lst).
def func_1(lst, n):
    result = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for (i, element) in enumerate(lst):
        result[i % n].append(element)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, and `result` contains `n` sublists where each sublist `result[j]` (for `j` in range `0` to `n-1`) contains elements from `lst` whose indices modulo `n` match `j`.
    return result
    #`result` contains `n` sublists where each sublist `result[j]` (for `j` in range `0` to `n-1`) contains elements from `lst` whose indices modulo `n` match `j`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, and returns a list of `n` sublists where each sublist `result[j]` (for `j` in range `0` to `n-1`) contains elements from `lst` whose indices modulo `n` match `j`. The function creates `n` empty sublists and iterates over the elements of `lst`, appending each element to the sublist corresponding to its index modulo `n`. The original list `lst` and integer `n` remain unchanged after the function execution. The function handles the case where `0 < n <= len(lst)` and ensures that each element from `lst` is placed into one of the `n` sublists based on the specified rule. There are no explicit edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code that need special handling, but the function assumes `n` is within the valid range and `lst` is non-empty.
