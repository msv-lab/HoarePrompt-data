The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, and returns a list of `n` sublists where each sublist `result[j]` (for `j` in range `0` to `n-1`) contains elements from `lst` whose indices modulo `n` match `j`. The function creates `n` empty sublists and iterates over the elements of `lst`, appending each element to the sublist corresponding to its index modulo `n`. The original list `lst` and integer `n` remain unchanged after the function execution. The function handles the case where `0 < n <= len(lst)` and ensures that each element from `lst` is placed into one of the `n` sublists based on the specified rule. There are no explicit edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code that need special handling, but the function assumes `n` is within the valid range and `lst` is non-empty.
