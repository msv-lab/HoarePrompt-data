Reasoning:
The provided function `func_1` aims to count the occurrences of each element in the list `lst` within the tuple `tup` and then return the sum of these counts. The function correctly uses a generator expression to iterate over each element in `lst` and sum the results of calling `tup.count(element)` for each element. This approach ensures that if an element from `lst` is not present in `tup`, its count will be zero, which is the desired behavior.

Given the problem statement and the annotated program, the function appears to correctly implement the required functionality.

Correctness: **True**
