Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Write a python function to count the occurence of all elements of list in a tuple.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup is a tuple, and lst is a list.
def func_1(tup, lst):
    return sum(tup.count(element) for element in lst)
    #The program returns the sum of counts of each element in `lst` that appear in tuple `tup`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `tup` and a list `lst`. It calculates and returns the sum of counts of each element in `lst` that also appear in `tup`. If an element in `lst` does not exist in `tup`, its count is considered as 0. This means that for every element in `lst`, if it is found in `tup`, its count in `tup` is added to the total sum; otherwise, 0 is added. The function handles the case where `lst` contains elements not present in `tup`, ensuring these do not affect the final sum.

# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
