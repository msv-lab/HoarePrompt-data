Reasoning:
The provided function `func_1` takes a tuple `tup` and a list `lst` as input. It aims to count the occurrences of each element from the list `lst` within the tuple `tup`. The function uses a generator expression inside the `sum` function to count occurrences of each element in `lst` within `tup`.

- The generator expression `(tup.count(element) for element in lst)` generates the count of each element from `lst` in `tup`.
- The `sum` function then adds up these counts.

This approach is correct because:
- The `count` method returns the number of times an element appears in the tuple.
- Summing these values gives the total count of all specified elements in the tuple.

Given that the problem description assumes valid inputs (i.e., the elements in `lst` will be present in `tup`), this implementation will work correctly.

Correctness: **True**
