### Reasoning:

Upon reviewing the original assessment and the annotated code, we need to verify whether the provided function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrences of all elements of `lst` in the tuple `tup`. 

Let's break down the function step-by-step:

1. **Function Definition**: 
   ```python
   def func_1(tup, lst):
       return sum(tup.count(element) for element in lst)
   ```

2. **Generator Expression**:
   - `(tup.count(element) for element in lst)` creates a generator that yields the count of each element from `lst` within `tup`.
   - For example, if `lst = [1, 2, 3]` and `tup = (1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3)`, the generator will yield `1, 2, 3` respectively.

3. **Sum Function**:
   - `sum(...)` adds up all the counts generated by the generator expression.
   - In the example above, the result would be `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`.

4. **Assumptions**:
   - The original assessment correctly states that the `count` method returns the number of times an element appears in the tuple.
   - However, it does not explicitly handle the case where an element in `lst` is not present in `tup`.

Given that the problem description assumes valid inputs, we can infer that all elements in `lst` are guaranteed to be present in `tup`. If this assumption holds true, the provided implementation is correct.

However, the original assessment does not explicitly mention this assumption. Without this assumption, the function could potentially raise a `ValueError` if any element in `lst` is not found in `tup`. Therefore, to be thorough, we should consider the possibility of such a scenario.

### Conclusion:

Since the problem description specifically mentions "valid inputs," which implies that all elements in `lst` are guaranteed to be present in `tup`, the provided implementation is correct under these assumptions.

Final: **True**
