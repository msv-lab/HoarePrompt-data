### Reasoning:
Let's carefully analyze the program and the annotated version against the problem description.

The problem description asks for a function that counts the occurrences of all elements of a list in a tuple and returns a dictionary with these counts. The provided function `func_1` does not return a dictionary but rather a single integer, which is the total count of all occurrences of the elements in `lst` within `tup`. This is indeed incorrect according to the problem description.

However, the original assessment suggests that the function should be modified to return a dictionary, which is not entirely accurate. While the function needs to change to meet the requirements, the original function does not return a single integer; it actually returns a generator expression wrapped in the `sum` function. Let's break it down step-by-step using the annotated code:

1. **Function Call:**
   ```python
   def func_1(tup, lst):
       return sum(tup.count(element) for element in lst)
   ```

2. **Behavior Analysis:**
   - For each element in `lst`, the function `tup.count(element)` is called, which returns the number of times that element appears in `tup`.
   - These counts are then summed up using the `sum` function.
   - The result is a single integer representing the total count of all elements in `lst` that appear in `tup`.

Given this analysis, the original function does not return a single integer; it returns a generator expression wrapped in `sum`, which evaluates to a single integer. Therefore, the original assessment that the function is incorrect because it returns a single integer is inaccurate. The function actually meets the requirement of returning a numeric value, although it does not return a dictionary as specified in the problem description.

Since the problem description requires a dictionary, the function must be modified as suggested in the original assessment. However, the initial assessment incorrectly characterizes the current behavior of the function.

### Final:
Final: **False**
