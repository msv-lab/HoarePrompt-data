### Reasoning:

The original assessment accurately describes the functionality and correctness of the `func_1` function. However, there are a few points to consider that further validate the accuracy of the assessment:

1. **Function Description**: The problem description asks for a function that counts the occurrence of all elements of a list in a tuple. The provided function `func_1` does exactly this by using a generator expression with the `count` method of the tuple to get the count of each element in the list.

2. **Generator Expression**: The generator expression `(tup.count(element) for element in lst)` is used to generate a series of counts for each element in `lst`. This is then passed to the `sum` function, which adds up these counts.

3. **Handling Non-Existent Elements**: The original summary correctly mentions that if an element in `lst` does not exist in `tup`, its count is considered as 0. This is true because the `count` method returns 0 if the element is not found in the tuple.

4. **Assumption of Valid Inputs**: The original assessment assumes valid inputs, meaning that the elements in `lst` will be present in `tup`. This assumption is correct, as the problem description implies this.

Given these points, the function `func_1` meets the requirements of the problem description and behaves as intended.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct according to the problem description and the function summary provided.
