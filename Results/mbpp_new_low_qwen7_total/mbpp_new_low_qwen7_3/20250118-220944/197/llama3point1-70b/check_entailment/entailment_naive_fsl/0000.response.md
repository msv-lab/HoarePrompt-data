Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` attempts to count the occurrences of each element from the list `lst` within the tuple `tup`. However, the function only returns a single integer value, which is the total count of all occurrences of the elements in `lst` within `tup`. According to the problem description, the function should return a dictionary where each key is an element from the list and the corresponding value is the count of that element in the tuple.

For example, consider the following inputs:
- `tup = (1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 2)`
- `lst = [1, 2, 3]`

The expected output would be `{1: 1, 2: 3, 3: 1}`, but the function will return `5`, which is the total count of all elements in `lst`.

To make the function correct, it should be modified to return a dictionary instead of a single integer. Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(tup, lst):
    return {element: tup.count(element) for element in lst}
```

This corrected function will produce the expected output as per the problem description.
