Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Write a python function to count the occurence of all elements of list in a tuple.

# Program:
def func_1(tup, lst):
    return sum((tup.count(element) for element in lst))





# Execution Summary:
The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `tup` and a list `lst`. It calculates and returns the sum of counts of each element in `lst` that also appear in `tup`. If an element in `lst` does not exist in `tup`, its count is considered as 0. This means that for every element in `lst`, if it is found in `tup`, its count in `tup` is added to the total sum; otherwise, 0 is added. The function handles the case where `lst` contains elements not present in `tup`, ensuring these do not affect the final sum.
