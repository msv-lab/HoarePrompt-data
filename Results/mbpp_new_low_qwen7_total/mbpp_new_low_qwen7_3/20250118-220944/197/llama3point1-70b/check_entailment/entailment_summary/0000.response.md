Reasoning:
The provided function `func_1` takes a tuple `tup` and a list `lst` as inputs. The function aims to count the occurrences of each element in `lst` within `tup` and return the total sum of these counts. To achieve this, the function uses a generator expression inside the `sum` function. For each element in `lst`, it calls `tup.count(element)` to find how many times that element appears in `tup`. If the element is not in `tup`, `tup.count(element)` will return 0. Therefore, the generator expression `(tup.count(element) for element in lst)` will yield 0 for elements not found in `tup`, and the `sum` function will correctly accumulate the counts.

The execution summary accurately describes the behavior of the function. It correctly states that if an element from `lst` is not found in `tup`, its count (which is 0) is added to the total sum. Thus, the function meets the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
