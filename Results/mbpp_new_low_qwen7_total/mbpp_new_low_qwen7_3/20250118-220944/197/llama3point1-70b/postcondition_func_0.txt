The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `tup` and a list `lst`. It calculates and returns the sum of counts of each element in `lst` that also appear in `tup`. If an element in `lst` does not exist in `tup`, its count is considered as 0. This means that for every element in `lst`, if it is found in `tup`, its count in `tup` is added to the total sum; otherwise, 0 is added. The function handles the case where `lst` contains elements not present in `tup`, ensuring these do not affect the final sum.
