Reasoning:
The original assessment is inaccurate. The provided function does not remove characters at even indices as intended; instead, it selects characters at odd indices. Let's analyze the function and the provided examples:

1. The function `func_1` iterates over the string `s` using a list comprehension and returns a new string that contains characters from `s` where the index `i` is odd (`i % 2 != 0`). This means it keeps the characters at odd indices and removes the characters at even indices.

2. For the example `func_1('python')`:
   - The characters at even indices are 'p', 't', 'h'.
   - The characters at odd indices are 'y', 'o', 'n'.
   - According to the function, it should return 'yhn' because it keeps the characters at odd indices. However, this is not what the problem description asks for. The problem description states to remove odd characters (which means keeping characters at even indices).

3. Similarly, for the other examples:
   - `func_1('program')` should return 'prg' (keeping 'p', 'r', 'g'), but it returns 'rga'.
   - `func_1('language')` should return 'lgug' (keeping 'l', 'g', 'u', 'g'), but it returns 'agae'.

The function is doing the opposite of what the problem description requires. It should be modified to select characters at even indices instead of odd indices.

Final: **False**
