### Reasoning:
The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the reasoning:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to remove odd characters in a string. This implies that we need to keep characters at even indices (0-based) and discard characters at odd indices.

2. **Function Summary**: The summary correctly describes that the function `func_1` returns a new string containing characters from the input string `s` at odd indices. This matches the problem description since characters at odd indices (1-based) are indeed removed when considering 0-based indexing.

3. **Program Code**: The code uses a list comprehension to iterate over the indices of the string `s` and includes only those indices where `i % 2 != 0`. This means it selects characters at odd positions (1-based).

4. **Examples**:
   - `'python'` -> `'yhn'`: Characters at positions 1, 3, and 5 are kept (1-based).
   - `'program'` -> `'rga'`: Characters at positions 1, 3, and 5 are kept (1-based).
   - `'language'` -> `'agae'`: Characters at positions 1, 3, 5, and 7 are kept (1-based).

The function correctly implements the requirement and produces the expected results based on the examples provided.

Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final:
**True**
