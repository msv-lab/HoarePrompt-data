Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies the intended behavior of the function `func_1`. The function is designed to select characters from the input string `s` at odd indices (i.e., positions 1, 3, 5, ...). The provided assertions and the function summary confirm that the function indeed behaves as expected, keeping characters at odd indices and removing characters at even indices.

However, there is a slight misalignment between the problem description and the original assessment. The problem description asks to "remove odd characters," which could be interpreted as removing characters at odd indices. But traditionally, "odd characters" refers to characters themselves, not their positions. Despite this minor confusion, the function logic and the assertions clearly show that the function removes characters at even indices, which is consistent with the provided test cases.

Since the function correctly implements the logic of keeping characters at odd indices and removing those at even indices, and all assertions pass, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
