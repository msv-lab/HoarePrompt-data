Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Write a function to remove odd characters in a string.

# Program:
assert func_1('python') == 'yhn'
assert func_1('program') == 'rga'
assert func_1('language') == 'agae'

def func_1(s):
    return ''.join([s[i] for i in range(len(s)) if i % 2 != 0])





# Execution Summary:
The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` as a parameter and returns a new string containing characters from `s` at odd indices (i.e., positions 1, 3, 5, ...). It achieves this by using a list comprehension to iterate over the indices of `s`, selecting only those indices where `i % 2 != 0`. The function does not modify the original string `s`; instead, it constructs and returns a new string. Potential edge cases include empty strings (`''`), strings with odd lengths, and strings with even lengths. In all cases, the returned string will contain characters from the original string at odd indices.


# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
