Reasoning:
The provided program defines a function `func_1` that correctly removes odd characters from a string, as specified in the problem description. The function iterates over the indices of the input string `s`, and includes only those characters whose index is odd (i.e., `i % 2 != 0`). This means it returns a new string containing characters from the original string at odd indices.

Let's verify this with the given assertions:
- For the input `'python'`, the output is `'yhn'`, which contains the characters at indices 1, 3, and 5.
- For the input `'program'`, the output is `'rga'`, which contains the characters at indices 1, 3, and 5.
- For the input `'language'`, the output is `'agae'`, which contains the characters at indices 1, 3, 5, and 7.

The function handles these test cases correctly, and the execution summary accurately describes how the function works. Therefore, the program is correct according to the provided problem description and test cases.

Correctness: **True**
