Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Write a function to remove odd characters in a string.

# Annotated Program:
assert func_1('python') == 'yhn'
assert func_1('program') == 'rga'
assert func_1('language') == 'agae'

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string.
def func_1(s):
    return ''.join([s[i] for i in range(len(s)) if i % 2 != 0])
    #The program returns a string containing characters from 's' at odd indices
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` as a parameter and returns a new string containing characters from `s` at odd indices (i.e., positions 1, 3, 5, ...). It achieves this by using a list comprehension to iterate over the indices of `s`, selecting only those indices where `i % 2 != 0`. The function does not modify the original string `s`; instead, it constructs and returns a new string. Potential edge cases include empty strings (`''`), strings with odd lengths, and strings with even lengths. In all cases, the returned string will contain characters from the original string at odd indices.

# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
