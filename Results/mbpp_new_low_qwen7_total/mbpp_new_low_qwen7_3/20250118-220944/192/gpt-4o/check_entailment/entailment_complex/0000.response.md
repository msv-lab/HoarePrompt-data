Reasoning:
The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to remove odd characters in a string. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. The function takes a string `s` as input.
2. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over the indices of `s`.
3. For each index `i`, it checks if `i % 2 != 0` (i.e., if the index is odd).
4. If the condition is true, the character at that index is included in the resulting list.
5. Finally, the list of characters is joined back into a string using `''.join()`.

Let's verify this with the provided test cases:

- `func_1('python')`: The characters at odd indices (1, 3, 5) are 'y', 'h', 'n'. So, the output should be 'yhn'.
- `func_1('program')`: The characters at odd indices (1, 3, 5, 7) are 'r', 'g', 'a'. So, the output should be 'rga'.
- `func_1('language')`: The characters at odd indices (1, 3, 5, 7, 9) are 'a', 'g', 'a', 'e'. So, the output should be 'agae'.

All the test cases match the expected results, indicating that the function works as intended.

Correctness: **True**
