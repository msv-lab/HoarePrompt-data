Reasoning:
- The problem description asks to remove odd characters in a string. This means removing characters at even indices (considering index starting from 0).
- The function `func_1` uses a list comprehension to iterate over the string `s` and includes only characters at odd indices (`i % 2 != 0`), which correctly removes characters at even indices.
- The provided test cases check the function with different strings and assert that the returned values match the expected results:
  - `func_1('python') == 'yhn'`: This is correct because it includes characters at indices 1, 3, and 5 ('y', 'h', 'n').
  - `func_1('program') == 'rga'`: This is correct because it includes characters at indices 1, 3, and 5 ('r', 'g', 'a').
  - `func_1('language') == 'agae'`: This is correct because it includes characters at indices 1, 3, 5, and 7 ('a', 'g', 'a', 'e').

Given that the implementation matches the problem description and all provided assertions pass, the function appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
