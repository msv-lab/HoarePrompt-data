Reasoning:
The given function `func_1` aims to remove odd characters from a string. This means it should keep the characters at even indices (considering the first character at index 0) and remove the characters at odd indices.

Let's analyze the assertions:
- `func_1('python') == 'yhn'`: In 'python', the characters at even indices are 'p', 't', 'h', and the characters at odd indices are 'y', 'o', 'n'. The function correctly returns 'yhn'.
- `func_1('program') == 'rga'`: In 'program', the characters at even indices are 'p', 'r', 'g', and the characters at odd indices are 'o', 'r', 'm'. The function correctly returns 'rga'.
- `func_1('language') == 'agae'`: In 'language', the characters at even indices are 'l', 'g', 'u', 'g', and the characters at odd indices are 'a', 'n', 'a', 'c'. The function correctly returns 'agae'.

The function uses list comprehension to iterate over the string with indices and includes only those characters where `i % 2 != 0`, which effectively selects characters at odd indices. This matches the problem requirement of removing odd characters (characters at even indices).

Given that all the assertions pass and the function logic aligns with the problem statement, the function is correct.

Correctness: **True**
