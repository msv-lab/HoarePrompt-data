#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string.
def func_1(s):
    return ''.join([s[i] for i in range(len(s)) if i % 2 != 0])
    #The program returns a string containing characters from 's' at odd indices
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` as a parameter and returns a new string containing characters from `s` at odd indices (i.e., positions 1, 3, 5, ...). It achieves this by using a list comprehension to iterate over the indices of `s`, selecting only those indices where `i % 2 != 0`. The function does not modify the original string `s`; instead, it constructs and returns a new string. Potential edge cases include empty strings (`''`), strings with odd lengths, and strings with even lengths. In all cases, the returned string will contain characters from the original string at odd indices.
