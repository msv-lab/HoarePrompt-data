    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-empty string with at least two characters. The variable `undulating` is `True` if and only if for every index `i` in the range `1` to `len(n) - 2`, the condition `n[i - 1] < n[i] and n[i] < n[i + 1]` or `n[i - 1] > n[i] and n[i] > n[i + 1]` holds true. Otherwise, `undulating` is `False`.
    return undulating
    #`undulating` is True if the string `n` alternates consistently (each character is either greater or lesser than its neighbors) and False otherwise
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n`, converts it to a string, and checks whether the digits in the string alternate consistently (each digit is either greater or lesser than its neighboring digits). If the digits alternate consistently, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function handles the case where `n` is a single digit by returning `True` immediately since a single-digit number trivially satisfies the alternating condition. The function also correctly identifies when the digits do not alternate consistently by setting the `undulating` variable to `False` and breaking out of the loop early if such a condition is detected.
