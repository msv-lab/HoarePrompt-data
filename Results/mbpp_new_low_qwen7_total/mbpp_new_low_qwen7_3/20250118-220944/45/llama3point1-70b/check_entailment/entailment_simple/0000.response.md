Reasoning:
1. The function `func_1` takes an integer `n`, converts it to a string, and then checks if the digits alternate between increasing and decreasing.
2. The logic inside the `for` loop correctly checks each digit in the string representation of `n` to ensure that for every index `i` in the range `1` to `len(n) - 2`, the digit at `i` is either greater than both its neighbors (forming a peak) or less than both its neighbors (forming a trough).
3. If any digit does not satisfy this condition, the `undulating` flag is set to `False` and the loop breaks, ensuring that the function returns `False` for such cases.
4. If the loop completes without finding any violations of the undulating pattern, the function correctly returns `True`.

Given this analysis, the annotated comments also accurately describe the state of the program and the conditions under which the function operates.

Correctness: **True**
