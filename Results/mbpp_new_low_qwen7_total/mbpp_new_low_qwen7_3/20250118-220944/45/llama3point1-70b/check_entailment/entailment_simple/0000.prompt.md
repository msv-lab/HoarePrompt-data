Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Write a function to check whether the given number is undulating or not.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    n = str(n)

undulating = True
    for i in range(1, len(n) - 1):
        if n[i - 1] < n[i] and n[i] < n[i + 1] or n[i - 1] > n[i] and n[i] > n[i + 1]:
            pass
        else:
            undulating = False
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-empty string with at least two characters. The variable `undulating` is `True` if and only if for every index `i` in the range `1` to `len(n) - 2`, the condition `n[i - 1] < n[i] and n[i] < n[i + 1]` or `n[i - 1] > n[i] and n[i] > n[i + 1]` holds true. Otherwise, `undulating` is `False`.
    return undulating
    #`undulating` is True if the string `n` alternates consistently (each character is either greater or lesser than its neighbors) and False otherwise


# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
