Reasoning:
- The function `func_1` aims to check if a given number is undulating, meaning its digits strictly alternate in increasing or decreasing order.
- The logic inside the loop checks two conditions:
  1. Whether the current digit is greater than the previous one and less than the next one.
  2. Whether the current digit is less than the previous one and greater than the next one.
- These conditions ensure that the digits are consistently alternating.
- The function correctly sets `undulating` to `False` and breaks the loop if any pair of adjacent digits does not meet these conditions.
- Single-digit numbers are handled correctly by returning `True`.
- The execution summary matches the implemented logic, confirming that the function behaves as intended.

Correctness: **True**
