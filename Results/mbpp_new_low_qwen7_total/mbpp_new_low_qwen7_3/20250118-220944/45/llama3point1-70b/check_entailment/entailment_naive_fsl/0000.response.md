Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program checks if the given number is undulating by comparing each digit with its adjacent digits. However, it only checks up to `len(n) - 2` digits. This means it does not check the last digit's condition, which could lead to incorrect results. For example, consider the number `12345`. The program will not check if `5` is greater than `4`, leading to an incorrect result since `12345` is not an undulating number.

To fix this, the loop should run until `len(n) - 2` instead of `len(n) - 1`:

```python
def func_1(n):
    n = str(n)
    undulating = True
    for i in range(1, len(n) - 1):
        if n[i - 1] < n[i] and n[i] < n[i + 1] or (n[i - 1] > n[i] and n[i] > n[i + 1]):
            pass
        else:
            undulating = False
            break
    if len(n) >= 3 and (n[0] != n[1] or n[-2] != n[-1]):  # Additional check for the first and last digits
        undulating = False
    return undulating
```

This ensures that the program correctly identifies undulating numbers for all potential cases.
