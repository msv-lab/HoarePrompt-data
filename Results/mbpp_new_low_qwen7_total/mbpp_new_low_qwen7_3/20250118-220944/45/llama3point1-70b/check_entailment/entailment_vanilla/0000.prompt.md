Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Write a function to check whether the given number is undulating or not.

# Program:
def func_1(n):
    n = str(n)
    undulating = True
    for i in range(1, len(n) - 1):
        if n[i - 1] < n[i] and n[i] < n[i + 1] or (n[i - 1] > n[i] and n[i] > n[i + 1]):
            pass
        else:
            undulating = False
            break
    return undulating



# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
