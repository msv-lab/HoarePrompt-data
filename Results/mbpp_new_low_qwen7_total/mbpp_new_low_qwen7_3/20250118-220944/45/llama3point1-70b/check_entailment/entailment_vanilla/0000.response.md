### Reasoning:

The goal of the function `func_1` is to determine if a given number is an undulating number. An undulating number is defined as a number that has an alternating pattern of digits where the digits are either increasing or decreasing consecutively.

Let's analyze the provided code:

1. **Convert to String**: The number `n` is converted to a string to easily access individual digits.
2. **Initialization**: A boolean variable `undulating` is initialized to `True`, assuming the number might be undulating until proven otherwise.
3. **Loop through Digits**: The loop iterates from the second digit to the second last digit (to avoid out-of-bounds errors).
4. **Condition Check**: For each digit, the code checks two conditions:
   - The current digit is greater than the previous digit and less than the next digit (`n[i-1] < n[i] and n[i] < n[i+1]`), indicating an increasing pattern.
   - The current digit is smaller than the previous digit and larger than the next digit (`n[i-1] > n[i] and n[i] > n[i+1]`), indicating a decreasing pattern.
5. **Toggle Flag**: If either condition is met, the loop continues. If neither condition is met, it sets `undulating` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.

The logic seems to correctly implement the criteria for an undulating number. However, there is a subtle issue with the logic flow:

- The code only checks for one of the two possible patterns (increasing or decreasing) in each iteration. It should check both patterns in sequence for the number to be considered undulating.
- The current implementation will incorrectly identify numbers like 123456 as undulating because it only checks one condition per iteration without ensuring the alternating pattern continues throughout the number.

To fix this, we need to ensure the function checks both increasing and decreasing patterns in a sequential manner and ensures they alternate.

### Conclusion:

Given the current implementation, the function does not correctly identify all undulating numbers due to the flawed logic. Therefore, the provided program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**
