The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n`, converts it to a string, and checks whether the digits in the string alternate consistently (each digit is either greater or lesser than its neighboring digits). If the digits alternate consistently, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function handles the case where `n` is a single digit by returning `True` immediately since a single-digit number trivially satisfies the alternating condition. The function also correctly identifies when the digits do not alternate consistently by setting the `undulating` variable to `False` and breaking out of the loop early if such a condition is detected.
