Output State: **n is a non-empty string with at least two characters, i is 3, undulating is False**

Explanation:
- The line `undulating = False` sets the boolean variable `undulating` to `False`.
- The line `break` is not inside any loop or match-case statement, so it will cause an error if executed. However, since the task is to provide the final state based on the given code without focusing on potential errors, we consider the last valid assignment to `undulating` which is `False`.

No other variables are affected by the provided code snippet. Therefore, the final state includes the updated value of `undulating` and retains the original values of `n` and `i`.
