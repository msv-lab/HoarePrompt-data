Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-empty string with at least two characters. If there exists an index `i` such that the `i`-th character of `n` is greater than the `(i-1)`-th character and less than the `(i+1)`-th character, or the `i`-th character of `n` is less than the `(i-1)`-th character and greater than the `(i+1)`-th character, then `undulating` remains True. Otherwise, `undulating` becomes False.***
