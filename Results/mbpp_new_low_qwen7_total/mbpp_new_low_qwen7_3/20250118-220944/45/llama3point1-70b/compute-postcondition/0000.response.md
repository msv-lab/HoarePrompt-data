Initial State: n is a positive integer.
```
```python
n = str(n)
undulating = True
```

Analysis:
1. The first line converts the integer value of `n` to a string and assigns it back to `n`. After this line, `n` is no longer an integer but a string.
2. The second line initializes the boolean variable `undulating` to `True`. This variable is set to `True` regardless of the initial state of `n`.

Final State: **n is a string, undulating is True**
