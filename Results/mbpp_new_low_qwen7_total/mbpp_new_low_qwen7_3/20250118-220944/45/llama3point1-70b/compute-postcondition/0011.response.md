Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the given for loop are `i`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` is a non-empty string with at least two characters.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `undulating` remains the same if the condition `n[i - 1] < n[i] and n[i] < n[i + 1] or (n[i - 1] > n[i] and n[i] > n[i + 1])` is met. Otherwise, `undulating` is set to `False`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 1` to `len(n) - 2`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3.

4. **Calculate the new value of `i` for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time it runs, the next value of `i` will be `i + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4`.

5. **Check if the loop can continue**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `1 <= i < len(n) - 1`.
   - Given that `i` becomes 4, we need to check if `4 < len(n) - 1`.

6. **Determine the new state**:
   - `i` will be 4.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `undulating` remains the same based on the condition evaluated at `i = 3`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`n` is a non-empty string with at least two characters, `i` is 4, and `undulating` remains the same if the condition `n[3 - 1] < n[3] and n[3] < n[3 + 1] or (n[3 - 1] > n[3] and n[3] > n[3 + 1])` is met. Otherwise, `undulating` is set to `False`.**
