Output State: **`n` is a non-empty string with at least two characters. The variable `undulating` is `True` if and only if for every index `i` in the range `1` to `len(n) - 2`, the condition `n[i - 1] < n[i] and n[i] < n[i + 1]` or `n[i - 1] > n[i] and n[i] > n[i + 1]` holds true. Otherwise, `undulating` is `False`.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initial State Analysis**:
   - `n` is initially a positive integer, which is converted to a string.
   - `undulating` is initialized to `True`.

2. **Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop iterates over the string `n` from index `1` to `len(n) - 2`.
   - For each index `i`, it checks whether `n[i - 1]` and `n[i + 1]` are either both greater than `n[i]` or both less than `n[i]`.
   - If any such pair does not satisfy the condition, `undulating` is set to `False` and the loop breaks.

3. **Final Output State**:
   - `n` remains a string.
   - `undulating` is `True` only if the string `n` satisfies the specified condition for all relevant indices. Otherwise, `undulating` is `False`.

This ensures that we correctly describe the state of `n` and `undulating` after the loop has completed its execution.
