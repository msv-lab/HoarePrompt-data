The `pass` statement in Python does nothing; it simply continues the execution without performing any operations. Therefore, none of the variables are affected by this statement. The conditions and values of the variables before the `pass` statement remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-empty string with at least two characters, undulating is True, and there exists an index `i` such that the `i`-th character of `n` is greater than the `(i-1)`-th character and less than the `(i+1)`-th character, or the `i`-th character of `n` is less than the `(i-1)`-th character and greater than the `(i+1)`-th character**
