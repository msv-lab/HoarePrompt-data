Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst`. It calculates the number of unique pairs of even integers (`even_pairs`) and the number of unique pairs of odd integers (`odd_pairs`). The function then returns the sum of these two values. The function handles the case where the list is empty, returning 0 in such a scenario. If the list contains only even numbers or only odd numbers, it correctly calculates the number of unique pairs for those numbers. However, it does not account for the case where the list contains both even and odd numbers, which is correctly handled by the provided code.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If the list `lst` is empty, the function returns 0.
- If the list contains only even numbers, the function correctly calculates the number of unique pairs of even numbers.
- If the list contains only odd numbers, the function correctly calculates the number of unique pairs of odd numbers.
- If the list contains both even and odd numbers, the function correctly calculates the sum of unique pairs of even numbers and unique pairs of odd numbers.
