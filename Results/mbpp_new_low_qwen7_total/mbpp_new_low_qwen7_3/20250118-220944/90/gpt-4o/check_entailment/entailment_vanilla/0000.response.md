Reasoning:
The provided function `func_1` calculates the number of pairs of integers in a list that xor to an even number. Here's how it works:

1. It first counts the number of even numbers in the list (`even_count`).
2. Then it calculates the number of odd numbers in the list by subtracting the count of even numbers from the total length of the list (`odd_count`).
3. The number of pairs of even numbers that can be formed is calculated using the combination formula \(\binom{even\_count}{2} = \frac{even\_count \times (even\_count - 1)}{2}\). This is because both numbers in a pair must be even for their XOR to be even.
4. Similarly, the number of pairs of odd numbers that can be formed is calculated using the same formula.
5. Finally, it returns the sum of these two values.

This logic is sound and should correctly count the number of pairs whose XOR is even. Let's verify this with the provided test cases:

- For the list `[5, 4, 7, 2, 1]`, there are 2 even numbers (4, 2) and 3 odd numbers (5, 7, 1). The number of even pairs is \(\binom{2}{2} = 1\) and the number of odd pairs is \(\binom{3}{2} = 3\). So the total is \(1 + 3 = 4\), which matches the expected result.
- For the list `[7, 2, 8, 1, 0, 5, 11]`, there are 3 even numbers (2, 8, 0) and 4 odd numbers (7, 1, 5, 11). The number of even pairs is \(\binom{3}{2} = 3\) and the number of odd pairs is \(\binom{4}{2} = 6\). So the total is \(3 + 6 = 9\), which matches the expected result.
- For the list `[1, 2, 3]`, there is 1 even number (2) and 2 odd numbers (1, 3). The number of even pairs is \(\binom{1}{2} = 0\) and the number of odd pairs is \(\binom{2}{2} = 1\). So the total is \(0 + 1 = 1\), which matches the expected result.

Since all the provided test cases are satisfied by the function, and the logic seems correct, we can conclude that the function is implemented correctly.

Correctness: **True**
