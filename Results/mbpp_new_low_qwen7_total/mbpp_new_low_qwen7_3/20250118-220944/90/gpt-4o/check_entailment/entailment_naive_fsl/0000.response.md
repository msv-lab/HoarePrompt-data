Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program attempts to count the number of pairs of integers in a list that XOR to an even number. However, the logic used to calculate the number of such pairs is flawed. Specifically, the program calculates the number of even pairs and odd pairs separately and sums them up, which does not accurately represent the pairs that XOR to an even number.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to consider the following:
- A pair of two even numbers (x, y) will XOR to an even number if both are either even or both are odd.
- A pair of one even number and one odd number (x, y) will XOR to an odd number.

Given the assertions:
- For `[5, 4, 7, 2, 1]`, the correct answer should be `6` (pairs: (4, 2), (4, 7), (4, 5), (4, 1), (7, 5), (7, 1)).
- For `[7, 2, 8, 1, 0, 5, 11]`, the correct answer should be `10` (pairs: (2, 8), (2, 0), (2, 5), (8, 0), (8, 5), (8, 11), (0, 5), (0, 11), (5, 11), (2, 11)).
- For `[1, 2, 3]`, the correct answer should be `1` (pair: (2, 2)).

The program's current approach does not correctly account for these scenarios. For instance, it fails to handle cases where the list has only even or only odd numbers, or mixed numbers properly.

A correct approach would involve counting the number of even and odd numbers and then calculating the valid pairs based on their counts. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(lst):
    even_count = sum(x % 2 == 0 for x in lst)
    odd_count = len(lst) - even_count
    even_pairs = even_count * (even_count - 1) // 2
    odd_pairs = odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2
    return even_pairs + odd_pairs
```

This corrected function should now correctly count the number of pairs that XOR to an even number.
