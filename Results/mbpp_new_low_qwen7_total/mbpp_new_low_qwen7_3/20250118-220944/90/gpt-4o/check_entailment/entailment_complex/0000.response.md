Reasoning:
- The provided function `func_1` does not correctly calculate the number of pairs of integers in the list that XOR to an even number.
- The function calculates the number of unique pairs of even numbers and the number of unique pairs of odd numbers separately and returns their sum. This approach is flawed because the XOR of two even numbers or two odd numbers will always be even, but the XOR of an even number and an odd number will always be odd.
- To correctly solve the problem, we need to count the number of pairs \((x, y)\) in the list such that \(x \oplus y\) is even. This can be achieved by counting the number of even numbers and the number of odd numbers in the list and then calculating the number of valid pairs from these counts.
- The current implementation does not consider the XOR operation; it simply counts the number of pairs of even and odd numbers separately.

Correctness: **False**
