Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Write a function that counts the number of pairs of integers in a list that xor to an even number.

# Annotated Program:
assert func_1([5, 4, 7, 2, 1]) == 4
assert func_1([7, 2, 8, 1, 0, 5, 11]) == 9
assert func_1([1, 2, 3]) == 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    even_count = sum(1 for x in lst if x % 2 == 0)

odd_count = len(lst) - even_count

even_pairs = even_count * (even_count - 1) // 2

odd_pairs = odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2
    return even_pairs + odd_pairs
    #`The program returns the total number of unique pairs of even integers (even_pairs) plus the total number of unique pairs of odd integers (odd_pairs)`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst`. It calculates the number of unique pairs of even integers (`even_pairs`) and the number of unique pairs of odd integers (`odd_pairs`). The function then returns the sum of these two values. The function handles the case where the list is empty, returning 0 in such a scenario. If the list contains only even numbers or only odd numbers, it correctly calculates the number of unique pairs for those numbers. However, it does not account for the case where the list contains both even and odd numbers, which is correctly handled by the provided code.

# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
