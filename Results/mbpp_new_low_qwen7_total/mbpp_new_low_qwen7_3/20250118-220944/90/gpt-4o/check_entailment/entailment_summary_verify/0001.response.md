Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to count the number of pairs of integers in a list that xor to an even number. 

Here's a detailed breakdown of why the function is correct:

1. **Counting Even and Odd Numbers**: The function first counts the number of even numbers (`even_count`) and the number of odd numbers (`odd_count`) in the list. This is done using the line `even_count = sum((1 for x in lst if x % 2 == 0))` and `odd_count = len(lst) - even_count`.

2. **Calculating Pairs**: 
   - The number of unique pairs of even numbers is calculated as `even_count * (even_count - 1) // 2`. This is derived from the combination formula \(\binom{n}{2}\), which gives the number of ways to choose 2 items out of `n` items.
   - Similarly, the number of unique pairs of odd numbers is calculated as `odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2`.

3. **Summing the Pairs**: The function then sums the number of even pairs and the number of odd pairs to get the total number of pairs whose XOR is even.

Given the provided test cases:
- For the list `[5, 4, 7, 2, 1]`, there are 2 even numbers (4, 2) and 3 odd numbers (5, 7, 1). The number of even pairs is \(\binom{2}{2} = 1\) and the number of odd pairs is \(\binom{3}{2} = 3\). So the total is \(1 + 3 = 4\), which matches the expected result.
- For the list `[7, 2, 8, 1, 0, 5, 11]`, there are 3 even numbers (2, 8, 0) and 4 odd numbers (7, 1, 5, 11). The number of even pairs is \(\binom{3}{2} = 3\) and the number of odd pairs is \(\binom{4}{2} = 6\). So the total is \(3 + 6 = 9\), which matches the expected result.
- For the list `[1, 2, 3]`, there is 1 even number (2) and 2 odd numbers (1, 3). The number of even pairs is \(\binom{1}{2} = 0\) and the number of odd pairs is \(\binom{2}{2} = 1\). So the total is \(0 + 1 = 1\), which matches the expected result.

Since the function logic and the test cases are consistent, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
