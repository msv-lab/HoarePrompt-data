Output State: **lst is a list of lists, where each inner list contains integers, result is a list of integers that appear exactly once in the flattened lst**

Explanation:
- The first line `count = Counter(lst)` creates a dictionary-like object (Counter) where keys are the unique elements found in the flattened `lst` (all elements from all inner lists), and values are the counts of those elements.
- The second line `result = [num for num in lst if count[num] == 1]` constructs a new list `result` containing only those numbers from the flattened `lst` that appear exactly once. It uses the `count` dictionary to determine the frequency of each number.

Since the exact values of `lst` are not provided, we can't specify the exact contents of `result`, but we know it will contain integers that appear exactly once in the flattened `lst`. Variables `count` and `lst` remain unchanged except for their implicit roles in the operations performed, and no new variables are introduced.
