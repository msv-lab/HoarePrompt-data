Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list of lists containing integers. It returns a list of integers that appear exactly once in the flattened `lst`. The function first counts the occurrences of each integer in `lst` using a `Counter`. Then, it filters the elements of `lst` to include only those integers that have a count of exactly one. If `lst` is empty or contains no unique integers, the function will return an empty list.**

This summary covers the actual behavior of the function based on the provided code and annotations, including the edge case where the input list might be empty or contain no unique integers.
