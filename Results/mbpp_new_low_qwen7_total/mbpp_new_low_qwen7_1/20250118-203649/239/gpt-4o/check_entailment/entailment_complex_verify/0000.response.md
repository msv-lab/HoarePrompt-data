Reasoning: 

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the program and the problem description to understand why:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to remove duplicate numbers from a given number of lists. This implies that the input is expected to be a list of lists, where each inner list contains integers.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a single list `lst` as input, which is a flat list (not a list of lists).
   - The function uses `Counter` to count the occurrences of each number in this flat list.
   - It then filters the elements to include only those integers that have a count of exactly one.
   - This means the function only processes one list at a time and removes duplicates within that single list.

3. **Annotated Code**:
   - The annotation states that the function returns a list of integers that appear exactly once in the flattened `lst`.
   - The function does not handle multiple lists; it treats the entire list as a single sequence of numbers.

Given that the problem description requires handling multiple lists, and the provided function only processes a single flat list, the program does not correctly implement the required functionality. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.

Final: **False**
