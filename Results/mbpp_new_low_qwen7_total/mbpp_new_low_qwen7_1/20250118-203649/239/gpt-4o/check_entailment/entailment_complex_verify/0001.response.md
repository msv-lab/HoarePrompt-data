Reasoning: 
The original assessment is accurate in its conclusion but incomplete in its analysis. Let's break down the problem and the provided solution:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to remove duplicate numbers from a given number of lists. This means the function should take a list of lists as input and return a list of integers that appear exactly once across all the sublists.

2. **Program Code**: The provided function `func_1` takes a single list `lst` as input and uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each integer in that list. It then filters the list to include only those integers that appear exactly once.

3. **Annotated Code**: The annotations correctly describe the behavior of the function. It indeed counts the occurrences of each integer in the flattened `lst` and returns only those integers that appear exactly once.

4. **Assertions**: The assertions provided in the annotated code are all valid for the current implementation. They check the function with different inputs and ensure that the returned list contains only unique elements from the given list.

However, the original assessment correctly points out that the problem description states "a given number of lists," implying multiple lists should be processed. The provided implementation, however, only handles a single list. Given the problem statement and the provided code, the function is designed to handle a single list, and the assertions reflect this correctly.

Therefore, while the function does correctly remove duplicates from a single list, it does not meet the full requirements of the problem as stated, which involves processing multiple lists. However, based on the given problem description and the current implementation, the function is correct for the given constraints.

Final: **False**
