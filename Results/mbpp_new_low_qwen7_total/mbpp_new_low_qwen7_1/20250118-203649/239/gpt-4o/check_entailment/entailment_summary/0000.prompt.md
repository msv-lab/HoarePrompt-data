Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Write a python function to remove duplicate numbers from a given number of lists.

# Program:
from collections import Counter

assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == [1, 4, 5]
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 5]) == [1, 3, 4, 5]
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

def func_1(lst):
    count = Counter(lst)
    result = [num for num in lst if count[num] == 1]
    return result





# Execution Summary:
The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list of lists containing integers. It returns a list of integers that appear exactly once in the flattened `lst`. The function first counts the occurrences of each integer in `lst` using a `Counter`. Then, it filters the elements of `lst` to include only those integers that have a count of exactly one. If `lst` is empty or contains no unique integers, the function will return an empty list.


# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
