Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly implement the function as described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` should take a single list (not a list of lists) as input and remove duplicates from that list. However, the given implementation treats the input as a flattened list of multiple sub-lists, which is not the intended behavior according to the problem description.

The execution summary incorrectly describes the behavior of the function, as the function does not flatten the list of lists before processing. Instead, it processes the list as a flat list of integers. This means the function will work correctly for the given test cases because they do not involve nested lists.

However, if the function were supposed to handle a list of lists (where each sublist is a separate list), the current implementation would need significant changes to flatten the list and then process it.

Given the problem description specifies removing duplicates from a given list, the provided code is incorrect because it assumes the input is a flat list rather than a list of lists.

Correctness: **False**
