### Reasoning:

The original assessment is partially correct but incomplete. Let's break down the program and the problem statement:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a function to remove duplicate numbers from a given number of lists. This means the function should accept multiple lists and return a combined list with no duplicates across all the input lists.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` currently accepts a single list `lst` and removes duplicates within that list.
   - The `Counter` object counts the occurrences of each element in the list.
   - A list comprehension is used to create a new list `result` containing only those elements that appear exactly once in the original list.

3. **Annotated Code Evaluation**:
   - The annotated code correctly states that the function returns a list of integers that appear exactly once in the flattened `lst`.
   - The provided assertions test the function with different single lists and confirm its behavior.

4. **Correctness Based on Problem Statement**:
   - The problem requires handling multiple lists, but the provided implementation only handles one list.
   - If we interpret the problem description as needing to handle multiple lists but the function is only designed to handle one list, then the function is indeed incorrect for the given problem statement.
   - However, the original assessment did not fully consider the possibility that the function might be intended to handle a single list, which is a common and valid interpretation of such problems.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the function as written does not meet the requirement of handling multiple lists. However, it did not fully explore the possibility that the function could be intended to handle a single list, which is a common and valid interpretation.

Given the context and the provided assertions, the function correctly handles the problem as a single list problem, but fails to meet the more complex requirement of handling multiple lists as stated in the problem description.

Therefore, the final evaluation is:

**Final: False**

The function is correct for the problem as a single list problem, but not for the multi-list problem as described.
