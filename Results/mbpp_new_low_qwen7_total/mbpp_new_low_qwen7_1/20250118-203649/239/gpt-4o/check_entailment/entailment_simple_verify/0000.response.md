### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Here's the detailed breakdown:

1. **Problem Description**:
   - The task is to remove duplicate numbers from a given number of lists.
   - The function `func_1` takes a single list (`lst`) as input and processes it.

2. **Function Behavior**:
   - The function counts the occurrences of each number in the list using `Counter(lst)`.
   - It then filters the list to keep only those numbers that appear exactly once.

3. **Annotated Code**:
   - The annotated code confirms that the function processes a single list and returns a list of numbers that appear exactly once in that list.
   - There are no indications that the function processes multiple lists within its current implementation.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - The original assessment correctly states that the function does not meet the requirement of handling multiple lists.
   - The function only processes one list and removes duplicates from that single list.

Given this analysis, the program does not satisfy the problem description which requires handling multiple lists. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
