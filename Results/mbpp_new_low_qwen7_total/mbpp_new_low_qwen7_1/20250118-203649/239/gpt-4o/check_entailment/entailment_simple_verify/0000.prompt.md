You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Write a python function to remove duplicate numbers from a given number of lists.

- Program: 
from collections import Counter

assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == [1, 4, 5]
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 5]) == [1, 3, 4, 5]
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

def func_1(lst):
    count = Counter(lst)
    result = [num for num in lst if count[num] == 1]
    return result



- Annotated Code: 
from collections import Counter

assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == [1, 4, 5]
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 5]) == [1, 3, 4, 5]
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of lists, where each inner list contains integers.
def func_1(lst):
    count = Counter(lst)

result = [num for num in lst if count[num] == 1]
    return result
    #`The program returns a list of integers that appear exactly once in the flattened 'lst'`



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program uses a `Counter` to count occurrences of each number in the list and then filters out numbers that appear more than once. However, the problem description asks to remove duplicate numbers from multiple lists, but the function `func_1` only processes a single list. This means the function does not meet the requirements for handling multiple lists as specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

End of Original Assessment
