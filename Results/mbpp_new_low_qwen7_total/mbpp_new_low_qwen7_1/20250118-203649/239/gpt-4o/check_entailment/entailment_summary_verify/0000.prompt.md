You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Write a python function to remove duplicate numbers from a given number of lists.

- Program:
from collections import Counter

assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == [1, 4, 5]
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 5]) == [1, 3, 4, 5]
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

def func_1(lst):
    count = Counter(lst)
    result = [num for num in lst if count[num] == 1]
    return result



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list of lists containing integers. It returns a list of integers that appear exactly once in the flattened `lst`. The function first counts the occurrences of each integer in `lst` using a `Counter`. Then, it filters the elements of `lst` to include only those integers that have a count of exactly one. If `lst` is empty or contains no unique integers, the function will return an empty list.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program uses a `Counter` to count occurrences of each number in the list and then filters out numbers that appear more than once. However, the problem description asks to remove duplicate numbers from multiple lists, but the function `func_1` only processes a single list. This means the function does not meet the requirements for handling multiple lists as specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
