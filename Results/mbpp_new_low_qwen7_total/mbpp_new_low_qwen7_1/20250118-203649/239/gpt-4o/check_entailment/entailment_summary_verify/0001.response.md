### Reasoning:

The original assessment accurately identifies a discrepancy between the problem description and the function's current implementation. The problem description states that the function should remove duplicate numbers from a given number of lists, implying that the input should be a collection of lists rather than a single list. However, the provided function `func_1` currently only processes a single list.

Let's analyze the function and the provided assertions:

1. **Function Behavior**: The function `func_1` takes a single list `lst` as input, flattens it (since it's a list of lists), and then uses `Counter` to count the occurrences of each element. It then filters out elements that appear more than once, returning a list of unique elements.

2. **Assertions**: The assertions provided are valid for a single list. They check the removal of duplicates within a single list:
   - `func_1([1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == [1, 4, 5]`: Removes duplicates from a single list.
   - `func_1([1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 5]) == [1, 3, 4, 5]`: Removes duplicates from a single list.
   - `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`: No duplicates to remove, returns the same list.

Since the function behaves correctly for the single list case, the provided assertions pass. However, this does not fulfill the requirement of handling multiple lists as specified in the problem description.

The original assessment correctly notes that the function does not meet the full requirements because it only processes a single list. Therefore, the function is not fully correct for the given problem description.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
