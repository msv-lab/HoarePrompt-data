### Reasoning:
Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary against the problem description.

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a Python function that removes duplicate numbers from a given number of lists. This implies that the function should take multiple lists as input and return a list of unique elements from all these lists combined.

2. **Function Summary**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a single list `lst` as input.
   - It counts the occurrences of each integer in `lst` using a `Counter`.
   - It filters the elements to include only those integers that have a count of exactly one.
   - If `lst` is empty or contains no unique integers, it returns an empty list.

3. **Program Code**:
   - The function `func_1` indeed uses a `Counter` to count occurrences.
   - It filters the elements based on their count, ensuring only those with a count of 1 are included in the result.
   - The assertions provided test the function with different single lists and correctly filter out duplicates.

Given the function summary and the provided assertions, the function appears to be designed to handle a single list and remove duplicates within that list. However, this does not align with the problem description, which explicitly mentions "a given number of lists" and suggests handling multiple lists.

The original assessment is accurate because the function `func_1` does not meet the requirement to handle multiple lists as specified in the problem description. It processes a single list and removes duplicates within that list, rather than combining multiple lists and removing duplicates.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
