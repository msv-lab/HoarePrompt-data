Reasoning: 
The provided function `func_1` aims to remove duplicate numbers from a given list. The function uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count occurrences of each element in the list. Then, it creates a new list `result` that contains only those elements that appear exactly once in the original list.

However, the problem statement mentions "a given number of lists," which implies that the function should accept multiple lists and remove duplicates across all these lists. The provided implementation, however, only processes a single list at a time.

Given the assertions provided, they all assume that the function is supposed to work with a single list. Therefore, based on the current implementation and the provided assertions, the function correctly removes duplicates from a single list. 

But since the problem description specifies handling multiple lists, the function as provided does not meet the full requirements.

Correctness: **False**
