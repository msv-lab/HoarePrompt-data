Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program uses a `Counter` to count occurrences of each number in the list and then filters out numbers that appear more than once. However, the problem description asks to remove duplicate numbers from multiple lists, but the function `func_1` only processes a single list. This means the function does not meet the requirements for handling multiple lists as specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
