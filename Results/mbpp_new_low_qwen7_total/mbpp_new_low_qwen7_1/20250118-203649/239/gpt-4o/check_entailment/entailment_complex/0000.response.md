Reasoning:

The annotated program provided has some inaccuracies in its logic and explanation. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Function Logic**:
   - The current implementation of `func_1` uses `Counter(lst)` where `lst` is the entire list of lists concatenated into one flat list. This means that `Counter` will count the occurrences of each integer across all inner lists.
   - However, the function is supposed to work with each inner list separately and find unique integers within each list, not across all lists combined.

2. **Expected Behavior**:
   - For each inner list, we need to count the occurrences of each integer within that list and then filter out the integers that appear exactly once in that specific list.
   - The current implementation does not account for this and instead treats the entire input as a single list.

3. **Correct Implementation**:
   - We need to iterate through each sublist and apply the `Counter` and filtering process individually.

Given these points, the provided function is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic to handle each sublist independently. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
