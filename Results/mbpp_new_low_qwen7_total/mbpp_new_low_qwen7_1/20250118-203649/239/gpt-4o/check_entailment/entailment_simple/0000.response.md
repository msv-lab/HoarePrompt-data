### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a function `func_1` that removes duplicate numbers from a given number of lists. The function should return a list of integers that appear exactly once when all the lists are combined into one flat list.

2. **Function Implementation**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a single argument `lst`, which is expected to be a list of lists.
   - Inside the function, a `Counter` object is created from `lst`, but this counter is created directly from the outer `lst` rather than flattening it first.
   - A list comprehension is used to filter out numbers that appear exactly once in the flattened list, but the counter is based on the entire `lst` rather than a flattened version.

3. **Test Cases**:
   - The test cases assume that `func_1` should take a single list (not a list of lists) and return unique elements from that list.
   - However, the function implementation does not handle a list of lists correctly; it treats the outer list as a single flat list, which is not the intended behavior according to the problem statement.

4. **Flattened List**:
   - For example, if `lst = [[1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 5]]`, the expected output would be `[1, 4, 5]` because these numbers appear exactly once in the flattened list `[1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
   - However, the current implementation would treat the entire list `[1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 5]` as a single flat list and incorrectly process it.

### Conclusion:
The function implementation does not correctly flatten the list of lists before counting and filtering duplicates. Therefore, the function is incorrect based on the provided problem description.

### Response:
Correctness: **False**
