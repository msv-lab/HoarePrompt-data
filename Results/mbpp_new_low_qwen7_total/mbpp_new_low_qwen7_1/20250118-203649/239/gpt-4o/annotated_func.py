#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of lists, where each inner list contains integers.
def func_1(lst):
    count = Counter(lst)

result = [num for num in lst if count[num] == 1]
    return result
    #`The program returns a list of integers that appear exactly once in the flattened 'lst'`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list of lists containing integers. It returns a list of integers that appear exactly once in the flattened `lst`. The function first counts the occurrences of each integer in `lst` using a `Counter`. Then, it filters the elements of `lst` to include only those integers that have a count of exactly one. If `lst` is empty or contains no unique integers, the function will return an empty list.
