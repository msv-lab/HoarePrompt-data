### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem description and the provided assertions along with the function summary.

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to extract elements and tuples from the given two tuples. This suggests that the function should return a structure that contains the elements from both tuples side by side, possibly as pairs or tuples of pairs.

2. **Function Summary**: The function `func_1` performs a bitwise AND operation on corresponding elements of the two input tuples and returns a new tuple with these results. This matches the assertions provided, indicating that the function is performing the bitwise AND operation as expected.

3. **Assertions**:
   - `func_1((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3)) == (0, 0, 2, 1)`
   - `func_1((1, 2, 3, 4), (5, 6, 7, 8)) == (1, 2, 3, 0)`
   - `func_1((8, 9, 11, 12), (7, 13, 14, 17)) == (0, 9, 10, 0)`

These assertions confirm that the function is indeed performing a bitwise AND operation on the elements of the input tuples, as described in the function summary.

4. **Original Assessment**:
   - The original assessment stated that the function is incorrect because it performs a bitwise AND operation instead of simply extracting elements as tuples.
   - However, the function summary and the assertions indicate that the function is correctly implementing the bitwise AND operation as required.

Given that the function summary accurately describes the behavior of the function and the assertions align with the function's implementation, the original assessment is inaccurate.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**

The given program is correct according to the problem description and the provided assertions, even though the name `func_1` might be misleading. The function correctly implements the bitwise AND operation on the corresponding elements of the input tuples.
