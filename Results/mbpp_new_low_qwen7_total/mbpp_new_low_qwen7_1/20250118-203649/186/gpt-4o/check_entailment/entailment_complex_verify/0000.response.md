### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem description and the provided function `func_1`.

#### Problem Description:
The task is to write a function to extract the element-wise and tuples from the given two tuples. This implies that the function should return a tuple containing pairs of elements from the input tuples, i.e., `((tuple1[0], tuple2[0]), (tuple1[1], tuple2[1]), ...)`.

#### Provided Function:
```python
def func_1(tuple1, tuple2):
    return tuple((a & b for (a, b) in zip(tuple1, tuple2)))
```

#### Annotated Code Analysis:
- The function uses the `zip` function to pair elements from `tuple1` and `tuple2`.
- It then applies the bitwise AND (`&`) operator on each pair of elements.
- Finally, it returns a tuple containing the results of these bitwise AND operations.

Given the assertions:
1. `assert func_1((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3)) == (0, 0, 2, 1)`
2. `assert func_1((1, 2, 3, 4), (5, 6, 7, 8)) == (1, 2, 3, 0)`
3. `assert func_1((8, 9, 11, 12), (7, 13, 14, 17)) == (0, 9, 10, 0)`

These assertions show that the function correctly performs the bitwise AND operation on corresponding elements of the tuples.

#### Original Assessment:
The original assessment states that the function is incorrect because it performs a bitwise AND operation instead of simply extracting the elements as tuples. This is based on the misunderstanding of the problem statement, which actually requires the bitwise AND operation.

However, the problem description can be ambiguous. If the intent was to simply extract elements as tuples (i.e., returning `((10, 5), (4, 2), (6, 3), (9, 3))`), then the provided function does not match this requirement. But the problem description could also imply performing the bitwise AND operation, which the provided function does correctly.

Given the assertions and the provided function, it appears the function is correctly implementing the bitwise AND operation on the tuples.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly implements the bitwise AND operation on corresponding elements of the tuples, which aligns with the problem description as interpreted from the provided assertions. Therefore, the original assessment was inaccurate.
