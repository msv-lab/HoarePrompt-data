Reasoning:
The annotated explanation of the program correctly describes the behavior of the `func_1` function. The function performs an element-wise logical AND operation on the two input tuples using the `zip` function and a generator expression within a `tuple` constructor. Given the provided assertions, let's verify the correctness of the function:

1. For `(10, 4, 6, 9)` and `(5, 2, 3, 3)`, the logical AND operations yield:
   - \(10 \& 5 = 0\)
   - \(4 \& 2 = 0\)
   - \(6 \& 3 = 2\)
   - \(9 \& 3 = 1\)
   So, the result should be `(0, 0, 2, 1)`, which matches the first assertion.

2. For `(1, 2, 3, 4)` and `(5, 6, 7, 8)`, the logical AND operations yield:
   - \(1 \& 5 = 1\)
   - \(2 \& 6 = 2\)
   - \(3 \& 7 = 3\)
   - \(4 \& 8 = 0\)
   So, the result should be `(1, 2, 3, 0)`, which matches the second assertion.

3. For `(8, 9, 11, 12)` and `(7, 13, 14, 17)`, the logical AND operations yield:
   - \(8 \& 7 = 0\)
   - \(9 \& 13 = 9\)
   - \(11 \& 14 = 10\)
   - \(12 \& 17 = 0\)
   So, the result should be `(0, 9, 10, 0)`, which matches the third assertion.

Since the function's implementation matches the expected behavior as described by the assertions, the function is correct.

Correctness: **True**
