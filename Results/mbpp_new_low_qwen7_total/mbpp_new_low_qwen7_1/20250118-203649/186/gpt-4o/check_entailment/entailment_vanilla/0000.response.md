Reasoning:
The function `func_1` aims to perform an element-wise bitwise AND operation between two tuples and return a new tuple with the results. Let's analyze the function and the provided test cases:

1. The function uses `zip(tuple1, tuple2)` to pair elements from both tuples.
2. It then applies the bitwise AND operator (`&`) to each pair of elements.
3. The result is generated using a generator expression inside the `tuple()` function, which converts the generator into a tuple.

Now let's verify the provided test cases:

- For the first test case: `(10, 4, 6, 9) & (5, 2, 3, 3)`
  - `10 & 5 = 0`
  - `4 & 2 = 0`
  - `6 & 3 = 2`
  - `9 & 3 = 1`
  - The result is `(0, 0, 2, 1)`, which matches the expected output.

- For the second test case: `(1, 2, 3, 4) & (5, 6, 7, 8)`
  - `1 & 5 = 1`
  - `2 & 6 = 2`
  - `3 & 7 = 3`
  - `4 & 8 = 0`
  - The result is `(1, 2, 3, 0)`, which matches the expected output.

- For the third test case: `(8, 9, 11, 12) & (7, 13, 14, 17)`
  - `8 & 7 = 0`
  - `9 & 13 = 9`
  - `11 & 14 = 10`
  - `12 & 17 = 0`
  - The result is `(0, 9, 10, 0)`, which matches the expected output.

Given that the function correctly performs the bitwise AND operation and the results match the provided test cases, the function is correct.

Correctness: **True**
