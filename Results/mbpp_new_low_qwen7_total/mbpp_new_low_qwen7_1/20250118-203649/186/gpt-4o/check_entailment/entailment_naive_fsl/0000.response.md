Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` uses the bitwise AND operator (`&`) on corresponding elements of the two tuples and returns a new tuple with these results. However, the problem description asks to extract elements and tuples, which implies returning individual elements from the tuples rather than performing a bitwise operation.

For instance, consider the following input:
```
assert func_1((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3)) == ((10, 5), (4, 2), (6, 3), (9, 3))
```

In this case, the function does not meet the requirements because it performs a bitwise AND operation instead of simply extracting the elements as tuples. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
