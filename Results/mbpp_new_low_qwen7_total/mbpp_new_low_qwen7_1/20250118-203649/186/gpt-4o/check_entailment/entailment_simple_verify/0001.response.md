### Reasoning:
Let's re-evaluate the provided program and the original assessment step-by-step using the annotated code.

The function `func_1` is defined as follows:
```python
def func_1(tuple1, tuple2):
    return tuple(a & b for a, b in zip(tuple1, tuple2))
```

#### Analysis:
1. **Function Logic**:
   - The function takes two tuples, `tuple1` and `tuple2`.
   - It uses `zip(tuple1, tuple2)` to pair up elements from both tuples.
   - For each pair `(a, b)`, it performs a bitwise AND operation `a & b`.
   - The results of these operations are collected into a tuple using a generator expression inside the `tuple()` function.

2. **Test Case Verification**:
   - **First Test Case**: `(10, 4, 6, 9) & (5, 2, 3, 3)`
     - `10 & 5 = 0`
     - `4 & 2 = 0`
     - `6 & 3 = 2`
     - `9 & 3 = 1`
     - The result is `(0, 0, 2, 1)`, which matches the expected output.
   
   - **Second Test Case**: `(1, 2, 3, 4) & (5, 6, 7, 8)`
     - `1 & 5 = 1`
     - `2 & 6 = 2`
     - `3 & 7 = 3`
     - `4 & 8 = 0`
     - The result is `(1, 2, 3, 0)`, which matches the expected output.
   
   - **Third Test Case**: `(8, 9, 11, 12) & (7, 13, 14, 17)`
     - `8 & 7 = 0`
     - `9 & 13 = 9`
     - `11 & 14 = 10`
     - `12 & 17 = 0`
     - The result is `(0, 9, 10, 0)`, which matches the expected output.

From the above analysis, it appears that the function is performing the bitwise AND operation correctly and producing the expected results for the given test cases.

#### Conclusion:
Based on the provided test cases and the logic of the function, the original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly implements the element-wise bitwise AND operation on the given tuples.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
