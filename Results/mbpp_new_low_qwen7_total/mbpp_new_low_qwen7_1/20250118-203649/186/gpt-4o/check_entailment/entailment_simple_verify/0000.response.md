Reasoning: 

Let's carefully analyze the provided problem description and the annotated code to understand what the function `func_1` is actually doing.

1. **Problem Description**: The problem requires us to extract elements and tuples from the given two tuples. This implies that we should be returning elements and possibly sub-tuples (if needed) from the given tuples, rather than performing any operations on them.

2. **Annotated Code**: The annotated code explains that the function `func_1` returns a tuple where each element is the result of the bitwise AND operation between the corresponding elements of `tuple1` and `tuple2`. The bitwise AND operation (`&`) combines the bits of two numbers, which is not what the problem description suggests.

Given the problem description, the expected behavior would be to simply return pairs of elements from the two tuples. For example, if we have `tuple1 = (10, 4, 6, 9)` and `tuple2 = (5, 2, 3, 3)`, the expected output should be `((10, 5), (4, 2), (6, 3), (9, 3))`.

However, the current implementation of `func_1` is using the bitwise AND operation, which means it's performing `10 & 5`, `4 & 2`, `6 & 3`, and `9 & 3`, respectively, and then returning those results as a tuple. The results of these operations are `0`, `0`, `2`, and `1`, which do not match the expected behavior.

Thus, the function `func_1` is not correctly implementing the problem's requirement. The original assessment is accurate because the function does not extract elements and tuples as required but instead performs a bitwise AND operation.

Final: **False**
