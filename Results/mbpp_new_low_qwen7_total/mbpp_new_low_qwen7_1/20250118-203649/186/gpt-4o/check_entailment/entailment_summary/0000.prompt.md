Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Write a function to extract the elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples.

# Program:
assert func_1((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3)) == (0, 0, 2, 1)
assert func_1((1, 2, 3, 4), (5, 6, 7, 8)) == (1, 2, 3, 0)
assert func_1((8, 9, 11, 12), (7, 13, 14, 17)) == (0, 9, 10, 0)

def func_1(tuple1, tuple2):
    return tuple((a & b for (a, b) in zip(tuple1, tuple2)))





# Execution Summary:
The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `tuple1` and `tuple2`, which are both tuples of the same length. It returns a new tuple where each element is the result of the logical AND operation between the corresponding elements of `tuple1` and `tuple2`. This means that if both elements are non-zero (True), the result is True; otherwise, the result is False. The function handles all elements in the tuples, including the case where either or both elements are zero (False). There are no explicit edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code, but the function assumes that `tuple1` and `tuple2` are of the same length. If they were not, the `zip` function would stop at the shortest tuple, which might lead to a shorter output tuple than expected. However, since the function does not handle such cases, the output will only contain the results up to the length of the shorter tuple.
