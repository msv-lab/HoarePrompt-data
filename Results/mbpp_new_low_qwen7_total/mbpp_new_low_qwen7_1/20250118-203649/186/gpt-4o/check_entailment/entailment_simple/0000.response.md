### Reasoning:
The provided function `func_1` uses a generator expression within a `tuple` constructor to apply the bitwise AND (`&`) operator to each pair of elements from the input tuples `tuple1` and `tuple2`. The `zip` function pairs up corresponding elements from both tuples, and the generator expression applies the `&` operator to these pairs.

Let's verify this with the given assertions:

1. `assert func_1((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3)) == (0, 0, 2, 1)`
   - Binary representation of 10 and 5: `1010` and `0101` -> `0000` (0)
   - Binary representation of 4 and 2: `0100` and `0010` -> `0000` (0)
   - Binary representation of 6 and 3: `0110` and `0011` -> `0010` (2)
   - Binary representation of 9 and 3: `1001` and `0011` -> `0001` (1)
   - The output is `(0, 0, 2, 1)`, which matches the assertion.

2. `assert func_1((1, 2, 3, 4), (5, 6, 7, 8)) == (1, 2, 3, 0)`
   - Binary representation of 1 and 5: `0001` and `0101` -> `0001` (1)
   - Binary representation of 2 and 6: `0010` and `0110` -> `0010` (2)
   - Binary representation of 3 and 7: `0011` and `0111` -> `0011` (3)
   - Binary representation of 4 and 8: `0100` and `1000` -> `0000` (0)
   - The output is `(1, 2, 3, 0)`, which matches the assertion.

3. `assert func_1((8, 9, 11, 12), (7, 13, 14, 17)) == (0, 9, 10, 0)`
   - Binary representation of 8 and 7: `1000` and `0111` -> `0000` (0)
   - Binary representation of 9 and 13: `1001` and `1101` -> `1001` (9)
   - Binary representation of 11 and 14: `1011` and `1110` -> `1010` (10)
   - Binary representation of 12 and 17: `1100` and `10001` -> `0000` (0)
   - The output is `(0, 9, 10, 0)`, which matches the assertion.

Since the function correctly performs the bitwise AND operation on each pair of elements from the input tuples and the provided assertions match the expected results, the function is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
