Output State: `patterns1` and `patterns2` are lists of strings with the same length. The `mapping` dictionary is populated such that for every pair `(p1, p2)` where `p1` is in `patterns1` and `p2` is in `patterns2`, if `p1` is not already in `mapping`, then `mapping[p1]` will be set to `p2`. If `p1` is already in `mapping` and `mapping[p1]` is not equal to `p2`, the function returns `False`. If `p1` is already in `mapping` and `mapping[p1]` is equal to `p2`, the function does nothing and continues to the next iteration. If the loop completes without returning `False`, it means that either there were no conflicting pairs `(p1, p2)` or the function never encountered such pairs due to early termination.

In summary, the loop ensures that if a string in `patterns1` appears more than once, the corresponding values in `patterns2` for subsequent occurrences must match the value stored in `mapping` for the first occurrence of that string. If this condition is violated at any point, the function returns `False`. If the loop completes without returning `False`, the `mapping` dictionary is fully populated with the required correspondences between `patterns1` and `patterns2`, provided no contradictions arise.
