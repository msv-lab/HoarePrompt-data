Postcondition: **`patterns1` and `patterns2` are lists with at least one element each. If `p1` is not in `mapping`, the function continues without changing anything. If `p1` is in `mapping` and `mapping[p1]` equals `p2`, the function continues without changes. If `p1` is in `mapping` but `mapping[p1]` does not equal `p2`, the function returns False.**
