To determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time, let's break down the given information and the loop itself.

### Given Information:
- `patterns1` and `patterns2` are lists of strings representing sequences.
- The length of `patterns1` is equal to the length of `patterns2`.
- `mapping` is an empty dictionary.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for (p1, p2) in zip(patterns1, patterns2):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Control Variables**: The loop uses `zip` to iterate over pairs of elements from `patterns1` and `patterns2`. Therefore, the loop control variables here are `(p1, p2)` where `p1` is from `patterns1` and `p2` is from `patterns2`.

2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute, there must be at least one pair of elements in the zipped sequence. This means the length of both `patterns1` and `patterns2` must be greater than zero.

3. **Initial State**: 
   - `patterns1` and `patterns2` are lists of strings.
   - `mapping` is an empty dictionary, which is not directly relevant to the loop execution but ensures it is correctly initialized.

4. **First Iteration Requirements**:
   - The loop starts with the first pair of elements from `patterns1` and `patterns2`.
   - Hence, for the first iteration, both `patterns1` and `patterns2` must have at least one element each.

Given this analysis, we can conclude the following for the loop to execute the first time:

- `patterns1` must have at least one element.
- `patterns2` must have at least one element.
- `mapping` being an empty dictionary does not affect the loop's ability to execute; it is just an initialization detail.

### Final State:
State: **`patterns1` must have at least one element, `patterns2` must have at least one element**
