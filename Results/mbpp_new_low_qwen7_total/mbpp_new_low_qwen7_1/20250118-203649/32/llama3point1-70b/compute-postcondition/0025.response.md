Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `patterns1` and `patterns2`, both being lists of strings representing sequences. The function checks if the lengths of `patterns1` and `patterns2` are equal. If they are not, it returns `False`.

If the lengths are equal, it proceeds to create a dictionary `mapping` to store the correspondences between elements in `patterns1` and `patterns2`. It iterates through each pair of elements from `patterns1` and `patterns2`. For each pair, it checks if the current element in `patterns1` (`p1`) is already in the `mapping` dictionary. If it is not, it stores the corresponding element from `patterns2` (`p2`) in the `mapping` dictionary. If it is already in the `mapping` dictionary, it checks if the stored value matches the current element from `patterns2`. If they do not match, it returns `False`.

After iterating through all pairs, if no conflicts are found, the function returns `True`. This indicates that for every element in `patterns1`, there is a unique corresponding element in `patterns2` according to the `mapping` dictionary.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function correctly handles the case where the lengths of `patterns1` and `patterns2` are unequal, returning `False`.
- The function correctly handles the case where there are duplicate elements in `patterns1` and ensures that their corresponding elements in `patterns2` are consistent. If any inconsistency is found, it returns `False`.
- There are no missing functionalities as the code correctly implements the described behavior.**

The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `patterns1` and `patterns2` have the same length, and if the function returns `True`, the `mapping` dictionary contains valid correspondences between the elements of `patterns1` and `patterns2` without any contradictions. If the function returns `False`, it means there was either a length mismatch or a contradiction in the correspondences.
