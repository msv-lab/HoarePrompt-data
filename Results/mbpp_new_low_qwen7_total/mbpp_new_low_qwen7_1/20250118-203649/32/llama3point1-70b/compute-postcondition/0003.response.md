The code initializes an empty dictionary called `mapping`. This means no changes are made to `patterns1` and `patterns2`, and the `mapping` dictionary is newly created and empty.

Output State: **`patterns1` and `patterns2` are lists of strings representing sequences, and the length of `patterns1` is equal to the length of `patterns2`; `mapping` is an empty dictionary.**
