`mapping` is updated such that the key `p1` is assigned the value `p2`. The values of `patterns1` and `patterns2` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `patterns1` must have at least one element, `patterns2` must have at least one element, `p1` is not in `mapping`, and `mapping[p1]` is now equal to `p2`.

Output State: **`patterns1` must have at least one element, `patterns2` must have at least one element, `p1` is not in `mapping`, and `mapping[p1]` is equal to `p2`**
