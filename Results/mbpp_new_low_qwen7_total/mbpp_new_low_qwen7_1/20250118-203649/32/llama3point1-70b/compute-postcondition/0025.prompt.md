You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: patterns1 and patterns2 are lists of strings representing sequences.
def func_1(patterns1, patterns2):
    if (len(patterns1) != len(patterns2)) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: patterns1 and patterns2 are lists of strings representing sequences, and the length of patterns1 is equal to the length of patterns2
    mapping = {}
    for (p1, p2) in zip(patterns1, patterns2):
        if p1 not in mapping:
            mapping[p1] = p2
        elif mapping[p1] != p2:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: `patterns1` and `patterns2` are lists of strings with the same length. The `mapping` dictionary is populated such that for every pair `(p1, p2)` where `p1` is in `patterns1` and `p2` is in `patterns2`, if `p1` is not already in `mapping`, then `mapping[p1]` will be set to `p2`. If `p1` is already in `mapping` and `mapping[p1]` is not equal to `p2`, the function returns `False`. If `p1` is already in `mapping` and `mapping[p1]` is equal to `p2`, the function does nothing and continues to the next iteration. If the loop completes without returning `False`, it means that either there were no conflicting pairs `(p1, p2)` or the function never encountered such pairs due to early termination.
    #
    #In summary, the loop ensures that if a string in `patterns1` appears more than once, the corresponding values in `patterns2` for subsequent occurrences must match the value stored in `mapping` for the first occurrence of that string. If this condition is violated at any point, the function returns `False`. If the loop completes without returning `False`, the `mapping` dictionary is fully populated with the required correspondences between `patterns1` and `patterns2`, provided no contradictions arise.
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `patterns1` and `patterns2`. Both `patterns1` and `patterns2` are lists of strings representing sequences. 
#
#- In Case_1, the function returns `False`.
#- In Case_2, the function returns `False`.
#- In Case_3, the function returns `False`.
#- In Case_4, the function returns `False`.
#- In Case_5, the function returns `True`.
#
#Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two parameters `patterns1` and `patterns2` (both being lists of strings), and return `True` under specific conditions defined in Case_5, while returning `False` in all other cases.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns False

Case_2: The program returns False

Case_3: The program returns False

Case_4: The program returns False

Case_5: The program returns True


Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
