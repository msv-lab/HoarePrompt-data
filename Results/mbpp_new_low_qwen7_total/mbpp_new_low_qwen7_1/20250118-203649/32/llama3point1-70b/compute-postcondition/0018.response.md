The code snippet `mapping[p1] = p2` assigns the value of `p2` to the key `p1` in the dictionary `mapping`. Since `p1` and `p2` are elements from `patterns1` and `patterns2` respectively, and assuming `p1` and `p2` refer to specific elements from these lists, the dictionary `mapping` will have a new key-value pair added.

Given that the initial state includes `patterns1` and `patterns2` as lists with at least one element each, the output state will include the updated dictionary `mapping` with the new key-value pair, while the lists `patterns1` and `patterns2` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`patterns1` and `patterns2` are lists with at least one element each; `mapping` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair (specifically, mapping[p1] = p2)**
