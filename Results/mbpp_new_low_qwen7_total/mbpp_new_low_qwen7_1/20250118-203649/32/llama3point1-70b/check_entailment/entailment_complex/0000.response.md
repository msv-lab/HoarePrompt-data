Reasoning: 
The provided function `func_1` correctly checks if the sequences in `patterns1` and `patterns2` follow the same pattern. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Length Check**: The function first checks if the lengths of `patterns1` and `patterns2` are equal. If not, it immediately returns `False`. This handles one edge case where the sequences cannot follow the same pattern because they have different numbers of elements.

2. **Mapping Creation and Validation**: A dictionary `mapping` is used to map elements from `patterns1` to `patterns2`. As it iterates through each pair `(p1, p2)` using `zip`, it checks if `p1` is already in `mapping`. 
   - If `p1` is not in `mapping`, it adds an entry with `p1` mapped to `p2`.
   - If `p1` is already in `mapping`, it checks if the stored value in `mapping` matches `p2`. If not, it returns `False` because the pattern is inconsistent.

3. **Completion Check**: After the loop completes, if no inconsistencies were found, the function returns `True`.

This logic ensures that each element in `patterns1` has a unique corresponding element in `patterns2` and that these correspondences are consistent. Therefore, the function works as intended.

Given the problem statement and the provided execution states, the function behaves correctly.

Correctness: **True**
