### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the problem and the function to ensure the analysis is correct:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to check whether the sequences in `patterns1` and `patterns2` follow the same pattern. Based on the provided function summary, the function `func_1` indeed verifies if there is a one-to-one correspondence between elements of `patterns1` and `patterns2`.

2. **Function Behavior**:
   - The function first checks if the lengths of `patterns1` and `patterns2` are equal. If they are not, it returns `False`.
   - If the lengths are equal, it uses a dictionary (`mapping`) to keep track of the correspondences between elements in `patterns1` and `patterns2`.
   - For each pair `(p1, p2)` in `zip(patterns1, patterns2)`, it checks if `p1` is already in the `mapping` dictionary. If it is not, it stores the corresponding `p2` in the dictionary. If it is already in the dictionary, it checks if the stored value matches `p2`. If any inconsistency is found, it returns `False`.
   - If no inconsistencies are found after processing all pairs, it returns `True`.

3. **Function Summary Validation**:
   - The function summary accurately describes the behavior of the function, including handling different lengths and maintaining consistency in mappings.

4. **Edge Cases and Functionality**:
   - The function correctly handles the case where the lengths of `patterns1` and `patterns2` are unequal.
   - The function correctly handles the case where there are duplicate elements in `patterns1` and ensures that their corresponding elements in `patterns2` are consistent.
   - No missing functionalities are identified, as the function correctly implements the described behavior.

Given the detailed breakdown, the original assessment correctly identifies the function's behavior and its alignment with the problem description. The function indeed checks for a one-to-one correspondence and ensures consistency in mappings, which is the primary requirement stated in the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
