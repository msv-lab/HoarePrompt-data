Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies the core functionality and edge cases of the function `func_1`. Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Problem Description and Functionality**:
   - The problem requires checking whether the sequences in `patterns1` and `patterns2` follow the same pattern.
   - The function `func_1` does this by creating a mapping from elements in `patterns1` to elements in `patterns2` and ensuring that the mapping is consistent throughout the sequences.

2. **Function Summary Analysis**:
   - The function summary accurately describes the steps taken in the function:
     - It first checks if the lengths of `patterns1` and `patterns2` are equal.
     - It then creates a dictionary `mapping` to store the correspondences between elements.
     - For each pair of elements, it checks if the current element in `patterns1` is already in the `mapping` dictionary.
     - If not, it adds the element to the dictionary.
     - If it is already in the dictionary, it checks if the stored value matches the current element from `patterns2`.
     - If any inconsistency is found, it returns `False`.
     - If no inconsistencies are found after processing all pairs, it returns `True`.

3. **Edge Cases and Missing Functionality**:
   - The function correctly handles the case where the lengths of `patterns1` and `patterns2` are unequal, returning `False`.
   - It also correctly handles the case where there are duplicate elements in `patterns1` and ensures that their corresponding elements in `patterns2` are consistent.
   - There are no missing functionalities as the code correctly implements the described behavior.

4. **Verification Based on Function Summary**:
   - The function summary aligns perfectly with the provided function code, indicating that the implementation meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
   - No edge cases or situations are identified that would cause the function to fail based on the logic provided.

Given the thorough analysis and the alignment between the problem description, the function code, and the function summary, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
