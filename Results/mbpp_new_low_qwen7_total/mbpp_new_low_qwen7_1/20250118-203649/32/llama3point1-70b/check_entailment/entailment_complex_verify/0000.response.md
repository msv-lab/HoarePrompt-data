Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem description, the program code, and the annotated version step-by-step.

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a function to check whether the sequences represented by `patterns1` and `patterns2` follow the same sequence. This implies that for each element in `patterns1`, there should be a corresponding element in `patterns2` following the same order.

2. **Program Code**:
   ```python
   def func_1(patterns1, patterns2):
       if len(patterns1) != len(patterns2):
           return False
       mapping = {}
       for (p1, p2) in zip(patterns1, patterns2):
           if p1 not in mapping:
               mapping[p1] = p2
           elif mapping[p1] != p2:
               return False
       return True
   ```

3. **Annotated Code**:
   - The function checks if the lengths of `patterns1` and `patterns2` are equal. If not, it returns `False`.
   - It then creates a dictionary `mapping` to store the correspondences between elements of `patterns1` and `patterns2`.
   - It iterates through each pair of elements from `patterns1` and `patterns2`.
     - If the element in `patterns1` (`p1`) is not in the `mapping`, it adds it with the corresponding element from `patterns2` (`p2`).
     - If `p1` is already in `mapping` and the value in `mapping` does not match `p2`, it returns `False`.
   - If no mismatches are found, it returns `True`.

4. **Evaluation Based on Annotations**:
   - The function correctly handles the case where the lengths of `patterns1` and `patterns2` are different.
   - It correctly maps elements from `patterns1` to `patterns2` and checks for consistency.
   - The function ensures that for each unique element in `patterns1`, its corresponding element in `patterns2` is consistent. If any inconsistency is found, it returns `False`.
   - The logic in the for-loop ensures that the sequence is followed correctly, but it does not guarantee that the sequences are strictly identical (i.e., one-to-one mapping is maintained throughout).

However, the problem description specifies "check whether it follows the sequence given in the patterns array," which implies that the sequences should be strictly identical, not just have a one-to-one mapping of elements.

5. **Edge Cases and Missing Functionality**:
   - The current implementation correctly identifies mismatches when the lengths differ or when the order of elements does not follow consistently.
   - However, the function does not handle the case where the sequences are strictly identical. For example, if `patterns1 = ['A', 'B', 'C']` and `patterns2 = ['A', 'B', 'C']`, the function should return `True`, but it doesn't explicitly ensure that the sequences are identical.

Based on the above analysis, while the function correctly identifies mismatches in terms of lengths and element order, it does not ensure that the sequences are strictly identical, which is a requirement implied by the problem description.

Final: **False**
