### Reasoning:

The provided function `func_1` is intended to check if two sequences (`patterns1` and `patterns2`) follow the same pattern. Based on the problem description, the function needs to ensure that each element in `patterns1` has a corresponding element in `patterns2` such that the sequence defined by `patterns1` is followed by `patterns2`.

Let's analyze the function step-by-step using the annotated code:

1. **Initial Check for Lengths:**
   ```python
   if len(patterns1) != len(patterns2):
       return False
   ```
   - This checks if the lengths of `patterns1` and `patterns2` are the same. If not, it returns `False` immediately. This ensures that the function only proceeds if the sequences have the same length, which is a necessary condition for meaningful comparison.

2. **Mapping Construction:**
   ```python
   mapping = {}
   for (p1, p2) in zip(patterns1, patterns2):
       if p1 not in mapping:
           mapping[p1] = p2
       elif mapping[p1] != p2:
           return False
   ```
   - A dictionary `mapping` is used to store the mapping from elements of `patterns1` to elements of `patterns2`.
   - For each pair `(p1, p2)` from the sequences:
     - If `p1` is not in the dictionary, it is added with `p2` as its value.
     - If `p1` is already in the dictionary and its value does not match `p2`, the function returns `False`.

3. **Return Statement:**
   ```python
   return True
   ```
   - If the loop completes without returning `False`, the function returns `True`, indicating that all elements in `patterns1` have consistent corresponding elements in `patterns2`.

Given the annotated code and the problem description, the function correctly checks for a one-to-one correspondence between the elements of `patterns1` and `patterns2` while ensuring consistency. The logic is sound and aligns with the requirement to check if `patterns2` follows the sequence given in `patterns1`.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the function checks for a one-to-one correspondence and ensures consistency in mappings. Since the function meets the requirements specified in the problem description and the annotated code validates its behavior, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
