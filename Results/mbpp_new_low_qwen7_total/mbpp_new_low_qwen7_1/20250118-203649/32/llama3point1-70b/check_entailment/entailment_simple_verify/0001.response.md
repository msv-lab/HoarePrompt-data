### Reasoning:

The provided function `func_1` is designed to check if two sequences (`patterns1` and `patterns2`) follow the same pattern. Based on the given annotated code and the original assessment, the function indeed verifies a one-to-one correspondence between elements of `patterns1` and `patterns2`. The function uses a dictionary to keep track of the mapping from elements of `patterns1` to elements of `patterns2`. If any element in `patterns1` maps to a different element in `patterns2` than previously recorded, the function returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any inconsistencies, the function returns `True`.

Upon closer examination, the annotated code provides a detailed explanation of the function's behavior. The function checks for the following:
1. Ensures the lengths of `patterns1` and `patterns2` are equal.
2. Creates a dictionary to map elements of `patterns1` to elements of `patterns2`.
3. Iterates through each pair of elements in `patterns1` and `patterns2`, updating the dictionary and checking for consistency.
4. Returns `True` only if all elements in `patterns1` map consistently to elements in `patterns2`.

Given the problem description and the annotated code, the function correctly implements the requirement to ensure a consistent one-to-one correspondence between the elements of the two sequences.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The function accurately implements the requirement to check if there is a consistent one-to-one correspondence between the elements of the two sequences, which aligns with the problem's intent.
