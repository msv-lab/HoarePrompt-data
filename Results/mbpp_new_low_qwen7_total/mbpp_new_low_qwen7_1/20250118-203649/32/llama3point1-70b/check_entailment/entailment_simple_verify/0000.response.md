Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` meets the problem requirements. However, let's break down the logic step-by-step using the annotated version to ensure there are no hidden issues.

1. **Length Check**: The function starts by checking if the lengths of `patterns1` and `patterns2` are equal. If not, it returns `False`. This part is correct and essential to handle mismatched lengths.

2. **Mapping Creation**: A dictionary `mapping` is used to store the mapping of elements from `patterns1` to `patterns2`. For each pair `(p1, p2)` in `zip(patterns1, patterns2)`:
   - If `p1` is not in the dictionary, it is added with the corresponding value `p2`.
   - If `p1` is already in the dictionary, it checks if the current `p2` matches the stored value. If not, it returns `False`.

3. **Termination**: If the loop completes without returning `False`, the function returns `True`, indicating that all elements in `patterns1` and `patterns2` match according to the rules defined.

The logic seems sound and the annotations confirm that the function correctly handles all cases described:
- Length mismatch is handled by returning `False`.
- Each element in `patterns1` is mapped to the corresponding element in `patterns2`, ensuring consistency.
- Early termination occurs if any mismatch is found.

Given this analysis, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
