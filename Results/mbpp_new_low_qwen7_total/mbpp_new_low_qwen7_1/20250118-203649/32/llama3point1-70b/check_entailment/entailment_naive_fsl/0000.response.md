Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks if two arrays (`patterns1` and `patterns2`) follow the same sequence. It uses a dictionary to map elements from `patterns1` to `patterns2`. If it finds any mismatch, it returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True` if all elements match the mapping. The function correctly handles the case where the lengths of the two arrays are different by immediately returning `False` if they are not equal.

Given the problem description and the logic implemented, the function appears to meet the requirements for all potential cases. There is no evident edge case or situation where the function would fail to work as expected based on the provided logic.
