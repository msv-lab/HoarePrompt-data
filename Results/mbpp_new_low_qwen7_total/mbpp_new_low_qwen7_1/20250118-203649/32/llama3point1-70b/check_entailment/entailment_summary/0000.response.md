Reasoning:
The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` checks if the sequences in `patterns1` and `patterns2` follow a consistent pattern, ensuring that each element in `patterns1` maps uniquely to an element in `patterns2`. The execution summary accurately describes the behavior of the function, including handling cases where the lengths of the input lists are unequal and ensuring consistency in mappings.

Given this analysis, the program correctly implements the required functionality without any identified issues.

Correctness: **True**
