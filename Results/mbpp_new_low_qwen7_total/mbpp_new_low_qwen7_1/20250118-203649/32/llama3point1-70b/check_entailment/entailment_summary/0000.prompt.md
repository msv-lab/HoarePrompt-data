Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Write a function to check whether it follows the sequence given in the patterns array.

# Program:
def func_1(patterns1, patterns2):
    if len(patterns1) != len(patterns2):
        return False
    mapping = {}
    for (p1, p2) in zip(patterns1, patterns2):
        if p1 not in mapping:
            mapping[p1] = p2
        elif mapping[p1] != p2:
            return False
    return True





# Execution Summary:
The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `patterns1` and `patterns2`, both being lists of strings representing sequences. The function checks if the lengths of `patterns1` and `patterns2` are equal. If they are not, it returns `False`.

If the lengths are equal, it proceeds to create a dictionary `mapping` to store the correspondences between elements in `patterns1` and `patterns2`. It iterates through each pair of elements from `patterns1` and `patterns2`. For each pair, it checks if the current element in `patterns1` (`p1`) is already in the `mapping` dictionary. If it is not, it stores the corresponding element from `patterns2` (`p2`) in the `mapping` dictionary. If it is already in the `mapping` dictionary, it checks if the stored value matches the current element from `patterns2`. If they do not match, it returns `False`.

After iterating through all pairs, if no conflicts are found, the function returns `True`. This indicates that for every element in `patterns1`, there is a unique corresponding element in `patterns2` according to the `mapping` dictionary.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function correctly handles the case where the lengths of `patterns1` and `patterns2` are unequal, returning `False`.
- The function correctly handles the case where there are duplicate elements in `patterns1` and ensures that their corresponding elements in `patterns2` are consistent. If any inconsistency is found, it returns `False`.
- There are no missing functionalities as the code correctly implements the described behavior.
