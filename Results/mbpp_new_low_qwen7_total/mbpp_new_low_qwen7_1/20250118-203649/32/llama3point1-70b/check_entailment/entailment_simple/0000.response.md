Reasoning: 
The provided function `func_1` aims to check if two lists of strings (`patterns1` and `patterns2`) follow the same sequence. It does this by ensuring that for each pair of elements `(p1, p2)` from the two lists, `p2` matches the previously mapped value for `p1` (stored in the `mapping` dictionary). Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Length Check**: The function first checks if the lengths of `patterns1` and `patterns2` are equal. If not, it immediately returns `False`.

2. **Mapping Creation**: For each pair `(p1, p2)` from the two lists, the function updates the `mapping` dictionary:
   - If `p1` is not already in the `mapping`, it maps `p1` to `p2`.
   - If `p1` is already in the `mapping`, it checks if the current `p2` matches the previously mapped value for `p1`. If not, it returns `False`.

3. **Completion**: If the loop completes without finding any contradictions, the function returns `True`.

This logic ensures that the function correctly checks if the sequences represented by `patterns1` and `patterns2` follow the same pattern, without any contradictions. Given the description and the steps outlined, the provided function meets the requirements specified in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
