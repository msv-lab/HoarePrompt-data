Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Write a function to check whether it follows the sequence given in the patterns array.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: patterns1 and patterns2 are lists of strings representing sequences.
def func_1(patterns1, patterns2):
    if (len(patterns1) != len(patterns2)) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: patterns1 and patterns2 are lists of strings representing sequences, and the length of patterns1 is equal to the length of patterns2
    mapping = {}
    for (p1, p2) in zip(patterns1, patterns2):
        if p1 not in mapping:
            mapping[p1] = p2
        elif mapping[p1] != p2:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: `patterns1` and `patterns2` are lists of strings with the same length. The `mapping` dictionary is populated such that for every pair `(p1, p2)` where `p1` is in `patterns1` and `p2` is in `patterns2`, if `p1` is not already in `mapping`, then `mapping[p1]` will be set to `p2`. If `p1` is already in `mapping` and `mapping[p1]` is not equal to `p2`, the function returns `False`. If `p1` is already in `mapping` and `mapping[p1]` is equal to `p2`, the function does nothing and continues to the next iteration. If the loop completes without returning `False`, it means that either there were no conflicting pairs `(p1, p2)` or the function never encountered such pairs due to early termination.
    #
    #In summary, the loop ensures that if a string in `patterns1` appears more than once, the corresponding values in `patterns2` for subsequent occurrences must match the value stored in `mapping` for the first occurrence of that string. If this condition is violated at any point, the function returns `False`. If the loop completes without returning `False`, the `mapping` dictionary is fully populated with the required correspondences between `patterns1` and `patterns2`, provided no contradictions arise.
    return True
    #The program returns True
