### Reasoning:

The provided function `func_1` is intended to check if two sequences (`patterns1` and `patterns2`) follow the same pattern. However, the problem description is not entirely clear, but we can infer that the function should verify if each element in `patterns1` has a consistent corresponding element in `patterns2` according to some predefined rules or sequence. 

Given the current implementation of `func_1`, it checks for one-to-one correspondence between elements of `patterns1` and `patterns2`. Specifically, it creates a mapping from elements of `patterns1` to elements of `patterns2` and ensures that this mapping remains consistent throughout both sequences. If at any point, an element in `patterns1` does not map to the corresponding element in `patterns2`, it returns `False`.

The logic in the function seems to be checking for a one-to-one correspondence and ensuring consistency in mappings. Given that no additional constraints or specific pattern rules beyond simple one-to-one correspondence are mentioned in the problem description, this implementation appears to be correct for the described task.

### Correctness:
**True**

The function correctly implements the requirement to check if there is a consistent one-to-one correspondence between the elements of the two sequences, which aligns with the problem's intent.
