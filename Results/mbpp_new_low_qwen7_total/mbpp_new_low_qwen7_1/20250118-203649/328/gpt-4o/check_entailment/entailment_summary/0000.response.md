Reasoning:
The provided code defines a function `func_1` that aims to find the nth polite number. A polite number is defined as a positive integer that can be written as the sum of two or more consecutive positive integers. However, the given implementation does not correctly identify polite numbers. Instead, it attempts to find numbers that are not powers of 2, which is a different concept. 

To determine correctness, we need to check if the function correctly implements the logic for finding the nth polite number according to the definition.

- The function uses a bit manipulation condition `if number & number - 1 != 0:` to check if a number is not a power of 2. This is correct.
- However, the function's logic to count non-powers of 2 and return the nth such number does not align with the requirement to find the nth polite number.

Given the problem statement and the provided test cases, the function should instead find the nth number that can be expressed as the sum of two or more consecutive positive integers.

Since the provided implementation does not correctly solve the problem as stated, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
