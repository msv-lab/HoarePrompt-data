### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code step-by-step and compare it with the definition of a polite number.

1. **Definition of a Polite Number**:
   - A polite number is a positive integer that can be expressed as the sum of two or more consecutive positive integers.

2. **Current Implementation**:
   - The function `func_1` uses a bitwise operation to check if a number is not a power of 2. Specifically, it checks if `number & (number - 1) != 0`. This operation determines if the number has multiple bits set in its binary representation, indicating that it is not a power of 2.
   - The function then increments a counter `count` for each non-power-of-2 number found, and it continues until `count` reaches `n`.
   - Finally, it returns `number - 1`, which is the last non-power-of-2 number encountered.

3. **Problem with the Current Implementation**:
   - As noted in the original assessment, simply checking if a number is not a power of 2 is insufficient to determine if it is a polite number. For example, the number 8 (which is \(2^3\)) is not a polite number because it cannot be expressed as the sum of two or more consecutive positive integers. However, the current implementation would incorrectly classify 8 as a polite number because it is not a power of 2.

4. **Example Verification**:
   - Let's verify the assertions provided:
     - `func_1(7)` should return 11, but 11 is a polite number (11 = 5 + 6).
     - `func_1(4)` should return 7, but 7 is a polite number (7 = 3 + 4).
     - `func_1(9)` should return 13, but 13 is a polite number (13 = 6 + 7).

   These examples show that the function is returning numbers that are not necessarily polite.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The original assessment is accurate. The current implementation does not correctly identify polite numbers and instead relies on a flawed heuristic that only checks for non-power-of-2 numbers.

### Final Evaluation:

**Final: False**

The given program is incorrect as it does not accurately determine if a number is a polite number based on the provided definition.
