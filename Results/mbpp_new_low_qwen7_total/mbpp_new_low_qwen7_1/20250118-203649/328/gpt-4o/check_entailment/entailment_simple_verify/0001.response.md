### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided code.

#### Problem Description:
We need to find the \(n\)-th polite number. A polite number is defined as a positive integer that can be expressed as the sum of two or more consecutive positive integers. For instance, 5 is a polite number because it can be written as \(2 + 3\).

#### Provided Code Analysis:
The code iterates through positive integers and uses a bitwise operation to check if a number is a power of 2. Specifically, it checks if `number & (number - 1) != 0`. This condition is true for non-power-of-two numbers, but it does not correctly identify polite numbers.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the provided code:
1. Initialize `count` to 0 and `number` to 1.
2. Loop until `count` reaches `n`.
   - Check if `number` is not a power of 2 using the condition `number & (number - 1) != 0`.
   - If true, increment `count`.
   - Increment `number` by 1.
3. Return `number - 1`.

#### Annotated Code Analysis:
- The assertions provided are:
  - `func_1(7) == 11` (Expected: 15)
  - `func_1(4) == 7` (Expected: 8)
  - `func_1(9) == 13` (Expected: 18)

Based on the annotated code, the function correctly follows the logic of iterating through numbers and counting non-powers-of-two numbers. However, the core issue lies in the misunderstanding of the definition of polite numbers.

The assertion-based verification shows that the function returns incorrect results. The function should be designed to count numbers with an odd number of divisors, which is the characteristic of polite numbers.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The provided code does not accurately implement the logic to find polite numbers. It mistakenly counts non-powers-of-two numbers instead of focusing on numbers with an odd number of divisors.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
