Reasoning:
- The problem requires finding the nth polite number. A polite number is defined as a positive integer that can be written as the sum of two or more consecutive positive integers.
- The given function `func_1` aims to find the nth polite number but instead appears to implement a different logic that counts numbers which are not powers of 2. This logic is flawed because:
  - It increments a counter `count` for numbers that are not powers of 2.
  - It returns `number - 1` when the count reaches `n`.
  - This approach incorrectly identifies polite numbers, as it does not consider the actual definition of polite numbers.

To correctly identify the nth polite number, the function should:
- Count numbers that can be expressed as the sum of two or more consecutive positive integers.
- Return the nth such number.

Given the provided test cases and the logic of the function, the function does not correctly implement the solution for finding polite numbers.

Correctness: **False**
