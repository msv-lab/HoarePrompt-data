Reasoning:

The original assessment incorrectly identifies the approach used in the function `func_1` as incorrect. Let's analyze the function based on the provided function summary and the problem description.

### Problem Description
A polite number is defined as a positive integer that can be written as the sum of two or more consecutive positive integers. The task is to find the n-th polite number.

### Function Summary
- The function `func_1` starts iterating from 1 and checks each number to see if it is a power of 2 (since numbers that are powers of 2 cannot be expressed as the sum of two or more consecutive positive integers).
- It increments a counter `count` each time it finds a number that is not a power of 2.
- Once `count` reaches `n`, the function returns the last number checked minus 1.

### Analysis
The function correctly identifies that numbers which are powers of 2 are not polite numbers. This is because a number \(2^k\) cannot be expressed as the sum of two or more consecutive positive integers. Therefore, the function's logic of incrementing `count` each time it encounters a number that is not a power of 2 is fundamentally sound.

Given the provided assertions:
- `func_1(7) == 11`: The 7th polite number is indeed 11 (sequence: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, ... skipping 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc.)
- `func_1(4) == 7`: The 4th polite number is indeed 7 (sequence: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, ... skipping 1, 2, 4, 8)
- `func_1(9) == 13`: The 9th polite number is indeed 13 (sequence: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, ... skipping 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, etc.)

The function correctly implements the logic to find the n-th polite number by skipping powers of 2.

### Conclusion
The original assessment incorrectly identified the function's logic as incorrect. Based on the provided assertions and the function summary, the function appears to be correct.

Final: **True**
