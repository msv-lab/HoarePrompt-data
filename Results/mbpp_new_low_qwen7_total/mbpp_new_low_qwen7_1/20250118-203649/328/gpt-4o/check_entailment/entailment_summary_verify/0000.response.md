Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem description, the provided program, and the function summary to determine the correctness of the given program.

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to find the nth polite number. A polite number is defined as a positive integer that can be expressed as the sum of two or more consecutive positive integers.

2. **Function Summary**: The function `func_1` iterates through numbers starting from 1, increments a counter when it encounters a number that is not a power of 2 (i.e., `number & (number - 1) != 0`), and returns the number after `n` such non-power-of-two numbers are found.

3. **Program Code**:
   ```python
   def func_1(n):
       count = 0
       number = 1
       while count < n:
           if number & number - 1 != 0:
               count += 1
           number += 1
       return number - 1
   ```

### Evaluation

- **Function Summary Analysis**:
  - The summary states that the function increments a counter for each number that is not a power of 2.
  - It then returns the number after `n` such numbers are found.
  - This approach is incorrect because it does not check if a number can be expressed as the sum of two or more consecutive positive integers.

- **Bitwise Operation**:
  - The condition `number & (number - 1) != 0` checks if a number is not a power of 2. This is correct for identifying non-powers of 2 but does not verify if a number is polite.

- **Example Analysis**:
  - Consider the number 8. The bitwise operation will correctly identify 8 as not a power of 2, but 8 is indeed a polite number (sum of 3, 4, and 5).
  - Another example, the number 9, is a power of 2 (2^3), and the program will skip it, which is correct for finding non-powers of 2, but 9 is also a polite number (sum of 4, 5).

### Correctness Check with Provided Assertions

- `func_1(7) == 11`: 11 is not a power of 2, and it is a polite number (sum of 5, 6).
- `func_1(4) == 7`: 7 is not a power of 2, and it is a polite number (sum of 3, 4).
- `func_1(9) == 13`: 13 is not a power of 2, and it is a polite number (sum of 6, 7).

These examples suggest that the program might be working correctly in terms of identifying non-powers of 2, but it does not verify if these numbers are polite.

### Conclusion

The original assessment is accurate. The program checks for non-powers of 2 but does not verify if these numbers are polite. Therefore, the final evaluation should be:

Final: **False**
