Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, let's first understand what a polite number is. A polite number is a positive integer that can be written as the sum of two or more consecutive positive integers. For example, 5 is a polite number because it can be written as 2 + 3. The task is to find the n-th polite number.

The provided code iterates through positive integers and checks if a number is polite by verifying that it is not a power of 2 (since numbers that are powers of 2 cannot be expressed as the sum of two or more consecutive positive integers). The code increments a counter `count` each time a polite number is found until the `n`-th polite number is reached. However, this approach is incorrect for finding polite numbers.

Instead of checking if a number is not a power of 2, we should check if the number has an odd number of divisors, which characterizes polite numbers. The correct way to determine if a number is polite involves counting its divisors.

Given the assertions provided, let's manually verify the outputs:
- The 7th polite number is actually 15, not 11.
- The 4th polite number is 8, not 7.
- The 9th polite number is 18, not 13.

These results do not match the expected polite numbers, indicating that the logic in the function is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
