Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Write a function to find nth polite number. geeksforgeeks.org/n-th-polite-number/

# Program:
assert func_1(7) == 11
assert func_1(4) == 7
assert func_1(9) == 13

def func_1(n):
    count = 0
    number = 1
    while count < n:
        if number & number - 1 != 0:
            count += 1
        number += 1
    return number - 1



# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
