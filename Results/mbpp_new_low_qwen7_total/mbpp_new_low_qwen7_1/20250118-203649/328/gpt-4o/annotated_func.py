#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    count = 0

number = 1
    while count < n:
        if number & number - 1 != 0:
            count += 1
        
        number += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: n = positive integer, count = n, number = n + 1.
    return number - 1
    #The program returns number - 1, where number is n + 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` as a parameter and iterates through numbers starting from 1 until it finds `n` consecutive numbers where each number is a power of 2 (i.e., numbers whose binary representation contains only one '1'). For each such number found, the counter `count` is incremented. Once `n` such numbers are found, the function returns the last number that was checked minus 1. If no such numbers are found (which should not happen given the problem constraints), the function still follows the same logic. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it returns `number - 1`, where `number` is the first number that did not meet the criteria of being a power of 2 after `n` valid numbers were found.
