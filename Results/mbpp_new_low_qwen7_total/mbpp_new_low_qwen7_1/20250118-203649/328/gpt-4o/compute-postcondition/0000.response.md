Initial State: n is a positive integer.
```
```python
count = 0
number = 1
```

The code block simply initializes two variables, `count` and `number`, both to 0 and 1 respectively. It does not perform any operations that modify these or any other variables.

Output State: **n is a positive integer, count is 0, number is 1**
