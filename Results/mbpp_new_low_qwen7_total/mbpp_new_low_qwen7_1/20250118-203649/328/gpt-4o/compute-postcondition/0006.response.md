The loop condition is `count < n`. For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `count < n` must be true at the start of the next iteration. Given that `count` is currently 0 and `n` is a positive integer, we need to ensure that `count` is incremented to 1 before the next iteration.

To achieve this, `count` should be incremented by 1. Since the loop head only involves `count` and `n`, and we know `n` is a positive integer, we don't need to adjust `n`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `count` is 1**
