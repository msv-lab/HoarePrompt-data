Postcondition: ***`count` is 2, `n` is greater than 2.*** 

Explanation: Given the if condition `number & number - 1 != 0`, the if part does not change the values of `count` and `n`. Since the precondition already states that `count` must be 1 and `n` must be greater than 2, and the if part sets `count` to 2 without altering `n`, the overall postcondition remains that `count` is 2 and `n` is greater than 2. There is no else part in the code, so no additional conditions are introduced.
