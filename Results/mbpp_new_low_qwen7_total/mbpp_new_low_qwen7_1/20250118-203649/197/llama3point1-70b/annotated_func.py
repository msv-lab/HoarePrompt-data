#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup is a tuple, and lst is a list.
def func_1(tup, lst):
    return sum(tup.count(element) for element in lst)
    #The program returns the sum of counts of each element in `lst` that appear in the tuple `tup`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `tup` (a tuple) and `lst` (a list). It calculates and returns the sum of counts of each element in `lst` that also appear in `tup`. If an element in `lst` does not exist in `tup`, its count is considered as 0. Edge cases include when either `tup` or `lst` is empty; in such cases, the function returns 0. Additionally, if `lst` contains elements that are not hashable (e.g., lists or dictionaries), these elements will not be counted since `tup.count()` only works with hashable types.
