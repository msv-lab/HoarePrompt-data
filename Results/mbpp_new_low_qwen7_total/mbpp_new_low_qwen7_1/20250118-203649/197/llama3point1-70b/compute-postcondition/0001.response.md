The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `tup` and `lst`. `tup` is a tuple, and `lst` is a list. The function returns the sum of counts of each element in `lst` that appear in the tuple `tup`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a tuple `tup` and a list `lst`, and return the sum of counts of each element in `lst` that appear in `tup`.
