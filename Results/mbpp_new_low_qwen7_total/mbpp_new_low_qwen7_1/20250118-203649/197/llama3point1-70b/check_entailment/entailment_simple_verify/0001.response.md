### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` aims to count the occurrences of each element from a list within a tuple and return the total count. Let's break down the function and verify its correctness step-by-step using the provided annotations:

1. **Function Signature**: The function takes two parameters, `tup` (a tuple) and `lst` (a list).
2. **Comprehension**: A generator expression `(tup.count(element) for element in lst)` is used to iterate over each element in the list `lst`. For each element, it counts how many times that element appears in the tuple `tup`.
3. **Sum Function**: The `sum()` function is used to add up all the counts returned by the generator expression.
4. **Return Value**: The function returns the total count of occurrences of all elements in the list within the tuple.

#### Analysis of the Code:
- The generator expression `(tup.count(element) for element in lst)` correctly iterates through each element in `lst` and uses the `count` method to find the number of occurrences of that element in `tup`.
- The `sum()` function then adds up all these counts, providing the total count of occurrences.

#### Edge Cases:
- **Empty Tuple or List**: If `tup` is empty, `tup.count(element)` will always return 0 for any `element` in `lst`, and `sum(0 for _ in lst)` will return 0. Similarly, if `lst` is empty, the generator expression will be empty, and `sum([])` will also return 0.
- **Element Not in Tuple**: If an element in `lst` does not exist in `tup`, `tup.count(element)` will return 0, which is correctly handled by the `sum()` function.

#### Annotations Verification:
- The annotation correctly describes the behavior of the generator expression and the sum function.
- The explanation about handling edge cases is accurate.

Given that the function correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all edge cases properly, the original assessment is accurate.

### Conclusion:
The function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrences of all elements of a list in a tuple.

**Final:** **True**
