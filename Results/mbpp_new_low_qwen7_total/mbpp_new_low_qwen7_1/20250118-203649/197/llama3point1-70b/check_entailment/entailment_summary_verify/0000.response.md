### Reasoning

Let's analyze the given problem description, the provided function `func_1`, and the function summary.

#### Problem Description:
- Write a Python function to count the occurrence of all elements of a list in a tuple.

#### Program Code:
```python
def func_1(tup, lst):
    return sum((tup.count(element) for element in lst))
```

#### Function Summary:
- The function `func_1` calculates and returns the sum of counts of each element in `lst` that also appears in `tup`.
- If an element in `lst` does not exist in `tup`, its count is considered as 0.
- Edge cases include when either `tup` or `lst` is empty; in such cases, the function returns 0.
- The function handles non-hashable elements in `lst` by ignoring them, as `tup.count()` only works with hashable types.

#### Original Assessment:
- Correctness: **False**
- Explanation: The function will return the total count of all occurrences combined, not the count for each individual element in `lst`. A corrected version should return a dictionary with the count of each element.

#### Analysis:
- The provided function indeed sums up the counts of all occurrences of elements from `lst` within `tup`.
- The function summary correctly describes the behavior of the function, including handling of non-hashable elements and edge cases.
- The function meets the requirement of counting the occurrences of elements from `lst` in `tup`.

#### Validation:
- The original assessment incorrectly states that the function sums up the counts instead of returning a dictionary. The function actually does what the problem description requires, which is to count the occurrences of each element in `lst` within `tup`.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **True**

The given program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement, and the original assessment was inaccurate.
