### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` aims to count the occurrences of each element from a list within a tuple and return the total count. The provided function summary also accurately describes the behavior of the function, including handling edge cases such as empty inputs and non-hashable elements in the list.

However, upon closer inspection, the function has a critical flaw: it does not handle non-hashable elements in the list `lst` properly. The summary mentions that the function should not count elements that are not hashable, but this is not reflected in the code itself. The `tup.count(element)` method will raise a `TypeError` if `element` is not hashable, such as a list or a dictionary.

To illustrate this, consider the following example:
```python
tup = (1, 2, 3)
lst = [1, 2, [3]]  # Note that [3] is not hashable
print(func_1(tup, lst))  # This will raise a TypeError
```

Since the function does not account for non-hashable elements in the list, it will fail for such inputs. Therefore, the function is not correct as stated, and the original assessment needs to be challenged.

### Conclusion:
The function `func_1` fails to handle non-hashable elements in the list `lst` correctly, leading to potential `TypeError` exceptions. Hence, the function is not fully correct.

**Correctness:** **False**

### Final:
Final: **False**
