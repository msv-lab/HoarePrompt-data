Reasoning:
- The function `func_1` takes a tuple `tup` and a list `lst` as input.
- It uses a generator expression inside the `sum` function to iterate over each element in `lst`.
- For each element in `lst`, it counts how many times that element appears in `tup` using `tup.count(element)`.
- The `sum` function then adds up all these counts.
- This approach correctly counts the occurrences of elements from `lst` that are present in `tup`.

This logic aligns with the problem statement which asks to count the occurrence of all elements of a list in a tuple. The implementation handles edge cases where elements in `lst` might not be present in `tup` and treats them as zero occurrences. The use of `tup.count(element)` is appropriate since tuples can only contain hashable elements, which matches the expected behavior.

Correctness: **True**
