### Reasoning:
The given program aims to count the occurrences of all elements in the list `lst` within the tuple `tup`. The function `func_1` uses a generator expression to iterate over each element in `lst` and count its occurrences in `tup` using the `count` method. The results of these counts are summed up using the `sum` function.

Let's break down the steps:
1. The generator expression `(tup.count(element) for element in lst)` generates a sequence of counts for each element in `lst`.
2. The `sum` function then adds up all these counts.

Given this logic, the function correctly implements the required functionality. It does not have any logical errors based on the problem statement and the provided comments.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be correct according to the problem description and the provided execution states.

### Response:
Correctness: **True**
