### Reasoning:

The given function `func_1` aims to count the occurrences of each element from a list within a tuple and return the total count. Let's break down the function:

1. **Function Signature**: The function takes two parameters, `tup` (a tuple) and `lst` (a list).
2. **Comprehension**: A generator expression `(tup.count(element) for element in lst)` is used to iterate over each element in the list `lst`. For each element, it counts how many times that element appears in the tuple `tup`.
3. **Sum Function**: The `sum()` function is used to add up all the counts returned by the generator expression.
4. **Return Value**: The function returns the total count of occurrences of all elements in the list within the tuple.

This approach is generally correct and should work for valid inputs where `tup` is a tuple and `lst` is a list. However, we need to ensure that the function works as expected under all conditions, including edge cases.

### Edge Cases:
- If any element in `lst` does not exist in `tup`, `tup.count(element)` will return 0, which is correctly handled by the `sum()` function.
- If `tup` or `lst` are empty, the function will return 0, which is also correct because there are no elements to count.

Given that the function handles these cases correctly and follows the logic described in the problem statement, the function is correct.

### Conclusion:
The function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrences of all elements of a list in a tuple.

**Correctness:** **True**
