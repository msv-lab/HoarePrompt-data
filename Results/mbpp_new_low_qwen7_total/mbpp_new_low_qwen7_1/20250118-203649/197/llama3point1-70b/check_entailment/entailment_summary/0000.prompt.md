Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Write a python function to count the occurence of all elements of list in a tuple.

# Program:
def func_1(tup, lst):
    return sum((tup.count(element) for element in lst))





# Execution Summary:
The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `tup` (a tuple) and `lst` (a list). It calculates and returns the sum of counts of each element in `lst` that also appear in `tup`. If an element in `lst` does not exist in `tup`, its count is considered as 0. Edge cases include when either `tup` or `lst` is empty; in such cases, the function returns 0. Additionally, if `lst` contains elements that are not hashable (e.g., lists or dictionaries), these elements will not be counted since `tup.count()` only works with hashable types.


# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
