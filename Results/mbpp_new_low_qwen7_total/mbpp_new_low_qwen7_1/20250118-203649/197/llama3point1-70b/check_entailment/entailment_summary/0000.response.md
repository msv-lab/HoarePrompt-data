Reasoning:
The provided function `func_1` aims to count the occurrences of elements from `lst` within the `tup` and return their total count. The function uses a generator expression inside the `sum()` function to iterate over each element in `lst` and count its occurrences in `tup` using `tup.count(element)`.

Here's a breakdown of how it works:
- The generator expression `(tup.count(element) for element in lst)` generates the count of each element in `lst` that exists in `tup`.
- The `sum()` function then adds up these counts.
- If an element in `lst` does not exist in `tup`, `tup.count(element)` returns 0, which is correctly handled by the `sum()` function.

The execution summary mentions edge cases and considerations, such as handling empty tuples/lists and ensuring elements in `lst` are hashable. However, these points do not directly affect the correctness of the core functionality described in the problem statement. The function behaves as expected for the stated problem.

Given this analysis, the function appears to meet the requirements specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
