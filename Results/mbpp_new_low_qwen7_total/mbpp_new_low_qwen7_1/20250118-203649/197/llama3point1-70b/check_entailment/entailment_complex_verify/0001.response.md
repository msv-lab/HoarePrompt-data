### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and the annotated version to verify the correctness of the function `func_1`.

#### Function Breakdown:
1. **Function Signature**: The function takes two parameters, `tup` (a tuple) and `lst` (a list).
2. **Comprehension**: A generator expression `(tup.count(element) for element in lst)` iterates over each element in `lst` and counts how many times that element appears in `tup`.
3. **Sum Function**: The `sum()` function adds up all the counts returned by the generator expression.
4. **Return Value**: The function returns the total count of occurrences of all elements in the list within the tuple.

#### Edge Cases:
- If any element in `lst` does not exist in `tup`, `tup.count(element)` will return 0, which is correctly handled by the `sum()` function.
- If `tup` or `lst` are empty, the function will return 0, which is also correct because there are no elements to count.
- If `lst` contains elements that are not hashable (e.g., lists or dictionaries), these elements will not be counted since `tup.count()` only works with hashable types.

#### Analysis of the Annotations:
- The annotations correctly describe the function's behavior and edge cases.
- The function correctly handles the absence of elements in the tuple and the presence of non-hashable types in the list.

#### Validation Against the Original Assessment:
- The original assessment correctly identifies that the function works as intended for valid inputs.
- The edge cases mentioned in the original assessment are accurately described.
- The conclusion that the function is correct is accurate.

Based on the analysis, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
