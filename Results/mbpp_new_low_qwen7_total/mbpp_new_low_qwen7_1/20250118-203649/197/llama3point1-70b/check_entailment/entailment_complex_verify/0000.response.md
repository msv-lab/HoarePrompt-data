### Reasoning:

The original assessment incorrectly states that the function is incorrect and should be modified to return a dictionary with the count of each element. However, based on the problem description and the provided annotations, the function `func_1` actually behaves correctly.

- **Problem Description**: The task is to count the occurrence of all elements of a list (`lst`) in a tuple (`tup`).
- **Function Behavior**: The function `func_1` returns the sum of counts of each element in `lst` that appear in the tuple `tup`. If an element in `lst` does not exist in `tup`, its count is considered as 0.
- **Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases where either `tup` or `lst` is empty, returning 0 in such cases. It also correctly handles non-hashable elements in `lst`, as they won't be counted due to `tup.count()` only working with hashable types.

Given the problem statement and the annotated code, the function `func_1` is correctly implemented to achieve the desired result, which is to return the sum of counts of each element in `lst` that appear in `tup`. The function does not need to return a dictionary because the problem does not require it to do so. The function's behavior matches the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
