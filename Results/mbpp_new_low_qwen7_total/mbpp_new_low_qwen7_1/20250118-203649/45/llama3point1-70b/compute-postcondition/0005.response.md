Output State: **n is a string with a length greater than 1, i is 1, undulating is False, break is executed**

Explanation:
- The initial state includes `n` as a string with a length greater than 1, `i` as 1, and the condition `(n[i - 1] >= n[i] or n[i] >= n[i + 1])` holds true.
- The code snippet sets `undulating` to `False` and then executes the `break` statement.
- Since `break` is executed, it implies that this block is likely part of a loop, but the loop itself is not shown. However, based on the information provided, the only modifications to the variables are setting `undulating` to `False`.
- The `break` statement itself does not modify any variables but indicates the exit from a loop.
- Therefore, the final state retains the initial values of `n` and `i`, while introducing the new variable `undulating` set to `False` and noting that `break` has been executed.
