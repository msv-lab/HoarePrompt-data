Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head involves the variable `i`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `len(n) - 1`. This means `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `len(n) - 2`.

3. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is a string with a length greater than 1, and `i` is 2.

4. **Check if the loop can continue**: For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `len(n) - 1`. Given that `i` is currently 2, we need to check if `2 < len(n) - 1`. 

5. **Update the state for the next iteration**: If the condition `2 < len(n) - 1` is true, then the loop can continue. Therefore, we need to update `i` to 3 (the next value it would take in the next iteration).

Given these steps, we can conclude that the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is `i`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`n` is a string with a length greater than 1, `i` is 3**.
