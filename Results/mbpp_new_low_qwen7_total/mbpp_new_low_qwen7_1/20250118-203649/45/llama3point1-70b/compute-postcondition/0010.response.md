Postcondition: ***`n` is a string with a length greater than 1, `i` is 2. If the condition `n[i - 1] < n[i] and n[i] < n[i + 1]` or `n[i - 1] > n[i] and n[i] > n[i + 1]` is true, the program continues without any changes. Otherwise, `undulating` is set to False and the `break` statement is executed.***
