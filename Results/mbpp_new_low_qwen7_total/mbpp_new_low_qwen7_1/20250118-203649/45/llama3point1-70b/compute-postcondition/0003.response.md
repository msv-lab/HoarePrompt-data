The `pass` statement does nothing and simply acts as a placeholder. It does not assign any new values to variables or perform any operations that would change the state of the program. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a string with a length greater than 1, `i` is 1. The current value of `n[i-1]` is less than `n[i]` and `n[i]` is less than `n[i+1]` or the current value of `n[i-1]` is greater than `n[i]` and `n[i]` is greater than `n[i+1]`.**
