Output State: **n is a string with a length greater than 1, i is 3, undulating is False, break is a statement**

Explanation:
- The initial state is `n` is a string with a length greater than 1, and `i` is 3.
- The line `undulating = False` sets the variable `undulating` to `False`.
- The line `break` is a statement used to exit loops and is not meant to assign any value or modify any variable. Therefore, it does not affect any variables.
- Thus, the values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged, and the new variable `undulating` is set to `False`.

Since `break` is not a variable but a statement, it is included in the final state description for completeness.
