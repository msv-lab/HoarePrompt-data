Postcondition: ***`n` is a string with a length greater than 1, `i` is 1. If the current value of `n[i-1]` is less than `n[i]` and `n[i]` is less than `n[i+1]`, or if the current value of `n[i-1]` is greater than `n[i]` and `n[i]` is greater than `n[i+1]`, then the condition is met. Otherwise, undulating is set to False and the break statement is executed.***
