Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns `True` if the digits of `n` form an undulating sequence, otherwise returns `False`. An undulating sequence means that each digit alternates between being greater than and less than the adjacent digits, starting from the second digit. If no such alternating pattern exists, the function returns `False`. The function checks this by converting the integer `n` to a string and iterating through the characters, verifying that the condition `n[i - 1] < n[i] and n[i] < n[i + 1]` or `n[i - 1] > n[i] and n[i] > n[i + 1]` holds true for all adjacent pairs of digits except the last one. If the condition fails for any pair, the function sets `undulating` to `False` and breaks out of the loop. If the loop completes without breaking, the function returns `True`. Potential edge cases include single-digit numbers, which do not form undulating sequences, and numbers with repeated digits, where the condition still needs to be checked properly.**
