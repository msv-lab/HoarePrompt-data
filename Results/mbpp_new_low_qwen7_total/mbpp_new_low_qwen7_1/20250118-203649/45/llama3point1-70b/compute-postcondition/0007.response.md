Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is a string with a length greater than 1.
   - `i` is 1.
   - The condition to check within the loop is based on comparing characters of the string `n` at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1`.

2. **Loop Condition**: 
   - The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `len(n) - 2`.

3. **Condition to Meet**:
   - If the current value of `n[i-1]` is less than `n[i]` and `n[i]` is less than `n[i+1]`, or if the current value of `n[i-1]` is greater than `n[i]` and `n[i]` is greater than `n[i+1]`, then the condition is met.
   - If this condition is not met, `undulating` is set to `False` and the `break` statement is executed.

4. **Current Values**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is a string with a length greater than 1.
   - `i` is 1 (the loop starts from 1).

5. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 2.
   - The new condition to check will be based on the values of `n[1]`, `n[2]`, and `n[3]` (if they exist).

Given the above points, let's determine the state adjustments needed for the next iteration:

- The variable `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 2.
- The condition to meet for the next iteration will be based on `n[1]`, `n[2]`, and `n[3]`.
- Since the string `n` is assumed to be valid and meet the initial condition, it should still be a string with a length greater than 1.

Therefore, the state adjustments for the next iteration are:

State: **`n` is a string with a length greater than 1, `i` is 2**.
