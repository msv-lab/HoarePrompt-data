Initial State: `n` is a positive integer.
```
n = str(n)
undulating = True
```

Analysis:
- The first line converts the integer value of `n` into a string and reassigns it to `n`. This means that now `n` is no longer an integer but a string.
- The second line simply initializes the boolean variable `undulating` to `True`.

Final Output State: **n is a string, undulating is True**
