Reasoning:
To determine if the given function `func_1` correctly checks if a number is undulating, we need to understand the definition of an undulating number. An undulating number is a number that has the form ABABAB... where A and B are different digits. This means the digits alternate between two different values.

Let's analyze the provided function:

1. The function converts the integer `n` to a string to easily iterate over its digits.
2. It sets `undulating` to `True` initially.
3. It iterates through the string representation of `n`, checking pairs of adjacent digits.
4. The condition inside the loop checks if the current digit alternates properly with the next one by comparing it to the previous digit. If the current digit is greater than the previous digit and less than the following digit, or vice versa, it passes. Otherwise, it sets `undulating` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.

This logic only checks for alternating increases and decreases between adjacent digits but does not ensure that the same two alternating digits repeat throughout the entire number. For example, consider the number `121212`. According to the given logic, this would be correctly identified as undulating because each pair of adjacent digits alternates. However, this is not sufficient to conclude the number is truly undulating since there must be exactly two different digits alternating.

Therefore, the provided function does not fully implement the definition of an undulating number.

Correctness: **False**
