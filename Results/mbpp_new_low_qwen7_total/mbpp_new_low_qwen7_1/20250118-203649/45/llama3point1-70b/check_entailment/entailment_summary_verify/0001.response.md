Reasoning:
The original assessment is accurate in pointing out that the function `func_1` does not fully implement the definition of an undulating number. The function correctly checks for the alternating pattern between adjacent digits but fails to ensure that the same two alternating digits repeat throughout the entire number.

Let's re-evaluate the function based on the given problem description and the function summary:

1. **Problem Description**: The function should check whether the given number is undulating, meaning the digits alternate between two different values.
2. **Function Summary**: The function converts the integer to a string and iterates through the characters, checking the condition for alternating digits. If the condition fails at any point, it sets `undulating` to `False` and breaks out of the loop. If the loop completes without breaking, it returns `True`.

The key issue is that the function only ensures the alternating pattern for consecutive digits but does not guarantee that the same two alternating digits repeat throughout the entire number. For example, the number `121212` would pass the function's check because each pair of adjacent digits alternates, but it does not meet the requirement of having exactly two different digits repeating in an alternating pattern.

A correct implementation would need to ensure that the first two digits are the only two unique digits and that they alternate throughout the rest of the number. The current function lacks this critical check.

Final: **False**
