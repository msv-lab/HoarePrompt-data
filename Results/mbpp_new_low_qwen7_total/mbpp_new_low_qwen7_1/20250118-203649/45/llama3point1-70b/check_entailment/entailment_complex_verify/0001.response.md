### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies a critical flaw in the given function `func_1`. The function checks if the digits of the number alternate between increasing and decreasing but does not ensure that the same two alternating digits repeat throughout the entire number. 

Here is a detailed breakdown of why the function is incorrect:

1. **Function Logic**: 
   - The function converts the integer `n` to a string to facilitate iteration over its digits.
   - It initializes `undulating` to `True`.
   - It iterates through the string representation of `n`, checking pairs of adjacent digits.
   - The condition inside the loop checks if the current digit alternates properly with the next one by comparing it to the previous digit. Specifically, it checks if the current digit is either greater than the previous digit and less than the following digit, or less than the previous digit and greater than the following digit.

2. **Issue with the Function**:
   - The function correctly identifies patterns like `121212`, `343434`, etc., as undulating because each pair of adjacent digits alternates. However, it fails to recognize that the same two alternating digits must repeat throughout the entire number.
   - For example, the number `121212` meets the alternating condition, but it does not have exactly two different digits repeating. Therefore, it should not be considered undulating according to the proper definition.

3. **Example Analysis**:
   - Consider the number `121212`: The function will identify this as undulating because the digits alternate between 1 and 2.
   - However, consider the number `123123`: The function will also identify this as undulating, even though it does not have exactly two different digits alternating (it has three different digits).

4. **Correct Definition**:
   - An undulating number is defined as a number where the digits strictly alternate between two different digits. The function fails to enforce this strict alternation.

Given the above analysis, the function does not correctly implement the definition of an undulating number.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
