### Reasoning:
Let's carefully analyze the given program and the annotated code against the problem description and the original assessment.

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a function that checks whether a given number is undulating or not. A number is considered undulating if its digits alternate between increasing and decreasing consecutively.

2. **Given Program**:
   ```python
   def func_1(n):
       n = str(n)
       undulating = True
       for i in range(1, len(n) - 1):
           if n[i - 1] < n[i] and n[i] < n[i + 1] or (n[i - 1] > n[i] and n[i] > n[i + 1]):
               pass
           else:
               undulating = False
               break
       return undulating
   ```

3. **Annotated Code**:
   - The function starts by converting the integer `n` to a string.
   - It initializes `undulating` to `True`.
   - The for loop iterates through the string representation of `n` to check the condition for every pair of adjacent digits (except the last one).
   - If the condition `n[i - 1] < n[i] and n[i] < n[i + 1]` or `n[i - 1] > n[i] and n[i] > n[i + 1]` fails, `undulating` is set to `False` and the loop breaks.
   - Finally, the function returns `undulating`.

4. **Original Assessment**:
   - **Correctness**: **False**
   - **Explanation**: The original assessment states that the program only checks for a single instance of the undulating pattern and fails to ensure that the entire number alternates consistently. For example, `12421` is incorrectly identified as undulating.

5. **Analysis of the Given Program**:
   - The program indeed only checks if there is a single instance where the digits alternate between increasing and decreasing.
   - However, upon closer inspection, the given program does not actually satisfy the problem requirements correctly. It should check if the entire sequence alternates consistently, but it only checks a single pair of adjacent digits.
   - The condition `n[i - 1] < n[i] and n[i] < n[i + 1]` or `n[i - 1] > n[i] and n[i] > n[i + 1]` is insufficient to ensure the entire sequence alternates consistently.

6. **Corrected Version**:
   - The original assessment provided a corrected version:
     ```python
     def is_undulating(n):
         n = str(n)
         if len(n) < 3:
             return False
         
         undulating = True
         for i in range(1, len(n) - 1):
             if (n[i-1] < n[i] and n[i] > n[i+1]) or (n[i-1] > n[i] and n[i] < n[i+1]):
                 pass
             else:
                 undulating = False
                 break
         return undulating
     ```
   - This corrected version ensures that the entire sequence alternates between increasing and decreasing by checking every pair of adjacent digits.

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect because it only checks a single instance of the undulating pattern and does not ensure that the entire sequence alternates consistently. The corrected version provided in the original assessment addresses this issue correctly.

**Final: False**

The given program is incorrect according to the problem requirements.
