Reasoning: The original assessment accurately describes the behavior of the `func_1` function. The function correctly uses the `re.search()` method to find the first occurrence of a pattern in a given string. If a match is found, it returns a tuple containing the matched substring, its start index, and its end index. If no match is found, it returns `None`. The function summary provided matches the implementation and the problem description perfectly.

Therefore, the function correctly implements the requirement as stated in the problem description.

Final: **True**
