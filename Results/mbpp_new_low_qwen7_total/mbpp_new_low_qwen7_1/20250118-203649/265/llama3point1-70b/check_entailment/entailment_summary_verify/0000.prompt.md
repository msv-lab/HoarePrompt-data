You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Write a function to search a string for a regex pattern. The function should return the matching subtring, a start index and an end index.

- Program:
import re

def func_1(s, pattern):
    match = re.search(pattern, s)
    if match:
        return (match.group(), match.start(), match.end())
    else:
        return None



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s`, a string, and `pattern`, a valid regular expression string. It searches for a match of the regular expression `pattern` within the string `s`. If a match is found, the function returns a tuple containing the matched string (`match.group()`), the start index of the match (`match.start()`), and the end index of the match (`match.end()`). If no match is found, the function returns `None`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` uses the `re.search` method to find the first occurrence of a regex pattern in a string. However, the function returns `None` if no match is found, which does not adhere to the problem description. According to the problem description, the function should return a tuple containing the matching substring, a start index, and an end index. If no match is found, the function should return `(None, None, None)` instead of `None`. Here is an example where the function does not work as expected:

```python
s = "example"
pattern = "xyz"
result = func_1(s, pattern)
print(result)  # Output: None
```

The function returns `None` in this case, but it should return `(None, None, None)` to indicate that no match was found. Therefore, the function is incorrect.
