Reasoning: 
The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It uses the `re.search` function to find the first occurrence of the regex pattern in the given string. If a match is found, it returns a tuple with the matched substring, the start index, and the end index of the match. If no match is found, it returns `None`. This behavior aligns perfectly with the execution summary provided.

Correctness: **True**
