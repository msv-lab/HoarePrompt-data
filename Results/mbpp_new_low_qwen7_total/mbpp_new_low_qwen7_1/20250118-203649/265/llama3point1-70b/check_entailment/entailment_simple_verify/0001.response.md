Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` returns the required information (the matching substring and its start and end indices) if a match is found, and returns `None` if no match is found. However, the original assessment does not explicitly validate the behavior of the function through systematic evaluation using the annotated code. Let's break down the annotated code step-by-step to ensure the function meets all requirements.

1. **Initial State**: The function starts with the parameters `s` (a string) and `pattern` (a valid regular expression string).
2. **Search Operation**: The `re.search(pattern, s)` function is called to find the first occurrence of the pattern in the string `s`.
3. **Match Found**:
   - If a match is found (`if match:`), the function returns a tuple containing:
     - `match.group()`: the matched substring.
     - `match.start()`: the starting index of the match.
     - `match.end()`: the ending index of the match (one character after the last matched character).
4. **No Match Found**:
   - If no match is found (`else`), the function returns `None`.

Given these steps and the annotations, we can see that the function behaves as expected according to the problem description. It returns the correct information when a match is found and `None` when no match is found. There are no logical errors or edge cases that would cause incorrect behavior.

Final: **True**
