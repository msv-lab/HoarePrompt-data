### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Description Analysis**:
   - The task is to write a function that searches a string for a regex pattern and returns the matching substring along with its start and end indices.

2. **Program Code Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `s` (a string) and `pattern` (a valid regular expression string).
   - It uses `re.search(pattern, s)` to find the first occurrence of the pattern in the string `s`.
   - If a match is found, it returns a tuple containing `match.group()`, `match.start()`, and `match.end()`.
   - If no match is found, it returns `None`.

3. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The annotations correctly describe the function's behavior.
   - They accurately state that if a match is found, the function returns a tuple with the matched substring and its start and end indices.
   - If no match is found, the function returns `None`.

4. **Original Assessment Evaluation**:
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that the function uses `re.search` to find the first match.
   - It accurately describes the methods `match.group()`, `match.start()`, and `match.end()`.
   - The conclusion that the function returns the required information (matched substring, start index, and end index) if a match is found, and `None` if no match is found, is correct.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The function behaves as expected based on the problem description.
   - The function is correctly implemented according to the given requirements.

### Final:
**True**

The given program is correct based on the problem description and the provided annotations.
