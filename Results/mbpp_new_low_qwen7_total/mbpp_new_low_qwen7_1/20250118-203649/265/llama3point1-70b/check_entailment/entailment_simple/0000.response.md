### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `s` (a string) and `pattern` (a valid regular expression string).
2. **Regex Search**: The function uses `re.search(pattern, s)` to find the first occurrence of the pattern in the string `s`.
3. **Return Values**:
   - If a match is found (`match` is not `None`), the function returns three values: `match.group()` (the matched substring), `match.start()` (the starting index of the match), and `match.end()` (the ending index of the match).
   - If no match is found, the function returns `None`.

Given that the problem statement requires the function to return either the matched substring along with its indices or `None` if no match is found, the annotated comments accurately describe what the function does. There are no logical errors or issues in the implementation that would cause it to fail according to the provided problem description.

### Conclusion:
Since the function correctly implements the required behavior as described in the problem statement and the provided comments, the given program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
