Reasoning:
The annotated program correctly describes the behavior of the function `func_1`. Here's a breakdown of the function:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `s` (a string) and `pattern` (a valid regular expression string).
2. **Regex Search**: It uses the `re.search()` method to search for the pattern within the string `s`.
3. **Match Found**: If a match is found, the function returns a tuple containing three elements:
   - The matched substring using `match.group()`.
   - The start index of the match using `match.start()`.
   - The end index of the match using `match.end()`.
4. **No Match Found**: If no match is found, the function returns `None`.

Given the problem description and the annotations, the function behaves as expected and performs the required task accurately. There are no logical errors or omissions in the function that would make it incorrect based on the provided information.

Correctness: **True**
