Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` uses the `re.search` method to find the first occurrence of a regex pattern in a string. However, the function returns `None` if no match is found, which does not adhere to the problem description. According to the problem description, the function should return a tuple containing the matching substring, a start index, and an end index. If no match is found, the function should return `(None, None, None)` instead of `None`. Here is an example where the function does not work as expected:

```python
s = "example"
pattern = "xyz"
result = func_1(s, pattern)
print(result)  # Output: None
```

The function returns `None` in this case, but it should return `(None, None, None)` to indicate that no match was found. Therefore, the function is incorrect.
