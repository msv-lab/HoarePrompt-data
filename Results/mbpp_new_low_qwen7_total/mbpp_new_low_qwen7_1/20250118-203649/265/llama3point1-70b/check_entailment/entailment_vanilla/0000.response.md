Reasoning:
The provided function `func_1` uses the `re.search()` method from the `re` module to find the first occurrence of a pattern in a given string `s`. If a match is found, it returns a tuple containing the matched substring, its start index, and its end index. If no match is found, it returns `None`.

- The `re.search(pattern, s)` method searches the string `s` for the regular expression `pattern` and returns a match object if there is a match.
- The `match.group()` method returns the part of the string where there was a match.
- The `match.start()` method returns the starting index of the match.
- The `match.end()` method returns the ending index of the match (one character after the last matched character).

Given this behavior, the function correctly implements the requirement to return the matching substring along with its start and end indices if a match is found, and returns `None` if no match is found.

Therefore, the function appears to be correct based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
