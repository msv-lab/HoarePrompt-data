The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s`, which is a string, and `pattern`, which is a valid regular expression string. 

- Case_1: The function returns `match.group()`, which is the string matched by the pattern, `match.start()`, which is the start index of the match, and `match.end()`, which is the end index of the match.
- Case_2: The function returns `None`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` and a valid regular expression `pattern`. If a match is found, it returns the matched string along with its start and end indices. If no match is found, it returns `None`.
