The code creates a new list `int_values` that contains only the integer elements from the original list `lst`. This means that `lst` remains unchanged, but `int_values` now holds the integers found in `lst`.

Output State: **`lst` is a list containing elements of various types, but at least one element that can be compared; `int_values` is a list of integers extracted from `lst`.**
