Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` containing elements of various types and returns the minimum integer value from the list if such a value exists. If no integer values are present in the list, the function returns `None`. The function filters out non-integer values and then finds the minimum integer using the built-in `min` function.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If the list `lst` contains no integer values, the function returns `None`.
- If the list `lst` is empty, the function also returns `None`, as there are no elements to filter and process.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not handle cases where the list contains elements that are not comparable (e.g., a mix of integers and strings). In such cases, the `min` function would raise a `TypeError`. However, the provided code and annotations do not specify handling these cases, so the function would implicitly fail in these scenarios.
