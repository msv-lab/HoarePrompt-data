Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Write a function to find the minimum value in a given heterogeneous list.

# Annotated Program:
assert func_1(['Python', 3, 2, 4, 5, 'version']) == 2
assert func_1(['Python', 15, 20, 25]) == 15
assert func_1(['Python', 30, 20, 40, 50, 'version']) == 20

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list containing elements of various types, but at least one element that can be compared.
def func_1(lst):
    int_values = [x for x in lst if isinstance(x, int)]
    return min(int_values)
    #The program returns the minimum integer value from the list 'int_values'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` containing elements of various types and returns the minimum integer value from the list if such a value exists. If no integer values are present in the list, the function returns `None`. The function filters out non-integer values and then finds the minimum integer using the built-in `min` function.

# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
