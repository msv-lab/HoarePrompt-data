Reasoning:

The original assessment incorrectly states that the program is incorrect because it assumes the list can only contain integers, which is not true according to the problem description. The problem description asks to find the minimum value in a *heterogeneous* list, meaning the list can contain elements of different types, including integers, strings, etc.

Let's analyze the provided test cases and the function summary to validate the program's behavior:

1. **Test Case 1**: `assert func_1(['Python', 3, 2, 4, 5, 'version']) == 2`
   - The list contains both integers and strings. The function correctly identifies the integer values `[3, 2, 4, 5]` and returns the minimum value `2`.

2. **Test Case 2**: `assert func_1(['Python', 15, 20, 25]) == 15`
   - The list contains only integers. The function correctly identifies all integer values `[15, 20, 25]` and returns the minimum value `15`.

3. **Test Case 3**: `assert func_1(['Python', 30, 20, 40, 50, 'version']) == 20`
   - The list contains both integers and a string. The function correctly identifies the integer values `[30, 20, 40, 50]` and returns the minimum value `20`.

Based on the function summary, the function `func_1` is designed to filter out non-integer values before applying the `min` function. This approach ensures that only integer values are considered when determining the minimum, which aligns with the problem description.

The function behaves correctly for the given test cases and does not raise any `TypeError` because it explicitly filters out non-integer values. The function summary accurately describes the behavior of the function, confirming that it correctly handles heterogeneous lists.

Final: **True**
