You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Write a function to find the minimum value in a given heterogeneous list.

- Program:
assert func_1(['Python', 3, 2, 4, 5, 'version']) == 2
assert func_1(['Python', 15, 20, 25]) == 15
assert func_1(['Python', 30, 20, 40, 50, 'version']) == 20

def func_1(lst):
    int_values = [x for x in lst if isinstance(x, int)]
    return min(int_values)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` containing elements of various types and returns the minimum integer value from the list if such a value exists. If no integer values are present in the list, the function returns `None`. The function filters out non-integer values and then finds the minimum integer using the built-in `min` function.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
The provided function `func_1` takes a list that contains both integers and strings and is designed to find the minimum value among the integers in the list. The function correctly filters out non-integer values using a list comprehension and then applies the `min()` function to the filtered list of integers.

Given the test cases:
1. `func_1(['Python', 3, 2, 4, 5, 'version'])` should return `2`.
2. `func_1(['Python', 15, 20, 25])` should return `15`.
3. `func_1(['Python', 30, 20, 40, 50, 'version'])` should return `20`.

All these test cases are satisfied by the current implementation of `func_1`. Therefore, the function works as expected based on the provided problem description and test cases.

Correctness: **True**
