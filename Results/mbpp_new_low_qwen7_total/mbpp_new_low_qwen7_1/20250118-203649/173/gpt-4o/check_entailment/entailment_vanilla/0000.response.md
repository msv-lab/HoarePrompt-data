Reasoning:
The provided function `func_1` takes a list that contains both integers and strings and is designed to find the minimum value among the integers in the list. The function correctly filters out non-integer values using a list comprehension and then applies the `min()` function to the filtered list of integers.

Given the test cases:
1. `func_1(['Python', 3, 2, 4, 5, 'version'])` should return `2`.
2. `func_1(['Python', 15, 20, 25])` should return `15`.
3. `func_1(['Python', 30, 20, 40, 50, 'version'])` should return `20`.

All these test cases are satisfied by the current implementation of `func_1`. Therefore, the function works as expected based on the provided problem description and test cases.

Correctness: **True**
