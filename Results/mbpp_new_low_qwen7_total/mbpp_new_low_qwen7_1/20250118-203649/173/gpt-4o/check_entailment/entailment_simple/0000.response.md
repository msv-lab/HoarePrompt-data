Reasoning:
1. The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` as input.
2. It filters out non-integer values using a list comprehension, keeping only the integers.
3. It then returns the minimum value from the filtered list of integers.
4. The assertions provided check the function with different lists:
   - The first assertion checks a list with both strings and integers, returning the smallest integer (2).
   - The second assertion checks a list with only integers, returning the smallest integer (15).
   - The third assertion checks another list with both strings and integers, again returning the smallest integer (20).

Given that the function correctly handles the provided test cases and the logic is sound for filtering and finding the minimum integer, the function appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
