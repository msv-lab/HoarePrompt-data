Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Write a function to find the minimum value in a given heterogeneous list.

# Program:
assert func_1(['Python', 3, 2, 4, 5, 'version']) == 2
assert func_1(['Python', 15, 20, 25]) == 15
assert func_1(['Python', 30, 20, 40, 50, 'version']) == 20

def func_1(lst):
    int_values = [x for x in lst if isinstance(x, int)]
    return min(int_values)





# Execution Summary:
The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` containing elements of various types and returns the minimum integer value from the list if such a value exists. If no integer values are present in the list, the function returns `None`. The function filters out non-integer values and then finds the minimum integer using the built-in `min` function.


# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
