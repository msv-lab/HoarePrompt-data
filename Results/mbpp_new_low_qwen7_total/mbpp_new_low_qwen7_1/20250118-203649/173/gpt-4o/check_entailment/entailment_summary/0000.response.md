Reasoning:
The provided function `func_1` correctly filters out non-integer values from the input list and then finds the minimum integer value among the remaining elements. The given test cases cover different scenarios:

1. A list with integers and a string.
2. A list with only integers.
3. Another list with integers and a string.

In all these cases, the function returns the expected minimum integer value. Since the function behaves as intended and produces the correct results for the provided assertions, it appears to be correct according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
