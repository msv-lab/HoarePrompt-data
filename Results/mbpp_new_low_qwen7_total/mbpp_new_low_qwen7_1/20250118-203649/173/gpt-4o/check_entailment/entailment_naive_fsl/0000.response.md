Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program only considers integers in the list when finding the minimum value. However, the problem description does not specify that the list should only contain integers. For instance, if the list contains non-integer values like strings, the program will raise a `TypeError` when trying to compare them with integers using the `min` function. 

For example, if we pass a list with a string that cannot be converted to an integer, such as `['Python', '3', 2, 4, 5, 'version']`, the program will fail. Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases as required by the problem description.
