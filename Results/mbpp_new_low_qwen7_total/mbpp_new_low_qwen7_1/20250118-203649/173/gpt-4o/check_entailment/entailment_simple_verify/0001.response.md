Reasoning:
Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its annotated code against the problem description and the original assessment.

### Analysis:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a function that finds the minimum value in a given heterogeneous list (a list that contains elements of different types).

2. **Program Code**:
   ```python
   def func_1(lst):
       int_values = [x for x in lst if isinstance(x, int)]
       return min(int_values)
   ```
   - The function `func_1` uses a list comprehension to filter out only the integer values from the input list `lst`.
   - It then returns the minimum value from the filtered list of integers.

3. **Annotated Code**:
   - The annotated code correctly describes the filtering process and the return statement.
   - However, it does not mention the potential issue when the list contains no integers.

4. **Test Cases**:
   - `func_1(['Python', 3, 2, 4, 5, 'version'])` returns `2`, which is correct.
   - `func_1(['Python', 15, 20, 25])` returns `15`, which is correct.
   - `func_1(['Python', 30, 20, 40, 50, 'version'])` returns `20`, which is correct.

### Evaluation:

- The program correctly filters out non-integer values and finds the minimum integer value from the list.
- The provided test cases cover various scenarios and all pass the assertion checks.

However, there is a critical edge case that the current implementation does not handle:
- If the list contains no integer values, the list `int_values` will be empty, and calling `min([])` will raise a `ValueError`.

To confirm, let's add an additional test case where the list contains no integers:
```python
assert func_1(['Python', 'version', 'hello']) == ValueError
```

### Conclusion:

The original assessment stated that the function works as expected, but it did not consider the case where the list contains no integers. Since the function will raise a `ValueError` in such a scenario, the function is not fully correct according to the problem description.

Final: **False**
