#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: The function returns `False` if it finds an index `i` such that `i % 2 != 0` and `lst[i] % 2 == 0`. Otherwise, it returns without changing `lst` and sets `i = len(lst)`.
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst`. It iterates through the list and checks if there exists an index `i` such that `i % 2 != 0` (i.e., `i` is odd) and `lst[i] % 2 == 0` (i.e., the element at index `i` is even). If such an index is found, the function immediately returns `False`. If no such index exists, the function continues to the end and returns `True`. Thus, the function returns `True` if and only if no odd index contains an even number in the list. If any odd index contains an even number, it returns `False`. This covers all possible cases and there are no missing functionalities.
