Let's think through this step-by-step:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head defines the variables `i` and `lst`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `lst` is a list of integers with at least 1 element.
   - `i` is 0.
   - Either `i` is even or the element at index `i` in `lst` is odd.

3. **Determine Next State**:
   - Since `i` is currently 0, the next value of `i` will be `i + 1`, making it `1`.
   - For the loop to continue, the condition `i < len(lst)` must hold true.
   - We also need to ensure that either `i` (which is now 1) is even or the element at index `i` (which is now 1) in `lst` is odd.

Given these points, let's formulate the new states:

- `i` will be 1.
- To ensure the loop continues, `lst` must still be a list of integers with at least 1 element.
- The condition that either `i` is even or the element at index `i` is odd must hold. Since `i` is now 1 (which is odd), this condition will be satisfied if the element at index 1 in `lst` is an integer (since all elements in `lst` are integers).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`lst` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is 1, and either `i` is even or the element at index `i` in `lst` is odd**.
