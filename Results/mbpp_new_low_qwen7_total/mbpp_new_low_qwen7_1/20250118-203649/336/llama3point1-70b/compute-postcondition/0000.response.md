Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables Involved:**
   - The loop is iterating over the length of the list `lst`.
   - The loop variable `i` will take values from `0` to `len(lst) - 1`.

2. **Determine the Initial Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute at least once, there must be at least one element in the list `lst`. This means the length of the list `lst` should be greater than or equal to 1.
   - When the loop starts, `i` should be `0` because that is the first index in a list.

3. **State the Required Conditions:**
   - `lst` must be a list of integers.
   - The length of `lst` must be at least 1 (i.e., `len(lst) >= 1`).
   - `i` must be `0` initially.

Based on this reasoning, the state of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time is as follows:

State: **`lst` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0**
