Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: The initial state at the end of the previous iteration is given as:
   - `lst` is a list of integers with at least 1 element.
   - `i` is 1.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over the indices of the list `lst` using `range(len(lst))`.

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - The loop checks if `i` is odd and if the element at index `i` in `lst` is even.
   - Since `i` is 1 (which is odd), it will check if `lst[1]` is even.
   - If `lst[1]` is even, the function returns `False`.
   - If `lst[1]` is odd, the function continues to the next iteration.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1 (since the loop starts from `0`).
   - Therefore, `i` will be 2 in the next iteration.

5. **State Adjustment**:
   - We need to adjust the state based on the loop head variables, which are `i` and `lst`.
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1, `i` will be 2 in the next iteration.
   - The value of `lst` remains unchanged unless the function returns `False` during the current iteration.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`lst` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is 2**.
