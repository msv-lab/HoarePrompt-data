The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`. `lst` is a list of integers. The function has multiple return points: in four different cases, it returns `False` in three of them and `True` in one of them. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `lst` and return `True` under specific conditions, otherwise it returns `False`.
