Reasoning:
The annotated program accurately describes the behavior of the function `func_1`. The function correctly iterates over the list, checking each odd index to ensure that the value at that index is also odd. If it finds an even number at an odd index, it immediately returns `False`. If it successfully iterates through the entire list without finding any even numbers at odd indices, it returns `True`. This matches the problem description perfectly, and there are no logical errors or missing functionalities in the code.

Correctness: **True**
