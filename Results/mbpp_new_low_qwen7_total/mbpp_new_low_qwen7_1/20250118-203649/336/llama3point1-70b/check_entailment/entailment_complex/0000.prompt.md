Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Write a python function to check whether every odd index contains odd numbers of a given list.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: The function returns `False` if it finds an index `i` such that `i % 2 != 0` and `lst[i] % 2 == 0`. Otherwise, it returns without changing `lst` and sets `i = len(lst)`.
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst`. It iterates through the list and checks if there exists an index `i` such that `i % 2 != 0` (i.e., `i` is odd) and `lst[i] % 2 == 0` (i.e., the element at index `i` is even). If such an index is found, the function immediately returns `False`. If no such index exists, the function continues to the end and returns `True`. Thus, the function returns `True` if and only if no odd index contains an even number in the list. If any odd index contains an even number, it returns `False`. This covers all possible cases and there are no missing functionalities.
