Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the analysis:

1. **Problem Description**: The function should verify if every odd index in the list contains an odd number.
2. **Program Code**: 
   ```python
   def func_1(lst):
       for i in range(len(lst)):
           if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
               return False
       return True
   ```
3. **Annotated Code**: 
   - The loop iterates over each index `i` of the list `lst`.
   - For each odd index (`i % 2 != 0`), it checks if the value at that index is even (`lst[i] % 2 == 0`).
   - If an even number is found at an odd index, the function immediately returns `False`.
   - If no such even number is found during the iteration, the function returns `True`.

4. **Original Assessment**: 
   - **Correctness**: **True**
   - **Explanation**: The function correctly checks if every odd index contains an odd number. It returns `False` as soon as it encounters an even number at an odd index, which means the condition is not satisfied. Otherwise, it returns `True`, indicating that the condition is met for all odd indices.

The function correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. The annotated code provides clear evidence that supports the original assessment.

Final: **True**
