### Reasoning:

Let's revisit the problem and the provided function `func_1` step-by-step:

1. **Problem Description**: Check if every odd index in the list contains an odd number.
2. **Function Logic**:
   - The function iterates through each index `i` of the list `lst`.
   - It checks if the index `i` is odd (`i % 2 != 0`) and if the value at that index is even (`lst[i] % 2 == 0`).
   - If both conditions are true for any index, the function immediately returns `False`.
   - If no such index is found during the iteration, the function returns `True`.

However, there is a subtle issue in the implementation:

- The condition `i % 2 != 0` checks if the index `i` is odd. This means that the function only considers indices like 1, 3, 5, etc.
- But the problem statement specifically mentions "every odd index," implying that the function should also consider the first element of the list (index 0) if it is treated as an odd index according to some contexts (though typically index 0 is considered even). 

To properly address this, the function should ideally be checking if the index is odd and the value is even, but the current implementation does not cover the case where the first element (index 0) might be considered odd under certain interpretations.

In the given annotated code, the function does not explicitly mention handling the case where the first element (index 0) might be considered odd. Since the function only checks for even numbers at odd indices starting from 1, it might miss cases where the first element (index 0) is considered odd.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment assumes that the function correctly implements the requirement, but the function does not cover the edge case where the first element (index 0) might be considered odd. Given the problem statement's requirement, the function does not fully meet the criteria because it skips checking the first element (index 0) if it is considered odd.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
