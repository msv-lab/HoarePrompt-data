Reasoning: 
The provided program correctly implements the logic required to check whether every odd index contains an odd number in the given list. The function `func_1` iterates through the list and checks each element at an odd index to ensure it is odd. If it finds an even number at any odd index, it immediately returns `False`. Only if all odd indices contain odd numbers does it return `True`.

The execution summary accurately describes the behavior of the function. It correctly states that the function returns `True` if no odd index contains an even number and `False` otherwise. Given this analysis, the program meets the specified requirements without any logical errors or missing functionalities.

Correctness: **True**
