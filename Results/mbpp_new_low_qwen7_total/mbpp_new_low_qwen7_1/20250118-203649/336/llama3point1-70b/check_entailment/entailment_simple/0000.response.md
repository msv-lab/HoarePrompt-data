### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic of the provided function `func_1` step-by-step:

1. **Function Signature**: The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` as input.
2. **Loop Through List**: It iterates through the list using a `for` loop with `i` ranging from `0` to `len(lst) - 1`.
3. **Condition Check**:
   - `if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0`: This condition checks if the current index `i` is an odd index (i.e., `i % 2 != 0`) and if the value at that index is an even number (`lst[i] % 2 == 0`).
4. **Return False**: If the condition is met, the function immediately returns `False`, indicating that the requirement is not satisfied.
5. **Return True**: If the loop completes without finding any index `i` where the condition is true, the function returns `True`.

### Analysis:
- The function correctly checks each odd-indexed element in the list to ensure it is odd.
- If any odd-indexed element is found to be even, the function correctly returns `False`.
- If all odd-indexed elements are odd, the function correctly returns `True`.

Given this analysis, the function appears to implement the required logic accurately.

### Conclusion:
Based on the provided annotated program and the analysis, the function correctly implements the logic to check whether every odd index contains an odd number in the given list.

### Response:
Correctness: **True**
