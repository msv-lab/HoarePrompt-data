Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks whether every odd index contains an odd number in the given list. The function iterates through the list and checks if the element at each odd index is even. If it finds an even number at an odd index, it returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True` after checking all elements. This logic correctly implements the requirement specified in the problem description. Since the function correctly handles all potential cases without any errors, the program is correct.
