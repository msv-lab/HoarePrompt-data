### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the function `func_1` using the annotated code and the original assessment.

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1` is designed to check whether every odd index in the list contains an odd number.
2. **Loop Iteration**: The function iterates through each element of the list using a `for` loop where `i` ranges from `0` to `len(lst) - 1`.
3. **Condition Check**: Inside the loop, the function checks two conditions:
   - `i % 2 != 0`: This condition checks if the index `i` is odd.
   - `lst[i] % 2 == 0`: This condition checks if the element at index `i` is even.
4. **Return Behavior**: If the loop finds an index `i` where `i % 2 != 0` and `lst[i] % 2 == 0`, the function immediately returns `False`. If no such index is found during the entire loop execution, the function returns `True`.

**Annotated Code Analysis**:
- The annotated code correctly describes the behavior of the function. However, there is a subtle but critical issue in the loop condition. The loop should only check odd indices, but the current condition `i % 2 != 0` includes both even and odd indices.

**Issue Identified**:
- The condition `i % 2 != 0` in the loop is incorrect because it checks for both even and odd indices. The correct condition should be `i % 2 == 1` (or simply `i & 1 == 1` for bitwise operations).

**Corrected Loop**:
```python
for i in range(1, len(lst), 2):  # Start from 1 and step by 2 to ensure only odd indices are checked
```

**Example Test Case**:
Consider the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`:
- Index 0 (even) -> Value 1 (odd)
- Index 1 (odd) -> Value 2 (even) -> Function returns `False`
- Indices 2, 3, 4 (all even) -> Values 3, 4, 5 (all odd)

Since the function correctly returns `False` for the second element (index 1), the logic seems to work as intended. However, the loop condition needs to be adjusted to strictly check only odd indices.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment concluded that the function is correct, but the loop condition is incorrect. By correcting the loop condition to only check odd indices, the function will accurately implement the desired functionality.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

Explanation: The original function contains a logical error in the loop condition, which should be corrected to ensure it only checks odd indices.
