You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Write a python function to check whether every odd index contains odd numbers of a given list.

- Program: 
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
    return True



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: The function returns `False` if it finds an index `i` such that `i % 2 != 0` and `lst[i] % 2 == 0`. Otherwise, it returns without changing `lst` and sets `i = len(lst)`.
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst`. It iterates through the list and checks if there exists an index `i` such that `i % 2 != 0` (i.e., `i` is odd) and `lst[i] % 2 == 0` (i.e., the element at index `i` is even). If such an index is found, the function immediately returns `False`. If no such index exists, the function continues to the end and returns `True`. Thus, the function returns `True` if and only if no odd index contains an even number in the list. If any odd index contains an even number, it returns `False`. This covers all possible cases and there are no missing functionalities.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

The given function `func_1` aims to check if every odd index in the list contains an odd number. Let's break down the logic of the function:

1. The function iterates through each element of the list using a `for` loop with `i` ranging from `0` to `len(lst) - 1`.
2. For each index `i`, it checks two conditions:
   - `i % 2 != 0`: This condition checks if the index `i` is odd.
   - `lst[i] % 2 == 0`: This condition checks if the element at index `i` is even.
3. If both conditions are met (i.e., the index is odd and the value at that index is even), the function returns `False`.
4. If the loop completes without finding any index that violates the condition, the function returns `True`.

The logic correctly identifies when an odd-indexed position contains an even number, which would violate the requirement. The function only returns `True` if no such index exists, meaning all odd indices contain odd numbers.

### Conclusion:
Given the problem statement and the provided function, the function logic aligns perfectly with the requirement. Therefore, the function is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
