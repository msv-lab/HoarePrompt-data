### Reasoning:
The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the analysis:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a Python function that checks whether every odd index in a given list contains an odd number.
   
2. **Program Code**: 
   ```python
   def func_1(lst):
       for i in range(len(lst)):
           if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
               return False
       return True
   ```
   - The function iterates over each index `i` in the list `lst`.
   - For each index `i`, it checks if `i` is odd (`i % 2 != 0`) and if the element at that index is even (`lst[i] % 2 == 0`).
   - If it finds any such index, it immediately returns `False`.
   - If it completes the loop without finding any index where the condition `i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0` holds true, it returns `True`.

3. **Annotated Code**:
   - The annotation accurately describes the behavior of the function. It correctly states that the function returns `False` as soon as it encounters an odd index with an even value and returns `True` only if no such index is found.
   - The function correctly checks all elements in the list and ensures that the condition for every odd index containing an odd number is met.

4. **Original Assessment**:
   - The assessment correctly notes that the function correctly implements the requirement by iterating through the list and checking the condition for each odd index.
   - It also correctly mentions that the function handles all potential cases without errors and meets the specified requirements.

Given the above analysis, the original assessment is accurate, and the function behaves as intended according to the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
