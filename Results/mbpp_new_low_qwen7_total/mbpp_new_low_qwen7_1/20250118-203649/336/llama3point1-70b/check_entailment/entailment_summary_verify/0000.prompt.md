You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Write a python function to check whether every odd index contains odd numbers of a given list.

- Program:
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
    return True



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst`. It iterates through the list and checks if there exists an index `i` such that `i % 2 != 0` (i.e., `i` is odd) and `lst[i] % 2 == 0` (i.e., the element at index `i` is even). If such an index is found, the function immediately returns `False`. If no such index exists, the function continues to the end and returns `True`. Thus, the function returns `True` if and only if no odd index contains an even number in the list. If any odd index contains an even number, it returns `False`. This covers all possible cases and there are no missing functionalities.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks whether every odd index contains an odd number in the given list. The function iterates through the list and checks if the element at each odd index is even. If it finds an even number at an odd index, it returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True` after checking all elements. This logic correctly implements the requirement specified in the problem description. Since the function correctly handles all potential cases without any errors, the program is correct.
