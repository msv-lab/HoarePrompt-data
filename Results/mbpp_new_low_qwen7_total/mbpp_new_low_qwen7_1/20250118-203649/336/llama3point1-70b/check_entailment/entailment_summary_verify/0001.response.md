### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate, but let's break down the analysis step-by-step to confirm the correctness of the function `func_1`.

1. **Function Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` iterates through each index `i` of the list `lst`.
   - For each index `i`, it checks if `i % 2 != 0` (i.e., `i` is odd) and `lst[i] % 2 == 0` (i.e., the element at index `i` is even).
   - If both conditions are met, the function immediately returns `False`.
   - If the loop completes without finding any such index, the function returns `True`.

2. **Function Summary**:
   - The function summary correctly states that the function returns `True` if and only if no odd index contains an even number in the list.
   - This means the function correctly checks the condition for every odd index in the list.

3. **Correctness Verification**:
   - Consider a few test cases to verify the function's behavior:
     - For the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`:
       - Odd indices: 1 (2), 3 (4)
       - The function will return `False` because the element at index 1 (which is 2) is even.
     - For the list `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`:
       - All odd indices contain odd numbers.
       - The function will return `True` as expected.
   - These examples confirm that the function behaves as intended.

4. **No Missing Functionalities**:
   - The function correctly handles all edge cases, including lists with zero elements, lists with only even or odd indices, and mixed cases.
   - There are no logical errors or missing functionalities that could lead to incorrect results.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to check if every odd index in the list contains an odd number.

### Final:
**True**
