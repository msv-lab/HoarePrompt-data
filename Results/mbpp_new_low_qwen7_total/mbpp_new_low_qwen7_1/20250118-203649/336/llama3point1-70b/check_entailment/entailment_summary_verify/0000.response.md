Reasoning: 

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the function and verify its correctness using the provided problem description and the function summary.

1. **Problem Description**: We need a function that checks whether every odd index in the given list contains an odd number.
2. **Function Logic**:
   - The function iterates through the list using a `for` loop.
   - For each index `i`, it checks two conditions:
     - `i % 2 != 0`: This ensures that the index is odd.
     - `lst[i] % 2 == 0`: This checks if the element at the odd index is even.
   - If any odd index has an even number, the function immediately returns `False`.
   - If the loop completes without finding any even number at an odd index, the function returns `True`.

The function summary accurately captures this logic and states that the function returns `True` if and only if no odd index contains an even number in the list. This aligns with the problem description, which requires that every odd index must contain an odd number.

Given this analysis, the original assessment is correct. The function behaves as intended and correctly implements the required functionality.

Final: **True**
