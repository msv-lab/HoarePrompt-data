### Reasoning:

The given function `func_1` aims to check if every odd index in the list contains an odd number. Let's break down the logic of the function:

1. The function iterates through each element of the list using a `for` loop with `i` ranging from `0` to `len(lst) - 1`.
2. For each index `i`, it checks two conditions:
   - `i % 2 != 0`: This condition checks if the index `i` is odd.
   - `lst[i] % 2 == 0`: This condition checks if the element at index `i` is even.
3. If both conditions are met (i.e., the index is odd and the value at that index is even), the function returns `False`.
4. If the loop completes without finding any index that violates the condition, the function returns `True`.

The logic correctly identifies when an odd-indexed position contains an even number, which would violate the requirement. The function only returns `True` if no such index exists, meaning all odd indices contain odd numbers.

### Conclusion:
Given the problem statement and the provided function, the function logic aligns perfectly with the requirement. Therefore, the function is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
