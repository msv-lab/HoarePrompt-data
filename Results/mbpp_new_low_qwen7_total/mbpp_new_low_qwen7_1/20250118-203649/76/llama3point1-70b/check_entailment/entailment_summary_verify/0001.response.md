### Reasoning:
The original assessment made an incorrect assumption that the tuple may contain elements of types other than strings. According to the problem description, the task is simply to convert a tuple to a string. The function `func_1` uses the `.join()` method with an empty string as the separator, which is appropriate for joining elements of a tuple into a single string, assuming that all elements in the tuple are indeed strings.

The function summary provided indicates that the function should handle the case where the tuple is empty, returning an empty string. This is also consistent with the behavior of the `.join()` method when passed an empty tuple.

Given that the problem description does not mention any constraints on the types of elements within the tuple, and the function summary confirms that the function handles both non-empty and empty tuples correctly, the original assessment is inaccurate.

Therefore, the provided function `func_1` is correct under the assumption that the input tuple contains string elements.

### Final:
**True**
