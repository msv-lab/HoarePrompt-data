Reasoning:
The provided function `func_1` takes a tuple `tup` as input and attempts to convert it to a string using `''.join(tup)`. However, this will raise a TypeError because the `.join()` method requires an iterable of strings, but a tuple can contain elements of any type.

For example, if the tuple contains integers or other non-string types, attempting to join them directly will result in a TypeError. To correctly convert a tuple containing string elements to a single string, we need to ensure that all elements are strings. If the tuple contains mixed types, we would first need to convert all elements to strings.

Since the problem statement does not specify that all elements in the tuple must be strings, and without additional context on how to handle mixed-type tuples, the provided implementation is not universally correct.

However, assuming the tuple contains only string elements, the provided function will work as expected.

Correctness: **False**
