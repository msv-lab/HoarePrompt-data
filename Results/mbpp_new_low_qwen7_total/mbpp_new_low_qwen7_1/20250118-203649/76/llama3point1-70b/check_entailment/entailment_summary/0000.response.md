Reasoning:
The provided function `func_1` attempts to convert a tuple into a string by using the `join` method. However, the `join` method requires an iterable of strings, but it does not automatically convert non-string elements in the tuple to strings. The `join` method will raise a `TypeError` if any element in the tuple is not a string.

For example, if the tuple contains integers or other non-string types, the function will fail because `join` expects an iterable of strings.

Given this, the function should first ensure all elements in the tuple are strings before joining them. If the input tuple contains non-string elements, they should be converted to strings.

Correctness: **False**
