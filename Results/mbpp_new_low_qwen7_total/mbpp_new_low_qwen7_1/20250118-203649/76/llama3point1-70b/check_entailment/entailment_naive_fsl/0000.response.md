Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The given program attempts to convert a tuple to a string using `''.join(tup)`. However, the `join` method requires its argument to be an iterable of strings. If the tuple contains non-string elements, the program will raise a `TypeError`. For example, if the tuple is `tup = (1, 2, 3)`, calling `func_1(tup)` will result in an error because the `join` method cannot concatenate integers directly.

To handle this correctly, the function should first ensure that all elements in the tuple are strings or convert them to strings if necessary. Here's a corrected version:

```python
def func_1(tup):
    return ''.join(str(item) for item in tup)
```

This version ensures that each element in the tuple is converted to a string before attempting to join them, thus handling tuples containing non-string elements without raising an error.
