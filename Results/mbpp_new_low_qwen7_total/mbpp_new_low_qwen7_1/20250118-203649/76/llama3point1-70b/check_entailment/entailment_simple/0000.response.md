### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` takes a single argument `tup`, which is expected to be a tuple.
2. **Return Statement**: The function uses the `join()` method to concatenate all elements of the tuple `tup`. However, the `join()` method requires an iterable of strings, not other types like integers or other objects. If the tuple contains non-string elements, the function will raise a `TypeError`.
3. **Expected Output**: The annotated program states that the function should return a string formed by concatenating all elements of the tuple `tup`. This implies that each element in the tuple must be a string for the function to work as intended.

Given this reasoning, the function is only correct if the tuple `tup` contains only string elements. If `tup` contains any non-string elements, the function will raise a `TypeError`.

### Response:
Since the problem statement does not specify that the tuple `tup` will only contain string elements, we cannot assume this condition holds true in general.

Therefore, the function can be considered incorrect because it does not handle cases where the tuple contains non-string elements.

**Correctness: **False**
