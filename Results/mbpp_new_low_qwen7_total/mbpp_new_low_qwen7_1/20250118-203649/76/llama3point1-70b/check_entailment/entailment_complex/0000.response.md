Reasoning:
The function `func_1` takes a tuple `tup` as input and returns a string formed by concatenating all elements of the tuple. The function uses the `join()` method to concatenate the elements. 

- If `tup` contains only strings, the function will correctly concatenate them into a single string.
- If `tup` contains non-string elements, those elements will be implicitly converted to strings because the `join()` method works with any iterable and will call `str()` on each element to convert it to a string.
- For an empty tuple, the function will return an empty string, which is the expected behavior.

Given the problem statement and the provided annotated program, there is no missing functionality or logical errors in the code. Therefore, the function should work correctly for the specified task.

Correctness: **True**
