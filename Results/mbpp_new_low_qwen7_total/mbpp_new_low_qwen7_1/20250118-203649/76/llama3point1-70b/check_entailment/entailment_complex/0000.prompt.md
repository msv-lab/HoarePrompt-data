Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Write a function to convert a tuple to a string.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup is a tuple.
def func_1(tup):
    return ''.join(tup)
    #The program returns a string that is formed by concatenating all elements of tuple 'tup'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `tup` as a parameter and returns a string that is formed by concatenating all elements of the tuple `tup`. This means that each element in the tuple will be converted to a string (if not already) and then concatenated together to form the final string. Potential edge cases include empty tuples, which would result in an empty string being returned. There is no missing functionality in the provided code.

# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
