Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `tup` as a parameter and returns a string that is formed by concatenating all elements of the tuple `tup`. This means that each element in the tuple will be converted to a string (if not already) and then concatenated together to form the final string. Potential edge cases include empty tuples, which would result in an empty string being returned. There is no missing functionality in the provided code.**
