Reasoning:
The given function `func_1` takes a list of string representations of numbers and returns a sorted list of those numbers after converting them from strings to integers. However, the function does not correctly handle the case where the input list contains non-numeric strings, which would raise a `ValueError` when attempting to convert these strings to integers.

Given the problem statement, it's assumed that the input will be a list of strings that can all be converted to integers. Therefore, under this assumption, the function should work as intended.

Correctness: **False**

The function is correct under the assumption of valid inputs but fails to handle potential errors gracefully and does not sort the strings numerically as explicitly required. A more robust approach would include error handling and ensure the sorting is done based on numerical values rather than lexicographical order (which is what `sorted()` does with strings).

To fix this, you could modify the function to:

```python
def func_1(num_strings):
    try:
        return sorted([int(num) for num in num_strings])
    except ValueError:
        return "Invalid input: All elements must be numeric strings"
```

This version includes error handling to manage cases where the input contains non-numeric strings.
