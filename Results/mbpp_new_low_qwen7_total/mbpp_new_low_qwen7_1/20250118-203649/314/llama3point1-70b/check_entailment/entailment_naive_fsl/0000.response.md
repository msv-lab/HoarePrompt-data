Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program attempts to sort a list of strings representing numbers by converting them to integers and then sorting. However, the problem description specifies that the list should be sorted numerically, but the program sorts the list after converting the strings to integers, which means it sorts the list as if it were a list of integers rather than sorting the original strings numerically.

For example, consider the input `["2", "11", "1"]`. The expected output would be `["1", "2", "11"]`, but the program will return `["1", "2", "11"]` as a list of integers, which is `['1', '2', '11']`. The strings are sorted lexicographically, not numerically.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should directly sort the list of strings without converting them to integers. Here is a corrected version:

```python
def func_1(num_strings):
    return sorted(num_strings, key=lambda x: int(x))
```

This version sorts the strings based on their numerical value, ensuring the output matches the problem description.
