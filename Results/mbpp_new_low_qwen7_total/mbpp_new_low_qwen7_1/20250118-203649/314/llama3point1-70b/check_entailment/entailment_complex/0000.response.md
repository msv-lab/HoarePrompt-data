Reasoning:
The function `func_1` correctly performs the following steps:
1. It takes a list of strings `num_strings`.
2. Using a list comprehension, it converts each string in `num_strings` to an integer.
3. It sorts the resulting list of integers in ascending order.
4. It returns the sorted list.

However, the provided code snippet does not handle potential errors that may occur if any string in the list cannot be converted to an integer. To ensure the function is robust, error handling should be included.

Despite this oversight, the primary functionality described (converting strings to integers and sorting them) is implemented correctly according to the problem statement, assuming all strings can be converted to integers without issues.

Correctness: **True**
