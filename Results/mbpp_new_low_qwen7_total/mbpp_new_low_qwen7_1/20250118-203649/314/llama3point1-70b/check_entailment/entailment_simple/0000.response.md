Reasoning:
- The function `func_1` takes a list of strings (`num_strings`) as input.
- It uses a list comprehension to convert each string in the list to an integer.
- Then, it sorts this list of integers.
- The return statement correctly returns the sorted list of integers.
- The comment at the end accurately describes the output of the function.

Given that the function logically performs the task as described in the problem statement and the comment, the implementation is correct.

Correctness: **True**
