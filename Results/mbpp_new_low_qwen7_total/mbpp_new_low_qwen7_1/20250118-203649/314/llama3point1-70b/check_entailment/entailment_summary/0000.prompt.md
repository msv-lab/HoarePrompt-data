Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Write a function to sort a given list of strings of numbers numerically.

# Program:
def func_1(num_strings):
    return sorted([int(num) for num in num_strings])





# Execution Summary:
The function `func_1` accepts a list of strings `num_strings`, where each string can be converted to an integer. It then converts each string to an integer using a list comprehension and sorts the resulting list of integers in ascending order. The function returns this sorted list of integers. Potential edge cases include lists containing non-convertible strings, which would result in a `ValueError`. If such an error occurs, the function will not proceed with sorting and will instead raise the exception.


# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
