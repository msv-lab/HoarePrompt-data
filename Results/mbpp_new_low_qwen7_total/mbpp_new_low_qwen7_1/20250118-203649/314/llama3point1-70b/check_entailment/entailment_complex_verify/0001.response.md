### Reasoning:
Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the original assessment based on the problem description and the annotated code.

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a function that sorts a given list of strings of numbers numerically.
2. **Program Code**:
   ```python
   def func_1(num_strings):
       return sorted([int(num) for num in num_strings])
   ```
3. **Annotated Code**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a list of strings `num_strings`.
   - Each string in `num_strings` is converted to an integer using a list comprehension.
   - The list of integers is then sorted.
   - The function returns the sorted list of integers.
   - Edge cases like non-convertible strings are mentioned, which could raise a `ValueError`.

4. **Original Assessment**:
   - The original assessment states that the function does not correctly handle non-numeric strings, which is true.
   - The function assumes all strings can be converted to integers, leading to a potential `ValueError` without any error handling.
   - The assessment suggests adding error handling to make the function more robust.

5. **Evaluation Based on Annotations**:
   - The annotated code confirms that the function will indeed raise a `ValueError` if there are non-numeric strings in the input.
   - The annotated code also correctly notes that the sorting is done based on the numerical values of the integers, which aligns with the requirement to sort the strings numerically.

Given the problem description and the fact that the function assumes all strings can be converted to integers, the function behaves as expected under the given assumption. The annotation correctly describes the behavior and the potential issues. While the function does not handle invalid inputs, the original problem description did not specify how to handle such cases. Therefore, the function is correct under the assumption of valid inputs.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly sorts a list of strings of numbers numerically under the assumption that all strings can be converted to integers. The original assessment was accurate in noting the potential issue with non-numeric strings but the function is still correct under the given problem description.
