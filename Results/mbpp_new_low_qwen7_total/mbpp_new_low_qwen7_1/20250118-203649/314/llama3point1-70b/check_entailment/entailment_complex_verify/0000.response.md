### Reasoning:
The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to sort a list of strings of numbers numerically. This means that the strings should be sorted based on their numerical values, not their lexicographical (string-based) order.

2. **Program Code Analysis**:
   ```python
   def func_1(num_strings):
       return sorted([int(num) for num in num_strings])
   ```
   - The function takes a list of strings `num_strings`.
   - It uses a list comprehension to convert each string to an integer.
   - The `sorted` function is applied to the list of integers.
   - The result is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.

3. **Behavior of the Program**:
   - For the input `["2", "11", "1"]`, the program first converts the strings to integers, resulting in `[2, 11, 1]`.
   - Then it sorts these integers, yielding `[1, 2, 11]`.
   - Finally, it returns the sorted list of integers as a list of strings, which is `['1', '2', '11']`.

4. **Expected Behavior**:
   - The correct output should be a list of strings sorted based on their numerical values, i.e., `["1", "2", "11"]`.

5. **Annotations**:
   - The annotation mentions that the function converts each string to an integer and then sorts the resulting list of integers.
   - This confirms that the function is indeed sorting the integers, not the original strings.

6. **Original Assessment**:
   - The assessment states that the program sorts the list as if it were a list of integers rather than sorting the original strings numerically.
   - This is accurate because the function does not preserve the original string format during sorting; it sorts the numerical values represented by those strings.

7. **Corrected Version**:
   - The suggested corrected version:
     ```python
     def func_1(num_strings):
         return sorted(num_strings, key=lambda x: int(x))
     ```
   - This version sorts the strings based on their numerical values while keeping them as strings, which aligns with the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**.

The original assessment is accurate, and the program is incorrect as it does not meet the requirement of sorting the strings numerically.
