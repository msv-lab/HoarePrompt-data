Reasoning: 

The original assessment is accurate. The given program does not correctly implement the requirement to sort the list of strings numerically. Instead, it converts each string to an integer before sorting, resulting in a list of integers rather than a list of sorted strings.

Let's evaluate this using the annotated code:

1. Before the function call, `num_strings` is a list of strings, each representing a number.
2. Inside the function, a list comprehension `[int(num) for num in num_strings]` converts each string to an integer.
3. The `sorted()` function sorts the list of integers.
4. The result is returned as a list of integers, not a list of sorted strings.

To sort the strings numerically, we need to sort them based on their numerical values, not their lexicographical order. This can be achieved by providing a custom key function to the `sorted()` method, which converts each string to an integer during the comparison process.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(num_strings):
    return sorted(num_strings, key=lambda x: int(x))
```

This version correctly sorts the strings based on their numerical value, meeting the requirements of the problem description.

Final: **False**
