### Reasoning:
Based on the provided function summary and the problem description, let's analyze the given program:

1. **Function Summary Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a list of strings `num_strings`.
   - Each string in `num_strings` is converted to an integer using a list comprehension.
   - The resulting list of integers is sorted in ascending order.
   - The function raises a `ValueError` if any string cannot be converted to an integer.

2. **Problem Description**:
   - The task is to sort a list of strings representing numbers numerically.
   - This implies that the sorting should be based on the numerical value of the strings, not their lexicographical order.

3. **Program Code Analysis**:
   - The program uses `sorted([int(num) for num in num_strings])` to first convert each string to an integer and then sort the resulting list of integers.
   - The code handles the case where any string cannot be converted to an integer by raising a `ValueError`.

4. **Original Assessment Analysis**:
   - The original assessment suggests that the function is incorrect because it does not handle non-numeric strings gracefully and does not sort the strings numerically.
   - However, the function summary indicates that the function does handle the conversion and sorting as described, and raises an exception only when necessary.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Given the problem description and the function summary, the function `func_1` correctly converts the strings to integers and sorts them numerically.
   - The function also handles invalid inputs by raising a `ValueError`, which is consistent with the requirement to ensure all elements can be converted to integers before sorting.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct under the assumption that all elements in the input list can be converted to integers. The function summary accurately reflects the behavior of the function, and the original assessment was overly critical without considering the function's handling of potential errors.
