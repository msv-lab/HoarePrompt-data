You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Write a function to sort a given list of strings of numbers numerically.

- Program:
def func_1(num_strings):
    return sorted([int(num) for num in num_strings])



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a list of strings `num_strings`, where each string can be converted to an integer. It then converts each string to an integer using a list comprehension and sorts the resulting list of integers in ascending order. The function returns this sorted list of integers. Potential edge cases include lists containing non-convertible strings, which would result in a `ValueError`. If such an error occurs, the function will not proceed with sorting and will instead raise the exception.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
The given function `func_1` takes a list of string representations of numbers and returns a sorted list of those numbers after converting them from strings to integers. However, the function does not correctly handle the case where the input list contains non-numeric strings, which would raise a `ValueError` when attempting to convert these strings to integers.

Given the problem statement, it's assumed that the input will be a list of strings that can all be converted to integers. Therefore, under this assumption, the function should work as intended.

Correctness: **False**

The function is correct under the assumption of valid inputs but fails to handle potential errors gracefully and does not sort the strings numerically as explicitly required. A more robust approach would include error handling and ensure the sorting is done based on numerical values rather than lexicographical order (which is what `sorted()` does with strings).

To fix this, you could modify the function to:

```python
def func_1(num_strings):
    try:
        return sorted([int(num) for num in num_strings])
    except ValueError:
        return "Invalid input: All elements must be numeric strings"
```

This version includes error handling to manage cases where the input contains non-numeric strings.
