### Your Response:

Reasoning: 

The original assessment is accurate. Let's analyze the provided function and the function summary to understand why the original assessment is correct.

1. **Function Behavior**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a list of strings `num_strings`.
   - It uses a list comprehension to convert each string in `num_strings` to an integer.
   - It then sorts the list of integers in ascending order.

2. **Function Summary**:
   - The summary states that the function converts each string to an integer and sorts the resulting list of integers.
   - This confirms that the function is sorting the integers, not the original strings as required.

3. **Problem Description**:
   - The problem requires sorting the list of strings numerically, meaning the strings should be sorted based on their numerical value, not their lexicographical order.

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - Consider the input `["2", "11", "1"]`.
   - The expected output is `["1", "2", "11"]` because these strings represent the numbers 1, 2, and 11, respectively.
   - However, the function returns `['1', '2', '11']`, which is the list of integers sorted lexicographically.

5. **Corrected Version**:
   - The corrected version provided in the original assessment:
     ```python
     def func_1(num_strings):
         return sorted(num_strings, key=lambda x: int(x))
     ```
   - This version uses the `sorted` function with a key function that converts each string to an integer before comparing them during the sort process. This ensures that the strings are sorted based on their numerical value, not their lexicographical order.

Given this analysis, the original assessment is correct because the function does not meet the requirement of sorting the strings numerically. The function sorts the integers derived from the strings, which is not what the problem description asks for.

Final: **False**
