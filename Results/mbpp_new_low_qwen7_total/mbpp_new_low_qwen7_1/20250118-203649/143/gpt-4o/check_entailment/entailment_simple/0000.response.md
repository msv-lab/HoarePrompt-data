### Reasoning:

1. **Pattern Matching**: The regular expression `a(b{2,3})` is used to check if the string contains an 'a' character followed by exactly two or three 'b' characters. 
   - `a`: Matches the character 'a'.
   - `(b{2,3})`: Matches exactly 2 or 3 occurrences of 'b'.

2. **Function Logic**:
   - The function uses `re.search()` to search for the pattern within the input string `text`.
   - If a match is found, `re.search()` returns a match object, and `bool(match)` returns `True`.
   - If no match is found, `re.search()` returns `None`, and `bool(None)` returns `False`.

3. **Assertions**:
   - `assert func_1('ac') == False`: The string 'ac' does not match the pattern (it has no 'a' followed by 2 or 3 'b's).
   - `assert func_1('dc') == False`: The string 'dc' also does not match the pattern (it does not contain 'a').
   - `assert func_1('abbbba') == True`: The string 'abbbba' matches the pattern (it contains 'a' followed by 4 'b's, but only the first 3 'b's are considered).

4. **Return Value**:
   - The function correctly returns `False` for strings like 'ac' and 'dc' because they do not match the pattern.
   - For 'abbbba', the function returns `False` because it should only return `True` if there are exactly 2 or 3 'b's following the 'a', but the string has 4 'b's.

### Conclusion:
The provided function logic and assertions are consistent with the problem statement. However, the pattern should be adjusted to ensure it correctly captures the requirement of exactly 2 or 3 'b's following an 'a'. 

The current implementation would return `True` for 'abbbb' (4 'b's) as well, which is not correct according to the problem description.

### Corrected Pattern:
To fix this, we need to use a positive lookahead to ensure exactly 2 or 3 'b's follow the 'a':
```python
pattern = 'a(b{2,3})'
```
Should be changed to:
```python
pattern = 'a(b{2,3})?b?'
```
Or more accurately:
```python
pattern = 'a(b{2}|b{3})'
```

However, the given annotated program does not have the corrected pattern and the logic in the function itself is correct based on the provided pattern.

### Final Answer:
Given the problem as stated and the provided pattern, the function logic appears correct based on the pattern. But if the intention was to match exactly 2 or 3 'b's, the pattern needs adjustment.

**Correctness: False** (if the intention was to match exactly 2 or 3 'b's, otherwise, it depends on the intended behavior)
