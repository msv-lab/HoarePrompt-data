Reasoning:
The provided program uses a regular expression to check if the input string contains the character 'a' followed by either two or three 'b's. The pattern `'a(b{2,3})'` correctly captures this requirement. Let's analyze the assertions:

1. `assert func_1('ac') == False`: The string 'ac' does not contain 'a' followed by two or three 'b's, so the function should return `False`, which it does.
2. `assert func_1('dc') == False`: The string 'dc' also does not contain 'a' followed by two or three 'b's, so the function should return `False`, which it does.
3. `assert func_1('abbbba') == True`: The string 'abbbba' contains 'a' followed by four 'b's, which matches the pattern 'a(b{2,3})', so the function should return `True`, which it does.

Given these points, the function behaves as expected according to the problem description and the provided test cases.

Correctness: **True**
