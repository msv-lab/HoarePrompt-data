Reasoning:
- The function `func_1` uses a regular expression pattern `'a(b{2,3})'` to check for an 'a' character followed by exactly two or three 'b' characters.
- The provided test cases assert the following:
  - `func_1('ac')` should be `False` because it does not contain 'a' followed by two or three 'b'.
  - `func_1('dc')` should be `False` because it does not contain 'a' followed by two or three 'b'.
  - `func_1('abbbba')` should be `False` because it contains more than three 'b' after 'a', which the pattern does not allow (it only matches exactly two or three 'b').
- However, the pattern `'a(b{2,3})'` correctly matches strings with 'a' followed by exactly two or three 'b'. For example, `func_1('abb')` and `func_1('abbb')` would both return `True`.

Given the pattern and the test cases, there seems to be a mismatch between the expected behavior and the provided assertions. The assertions suggest that `func_1('abbbba')` should return `True`, but according to the pattern, it should return `False` because there are four 'b's after 'a'.

Correctness: **False**
