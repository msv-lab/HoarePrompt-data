Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program uses a regular expression to check if a string contains 'a' followed by two or three 'b' characters. However, the regular expression `a(b{2,3})` is incorrect because it requires 'b' to be immediately following 'a', and it does not account for the possibility of 'a' being followed by more than three 'b's or no 'b's at all. 

For example, consider the string 'abbbb'. According to the problem description, this string should return `True`, but the current implementation will return `False` because the regular expression does not match more than three 'b's following 'a'.

A corrected version would be:

```python
import re

assert func_1('ac') == False
assert func_1('dc') == False
assert func_1('abbbba') == True
assert func_1('abbbb') == True

def func_1(text):
    pattern = 'a(b{2,3})?'
    match = re.search(pattern, text)
    return bool(match)
```

This corrected version uses the optional grouping `(b{2,3})?` to handle cases where 'a' might be followed by zero, two, or three 'b's.
