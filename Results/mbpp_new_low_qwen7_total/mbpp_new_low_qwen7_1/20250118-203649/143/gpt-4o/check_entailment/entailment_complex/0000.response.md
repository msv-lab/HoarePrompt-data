### Reasoning:

1. **Pattern Definition**: The regular expression pattern `'a(b{2,3})'` correctly matches a string that starts with an 'a' followed by exactly two or three 'b's.
2. **Function Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` uses `re.search` to find the pattern in the input string `text`.
   - If the pattern is found, `re.search` returns a match object, which will make `bool(match)` evaluate to `True`.
   - If the pattern is not found, `re.search` returns `None`, and `bool(None)` evaluates to `False`.
3. **Test Cases**:
   - `func_1('ac')`: The string does not contain 'a' followed by two or three 'b's, so the function should return `False` (correct).
   - `func_1('dc')`: The string does not contain 'a' at all, so the function should return `False` (correct).
   - `func_1('abbbba')`: The string contains 'a' followed by five 'b's, but only the first four ('abbb') match the pattern, so the function should return `True` (correct).

Given the pattern and the logic, the function behaves as expected based on the provided test cases.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
