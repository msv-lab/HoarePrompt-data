The function `func_1` accepts a string `text` and searches for a pattern `'a(b{2,3})'` within the string. If the pattern is found, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function specifically checks if the substring "bb" or "bbb" (i.e., two or three consecutive 'b's) immediately follows an 'a'. If no such pattern is found in the input string, the function returns `False`. This behavior covers all potential edge cases where the pattern might or might not be present in the input string.
