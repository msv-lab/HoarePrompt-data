Output State: **text is a string, pattern is 'a(b{2,3})', match is None**

Explanation:
- The first line defines the regular expression pattern `pattern = 'a(b{2,3})'`.
- The second line attempts to find a match of this pattern in the `text` string using `re.search(pattern, text)`. Since no specific `text` string is provided, the `match` variable is set to `None` (no match found).
