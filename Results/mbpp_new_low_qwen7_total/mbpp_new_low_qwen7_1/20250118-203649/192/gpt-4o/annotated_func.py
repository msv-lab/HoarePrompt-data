#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string.
def func_1(s):
    return ''.join([s[i] for i in range(len(s)) if i % 2 != 0])
    #The program returns a string containing every second character of the original string `s`, starting from the second character (index 1)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` as input and returns a new string containing every second character of `s`, starting from the second character (index 1). There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations or the code itself, but the function correctly handles the provided logic. The returned string includes characters at odd indices of the original string.
