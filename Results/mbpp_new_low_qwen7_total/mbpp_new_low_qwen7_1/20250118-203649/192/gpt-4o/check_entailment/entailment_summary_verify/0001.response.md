Reasoning:
The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` indeed removes characters at odd indices (0-based indexing) and keeps characters at even indices, which aligns with the problem description of removing "odd characters" in a string.

Let's break down the function and the provided assertions:

1. **Function Behavior**:
   - The function `func_1` uses a list comprehension to iterate over the string `s` and includes only the characters where the index `i` is odd (i.e., `i % 2 != 0`).
   - This effectively removes characters at even indices (1-based indexing) and keeps characters at odd indices (0-based indexing).

2. **Assertions Analysis**:
   - `func_1('python') == 'yhn'`: Characters at even indices (0, 2, 4) are kept ('p', 't', 'h', 'n'), and characters at odd indices (1, 3) are removed ('y', 'o'). This matches the expected output.
   - `func_1('program') == 'rga'`: Characters at even indices (0, 2, 4, 6) are kept ('p', 'r', 'o', 'm'), and characters at odd indices (1, 3, 5) are removed ('g', 'r', 'a'). This matches the expected output.
   - `func_1('language') == 'agae'`: Characters at even indices (0, 2, 4, 6, 8) are kept ('l', 'a', 'g', 'u', 'e'), and characters at odd indices (1, 3, 5, 7) are removed ('a', 'n', 'c', 'g'). This matches the expected output.

The function summary also accurately describes the behavior of the function, stating that it returns a new string containing every second character of `s`, starting from the second character (index 1 in 1-based indexing, which corresponds to index 0 in 0-based indexing).

Since the function behaves as intended and the provided assertions confirm its correctness, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
