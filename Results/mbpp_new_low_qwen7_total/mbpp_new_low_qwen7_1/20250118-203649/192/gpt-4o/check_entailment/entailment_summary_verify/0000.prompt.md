You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Write a function to remove odd characters in a string.

- Program:
assert func_1('python') == 'yhn'
assert func_1('program') == 'rga'
assert func_1('language') == 'agae'

def func_1(s):
    return ''.join([s[i] for i in range(len(s)) if i % 2 != 0])



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` as input and returns a new string containing every second character of `s`, starting from the second character (index 1). There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations or the code itself, but the function correctly handles the provided logic. The returned string includes characters at odd indices of the original string.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program removes characters from a string at odd indices, but the problem description asks to remove odd characters. Typically, in programming, characters are not considered "odd" or "even" in the same way as indices. However, if we interpret "odd characters" to mean characters at odd indices, the program appears to be correct.

To verify this, let's consider a few more test cases:

- `func_1('abcdefg')` should return `'bdf'`, but the current implementation returns `'bdfg'`.
- `func_1('hello')` should return `'el'`, but the current implementation returns `'elo'`.

These examples show that the program is removing characters at odd indices instead of odd characters. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for these cases.

Correctness: **False**.
