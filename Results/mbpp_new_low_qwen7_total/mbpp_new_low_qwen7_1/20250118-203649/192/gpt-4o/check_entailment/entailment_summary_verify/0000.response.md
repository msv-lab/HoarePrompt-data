Reasoning: 

The original assessment is inaccurate. Let's analyze the problem description and the provided function code:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to remove odd characters in a string. In the context of strings, "odd characters" could be interpreted as characters at odd indices (1-based indexing).

2. **Function Code**:
   ```python
   def func_1(s):
       return ''.join([s[i] for i in range(len(s)) if i % 2 != 0])
   ```
   - The function iterates over the string `s` using `range(len(s))`.
   - It checks if the index `i` is odd using `if i % 2 != 0`.
   - If the index is odd, the character at that position is included in the result.
   - The function then joins these characters into a new string and returns it.

3. **Function Summary**:
   - The function `func_1` returns a new string containing every second character of `s`, starting from the second character (index 1).

4. **Test Cases**:
   - `func_1('python') == 'yhn'`: Correct, because 'y', 'h', and 'n' are at indices 1, 3, and 5.
   - `func_1('program') == 'rga'`: Correct, because 'r', 'g', and 'a' are at indices 1, 3, and 5.
   - `func_1('language') == 'agae'`: Correct, because 'a', 'g', 'a', and 'e' are at indices 1, 3, 5, and 7.

Given these points, the function indeed removes characters at odd indices, which aligns with the problem description when interpreted as removing "odd characters" (characters at odd indices).

Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate, and the program is correct according to the given interpretation.

Final: **True**
