### Reasoning:
The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the program step-by-step to confirm its correctness.

1. **Function Definition and Annotations**:
   ```python
   def func_1(s):
       return ''.join([s[i] for i in range(len(s)) if i % 2 != 0])
   ```
   - The function `func_1` takes a string `s` as input.
   - It uses a list comprehension to iterate over the indices of the string `s`.
   - For each index `i` from 0 to `len(s)-1`, it checks if `i % 2 != 0` (i.e., if `i` is odd).
   - If the condition is true, the character at index `i` is included in the resulting list.
   - Finally, `''.join()` is used to concatenate these characters into a new string.

2. **Analyzed Assertions**:
   - `func_1('python') == 'yhn'`
     - Indices: 0 (p), 1 (y), 2 (t), 3 (h), 4 (o), 5 (n)
     - Odd indices (1-based): 2 (t), 4 (o)
     - Characters at these indices: 'y', 'h', 'n'
     - Result: 'yhn'
   - `func_1('program') == 'rga'`
     - Indices: 0 (p), 1 (r), 2 (o), 3 (g), 4 (r), 5 (a), 6 (m)
     - Odd indices (1-based): 2 (o), 4 (r), 6 (m)
     - Characters at these indices: 'r', 'g', 'a'
     - Result: 'rga'
   - `func_1('language') == 'agae'`
     - Indices: 0 (l), 1 (a), 2 (n), 3 (g), 4 (u), 5 (a), 6 (g), 7 (e)
     - Odd indices (1-based): 2 (n), 4 (u), 6 (g)
     - Characters at these indices: 'a', 'g', 'a', 'e'
     - Result: 'agae'

   Each of these results matches the expected output, confirming that the function behaves as intended.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
