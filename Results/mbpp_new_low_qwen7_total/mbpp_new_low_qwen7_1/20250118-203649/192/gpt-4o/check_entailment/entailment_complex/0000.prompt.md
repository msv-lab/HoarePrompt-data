Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Write a function to remove odd characters in a string.

# Annotated Program:
assert func_1('python') == 'yhn'
assert func_1('program') == 'rga'
assert func_1('language') == 'agae'

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string.
def func_1(s):
    return ''.join([s[i] for i in range(len(s)) if i % 2 != 0])
    #The program returns a string containing every second character of the original string `s`, starting from the second character (index 1)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` as input and returns a new string containing every second character of `s`, starting from the second character (index 1). There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations or the code itself, but the function correctly handles the provided logic. The returned string includes characters at odd indices of the original string.

# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
