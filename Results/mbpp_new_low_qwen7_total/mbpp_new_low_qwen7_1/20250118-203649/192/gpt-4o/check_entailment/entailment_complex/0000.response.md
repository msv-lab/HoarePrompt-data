Reasoning:  
The given program defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `s` as input and returns a new string containing every second character of `s`, starting from the second character (index 1). This means it skips every other character starting from the first character. The provided assertions check if the function correctly removes characters at even indices (considering the index starts from 0).

- `func_1('python')` should return `'yhn'` because it includes the characters at indices 1, 3, and 5 ('y', 'h', 'n').
- `func_1('program')` should return `'rga'` because it includes the characters at indices 1, 3, and 5 ('r', 'g', 'a').
- `func_1('language')` should return `'agae'` because it includes the characters at indices 1, 3, 5, and 7 ('a', 'g', 'a', 'e').

The function implementation is correct as it uses list comprehension to iterate over the string indices and includes only those characters where `i % 2 != 0`.

Correctness: **True**
