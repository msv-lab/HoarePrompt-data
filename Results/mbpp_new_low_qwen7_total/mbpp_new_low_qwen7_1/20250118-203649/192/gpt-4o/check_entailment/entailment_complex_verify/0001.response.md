Reasoning: 
The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` is designed to remove characters at odd indices (0-based indexing) and keep characters at even indices. However, the problem description asks to remove "odd characters," which typically implies characters at odd positions (1-based indexing).

Let's re-evaluate the function with this understanding:

1. The first assertion: `func_1('python') == 'yhn'`
   - If we interpret "odd characters" as characters at odd positions (1-based indexing), then we should remove 'p', 't', 'h', and 'n' (characters at positions 1, 3, 5, and 7).
   - The characters at even positions are kept: 'y', 'o'.
   - Therefore, 'yo' should be the output, not 'yhn'.

2. The second assertion: `func_1('program') == 'rga'`
   - If we interpret "odd characters" as characters at odd positions (1-based indexing), then we should remove 'p', 'r', 'o', and 'm' (characters at positions 1, 3, 5, and 7).
   - The characters at even positions are kept: 'r', 'g', 'a'.
   - Therefore, 'rag' should be the output, not 'rga'.

3. The third assertion: `func_1('language') == 'agae'`
   - If we interpret "odd characters" as characters at odd positions (1-based indexing), then we should remove 'l', 'a', 'g', and 'u' (characters at positions 1, 3, 5, and 7).
   - The characters at even positions are kept: 'a', 'n', 'c', 'e'.
   - Therefore, 'ane' should be the output, not 'agae'.

Based on these observations, the function `func_1` does not correctly implement the requirement to remove odd characters (1-based indexing). Instead, it removes characters at even indices (0-based indexing).

Final: **False**
