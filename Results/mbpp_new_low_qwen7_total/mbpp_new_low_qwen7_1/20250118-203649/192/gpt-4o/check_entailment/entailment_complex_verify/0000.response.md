### Reasoning

Let's carefully analyze the given problem and the provided code:

1. **Problem Description**: Remove odd characters in a string.
   - In typical programming terms, characters are not considered "odd" or "even." However, if we interpret "odd characters" to mean characters at odd indices, then the problem is to remove characters at even indices and keep those at odd indices.

2. **Given Code**:
   ```python
   def func_1(s):
       return ''.join([s[i] for i in range(len(s)) if i % 2 != 0])
   ```
   - This function takes a string `s` and returns a new string where every character at an odd index is included, starting from the first character (index 0).

3. **Annotated Code**:
   - The annotated code correctly explains that the function returns a string containing every second character of the original string `s`, starting from the first character (index 0).
   - This matches the interpretation that "odd characters" means characters at odd indices.

4. **Test Cases Provided**:
   - `func_1('python')` should return `'yhn'` (correct).
   - `func_1('program')` should return `'rag'` (correct).
   - `func_1('language')` should return `'agae'` (correct).

5. **Additional Test Cases**:
   - `func_1('abcdefg')` should return `'bdf'` (as per the problem description, removing odd characters means keeping even indices, which would result in `'bdf'`).
   - `func_1('hello')` should return `'elo'` (again, keeping even indices would result in `'elo'`).

6. **Conclusion**:
   - Based on the test cases and the problem description, the function correctly removes characters at even indices and keeps those at odd indices.
   - The function does not meet the requirement of removing odd characters in the traditional sense (characters themselves), but it does meet the requirement of removing characters at even indices, which aligns with the interpretation of the problem.

### Final Evaluation

Since the function behaves as intended based on the provided interpretation and test cases, the original assessment is inaccurate.

**Final: False**
