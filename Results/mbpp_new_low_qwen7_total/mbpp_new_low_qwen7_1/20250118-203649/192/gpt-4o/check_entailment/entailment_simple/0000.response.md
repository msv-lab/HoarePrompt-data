Reasoning:
- The problem statement asks for a function that removes "odd characters" from a string. Given the context, this likely means removing characters at odd indices (i.e., keeping only the characters at even indices).
- The provided function uses list comprehension to iterate over the string `s` and includes only characters at even indices (`if i % 2 != 0` checks for odd indices).
- However, the expected outputs provided in the assertions indicate that characters at even indices (0-based) should be kept. This suggests that the condition `i % 2 != 0` (which checks for odd indices) is not what was intended.
- The function should instead check for even indices (`if i % 2 == 0`) to correctly implement the requirement of keeping every second character starting from the first character (index 0).

Correctness: **False**

To fix the function, it should be:

```python
def func_1(s):
    return ''.join([s[i] for i in range(len(s)) if i % 2 == 0])
```

This will correctly keep characters at even indices and remove those at odd indices, matching the intended behavior.
