Reasoning:
- The problem statement asks to remove "odd characters" from a string, which typically means removing characters at odd indices.
- The provided function `func_1` uses a list comprehension to select characters from the string `s` at even indices (i.e., where `i % 2 != 0`), not odd indices.
- The execution summary correctly states that the function returns every second character starting from the second character (index 1), which aligns with selecting characters at even indices.
- Given the function's implementation and the execution summary, it appears that the function does not remove odd characters as per the problem statement, but rather removes characters at odd indices.

Correctness: **False**
