Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Write a function to remove odd characters in a string.

# Program:
assert func_1('python') == 'yhn'
assert func_1('program') == 'rga'
assert func_1('language') == 'agae'

def func_1(s):
    return ''.join([s[i] for i in range(len(s)) if i % 2 != 0])





# Execution Summary:
The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` as input and returns a new string containing every second character of `s`, starting from the second character (index 1). There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations or the code itself, but the function correctly handles the provided logic. The returned string includes characters at odd indices of the original string.


# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
