Reasoning: 
The given function `func_1` is designed to remove odd characters from a string, which can be interpreted as removing characters at odd indices (1-based indexing) or keeping characters at even indices (0-based indexing). Let's analyze the provided assertions and the implementation of the function:

1. The first assertion: `func_1('python') == 'yhn'`
   - 'python' has characters at even indices: 'p', 't', 'h', 'n'.
   - The characters at odd indices are removed: 'y', 'o'.
   - Therefore, 'yhn' is correct.

2. The second assertion: `func_1('program') == 'rga'`
   - 'program' has characters at even indices: 'p', 'r', 'o', 'm'.
   - The characters at odd indices are removed: 'g', 'r', 'a'.
   - Therefore, 'rga' is correct.

3. The third assertion: `func_1('language') == 'agae'`
   - 'language' has characters at even indices: 'l', 'a', 'g', 'u', 'e'.
   - The characters at odd indices are removed: 'a', 'n', 'c', 'g'.
   - Therefore, 'agae' is correct.

The function `func_1` correctly removes characters at odd indices (based on 0-based indexing), which matches the expected behavior of the problem statement.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
