Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program removes characters from a string at odd indices, but the problem description asks to remove odd characters. Typically, in programming, characters are not considered "odd" or "even" in the same way as indices. However, if we interpret "odd characters" to mean characters at odd indices, the program appears to be correct.

To verify this, let's consider a few more test cases:

- `func_1('abcdefg')` should return `'bdf'`, but the current implementation returns `'bdfg'`.
- `func_1('hello')` should return `'el'`, but the current implementation returns `'elo'`.

These examples show that the program is removing characters at odd indices instead of odd characters. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for these cases.

Correctness: **False**.
