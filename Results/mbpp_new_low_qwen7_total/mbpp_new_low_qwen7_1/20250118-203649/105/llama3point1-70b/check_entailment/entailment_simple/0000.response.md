### Reasoning:

To solve the problem of setting all even bits of a given number, we need to understand what even bits mean in the context of binary representation. Even bits refer to the bits at even positions (0, 2, 4, ...) in the binary representation of the number. The goal is to set these bits to 1 while keeping the other bits unchanged.

In the given solution, the function `func_1` performs a bitwise OR operation between the input `n` and the constant `2863311530`. Let's examine this constant in binary form to understand its effect:

- `2863311530` in binary is `10101010101010101010101010101010`.

This binary number has 1s in all even bit positions and 0s in all odd bit positions. Performing a bitwise OR with this number will set all even bits of the input number to 1, leaving the odd bits unchanged.

For example:
- If `n = 13` (binary `1101`), performing the bitwise OR with `2863311530` results in `1010101010101010101010101101`, which is the binary representation of `2863311541`.

Given that the bitwise OR operation correctly sets all even bits to 1 for any integer input, the provided function should work as expected.

### Conclusion:

Since the function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement of setting all even bits of the given number, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
