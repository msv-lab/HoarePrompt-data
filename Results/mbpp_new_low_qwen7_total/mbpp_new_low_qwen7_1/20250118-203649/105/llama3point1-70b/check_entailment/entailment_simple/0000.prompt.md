Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Write a python function to set all even bits of a given number.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer.
def func_1(n):
    return n | 2863311530
    #The program returns the bitwise OR of 'n' and 2863311530


# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
