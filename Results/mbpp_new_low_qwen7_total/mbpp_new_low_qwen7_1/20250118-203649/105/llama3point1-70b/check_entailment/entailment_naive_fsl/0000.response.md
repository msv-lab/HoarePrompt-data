Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program `func_1(n)` uses a magic number `2863311530` to set all even bits of a given number. However, this approach is incorrect because the binary representation of `2863311530` is `10101010101010101010101010101010`, which sets only the even bits to 1. This will work correctly for setting even bits but will also set the least significant bit (which is odd) to 1, thus violating the requirement to only set even bits.

To correctly set all even bits of a number, we need to use a mask that has 1s in the even positions and 0s in the odd positions. The correct mask would be `0b10101010101010101010101010101010` (or `0x55555555` in hexadecimal).

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def set_even_bits(n):
    # Create a mask with 1s in even positions
    mask = 0x55555555
    return n | mask
```

This function will correctly set all even bits of the given number without affecting the odd bits.
