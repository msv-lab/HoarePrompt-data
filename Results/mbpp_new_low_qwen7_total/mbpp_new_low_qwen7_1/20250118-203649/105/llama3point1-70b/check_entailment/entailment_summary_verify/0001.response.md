### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the given function `func_1` to ensure it correctly sets all even bits of a given number.

1. **Problem Description**: Set all even bits of a given number.
2. **Function Summary**: The function performs a bitwise OR operation between the input number `n` and the constant `2863311530`.

First, let's examine the binary representation of `2863311530`:
```
2863311530 in binary: 10101010101010101010101010101010
```
This number has '1' in every even bit position (0th, 2nd, 4th, ..., 30th) and '0' in every odd bit position.

Given this, let's consider the following examples to see if the function works as expected:

- **Example 1**: `n = 10` (binary `1010`)
  - Performing `10 | 2863311530` results in `10101010101010101010101010101010` (decimal `2863311540`).
  - However, the correct output should be `101010` (binary) which is `10 in decimal`, but with all even bits set to 1, resulting in `101010` (binary) or `22 in decimal`.

- **Example 2**: `n = 21` (binary `10101`)
  - Performing `21 | 2863311530` results in `1010101010101010101010101010101` (decimal `2863311553`).
  - The correct output should be `1010101` (binary) which is `21 in decimal`, but with all even bits set to 1, resulting in `1010101` (binary) or `85 in decimal`.

From these examples, it is clear that the function does not correctly set only the even bits of the given number. Instead, it sets all even bits to 1, regardless of the original state of the even bits in the input number.

Therefore, the function does not satisfy the requirement of setting only the even bits and leaves the odd bits unchanged.

### Conclusion:
The function provided does not correctly set all even bits of the given number.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
