The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and returns the result of the bitwise OR operation between `n` and the constant value `2863311530`. This operation sets specific bits in `n` based on the binary representation of `2863311530`. The function does not modify `n` in place; instead, it creates a new integer that represents the bitwise OR of `n` and `2863311530`. There are no edge cases or missing functionalities in the provided code.
