#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a sorted list of integers, n is a positive integer representing the length of arr, and x is an integer.
def func_1(arr, n, x):
    count = arr.count(x)
    return count > n / 2
    #The program returns True if x appears more than n/2 times in arr, otherwise it returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a sorted list of integers `arr`, a positive integer `n` representing the length of `arr`, and an integer `x`. It counts the number of occurrences of `x` in `arr` and checks if this count is greater than `n / 2`. If `x` appears more than `n / 2` times in `arr`, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Note that since `arr` is sorted, the function does not need to sort `arr` again. However, the function does not handle the case where `arr` might be empty, which would result in an error when calling `arr.count(x)` if `arr` is empty and `x` is not present in `arr`. To address this, an additional check should be included to handle the case where `arr` is empty.
