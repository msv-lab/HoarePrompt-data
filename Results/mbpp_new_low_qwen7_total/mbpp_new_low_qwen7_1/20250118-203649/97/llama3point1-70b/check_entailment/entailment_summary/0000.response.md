Reasoning:
The given program has a logical flaw because it does not correctly handle the case where the input array `arr` is empty. The method `arr.count(x)` will raise a `TypeError` if `arr` is an empty list and `x` is not present in `arr`. Therefore, before counting the occurrences of `x`, we should first check if `arr` is empty. If `arr` is empty, the function should immediately return `False` since no element can be a majority element in an empty array.

However, the core logic of checking if the count of `x` is greater than `n / 2` is correct when the array is not empty. Since the problem assumes valid inputs (i.e., the array is guaranteed to be non-empty if it contains the element `x`), we only need to add the check for an empty array.

Correctness: **False**

To fix the program, you could modify it as follows:

```python
def func_1(arr, n, x):
    if len(arr) == 0:
        return False
    count = arr.count(x)
    return count > n / 2
```

This version of the function first checks if `arr` is empty and returns `False` immediately if it is. Then it proceeds with the original logic to count the occurrences of `x` and check if it is more than `n / 2`.
