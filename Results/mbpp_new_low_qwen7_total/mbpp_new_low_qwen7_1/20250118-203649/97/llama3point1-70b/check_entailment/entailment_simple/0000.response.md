### Reasoning:

The provided function `func_1` takes three parameters: `arr`, `n`, and `x`. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Function Parameters**:
   - `arr`: A sorted list of integers.
   - `n`: The length of the list `arr`.
   - `x`: An integer element to check for majority.

2. **Core Logic**:
   - The function uses the `count` method of the list to count how many times `x` appears in `arr`.
   - It then checks if this count is greater than `n / 2`.

3. **Majority Element Definition**:
   - By definition, a majority element must appear more than `n / 2` times in the array.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the case where the element `x` is the majority element.
   - If `x` does not meet the majority condition, the function correctly returns `False`.

5. **Algorithm Correctness**:
   - The logic of counting occurrences and comparing against `n / 2` is accurate for determining the majority element.

6. **No Potential Issues**:
   - There are no apparent issues with the provided logic, and it directly meets the problem requirements.

Given this analysis, the provided function correctly implements the required functionality.

### Correctness:
**True**
