Reasoning:
- The provided function `func_1` uses the `.count()` method to count how many times `x` appears in the list `arr`.
- However, this approach is not efficient for large arrays because the `.count()` method has a time complexity of O(n) due to the need to iterate through the entire list.
- More importantly, this approach does not take advantage of the fact that the input array is sorted. Given that the array is sorted and we are looking for a majority element, we can use a more efficient algorithm to solve this problem, such as checking if the middle element of the array is the majority element.
- The function should check if the middle element of the array is `x` and verify if it appears more than `n/2` times consecutively.

Correctness: **False**

A more efficient solution would be:

```python
def func_1(arr, n, x):
    # Check if the middle element is x and appears more than n/2 times
    if arr[n // 2] == x:
        left_count = sum(1 for i in range(n) if arr[i] == x)
        return left_count > n / 2
    return False
```

This solution works by first checking if the middle element of the array is `x`. If it is, it counts how many times `x` appears from the start of the array up to the middle and checks if this count is greater than `n/2`. This approach leverages the sorted property of the array to efficiently find the majority element.
