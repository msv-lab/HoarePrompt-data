Reasoning:
The annotated program correctly describes the logic of the function `func_1`. The function indeed counts the occurrences of the element `x` in the sorted array `arr` and checks if the count is greater than `n / 2`. The logic is accurate, but there is a minor issue with the annotation that should be noted. The function assumes that `arr` is not empty and does not explicitly handle the case where `arr` might be empty. However, the problem statement does not specify any input constraints beyond the array being sorted, and valid inputs are assumed. Therefore, the function can be considered correct for the given assumptions.

Correctness: **True**
