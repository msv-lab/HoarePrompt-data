Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a sorted list of integers `arr`, a positive integer `n` representing the length of `arr`, and an integer `x`. It counts the number of occurrences of `x` in `arr` and checks if this count is greater than `n / 2`. If `x` appears more than `n / 2` times in `arr`, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Note that since `arr` is sorted, the function does not need to sort `arr` again. However, the function does not handle the case where `arr` might be empty, which would result in an error when calling `arr.count(x)` if `arr` is empty and `x` is not present in `arr`. To address this, an additional check should be included to handle the case where `arr` is empty.**
