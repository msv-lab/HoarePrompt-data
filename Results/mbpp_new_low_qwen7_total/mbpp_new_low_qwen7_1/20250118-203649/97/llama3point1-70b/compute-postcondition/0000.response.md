`count` is assigned the value of `arr.count(x)`, which counts how many times `x` appears in the list `arr`. Since `arr` is a sorted list of integers, the value of `count` will be an integer representing the number of occurrences of `x` in `arr`. The states of the other variables (`arr`, `n`, and `x`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is a positive integer representing the length of `arr`, `x` is an integer, `count` is the number of times `x` appears in `arr`**
