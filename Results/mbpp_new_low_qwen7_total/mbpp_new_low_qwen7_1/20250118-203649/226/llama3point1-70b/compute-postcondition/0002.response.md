The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr`, which is a list of non-negative integers, and `n`, which is a positive integer such that `0 <= n <= len(arr)`. The function returns a computed value based on the counts of even and odd numbers in the list `arr`.

To break it down:
- It calculates the count of odd numbers in `arr` as `odd_count`.
- It calculates the count of even numbers in `arr` as `even_count = n - odd_count`.
- It then returns the value of `odd_count * (even_count * (even_count - 1) // 2) + odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of non-negative integers `arr` and a positive integer `n` such that `0 <= n <= len(arr)`, and return a computed value based on the counts of even and odd numbers in the list.
