### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given function, let's analyze its logic and the problem it's trying to solve.

The problem requires counting the number of pairs \((i, j)\) in an array such that the XOR of the elements at these positions, \(arr[i] \oplus arr[j]\), is odd.

For the XOR of two numbers to be odd, one of the numbers must be odd and the other must be even. Therefore, we need to count how many odd and even numbers are present in the array and then calculate the number of valid pairs.

1. **Odd Count Calculation**: The line `odd_count = sum((1 for num in arr if num % 2 != 0))` correctly counts the number of odd numbers in the array.
2. **Even Count Calculation**: The line `even_count = n - odd_count` correctly calculates the number of even numbers in the array, where `n` is the total number of elements in the array.
3. **Number of Pairs**:
   - Pairs where one element is odd and the other is even contribute to the result. There are `odd_count * even_count` such pairs.
   - Additionally, we need to consider the pairs where both elements are odd. Since the XOR of two odd numbers is even, these do not contribute to the count of pairs with an odd XOR value. However, if we had pairs where both are even, their XOR would also be even. Therefore, only the first part (`odd_count * even_count`) is relevant here.

Given this analysis, the formula `return odd_count * even_count + odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2` is unnecessary and potentially incorrect because it includes an extra term that doesn't contribute to the correct count of pairs with an odd XOR value.

The correct formula should simply be `return odd_count * even_count`.

### Conclusion:

The given function does not follow the correct logic to solve the problem as intended. It unnecessarily includes a term that does not affect the count of pairs with an odd XOR value.

**Correctness: **False**
