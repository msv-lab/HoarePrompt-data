Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the function to verify its correctness:

1. The function `func_1` aims to count the number of pairs in the list `arr` whose XOR value is odd.
2. For the XOR of two numbers to be odd, one number must be odd and the other must be even. This is because the XOR of two even numbers or two odd numbers results in an even number.
3. The provided implementation correctly identifies the number of odd and even numbers in the list:
   - `odd_count` is calculated as the number of odd elements in `arr`.
   - `even_count` is calculated as the number of even elements in `arr`, which is `n - odd_count` since `n` is the total number of elements in `arr`.
4. The formula used in the return statement is intended to count the number of valid pairs:
   - `odd_count * even_count` gives the number of pairs consisting of one odd and one even number.
   - `odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2` gives the number of pairs consisting of two odd numbers.
5. However, there is a discrepancy between the commented-out formula and the actual code:
   - The commented-out formula includes `even_count * (even_count - 1) // 2`, which is not part of the actual implementation. This term would incorrectly count pairs of even numbers, which should not be included since we are looking for pairs with an odd XOR value.

Given these points, the actual implementation does not match the intended logic for counting pairs with an odd XOR value. Therefore, the function is incorrect as it currently stands.

Correctness: **False**
