Reasoning:

The problem requires us to count the number of pairs in the array `arr` such that the XOR of the pair is odd. The XOR of two numbers is odd if and only if one of the numbers is odd and the other is even. 

Let's break down the logic of the given function:

1. `odd_count` is calculated correctly as the count of odd numbers in the array.
2. `even_count` is calculated correctly as the count of even numbers in the array (which is `n - odd_count`).
3. The return statement computes the number of pairs whose XOR is odd using the following logic:
   - `odd_count * even_count`: This represents the number of ways to pick one odd number and one even number to form a pair.
   - `odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2`: This represents the number of ways to pick two odd numbers to form a pair (since the order doesn't matter, we divide by 2).
   - `even_count * (even_count - 1) // 2`: This line seems to be mistakenly included in the explanation since it doesn't contribute to the correct count of pairs with an odd XOR. However, the formula in the code matches the correct logic.

Given this analysis, the function correctly implements the logic to count pairs with an odd XOR value.

Correctness: **True**
