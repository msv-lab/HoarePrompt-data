Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Write a python function to count the number of pairs whose xor value is odd.

# Program:
def func_1(arr, n):
    odd_count = sum((1 for num in arr if num % 2 != 0))
    even_count = n - odd_count
    return odd_count * even_count + odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2





# Execution Summary:
The function `func_1` accepts a list of non-negative integers `arr` and a positive integer `n` such that `0 <= n <= len(arr)`. It calculates the count of odd numbers in the list `arr` and assigns it to `odd_count`. It then calculates the count of even numbers by subtracting `odd_count` from `n` and assigns it to `even_count`. Finally, it returns the value of `odd_count * (even_count * (even_count - 1) // 2) + odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2`.

This formula computes a value based on the counts of odd and even numbers in the list. Specifically, it involves the number of ways to choose pairs of even numbers, the number of ways to choose pairs of odd numbers, and the number of ways to pair each odd number with an even number.

Potential edge cases include:
- If `arr` is empty, `odd_count` will be 0 and `even_count` will be `n` (if `n` is less than or equal to `len(arr)`), resulting in a return value of 0.
- If `arr` contains only odd numbers, `even_count` will be 0, and the return value will be `odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2`, representing the number of ways to choose pairs of odd numbers.
- If `arr` contains only even numbers, `odd_count` will be 0, and the return value will be 0.

The annotation mentions the formula `odd_count * (even_count * (even_count - 1) // 2) + odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2`, but the actual code uses `odd_count * even_count * (even_count - 1) // 2 + odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2`, which is consistent with the given return postconditions.
