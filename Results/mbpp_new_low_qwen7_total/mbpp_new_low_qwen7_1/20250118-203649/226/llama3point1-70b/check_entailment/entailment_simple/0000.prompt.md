Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Write a python function to count the number of pairs whose xor value is odd.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of non-negative integers, and n is a positive integer such that 0 <= n <= len(arr).
def func_1(arr, n):
    odd_count = sum(1 for num in arr if num % 2 != 0)

even_count = n - odd_count
    return odd_count * even_count + odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2
    #`odd_count * (even_count * (even_count - 1) // 2) + odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2` where `even_count = n - odd_count`


# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
