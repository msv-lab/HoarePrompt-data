### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic of the given function step by step.

1. **Odd Count Calculation**: 
   - The variable `odd_count` is correctly calculated as the count of odd numbers in the list `arr`. This is done using the generator expression `sum(1 for num in arr if num % 2 != 0)`.

2. **Even Count Calculation**:
   - The variable `even_count` is defined as `n - odd_count`, which is correct because `n` is the total number of elements in `arr`.

3. **Return Value**:
   - The function returns `odd_count * even_count + odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2`.
     - `odd_count * even_count` counts the number of pairs where one element is odd and the other is even.
     - `odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2` counts the number of pairs where both elements are odd.

However, there is a discrepancy between the annotated formula and the actual implementation:
- The annotated formula is `odd_count * (even_count * (even_count - 1) // 2) + odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2`.
- The actual implementation is `odd_count * even_count + odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2`.

The annotated formula incorrectly calculates the number of pairs where both elements are even, which is not relevant to the problem. We only need to consider pairs where at least one element is odd to get an odd XOR result.

### Conclusion:
The actual implementation is correct, but the provided annotation is misleading. Despite this, the function itself works as intended and returns the correct count of pairs whose XOR value is odd.

### Correctness:
**True**

The function is correct in terms of its logic and output, even though the provided comment is incorrect.
