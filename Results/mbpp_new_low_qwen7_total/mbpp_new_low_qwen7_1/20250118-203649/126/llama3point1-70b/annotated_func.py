#State of the program right berfore the function call: side_length is a positive floating-point or integer number.
def func_1(side_length):
    return 4 * side_length ** 2
    #The program returns 4 multiplied by the square of the side_length, which is a positive floating-point or integer number
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `side_length`, which must be a positive floating-point or integer number. It calculates and returns the value of 4 multiplied by the square of `side_length`. There are no potential edge cases or missing functionality noted in the provided code; the code accurately performs the intended operation. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it returns a single value, which is the result of the calculation `4 * side_length
