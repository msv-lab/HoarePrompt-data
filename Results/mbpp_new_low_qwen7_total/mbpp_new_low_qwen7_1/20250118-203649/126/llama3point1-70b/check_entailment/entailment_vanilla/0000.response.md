Reasoning: 
The formula for the lateral surface area (LSA) of a cube is given by \(4 \times \text{side length}^2\). The provided function `func_1` correctly implements this formula by multiplying the square of the side length by 4. Since the formula and implementation match, the function should correctly calculate the lateral surface area of a cube for any valid input.

Correctness: **True**
