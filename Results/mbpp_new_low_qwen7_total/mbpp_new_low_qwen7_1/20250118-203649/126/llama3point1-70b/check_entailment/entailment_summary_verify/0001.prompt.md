You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Write a function to find the lateral surface area of a cube given its side length.

- Program:
def func_1(side_length):
    return 4 * side_length ** 2



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `side_length`, which must be a positive floating-point or integer number. It calculates and returns the value of 4 multiplied by the square of `side_length`. There are no potential edge cases or missing functionality noted in the provided code; the code accurately performs the intended operation. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it returns a single value, which is the result of the calculation `4 * side_length

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning: 
The formula for the lateral surface area (LSA) of a cube is given by \(4 \times \text{side length}^2\). The provided function `func_1` correctly implements this formula by multiplying the square of the side length by 4. Since the formula and implementation match, the function should correctly calculate the lateral surface area of a cube for any valid input.

Correctness: **True**

End of Original Assessment

Reasoning: [Your explanation]
Final: **True** or **False**
