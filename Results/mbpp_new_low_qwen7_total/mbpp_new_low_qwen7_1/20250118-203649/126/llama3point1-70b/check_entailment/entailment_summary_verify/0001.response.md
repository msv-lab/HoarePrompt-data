Reasoning: 
The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the formula for the lateral surface area (LSA) of a cube, which is indeed \(4 \times \text{side length}^2\). The function summary also accurately describes the function's operation, indicating that it takes a positive floating-point or integer `side_length` and returns the calculated LSA. Given that the formula and the implementation match, and there are no edge cases or missing functionalities mentioned, the function will correctly compute the LSA for any valid input.

Final: **True**
