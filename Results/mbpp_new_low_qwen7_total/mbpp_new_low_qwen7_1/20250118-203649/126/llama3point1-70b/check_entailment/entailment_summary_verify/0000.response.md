Reasoning: 
The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly implements the formula for calculating the lateral surface area of a cube, which is \(4 \times \text{side\_length}^2\). Given the problem description and the function summary, there are no edge cases or potential inputs that would cause the function to behave incorrectly. The function accepts a positive floating-point or integer number as the side length and returns the correct lateral surface area.

Final: **True**
