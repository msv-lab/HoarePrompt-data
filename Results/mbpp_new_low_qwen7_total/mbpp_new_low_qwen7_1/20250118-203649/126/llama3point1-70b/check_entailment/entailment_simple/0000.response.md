Reasoning:
The problem statement asks for a function to calculate the lateral surface area of a cube given its side length. The lateral surface area of a cube is the area of the four sides excluding the top and bottom faces. For a cube with side length \( s \), the formula for the lateral surface area is \( 4s^2 \).

Looking at the provided code:
```python
def func_1(side_length):
    return 4 * side_length ** 2
```
- The function `func_1` takes one parameter, `side_length`, which is expected to be a positive floating-point or integer number.
- The function correctly calculates the lateral surface area using the formula \( 4 \times \text{side\_length}^2 \).
- There are no logical errors or mistakes in the implementation.

Given that the function implements the correct formula for the lateral surface area of a cube, the provided program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
