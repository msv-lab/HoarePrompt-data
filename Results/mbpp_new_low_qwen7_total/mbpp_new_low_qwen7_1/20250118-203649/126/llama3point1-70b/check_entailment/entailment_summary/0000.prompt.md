Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Write a function to find the lateral surface area of a cube given its side length.

# Program:
def func_1(side_length):
    return 4 * side_length ** 2





# Execution Summary:
The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `side_length`, which must be a positive floating-point or integer number. It calculates and returns the value of 4 multiplied by the square of `side_length`. There are no potential edge cases or missing functionality noted in the provided code; the code accurately performs the intended operation. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it returns a single value, which is the result of the calculation `4 * side_length


# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
