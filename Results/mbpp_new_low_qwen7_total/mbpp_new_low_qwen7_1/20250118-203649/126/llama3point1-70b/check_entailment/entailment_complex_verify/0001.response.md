Reasoning: 
The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the formula for the lateral surface area (LSA) of a cube, which is \(4 \times \text{side length}^2\). The function takes a single parameter `side_length` and returns the calculated LSA. The annotation clearly states that the function multiplies the square of `side_length` by 4, which is precisely what the formula requires. Given that the input is a positive floating-point or integer number (as stated in the annotated code), the function will correctly compute the LSA for any valid input.

Final: **True**
