Reasoning: 
The original assessment is accurate. The problem description asks for the lateral surface area of a cube, and the formula provided in the problem description is indeed \(4 \times \text{side length}^2\). The function `func_1` correctly implements this formula by returning \(4 \times \text{side\_length}^2\).

The annotation correctly states that the program returns 4 multiplied by the square of the side length, which aligns with the intended behavior of calculating the lateral surface area of a cube. Given that the formula and the implementation match, the function will correctly compute the lateral surface area for any valid input, which is a positive floating-point or integer number.

Final: **True**
