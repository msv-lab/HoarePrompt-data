Reasoning:
The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the lateral surface area of a cube given its side length. The formula for the lateral surface area of a cube is \(4 \times \text{side length}^2\). 

In the annotated program:
- The function `func_1` correctly takes a parameter `side_length`.
- It returns the correct formula for the lateral surface area, which is \(4 \times \text{side length}^2\).

There are no potential edge cases mentioned, and the logic of the function matches the mathematical formula for the lateral surface area of a cube. Therefore, the function is correct based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
