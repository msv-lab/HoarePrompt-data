The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst`, which is a list of any type, and `n`, which is a positive integer such that `n > 0`. The function returns a list of sublists, where each sublist contains every nth element from the original list `lst`, starting from each index from 0 to `n-1`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, and returns a list of sublists containing every nth element from `lst`, starting from each index from 0 to `n-1`.**
