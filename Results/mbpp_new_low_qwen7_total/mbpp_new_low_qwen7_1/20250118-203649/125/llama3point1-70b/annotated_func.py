#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of any type, and n is a positive integer such that n > 0.
def func_1(lst, n):
    return [lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]
    #The program returns a list of sublists, where each sublist contains every nth element from the original list `lst`, starting from each index from 0 to n-1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`. It returns a list of sublists, where each sublist contains every nth element from the original list `lst`, starting from each index from 0 to `n-1`. Specifically, the function creates a list of `n` sublists. Each sublist starts from an index in the range `[0, n-1)` and includes elements from `lst` that are `n` positions apart. For example, if `n=3`, the first sublist will contain elements at indices 0, 3, 6, ..., the second sublist will contain elements at indices 1, 4, 7, ..., and so on. If `lst` has fewer than `n` elements, some sublists will be empty. If `n` is greater than the length of `lst`, the function will still create `n` sublists, but some will be empty.
