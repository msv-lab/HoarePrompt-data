### Reasoning:

The given function `func_1` aims to split a list into sublists such that each sublist contains every nth element from the original list, starting from each index from 0 to n-1. Let's analyze the code step by step:

1. **List Comprehension**: The line `[lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]` uses a list comprehension to create a new list of sublists.
2. **Slicing with Step `n`**: Inside the list comprehension, `lst[i::n]` slices the list `lst` starting from index `i` and taking every `n`th element thereafter.
3. **Loop through Indices**: The outer loop `for i in range(n)` iterates over indices from 0 to n-1, ensuring that each start index for slicing is covered.

Given this logic, the function should correctly generate the required sublists. Here's an example to illustrate:

```python
lst = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
n = 3
result = func_1(lst, n)
print(result)  # Output: [[0, 3, 6, 9], [1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 8]]
```

In this example:
- For `i=0`, the slice `lst[0::3]` results in `[0, 3, 6, 9]`.
- For `i=1`, the slice `lst[1::3]` results in `[1, 4, 7]`.
- For `i=2`, the slice `lst[2::3]` results in `[2, 5, 8]`.

This matches the problem statement and the expected behavior of the function.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the function appears to be implemented correctly according to the problem description.

### Response:
Correctness: **True**
