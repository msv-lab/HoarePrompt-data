Reasoning:
The provided program implements the functionality as described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and an integer `n` and uses a list comprehension to generate a new list containing sublists. Each sublist is created by slicing `lst` from an initial index `i` (where `i` ranges from `0` to `n-1`) with a step of `n`.

Let's verify this by breaking down the key aspects:

1. **List Comprehension**: The line `[lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]` is used to generate the sublists.
   - `lst[i::n]` slices the list starting from index `i` with a step of `n`.
   - `for i in range(n)` ensures that we start from each index from `0` to `n-1`.

2. **Behavior Verification**:
   - For `n=3`, the function will produce three sublists:
     - First sublist: `lst[0::3]` (elements at indices 0, 3, 6, ...)
     - Second sublist: `lst[1::3]` (elements at indices 1, 4, 7, ...)
     - Third sublist: `lst[2::3]` (elements at indices 2, 5, 8, ...)

   - This matches the expected behavior described in the execution summary.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `lst` has fewer than `n` elements, the extra sublists will indeed be empty.
   - If `n` is greater than the length of `lst`, the function will still attempt to create `n` sublists, but some will be empty due to the constraints of slicing.

Given this analysis, the implementation of the function `func_1` aligns perfectly with the problem statement and the execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
