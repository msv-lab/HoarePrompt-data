Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly split the list for every nth element. According to the problem description, the function should return a list of lists, where each inner list contains every nth element starting from the ith element. However, the current implementation returns a single list where elements are skipped by n positions.

For example, consider the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `n = 2`. The expected output is `[[1, 3, 5], [2, 4]]`, but the program will return `[[1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 5]]`.

The correct implementation should be:
```python
def func_1(lst, n):
    return [lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]
```

This will correctly split the list into sublists starting from every nth element.
