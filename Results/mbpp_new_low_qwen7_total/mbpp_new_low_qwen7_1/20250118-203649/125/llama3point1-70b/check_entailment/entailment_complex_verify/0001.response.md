Reasoning:
Let's re-evaluate the program based on the given problem description and the annotated code. The function `func_1` is supposed to split a list into sublists every nth element. We need to ensure that the function behaves as intended for all possible cases.

1. **List Comprehension Analysis**:
   - The list comprehension `[lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]` indeed creates a new list where each element is a slice of the original list `lst`.
   - For each `i` in `range(n)`, `lst[i::n]` starts at index `i` and takes every `n`th element from there.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Case 1**: When `n` is greater than the length of `lst`.
     - In this case, the function will still create `n` sublists, but some of them will be empty because there won't be enough elements in `lst` to fill the sublists. For example, if `lst = [1, 2, 3]` and `n = 4`, the output will be `[[], [], [], []]`.
   - **Case 2**: When `lst` has fewer than `n` elements.
     - Similar to the previous case, the function will still create `n` sublists, but some of them will be empty. For example, if `lst = [1]` and `n = 2`, the output will be `[[1], []]`.

3. **Behavior Verification**:
   - The provided examples in the original assessment are correct and confirm that the function works as intended for the given scenarios.
   - However, the function does not handle the edge case where `n` is greater than the length of `lst` properly. The function creates `n` sublists but does not account for the fact that some of them might be empty due to insufficient elements in `lst`.

Given that the function correctly handles the main case (where `n` is less than or equal to the length of `lst`) and the original assessment did not explicitly mention the handling of the edge case, we can conclude that the function is generally correct but needs a slight adjustment to clearly handle the edge case where `n` is greater than the length of `lst`.

Final: **True** (with a note that the function should handle the case where `n` is greater than the length of `lst` more gracefully by returning empty sublists only when necessary).

Note: The function could be improved to return an empty list if `n` is greater than the length of `lst`, ensuring that the number of sublists does not exceed the number of elements in `lst`.
