### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and the annotated version step-by-step to verify the correctness of the function `func_1`.

#### Function Definition:
```python
def func_1(lst, n):
    return [lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]
```

#### Annotated Code Explanation:
- The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`.
- It returns a list of sublists, where each sublist contains every nth element from the original list `lst`, starting from each index from 0 to `n-1`.

#### Example Walkthrough:
1. **Input:** `lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, `n = 2`
   - Sublist starting from index 0 (0th element): `[1, 3, 5]`
   - Sublist starting from index 1 (1st element): `[2, 4]`
   - Therefore, the expected output is `[[1, 3, 5], [2, 4]]`.

2. **Function Execution:**
   ```python
   [lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]
   ```
   - For `i = 0`: `lst[0::2]` gives `[1, 3, 5]`
   - For `i = 1`: `lst[1::2]` gives `[2, 4]`
   - Hence, the output is `[[1, 3, 5], [2, 4]]`.

3. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The annotated code correctly explains the behavior of the function. Each sublist indeed starts from the ith element and contains every nth element.
   - The original assessment incorrectly states that the function returns a single list with elements skipped by n positions, which is not true. The function actually returns a list of sublists as specified.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is inaccurate because it incorrectly claims that the function does not return a list of sublists. The annotated code provides the correct understanding of the function's behavior.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
