Reasoning:
The given function `func_1` aims to split a list into sublists every nth element. Let's analyze how it works:

1. The list comprehension `[lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]` creates a new list where each element is a slice of the original list `lst`.
2. For each `i` in `range(n)`, `lst[i::n]` starts at index `i` and takes every `n`th element from there.
3. This results in `n` sublists, which are returned as a list of lists.

Let's test this with some examples:

- If `lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` and `n = 2`, the expected output should be `[[1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6]]`. The function will return `[[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6][0::2], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6][1::2]]`, which matches the expected output.
- If `lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` and `n = 3`, the expected output should be `[[1, 4], [2, 5], [3, 6]]`. The function will return `[[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6][0::3], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6][1::3], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6][2::3]]`, which also matches the expected output.

Given these examples, the function correctly implements the desired behavior.

Correctness: **True**
