Reasoning:
The provided annotated program accurately describes the behavior of the `func_1` function. The function indeed takes a list `lst` and an integer `n`, and it returns a list of sublists, where each sublist contains every nth element from the original list `lst`, starting from each index from 0 to `n-1`. This matches the problem description perfectly. Therefore, the given Python program correctly implements the specified functionality without any errors or inconsistencies.

Correctness: **True**
