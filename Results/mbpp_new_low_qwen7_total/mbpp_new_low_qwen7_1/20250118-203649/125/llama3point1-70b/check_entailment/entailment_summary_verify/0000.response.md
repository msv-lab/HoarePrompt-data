### Your Response:

Reasoning:
The original assessment is **inaccurate**. Let's break down the function and its intended behavior based on the provided function summary and the actual code.

1. **Function Summary and Code Analysis:**
   - The function summary states that `func_1` returns a list of sublists, where each sublist contains every nth element from the original list `lst`, starting from each index from 0 to `n-1`.
   - The provided code is exactly as follows:
     ```python
     def func_1(lst, n):
         return [lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]
     ```
   - This code uses a list comprehension to generate a list of sublists. For each index `i` in the range `[0, n)`, it creates a sublist starting from `i` and including every nth element thereafter.

2. **Example Walkthrough:**
   - Consider the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `n = 2`:
     - `lst[0::2]` will give `[1, 3, 5]` (starting from index 0, taking every 2nd element).
     - `lst[1::2]` will give `[2, 4]` (starting from index 1, taking every 2nd element).
   - Therefore, the output should be `[[1, 3, 5], [2, 4]]`.

3. **Verification with the Provided Summary:**
   - The summary correctly describes how the function works and matches the provided code.
   - The function does indeed return a list of sublists where each sublist contains every nth element starting from each index from 0 to `n-1`.

Given this analysis, the original assessment incorrectly concluded that the function does not correctly split the list for every nth element. The provided code and the function summary clearly indicate that the function behaves as intended.

### Final:
**True**
