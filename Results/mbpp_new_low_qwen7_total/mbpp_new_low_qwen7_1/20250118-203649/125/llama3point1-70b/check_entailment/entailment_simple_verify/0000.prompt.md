You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Write a function that takes in a list and an integer n and splits a list for every nth element, returning a list of the resulting lists.

- Program: 
def func_1(lst, n):
    return [lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of any type, and n is a positive integer such that n > 0.
def func_1(lst, n):
    return [lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]
    #The program returns a list of sublists, where each sublist contains every nth element from the original list `lst`, starting from each index from 0 to n-1



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly split the list for every nth element. According to the problem description, the function should return a list of lists, where each inner list contains every nth element starting from the ith element. However, the current implementation returns a single list where elements are skipped by n positions.

For example, consider the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `n = 2`. The expected output is `[[1, 3, 5], [2, 4]]`, but the program will return `[[1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 5]]`.

The correct implementation should be:
```python
def func_1(lst, n):
    return [lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]
```

This will correctly split the list into sublists starting from every nth element.
