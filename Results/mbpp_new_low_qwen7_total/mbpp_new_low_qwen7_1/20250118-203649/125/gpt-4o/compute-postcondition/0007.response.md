Let's analyze the given code and the provided information step by step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Code and Initial State

- **Initial State**: 
  - `lst`: A list.
  - `n`: A positive integer such that \(0 < n \leq \text{len}(lst)\).
  - `result`: A list of `n` empty lists.

- **Loop Code**:
  ```python
  for i, element in enumerate(lst):
      result[i % n].append(element)
  ```

### Step 2: Track Variable Changes

- **Invariants**:
  - The length of `result` remains `n` throughout the loop.
  - `n` remains unchanged since it is a constant value from the initial state.

- **Variables that change**:
  - `i`: This variable increments from `0` to `len(lst) - 1`.
  - `element`: This variable takes the value of each element in `lst` as the loop iterates.
  - `result`: The contents of `result` are updated based on the values of `i` and `element`.

### Step 3: Summarize the Loop Behavior

- For each iteration of the loop:
  - `i` increments by 1.
  - `element` becomes the current element in `lst` at index `i`.
  - `result[i % n]` appends the `element` to the corresponding sublist in `result`.

- If the loop completes:
  - Each sublist in `result` will contain elements from `lst` starting from the position `i % n` and wrapping around if necessary.

### Step 4: Verify Relationships

- The loop will execute `len(lst)` times if `lst` is not empty.
- After the loop completes, `result` will have sublists where the first sublist (`result[0]`) contains elements from `lst` starting from index `0` to `n-1`, the second sublist (`result[1]`) contains elements from `lst` starting from index `1` to `n`, and so on.

### Final Output State

Since the loop will iterate over all elements in `lst`, the final output state will be:

- `lst`: Unchanged.
- `n`: Unchanged.
- `result`: A list of `n` sublists, where the `k`-th sublist contains elements from `lst` starting from index `k` to `k + len(lst) - 1` modulo `n`.

**Output State:**
```
result: [[lst[0], lst[1], ..., lst[n-1]], [lst[n], lst[n+1], ..., lst[2*n-1]], ..., [lst[len(lst)-n], lst[len(lst)-n+1], ..., lst[len(lst)-1]]]
```
