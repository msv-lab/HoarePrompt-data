The code `result = [[] for _ in range(n)]` creates a list of `n` empty lists and assigns it to the variable `result`. The initial state of `lst` and `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `lst` is a list, and `n` is a positive integer such that 0 < n <= len(lst); `result` is a list of `n` empty lists.

Output State: **`lst` is a list, and `n` is a positive integer such that 0 < n <= len(lst); `result` is a list of `n` empty lists**
