Let's break down the problem step by step to determine what must hold true for the states of the objects in the loop head for the loop to execute the first time.

### Given Information:
- `lst` is a list.
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(0 < n \leq \text{len(lst)}\).
- `result` is a list of `n` empty lists.

### Loop:
```python
for (i, element) in enumerate(lst):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variables in the loop header**: The loop header uses `enumerate(lst)`, which means that `i` and `element` are generated from the enumeration of `lst`.
2. **First Iteration Conditions**:
   - For the loop to execute at least once, the list `lst` must contain at least one element.
   - The variable `i` should start from 0, as `enumerate` starts counting from 0.
   - The variable `element` should be the first element of `lst`.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute the first time, the following conditions must hold true:
- The list `lst` must have at least one element.
- The index `i` must be 0.
- The element `element` must be the first element of `lst`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`lst` must have at least one element, `i` is 0, and `element` is the first element of `lst`**.
