`result` is an undefined variable in the initial state, and the code attempts to append `element` to `result[i % n]`. Since `result` is not defined, the code will raise an error and the initial state remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`lst` must have at least one element, `i` is 1, `element` is the second element of `lst`, `result` is undefined (error raised)**
