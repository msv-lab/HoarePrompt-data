The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst`, which is a list, and `n`, which is a positive integer such that `0 < n <= len(lst)`. The function returns a list of `n` sublists, where the `k`-th sublist contains elements from `lst` starting from index `k` to `k + len(lst) - 1` modulo `n`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, and return a list of `n` sublists, where each sublist contains elements from `lst` starting from index `k` to `k + len(lst) - 1` modulo `n`.
