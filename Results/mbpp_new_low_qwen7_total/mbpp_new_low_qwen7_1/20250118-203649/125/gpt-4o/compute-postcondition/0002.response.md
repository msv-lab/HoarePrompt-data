`result[i % n].append(element)` will append the value of `element` to the list at index `i % n` in `result`. Given the initial state, `i` is 0 and `element` is the first element of `lst`. Since `i` is 0, `i % n` will be 0 (assuming `n` is the length of `result`). 

- `result[0]` will now include `element`.
- `i` remains unchanged as the code does not modify its value.
- `element` remains the first element of `lst` since the code does not modify it.

Output State: **`lst` must have at least one element, `i` is 0, `element` is the first element of `lst`, and `result[0]` contains the first element of `lst`.**
