You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list, and n is a positive integer such that 0 < n <= len(lst).
def func_1(lst, n):
    result = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for (i, element) in enumerate(lst):
        result[i % n].append(element)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Let's analyze the given code and the provided information step by step.
    #
    #### Step 1: Analyze the Code and Initial State
    #
    #- **Initial State**: 
    #  - `lst`: A list.
    #  - `n`: A positive integer such that \(0 < n \leq \text{len}(lst)\).
    #  - `result`: A list of `n` empty lists.
    #
    #- **Loop Code**:
    #  ```python
    #  for i, element in enumerate(lst):
    #      result[i % n].append(element)
    #  ```
    #
    #### Step 2: Track Variable Changes
    #
    #- **Invariants**:
    #  - The length of `result` remains `n` throughout the loop.
    #  - `n` remains unchanged since it is a constant value from the initial state.
    #
    #- **Variables that change**:
    #  - `i`: This variable increments from `0` to `len(lst) - 1`.
    #  - `element`: This variable takes the value of each element in `lst` as the loop iterates.
    #  - `result`: The contents of `result` are updated based on the values of `i` and `element`.
    #
    #### Step 3: Summarize the Loop Behavior
    #
    #- For each iteration of the loop:
    #  - `i` increments by 1.
    #  - `element` becomes the current element in `lst` at index `i`.
    #  - `result[i % n]` appends the `element` to the corresponding sublist in `result`.
    #
    #- If the loop completes:
    #  - Each sublist in `result` will contain elements from `lst` starting from the position `i % n` and wrapping around if necessary.
    #
    #### Step 4: Verify Relationships
    #
    #- The loop will execute `len(lst)` times if `lst` is not empty.
    #- After the loop completes, `result` will have sublists where the first sublist (`result[0]`) contains elements from `lst` starting from index `0` to `n-1`, the second sublist (`result[1]`) contains elements from `lst` starting from index `1` to `n`, and so on.
    #
    #### Final Output State
    #
    #Since the loop will iterate over all elements in `lst`, the final output state will be:
    #
    #- `lst`: Unchanged.
    #- `n`: Unchanged.
    #- `result`: A list of `n` sublists, where the `k`-th sublist contains elements from `lst` starting from index `k` to `k + len(lst) - 1` modulo `n`.
    #
    #**Output State:**
    #```
    #result: [[lst[0], lst[1], ..., lst[n-1]], [lst[n], lst[n+1], ..., lst[2*n-1]], ..., [lst[len(lst)-n], lst[len(lst)-n+1], ..., lst[len(lst)-1]]]
    #```
    return result
    #`result` is a list of `n` sublists, where the `k`-th sublist contains elements from `lst` starting from index `k` to `k + len(lst) - 1` modulo `n`, and `n` is a positive integer such that `0 < n <= len(lst)`
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, and returns a list of `n` sublists, where the `k`-th sublist contains elements from `lst` starting from index `k` to `k + len(lst) - 1` modulo `n`.

```

Return Postconditions: `result` is a list of `n` sublists, where the `k`-th sublist contains elements from `lst` starting from index `k` to `k + len(lst) - 1` modulo `n`, and `n` is a positive integer such that `0 < n <= len(lst)`


Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
