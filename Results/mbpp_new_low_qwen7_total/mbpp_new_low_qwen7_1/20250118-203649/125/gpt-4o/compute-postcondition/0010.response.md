Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, and returns a list of `n` sublists. Each sublist contains elements from `lst` starting from index `k` to `k + len(lst) - 1` modulo `n`. Specifically, the `k`-th sublist contains elements from `lst[k % len(lst)]` to `lst[(k + len(lst) - 1) % len(lst)]`. The function ensures that `0 < n <= len(lst)` and handles the case when `lst` is empty by creating an empty `result` list.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If `lst` is empty, the function returns an empty list.
- If `n` is equal to `len(lst)`, the function returns `lst` itself split into `n` sublists of equal size, with the last sublist possibly being smaller if `len(lst)` is not divisible by `n`.

**Missing Functionality:**
- There are no missing functionalities in the provided code; the code accurately implements the described behavior.
