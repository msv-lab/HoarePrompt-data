The only objects in the loop head are variables `i`, `element`, and `lst`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `lst` and `i`. For the loop to execute again, `lst` must have at least two elements, and `i` must be 1 because the first iteration sets `i` to 0.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `lst` must have at least one element.
- `i` is 0.
- `element` is the first element of `lst`.
- `result[0]` contains the first element of `lst`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1.
- `element` becomes the second element of `lst`.
- `lst` must still have at least one element to continue the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`lst` must have at least one element, `i` is 1, `element` is the second element of `lst`**
