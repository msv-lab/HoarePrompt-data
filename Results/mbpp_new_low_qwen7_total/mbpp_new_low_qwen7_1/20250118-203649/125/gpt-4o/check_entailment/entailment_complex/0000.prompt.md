Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Write a function that takes in a list and an integer n and splits a list for every nth element, returning a list of the resulting lists.

# Annotated Program:
assert func_1(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n'], 3) == [['a', 'd', 'g', 'j', 'm'], ['b', 'e', 'h', 'k', 'n'], ['c', 'f', 'i', 'l']]
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 3) == [[1, 4, 7, 10, 13], [2, 5, 8, 11, 14], [3, 6, 9, 12]]
assert func_1(['python', 'java', 'C', 'C++', 'DBMS', 'SQL'], 2) == [['python', 'C', 'DBMS'], ['java', 'C++', 'SQL']]

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list, and n is a positive integer such that 0 < n <= len(lst).
def func_1(lst, n):
    result = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for (i, element) in enumerate(lst):
        result[i % n].append(element)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Let's analyze the given code and the provided information step by step.
    #
    #### Step 1: Analyze the Code and Initial State
    #
    #- **Initial State**: 
    #  - `lst`: A list.
    #  - `n`: A positive integer such that \(0 < n \leq \text{len}(lst)\).
    #  - `result`: A list of `n` empty lists.
    #
    #- **Loop Code**:
    #  ```python
    #  for i, element in enumerate(lst):
    #      result[i % n].append(element)
    #  ```
    #
    #### Step 2: Track Variable Changes
    #
    #- **Invariants**:
    #  - The length of `result` remains `n` throughout the loop.
    #  - `n` remains unchanged since it is a constant value from the initial state.
    #
    #- **Variables that change**:
    #  - `i`: This variable increments from `0` to `len(lst) - 1`.
    #  - `element`: This variable takes the value of each element in `lst` as the loop iterates.
    #  - `result`: The contents of `result` are updated based on the values of `i` and `element`.
    #
    #### Step 3: Summarize the Loop Behavior
    #
    #- For each iteration of the loop:
    #  - `i` increments by 1.
    #  - `element` becomes the current element in `lst` at index `i`.
    #  - `result[i % n]` appends the `element` to the corresponding sublist in `result`.
    #
    #- If the loop completes:
    #  - Each sublist in `result` will contain elements from `lst` starting from the position `i % n` and wrapping around if necessary.
    #
    #### Step 4: Verify Relationships
    #
    #- The loop will execute `len(lst)` times if `lst` is not empty.
    #- After the loop completes, `result` will have sublists where the first sublist (`result[0]`) contains elements from `lst` starting from index `0` to `n-1`, the second sublist (`result[1]`) contains elements from `lst` starting from index `1` to `n`, and so on.
    #
    #### Final Output State
    #
    #Since the loop will iterate over all elements in `lst`, the final output state will be:
    #
    #- `lst`: Unchanged.
    #- `n`: Unchanged.
    #- `result`: A list of `n` sublists, where the `k`-th sublist contains elements from `lst` starting from index `k` to `k + len(lst) - 1` modulo `n`.
    #
    #**Output State:**
    #```
    #result: [[lst[0], lst[1], ..., lst[n-1]], [lst[n], lst[n+1], ..., lst[2*n-1]], ..., [lst[len(lst)-n], lst[len(lst)-n+1], ..., lst[len(lst)-1]]]
    #```
    return result
    #`result` is a list of `n` sublists, where the `k`-th sublist contains elements from `lst` starting from index `k` to `k + len(lst) - 1` modulo `n`, and `n` is a positive integer such that `0 < n <= len(lst)`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, and returns a list of `n` sublists. Each sublist contains elements from `lst` starting from index `k` to `k + len(lst) - 1` modulo `n`. Specifically, the `k`-th sublist contains elements from `lst[k % len(lst)]` to `lst[(k + len(lst) - 1) % len(lst)]`. The function ensures that `0 < n <= len(lst)` and handles the case when `lst` is empty by creating an empty `result` list.
