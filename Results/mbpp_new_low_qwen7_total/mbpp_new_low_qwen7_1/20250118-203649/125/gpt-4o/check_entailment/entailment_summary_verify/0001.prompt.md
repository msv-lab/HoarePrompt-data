You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Write a function that takes in a list and an integer n and splits a list for every nth element, returning a list of the resulting lists.

- Program:
assert func_1(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n'], 3) == [['a', 'd', 'g', 'j', 'm'], ['b', 'e', 'h', 'k', 'n'], ['c', 'f', 'i', 'l']]
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 3) == [[1, 4, 7, 10, 13], [2, 5, 8, 11, 14], [3, 6, 9, 12]]
assert func_1(['python', 'java', 'C', 'C++', 'DBMS', 'SQL'], 2) == [['python', 'C', 'DBMS'], ['java', 'C++', 'SQL']]

def func_1(lst, n):
    result = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for (i, element) in enumerate(lst):
        result[i % n].append(element)
    return result



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, and returns a list of `n` sublists. Each sublist contains elements from `lst` starting from index `k` to `k + len(lst) - 1` modulo `n`. Specifically, the `k`-th sublist contains elements from `lst[k % len(lst)]` to `lst[(k + len(lst) - 1) % len(lst)]`. The function ensures that `0 < n <= len(lst)` and handles the case when `lst` is empty by creating an empty `result` list.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to split the input list into sublists based on the nth element. However, the current implementation does not actually split the list every nth element as required. Instead, it places each element into one of `n` sublists based on the index modulo `n`.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to create new sublists every nth element. The given test cases suggest that the desired behavior is to split the list into sublists where each sublist contains every nth element starting from the beginning of the list.

Let's review the provided test cases:
- For `func_1(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n'], 3)`, the expected output is `[['a', 'd', 'g', 'j', 'm'], ['b', 'e', 'h', 'k', 'n'], ['c', 'f', 'i', 'l', 'n']]`. This suggests that we should take every 3rd element starting from the first element.
- For `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 3)`, the expected output is `[[1, 4, 7, 10, 13], [2, 5, 8, 11, 14], [3, 6, 9, 12]]`. Again, this indicates taking every 3rd element starting from each position.
- For `func_1(['python', 'java', 'C', 'C++', 'DBMS', 'SQL'], 2)`, the expected output is `[['python', 'C', 'DBMS'], ['java', 'C++', 'SQL']]`. This shows taking every 2nd element starting from each position.

The current implementation does not achieve this. We need to modify the code to ensure that elements are grouped into sublists based on their position relative to `n`.

Given the above analysis, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
