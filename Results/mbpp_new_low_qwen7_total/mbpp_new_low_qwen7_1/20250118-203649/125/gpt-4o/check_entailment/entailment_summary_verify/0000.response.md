### Reasoning:

The original assessment incorrectly characterizes the behavior of the function `func_1`. Let's break down the problem and the function:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to split a list into sublists every nth element. However, the provided function does not perform this exact operation. Instead, it distributes elements across sublists based on their index modulo `n`.

2. **Function Summary**: The summary describes the function as distributing elements such that each sublist contains elements from `lst[k % len(lst)]` to `lst[(k + len(lst) - 1) % len(lst)]`. This means that each sublist will contain elements with indices that, when taken modulo `len(lst)`, fall within a specific range determined by `k`.

3. **Function Code Analysis**:
   ```python
   def func_1(lst, n):
       result = [[] for _ in range(n)]
       for (i, element) in enumerate(lst):
           result[i % n].append(element)
       return result
   ```
   - The function initializes a list of `n` empty sublists.
   - It then iterates over the elements of the input list `lst` using `enumerate`.
   - For each element, it appends the element to the sublist indexed by `i % n`.

This approach indeed distributes the elements of `lst` across `n` sublists. For example:
- For `lst = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n']` and `n = 3`:
  - The first sublist will contain elements at indices 0, 3, 6, 9, 12 (mod 13).
  - The second sublist will contain elements at indices 1, 4, 7, 10, 13 (mod 13).
  - The third sublist will contain elements at indices 2, 5, 8, 11, 14 (mod 13).

Given the provided assertions, the function appears to be working as intended. The function does not explicitly split the list every nth element but rather distributes the elements across `n` sublists in a round-robin fashion. 

Since the provided function satisfies the requirement of distributing elements across `n` sublists and the provided assertions confirm its correctness, the original assessment is inaccurate.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
