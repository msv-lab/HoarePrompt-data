You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Write a function that takes in a list and an integer n and splits a list for every nth element, returning a list of the resulting lists.

- Program:
assert func_1(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n'], 3) == [['a', 'd', 'g', 'j', 'm'], ['b', 'e', 'h', 'k', 'n'], ['c', 'f', 'i', 'l']]
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 3) == [[1, 4, 7, 10, 13], [2, 5, 8, 11, 14], [3, 6, 9, 12]]
assert func_1(['python', 'java', 'C', 'C++', 'DBMS', 'SQL'], 2) == [['python', 'C', 'DBMS'], ['java', 'C++', 'SQL']]

def func_1(lst, n):
    result = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for (i, element) in enumerate(lst):
        result[i % n].append(element)
    return result



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, and returns a list of `n` sublists. Each sublist contains elements from `lst` starting from index `k` to `k + len(lst) - 1` modulo `n`. Specifically, the `k`-th sublist contains elements from `lst[k % len(lst)]` to `lst[(k + len(lst) - 1) % len(lst)]`. The function ensures that `0 < n <= len(lst)` and handles the case when `lst` is empty by creating an empty `result` list.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` does not split the list into sublists at every nth element. Instead, it distributes elements across sublists based on their index modulo n. This means that for the given examples, the function works correctly, but it does not meet the requirement of splitting the list at every nth element. For instance, if we call `func_1(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n'], 3)`, the expected output would be [['a', 'd', 'g', 'j', 'm'], ['b', 'e', 'h', 'k', 'n'], ['c', 'f', 'i', 'l', 'n']], but the function returns [['a', 'd', 'g', 'j', 'm'], ['b', 'e', 'h', 'k', 'n'], ['c', 'f', 'i', 'l']]. The last sublist is not split as expected because the original list length is not a multiple of n. Thus, the function does not correctly implement the described behavior for all potential cases.
