Reasoning:
The original assessment is inaccurate. Let's analyze the provided program and its behavior based on the problem description and the function summary.

The problem requires splitting a list into sublists such that every nth element forms a new sublist. The function summary correctly describes this behavior, stating that the `k`-th sublist contains elements from `lst[k % len(lst)]` to `lst[(k + len(lst) - 1) % len(lst)]`.

The provided program:
```python
def func_1(lst, n):
    result = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for (i, element) in enumerate(lst):
        result[i % n].append(element)
    return result
```
This program indeed splits the list into `n` sublists, but it does so by distributing the elements of the list into these sublists based on the index modulo `n`. This is consistent with the function summary, which states that each sublist will contain elements from `lst[k % len(lst)]` to `lst[(k + len(lst) - 1) % len(lst)]`.

Let's verify this with the provided test cases:

1. For `func_1(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n'], 3)`, the expected output is `[['a', 'd', 'g', 'j', 'm'], ['b', 'e', 'h', 'k', 'n'], ['c', 'f', 'i', 'l', 'n']]`. The program correctly groups every third element into separate sublists.
2. For `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 3)`, the expected output is `[[1, 4, 7, 10, 13], [2, 5, 8, 11, 14], [3, 6, 9, 12]]`. Again, the program correctly groups every third element into separate sublists.
3. For `func_1(['python', 'java', 'C', 'C++', 'DBMS', 'SQL'], 2)`, the expected output is `[['python', 'C', 'DBMS'], ['java', 'C++', 'SQL']]`. The program correctly groups every second element into separate sublists.

The function summary accurately describes the behavior of the program, and the provided test cases confirm that the program meets the requirements of the problem.

Given this analysis, the original assessment is incorrect because the program does indeed split the list into sublists such that every nth element forms a new sublist, as required.

Final: **True**
