### Reasoning:

Let's carefully review the given program and the provided annotations to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

1. **Problem Description and Requirements**:
   - The function `func_1` should split a list into sublists, with each sublist containing every nth element starting from the respective position.

2. **Original Code Analysis**:
   - The function initializes a list `result` with `n` empty sublists.
   - It uses a for loop with `enumerate` to iterate over the elements of the input list `lst`.
   - For each element, it appends the element to the sublist indexed by `i % n`.

3. **Annotated Code Explanation**:
   - The annotation describes how the `i % n` operation ensures that elements are distributed across `n` sublists in a circular manner.
   - This means that the first element goes into the first sublist, the second element into the second sublist, and so on, with the `n`-th element going back to the first sublist, and so forth.

4. **Verification with Test Cases**:
   - **Test Case 1**: `func_1(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n'], 3)`
     - Expected: `[['a', 'd', 'g', 'j', 'm'], ['b', 'e', 'h', 'k', 'n'], ['c', 'f', 'i', 'l', 'n']]`
     - Actual: `[['a', 'd', 'g', 'j', 'm'], ['b', 'e', 'h', 'k', 'n'], ['c', 'f', 'i', 'l']]`
     - The actual output is correct; there is no extra 'n' in the third sublist.
   - **Test Case 2**: `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 3)`
     - Expected: `[[1, 4, 7, 10, 13], [2, 5, 8, 11, 14], [3, 6, 9, 12]]`
     - Actual: `[[1, 4, 7, 10, 13], [2, 5, 8, 11, 14], [3, 6, 9, 12]]`
     - The actual output matches the expected output perfectly.
   - **Test Case 3**: `func_1(['python', 'java', 'C', 'C++', 'DBMS', 'SQL'], 2)`
     - Expected: `[['python', 'C', 'DBMS'], ['java', 'C++', 'SQL']]`
     - Actual: `[['python', 'C', 'DBMS'], ['java', 'C++', 'SQL']]`
     - The actual output matches the expected output perfectly.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The code correctly groups the elements into sublists based on their position relative to `n`, as demonstrated by the test cases.
   - The provided annotation accurately explains the behavior of the code.
   - The original assessment incorrectly concluded that the program was incorrect because it did not match the initial expectation of splitting every nth element directly. However, the actual behavior is correct according to the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct based on the provided problem description and test cases.
