Reasoning:
The provided function `func_1` aims to split a list into sublists every nth element. However, the logic within the function does not achieve this. Instead, the function places elements into sublists based on their indices modulo `n`, which is not the desired behavior.

For example, consider the first test case:
```python
assert func_1(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n'], 3) == [['a', 'd', 'g', 'j', 'm'], ['b', 'e', 'h', 'k', 'n'], ['c', 'f', 'i', 'l', 'n']]
```
The expected output is every third element, but the function will instead place elements into sublists based on their index modulo 3, which results in the wrong grouping.

A correct implementation would be to use a different approach, such as slicing the list at every nth element. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(lst, n):
    result = []
    for i in range(0, len(lst), n):
        result.append(lst[i:i + n])
    return result
```

This function correctly splits the list into sublists every nth element.

Given the provided code does not match the problem statement and the assertions, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
