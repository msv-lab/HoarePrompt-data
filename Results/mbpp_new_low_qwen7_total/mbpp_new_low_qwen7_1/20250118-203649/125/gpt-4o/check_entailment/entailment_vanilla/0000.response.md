Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to split the input list into sublists based on the nth element. However, the current implementation does not actually split the list every nth element as required. Instead, it places each element into one of `n` sublists based on the index modulo `n`.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to create new sublists every nth element. The given test cases suggest that the desired behavior is to split the list into sublists where each sublist contains every nth element starting from the beginning of the list.

Let's review the provided test cases:
- For `func_1(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n'], 3)`, the expected output is `[['a', 'd', 'g', 'j', 'm'], ['b', 'e', 'h', 'k', 'n'], ['c', 'f', 'i', 'l', 'n']]`. This suggests that we should take every 3rd element starting from the first element.
- For `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 3)`, the expected output is `[[1, 4, 7, 10, 13], [2, 5, 8, 11, 14], [3, 6, 9, 12]]`. Again, this indicates taking every 3rd element starting from each position.
- For `func_1(['python', 'java', 'C', 'C++', 'DBMS', 'SQL'], 2)`, the expected output is `[['python', 'C', 'DBMS'], ['java', 'C++', 'SQL']]`. This shows taking every 2nd element starting from each position.

The current implementation does not achieve this. We need to modify the code to ensure that elements are grouped into sublists based on their position relative to `n`.

Given the above analysis, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
