Reasoning: 

Let's carefully review the given problem description and the provided function:

- **Problem Description**: Write a function that takes in a list and an integer `n` and splits a list for every `n`th element, returning a list of the resulting lists.

- **Given Function**:
  ```python
  def func_1(lst, n):
      result = [[] for _ in range(n)]
      for (i, element) in enumerate(lst):
          result[i % n].append(element)
      return result
  ```

- **Annotated Code**:
  The annotated code provides insights into the behavior of the function. It correctly describes how the function works: it creates a list of `n` empty sublists and then distributes the elements of the input list `lst` into these sublists based on the index `i` modulo `n`.

- **Function Analysis**:
  - The function initializes `result` with `n` empty sublists.
  - It then iterates over the input list `lst` using `enumerate`, which provides both the index `i` and the element.
  - For each element, it appends the element to the sublist at index `i % n` in `result`.
  - This means that elements from `lst` are distributed cyclically among the sublists in `result`.

- **Verification with Examples**:
  - **Example 1**:
    ```python
    assert func_1(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n'], 3) == [['a', 'd', 'g', 'j', 'm'], ['b', 'e', 'h', 'k', 'n'], ['c', 'f', 'i', 'l']]
    ```
    Here, the function correctly groups the elements into sublists based on the index modulo 3.

  - **Example 2**:
    ```python
    assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 3) == [[1, 4, 7, 10, 13], [2, 5, 8, 11, 14], [3, 6, 9, 12]]
    ```
    Similarly, the elements are grouped correctly.

  - **Example 3**:
    ```python
    assert func_1(['python', 'java', 'C', 'C++', 'DBMS', 'SQL'], 2) == [['python', 'C', 'DBMS'], ['java', 'C++', 'SQL']]
    ```
    Again, the elements are correctly grouped into sublists based on the index modulo 2.

- **Conclusion**:
  The function `func_1` indeed splits the list into sublists where the `k`-th sublist contains elements from `lst` starting from index `k` to `k + len(lst) - 1` modulo `n`. This behavior is consistent with the given examples and the problem description.

The original assessment incorrectly states that the function does not split the list at every `n`th element. However, the function does achieve this by distributing elements cyclically based on the index modulo `n`.

Final: **True**
