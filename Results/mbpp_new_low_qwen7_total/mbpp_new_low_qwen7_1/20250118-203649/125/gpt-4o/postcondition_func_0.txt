The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, and returns a list of `n` sublists. Each sublist contains elements from `lst` starting from index `k` to `k + len(lst) - 1` modulo `n`. Specifically, the `k`-th sublist contains elements from `lst[k % len(lst)]` to `lst[(k + len(lst) - 1) % len(lst)]`. The function ensures that `0 < n <= len(lst)` and handles the case when `lst` is empty by creating an empty `result` list.
