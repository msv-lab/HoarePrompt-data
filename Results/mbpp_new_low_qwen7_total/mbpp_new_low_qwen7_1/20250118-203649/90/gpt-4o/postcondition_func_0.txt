The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst` and calculates the number of even and odd pairs within the list. Specifically, it counts the number of ways to choose 2 even numbers (denoted as `even_pairs`) and the number of ways to choose 2 odd numbers (denoted as `odd_pairs`). It then returns the sum of `even_pairs` and `odd_pairs`. This sum represents the total number of unique pairs of either even or odd numbers that can be formed from the input list.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
1. If the input list `lst` is empty, both `even_count` and `odd_count` will be 0, resulting in `even_pairs` and `odd_pairs` also being 0. Therefore, the function correctly returns 0 in this case.
2. The code does not handle the case where the list contains only one element, which would result in both `even_count` and `odd_count` being 0, again leading to `even_pairs` and `odd_pairs` being 0 and the function returning 0. This case is correctly handled by the current implementation.

In summary, the function calculates the number of unique pairs of either even or odd numbers in the input list and returns their sum, with appropriate handling for edge cases like an empty list or a list with a single element.
