### Reasoning:

The function `func_1` aims to count the number of pairs of integers in a list such that their XOR results in an even number. 

For two integers \(a\) and \(b\), their XOR result \(a \oplus b\) will be even if and only if both \(a\) and \(b\) are either even or both are odd. This is because:
- If both numbers are even, their binary representation has all bits even, resulting in another even number when XORed.
- If both numbers are odd, their binary representation has all bits odd in the same positions, resulting in another even number when XORed.

Given this, we can categorize each number in the list as either even or odd. The total number of pairs where both numbers are even is calculated using combinations of even numbers, and similarly for odd numbers. The function calculates these using combinations:
- `even_pairs`: Number of ways to choose 2 even numbers out of `even_count`.
- `odd_pairs`: Number of ways to choose 2 odd numbers out of `odd_count`.

The formula used is correct for calculating combinations:
\[ \text{Combinations} = \frac{n \times (n - 1)}{2} \]

The implementation of the function correctly counts the even and odd numbers in the list, and then computes the number of valid pairs using the combination formulas.

### Conclusion:

Based on the provided assertions and the logic of the function, it appears that the function `func_1` correctly implements the required functionality.

### Response:

Correctness: **True**
