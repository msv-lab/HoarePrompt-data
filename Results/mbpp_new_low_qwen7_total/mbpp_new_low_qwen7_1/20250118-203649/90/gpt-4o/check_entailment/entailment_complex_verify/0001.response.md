### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step against the problem description and the given assertions.

#### Problem Description:
The function should count the number of pairs of integers in a list such that their XOR results in an even number. According to the properties of XOR, the XOR of two numbers is even if and only if both numbers are either even or both are odd.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Counting Even and Odd Numbers:**
   - The program correctly counts the number of even and odd numbers in the list.
   ```python
   even_count = sum(1 for x in lst if x % 2 == 0)
   odd_count = len(lst) - even_count
   ```
2. **Calculating Combinations:**
   - The number of ways to choose 2 even numbers from `even_count` is calculated using combinations:
     ```python
     even_pairs = even_count * (even_count - 1) // 2
     ```
   - Similarly, the number of ways to choose 2 odd numbers from `odd_count` is calculated:
     ```python
     odd_pairs = odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2
     ```
3. **Summing Up Pairs:**
   - The function returns the sum of `even_pairs` and `odd_pairs`:
     ```python
     return even_pairs + odd_pairs
     ```

#### Assertions and Edge Cases:
1. **Empty List:**
   - If the input list is empty, both `even_count` and `odd_count` will be 0, resulting in `even_pairs` and `odd_pairs` being 0. The function correctly returns 0.
   
2. **Single Element List:**
   - If the list contains only one element, both `even_count` and `odd_count` will be 0, again leading to `even_pairs` and `odd_pairs` being 0. The function correctly returns 0.

3. **Multiple Elements:**
   - The provided assertions:
     - `assert func_1([5, 4, 7, 2, 1]) == 4`
     - `assert func_1([7, 2, 8, 1, 0, 5, 11]) == 9`
     - `assert func_1([1, 2, 3]) == 1`
   - These assertions check different scenarios and cover various cases, including lists with mixed even and odd numbers.

#### Verification Using Annotated Code:
- The annotated code correctly explains the logic behind counting even and odd numbers and the calculation of combinations.
- The reasoning aligns with the problem description and the provided assertions.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the program, its logic, and the provided assertions, the function correctly implements the required functionality of counting pairs of integers whose XOR results in an even number.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
