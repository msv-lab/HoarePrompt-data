Reasoning:
- The function `func_1` is designed to count the number of pairs of integers in a list that xor to an even number.
- According to the problem, two integers XOR to an even number if and only if both integers are either even or both are odd.
- The provided code correctly counts the number of even and odd integers in the list and calculates the number of possible pairs of even and odd numbers.
- However, the provided assertions do not fully cover all possible scenarios, especially when there are pairs of numbers that are exactly the same (i.e., identical even or odd numbers).

Let's consider the following test case:
- Input: `[2, 2, 4]`
- Expected output: 3 (pairs: (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 4))

The current implementation will calculate:
- Even count: 3
- Odd count: 0
- Even pairs: \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \)
- Odd pairs: 0
- Total pairs: 3

This seems correct, but let's test another case to ensure the function works for all scenarios:

- Input: `[2, 2, 4, 6]`
- Expected output: 6 (pairs: (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (2, 6), (4, 6), (4, 6))

The current implementation will calculate:
- Even count: 4
- Odd count: 0
- Even pairs: \( \binom{4}{2} = 6 \)
- Odd pairs: 0
- Total pairs: 6

This also seems correct, but we should verify the function against the original assertions and additional edge cases.

Given the provided assertions and the explanation, the function appears to handle the basic logic correctly, but it needs more detailed testing to confirm it covers all possible scenarios.

Conclusion:
- Based on the provided execution summary and reasoning, the function seems to be handling the basic logic correctly, but it requires more comprehensive testing to ensure it works in all cases.
- Given the information provided, the function does not explicitly fail based on the assertions and the explanation.

Correctness: **True**
