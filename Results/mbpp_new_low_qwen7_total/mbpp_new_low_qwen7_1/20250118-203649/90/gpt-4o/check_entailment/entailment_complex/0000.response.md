Reasoning:
The provided program does not actually calculate the number of pairs of integers in the list that xor to an even number. Instead, it calculates the number of ways to pick two even numbers and the number of ways to pick two odd numbers from the list. This is because the XOR of two even numbers or two odd numbers is always even. However, the XOR of an even number and an odd number is always odd. Therefore, the logic correctly identifies the number of even pairs and odd pairs but does not solve the actual problem stated.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to check each pair of numbers in the list to see if their XOR is even. The provided solution does not do this. It simply counts pairs based on the parity of individual numbers, which is not sufficient to solve the problem as described.

Therefore, the function `func_1` does not meet the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
