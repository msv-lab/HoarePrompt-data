Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program calculates the number of pairs in a list whose XOR results in an even number. However, the logic in the function is flawed. Specifically, the program incorrectly calculates the number of even pairs and odd pairs.

The issue lies in the way the number of even and odd pairs are being calculated. The current logic calculates the number of pairs where both elements are either even or both are odd. However, an even XOR result can also occur when one element is even and the other is odd (since even XOR odd = odd, and odd XOR odd = even).

To fix this, the program should calculate the number of pairs where one element is even and the other is odd. This can be done by multiplying the count of even numbers by the count of odd numbers.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(lst):
    even_count = sum(x % 2 == 0 for x in lst)
    odd_count = len(lst) - even_count
    return even_count * (even_count - 1) // 2 + odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2 + even_count * odd_count
```

This corrected function properly accounts for all possible pairs that result in an even XOR value.
