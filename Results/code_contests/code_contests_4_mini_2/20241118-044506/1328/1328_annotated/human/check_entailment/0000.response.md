Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not implement any logic for solving the problem described. The function `func_1()` is defined but not implemented, meaning it does not contain any logic to process the input or solve the knapsack problem as outlined in the problem description. The second function, `func_2()`, appears to be unrelated to the task at hand, as it is designed to print values to a stream but does not contribute to solving the knapsack problem.

To illustrate a specific case where the program fails:
- For an input where `n = 1` and `W = 3` with the item weight being `3`, the expected output is `1` followed by `1`, indicating that the item can be packed into the knapsack. However, since there is no implementation in `func_1()`, the program cannot provide any output, hence it cannot meet the requirements of the problem description.

Since the function does not process any test cases or produce any required output, it is clear that the program is incorrect.
