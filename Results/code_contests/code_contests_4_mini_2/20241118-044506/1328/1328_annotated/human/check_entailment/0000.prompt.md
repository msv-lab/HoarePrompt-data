You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
We have added some annotations within the code to help you understand the code and its logic. The annotations are in the form of comments and are inserted automatically so double check whether the annotations are correct or not and describe the code correctly.
If the annotations are correct use them along with the code to determine the correctness of the code. If the annotations are incorrect then you can ignore them and just use the code to determine the correctness.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You have a knapsack with the capacity of W. There are also n items, the i-th one has weight w_i. 

You want to put some of these items into the knapsack in such a way that their total weight C is at least half of its size, but (obviously) does not exceed it. Formally, C should satisfy: ⌈ W/2⌉ ≤ C ≤ W. 

Output the list of items you will put into the knapsack or determine that fulfilling the conditions is impossible. 

If there are several possible lists of items satisfying the conditions, you can output any. Note that you don't have to maximize the sum of weights of items in the knapsack.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). Description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains integers n and W (1 ≤ n ≤ 200 000, 1≤ W ≤ 10^{18}). 

The second line of each test case contains n integers w_1, w_2, ..., w_n (1 ≤ w_i ≤ 10^9) — weights of the items.

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 200 000.

Output

For each test case, if there is no solution, print a single integer -1. 

If there exists a solution consisting of m items, print m in the first line of the output and m integers j_1, j_2, ..., j_m (1 ≤ j_i ≤ n, all j_i are distinct) in the second line of the output — indices of the items you would like to pack into the knapsack.

If there are several possible lists of items satisfying the conditions, you can output any. Note that you don't have to maximize the sum of weights items in the knapsack.

Example

Input


3
1 3
3
6 2
19 8 19 69 9 4
7 12
1 1 1 17 1 1 1


Output


1
1
-1
6
1 2 3 5 6 7

Note

In the first test case, you can take the item of weight 3 and fill the knapsack just right.

In the second test case, all the items are larger than the knapsack's capacity. Therefore, the answer is -1.

In the third test case, you fill the knapsack exactly in half.
Annotated Program:
```
#Function 1:
def func_1():
    pass

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    """Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default."""
    sep, file = kwargs.pop('sep', ' '), kwargs.pop('file', sys.stdout)
    at_start = True
    for x in args:
        if not at_start:
            file.write(sep)
        
        file.write(str(x))
        
        at_start = False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `if args is a non-empty iterable, then at_start is False after the loop, and file has written all elements of args separated by sep; if args is empty, then at_start remains True, and no elements are written to file.`
    file.write(kwargs.pop('end', '\n'))
    if kwargs.pop('flush', False) :
        file.flush()
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *If `kwargs` contains the key 'flush' with a value of True, then if `args` is a non-empty iterable, all elements of `args` are written to `file` separated by `sep`, `at_start` is False, and the end value from `kwargs` (defaulting to a newline character if not specified) is also written to `file`. If `args` is empty, `at_start` remains True, and no elements are written to `file`, but the end value from `kwargs` is still written to `file`. The `file` is flushed to ensure all data is written out, but the state of the other variables remains unchanged. If `kwargs` does not contain the key 'flush', no action is taken, and the state of `file`, `args`, and `at_start` remains as described in the precondition.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
