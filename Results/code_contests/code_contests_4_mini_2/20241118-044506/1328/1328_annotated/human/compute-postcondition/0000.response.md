Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `W` is a positive integer (1 ≤ W ≤ 10^18), and `w_i` are positive integers (1 ≤ w_i ≤ 10^9). The code prints values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default, and does not change the state of the variables.**
