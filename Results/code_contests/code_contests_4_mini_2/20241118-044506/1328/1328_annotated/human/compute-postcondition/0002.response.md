The variable `at_start` is assigned the value `True`. The states of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `W`, `w_i`, `sep`, and `file`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `W` is a positive integer (1 ≤ W ≤ 10^18), `w_i` are positive integers (1 ≤ w_i ≤ 10^9), `sep` is ' ', `file` is set to sys.stdout, and `at_start` is True.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `W` is a positive integer (1 ≤ W ≤ 10^18), `w_i` are positive integers (1 ≤ w_i ≤ 10^9), `sep` is ' ', `file` is set to sys.stdout, and `at_start` is True.**
