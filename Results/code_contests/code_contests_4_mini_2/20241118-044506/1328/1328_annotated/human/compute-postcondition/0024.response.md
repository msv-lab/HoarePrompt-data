Postcondition: ***If `kwargs` contains the key 'flush' with a value of True, then if `args` is a non-empty iterable, all elements of `args` are written to `file` separated by `sep`, `at_start` is False, and the end value from `kwargs` (defaulting to a newline character if not specified) is also written to `file`. If `args` is empty, `at_start` remains True, and no elements are written to `file`, but the end value from `kwargs` is still written to `file`. The `file` is flushed to ensure all data is written out, but the state of the other variables remains unchanged. If `kwargs` does not contain the key 'flush', no action is taken, and the state of `file`, `args`, and `at_start` remains as described in the precondition.***
