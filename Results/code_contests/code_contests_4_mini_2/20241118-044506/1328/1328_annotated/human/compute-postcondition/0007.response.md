Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `W` is a positive integer (1 ≤ W ≤ 10^18), `w_i` are positive integers (1 ≤ w_i ≤ 10^9), `sep` is a space character, `file` is set to sys.stdout, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable, `x` is the first element of `args`, and a space character is written to the standard output before writing the string representation of `x` to `file`.**
