The function `func_2` accepts multiple parameters indirectly through the number of test cases and their respective values. Specifically, it accepts `t`, a positive integer representing the number of test cases; for each test case, it expects `n`, a positive integer representing the number of items; `W`, a positive integer representing the capacity of the knapsack; and a list of weights `w_i`, which are positive integers representing the weights of the items. 

After executing the function body, based on the input parameters, the function processes the test cases and returns the results for each test case, which typically involves determining the maximum value that can be achieved with the given weights and the knapsack capacity.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a number of test cases along with their respective item counts, knapsack capacities, and item weights, and return results pertaining to the knapsack problem for each test case. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a number of test cases t, for each test case it accepts n (the number of items), W (the capacity of the knapsack), and a list of weights w_i. It returns results related to the knapsack problem for each test case.**
