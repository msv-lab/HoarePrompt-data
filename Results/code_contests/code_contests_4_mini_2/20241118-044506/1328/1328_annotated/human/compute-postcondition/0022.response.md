Postcondition: ***If `kwargs` contains the key 'flush', its value is True; `args` is either a non-empty iterable with all its elements written to `file` separated by `sep` and `at_start` is False, or `args` is empty, in which case `at_start` remains True and no elements are written to `file`. The `file` has the end value from `kwargs` written, which defaults to a newline character if not specified.***
