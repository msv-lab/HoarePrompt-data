Functionality: ** The function accepts an arbitrary number of positional arguments (`args`), along with keyword arguments (`kwargs`) that can include options for separating the output (`sep`), specifying the output file (`file`), an end character (`end`), and a flush option (`flush`). It writes the string representation of each argument to the specified output stream, separated by the specified separator, followed by the end character. If the flush option is set to True, it flushes the output stream after writing. If no arguments are provided, it still writes the end character to the output. **
