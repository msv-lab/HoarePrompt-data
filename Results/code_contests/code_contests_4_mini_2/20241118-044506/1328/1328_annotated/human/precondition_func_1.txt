t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, for each test case n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000) representing the number of items, W is a positive integer (1 ≤ W ≤ 10^18) representing the capacity of the knapsack, and w_i are positive integers (1 ≤ w_i ≤ 10^9) representing the weights of the items. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 200,000.
