Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `W` is a positive integer, `sep` is either a value from kwargs or a space, `file` is either a value from kwargs or sys.stdout, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable with elements that have been written to `file`, and the value written to `file` is either from kwargs or '\n'. If the 'flush' key is present in kwargs with a value of True, the file is flushed; otherwise, the file remains unchanged.***
