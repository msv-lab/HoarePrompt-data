The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `t`, which is an integer representing the number of test cases, constrained such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). For each test case, it processes additional parameters: `n`, an integer representing the number of items (with constraints \(1 \leq n \leq 200,000\)), and `W`, a positive integer representing the capacity of the knapsack (with constraints \(1 \leq W \leq 10^{18}\)). Additionally, the weights \(w_i\) of the items are integers constrained by \(1 \leq w_i \leq 10^9\), and the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 200,000.

The function's output is not explicitly stated, but it is implied that it performs some calculations based on the number of items, their weights, and the capacity of the knapsack for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it processes integers `n` (number of items) and `W` (capacity of the knapsack), along with the weights of the items, to perform calculations related to the knapsack problem.**
