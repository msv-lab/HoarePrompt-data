Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `W` is a positive integer, `sep` is either a value from kwargs or a space, `file` is either a value from kwargs or sys.stdout, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable with `x` as the first element. If `at_start` is False, then `sep` is written to the file; if `at_start` is True, nothing is written to the file.***
