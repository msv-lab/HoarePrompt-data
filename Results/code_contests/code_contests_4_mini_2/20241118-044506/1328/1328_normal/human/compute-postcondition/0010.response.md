The `file.write(sep)` method writes the value of `sep` to the `file`. The variables `t`, `n`, `W`, `at_start`, and `args` remain unchanged, while the `sep` variable, which is either a value from `kwargs` or a space, is written to `file`. Since `file` is either a value from `kwargs` or `sys.stdout`, it will receive the output. Therefore, the output state reflects that `sep` has been written to `file`, while all other variables retain their original values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `W` is a positive integer, `sep` is either a value from kwargs or a space, `file` is either a value from kwargs or sys.stdout, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable with at least 2 elements, and `x` is the second element in `args`, and `sep` has been written to `file`.**
