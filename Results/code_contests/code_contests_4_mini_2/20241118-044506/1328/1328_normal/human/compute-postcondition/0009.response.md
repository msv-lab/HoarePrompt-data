According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the iterable `args`. If `args` is non-empty, the loop can iterate over its elements. At the end of the last iteration, `args` is a non-empty iterable with `x` as the first element. For the loop to execute one more time, `args` must have at least two elements, and `x` must be set to the second element of the iterable.

State: **`t` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `W` is a positive integer, `sep` is either a value from kwargs or a space, `file` is either a value from kwargs or sys.stdout, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable with at least 2 elements, and `x` is the second element in `args`**
