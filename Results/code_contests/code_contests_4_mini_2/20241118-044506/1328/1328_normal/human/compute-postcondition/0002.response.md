The variable `at_start` is assigned the value `True`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `W`, `sep`, `file`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `at_start` while retaining the previous values of the other variables.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases; for each test case, `n` is an integer representing the number of items, and `W` is a positive integer representing the capacity of the knapsack; `sep` is either the value from kwargs or a space, `file` is either the value from kwargs or sys.stdout; `at_start` is True**
