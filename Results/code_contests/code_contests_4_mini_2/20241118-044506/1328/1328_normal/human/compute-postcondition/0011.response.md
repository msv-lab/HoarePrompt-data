Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `W` is a positive integer, `sep` is either a value from kwargs or a space, `file` is either a value from kwargs or sys.stdout, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable with at least 2 elements, and `x` is the second element in `args`. If `at_start` is False, then `sep` has been written to `file`; if `at_start` is True, no changes are made to `file`.***
