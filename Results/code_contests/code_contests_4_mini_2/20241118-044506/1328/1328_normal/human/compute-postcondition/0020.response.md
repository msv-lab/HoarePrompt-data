Output State: **`t` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `W` is a positive integer, `sep` is either a value from kwargs or a space, `file` is either a value from kwargs or sys.stdout, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable with elements that have been written to `file`. If `args` is an empty iterable, the loop does not execute, and `at_start` remains True, with no output written to `file`.**
