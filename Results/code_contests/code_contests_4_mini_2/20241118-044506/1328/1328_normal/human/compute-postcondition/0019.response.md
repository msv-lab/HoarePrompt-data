According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the iterable `args`. Since `args` is a non-empty iterable with at least 3 elements, we need to determine the current state of `x` and the length of `args` after the last iteration. 

At the end of the last iteration, `x` would be the third element in `args`, and since `args` has at least 3 elements, the loop can execute again if there are more elements. To ensure the loop executes one more time, we should adjust the state to indicate that there is at least one more element in `args` beyond the current `x`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust `x` to be the fourth element in `args`, and `args` must have at least 4 elements.

State: **`t` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `W` is a positive integer, `sep` is either a value from kwargs or a space, `file` is either a value from kwargs or sys.stdout, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable with at least 4 elements, `x` is the fourth element in `args`**
