The value of `at_start` is assigned `False`, but it was already `False` in the initial state. Therefore, the state of the other variables is not affected. Thus, the output state remains the same.

Output State: **`t` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `W` is a positive integer, `sep` is either a value from kwargs or a space, `file` is either a value from kwargs or sys.stdout, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable with at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element in `args`, and `x` has been written to `file`**
