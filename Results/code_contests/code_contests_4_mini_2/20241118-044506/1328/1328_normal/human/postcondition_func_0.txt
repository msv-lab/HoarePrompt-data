The function `func_1` accepts no parameters and does not perform any operations as it currently contains only the `pass` statement. It is intended to handle a positive integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, and for each test case, it is meant to accept a positive integer `n`, a positive integer `W`, and a list `w` of positive integers representing item weights. However, since the function is not implemented, it does not fulfill any of these intended functionalities.
