Precondition: **t is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each test case, n is an integer representing the number of items (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000) and W is a positive integer representing the capacity of the knapsack (1 ≤ W ≤ 10^18). The weights w_i of the items are integers such that 1 ≤ w_i ≤ 10^9, and the sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 200,000.**
