The variable `r1` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 3. The previous value of `r1` is not defined, but it is now set to the current value of `i`. Other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `trump_suit` is a character representing one of the suits ("S", "H", "D", "C"); `card1` is a string of two characters; `card2` is a string of two characters; `s2` is a list of substrings from the input string `s`; `m1` is '6789TJQKA'; `i` is 3; `ts` is '9'; and `r1` is 3.
