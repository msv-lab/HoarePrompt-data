Postcondition: ***`i` is the length of `m1` after the loop execution, and `r2` is the index of the first occurrence of `s2[1][0]` in `m1` if it exists; if `s2[0][1]` is not equal to `s2[1][1]` and `s2[0][1]` is equal to `s[0]`, then the output is 'YES'. If `s2[0][1]` is equal to `s2[1][1]` and `r1` is greater than `r2`, the output is 'YES'. In all other cases, including when `s2[0][1]` is equal to `s2[1][1]` or `s2[0][1]` is not equal to `s[0]`, the output is 'NO'. Additionally, if `m1` is empty, `i` remains 0, and `r2` remains unchanged.***
