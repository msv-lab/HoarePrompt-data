Postcondition: ***`i` is the length of `m1` after the loop execution, and `r2` is the index of the first occurrence of `s2[1][0]` in `m1` if it exists. If `s2[0][1]` is equal to `s2[1][1]` and `r1` is greater than `r2`, the output is 'YES'. Otherwise, if `s2[0][1]` is not equal to `s2[1][1]` or `r1` is less than or equal to `r2`, the output is 'NO'. Additionally, if `s2[0][1] == s2[1][1]` or `s2[0][1] != s[0]`, then the condition for `s2[0][1]` is not satisfied.***
