Output State: **`i` is 8 after the loop completes; `r1` is the index of the first character of `s2[0]` found in `m1` ('6789TJQKA') or remains unchanged if not found; if `s2` is empty, the loop does not execute and `i` remains 0 and `r1` is undefined. If `s2[0]` is not a valid character in `m1`, `r1` will not be set and will retain its initial value (undefined if not previously assigned).**
