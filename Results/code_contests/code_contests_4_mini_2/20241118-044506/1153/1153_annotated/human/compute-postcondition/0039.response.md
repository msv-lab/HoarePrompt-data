Output State: **`i` is the length of `m1` after the loop execution; `r2` is the index of the first occurrence of `s2[1][0]` in `m1` if it exists; `s2[0][1]` is equal to `s2[1][1]` and `r1` is greater than `r2`. Additionally, if `s2[0][1] == s2[1][1]` or `s2[0][1] != s[0]`, then the condition for `s2[0][1]` is not satisfied. The output includes the printed statement 'YES'.**
