The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 3 to 4. The values of `m1`, `ts`, and `r2` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is 4, `m1` is a non-empty iterable with at least 3 elements, `ts` is the third element in `m1`, and `r2` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 4, `m1` is a non-empty iterable with at least 3 elements, `ts` is the third element in `m1`, and `r2` remains unchanged**
