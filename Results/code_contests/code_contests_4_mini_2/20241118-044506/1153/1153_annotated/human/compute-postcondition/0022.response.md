The variable `r2` is assigned the value of `i`, which is currently 0. The previous values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is 0, `m1` is a non-empty iterable, `ts` is the first element in `m1`, and `ts` is equal to the first element of the second element of `s2`; `r2` is 0.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `m1` is a non-empty iterable, `ts` is the first element in `m1`, and `ts` is equal to the first element of the second element of `s2`; `r2` is 0.**
