The value of `r2` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 3. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is 3, `m1` is a non-empty iterable with at least 3 elements, `ts` is the third element in `m1`, and `r2` is 3.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `m1` is a non-empty iterable with at least 3 elements, `ts` is the third element in `m1`, and `r2` is 3**
