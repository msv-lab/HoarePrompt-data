Postcondition: ***`trump_suit` is a character representing one of the suits ("S", "H", "D", "C"); `card1` is a string of two characters; `card2` is a string of two characters; `s2` is a list of substrings from the input string `s`; `m1` is '6789TJQKA'; `i` is 0; `ts` is '6'. If the first character of the first substring in `s2` is equal to '6', then `r1` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 0. Otherwise, `r1` remains undefined since there is no else part in the code.***
