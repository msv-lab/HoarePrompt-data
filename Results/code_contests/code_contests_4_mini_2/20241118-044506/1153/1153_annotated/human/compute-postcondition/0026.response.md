The variable `r2` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 2. The value of `m1`, `ts`, and the unchanged state of `r2` do not impact the assignment. After execution, `r2` is now 2, which is the same as the value of `i`. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is 2, `m1` is a non-empty iterable, `ts` is the second element in `m1`, and `r2` is 2.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `m1` is a non-empty iterable, `ts` is the second element in `m1`, and `r2` is 2**
