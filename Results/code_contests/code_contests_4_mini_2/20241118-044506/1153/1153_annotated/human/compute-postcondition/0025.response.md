To determine the necessary adjustments to the state for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the current state and how it interacts with the loop structure.

1. The loop iterates over the iterable `m1`. Since `m1` is a non-empty iterable, it contains at least one element.
2. At the end of the previous iteration, `ts` is the first element in `m1`, and `i` is 1. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are more elements in `m1` to iterate through.
3. Since `ts` is currently the first element, we need to adjust it to the next element of `m1` for the loop to execute again.

Given that `ts` is the first element in `m1`, to prepare for the next iteration, `ts` should be set to the second element in `m1`, and `i` should be incremented to reflect that we are now on the second element.

Therefore, the adjustments needed are:
- `ts` should be the second element in `m1`.
- `i` should be incremented to 2.

State: **`i` is 2, `m1` is a non-empty iterable, `ts` is the second element in `m1`, and `r2` remains unchanged.**
