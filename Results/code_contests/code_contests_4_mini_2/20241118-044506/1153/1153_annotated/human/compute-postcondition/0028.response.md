The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The other variables `m1`, `ts`, `s2`, and `r2` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 3, `m1` is a non-empty iterable, `ts` is the second element in `m1`, and `r2` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `m1` is a non-empty iterable, `ts` is the second element in `m1`, and `r2` remains unchanged**.
