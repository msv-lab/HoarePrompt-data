The function accepts no parameters directly, but it reads input from the user, which is expected to be a trump suit and two playing cards represented as strings. It checks specific conditions based on the suits and ranks of these cards, printing 'YES' or 'NO' based on the comparisons. The function does not handle edge cases where the input is invalid or unexpected, such as insufficient input size or invalid characters, which may lead to runtime errors. Additionally, it does not return any values; it only prints the result.
