`r2` is assigned the value of `i`, and `i` is 2, so after execution, `r2` becomes 2. The states of the other variables (`m1` and `r2`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 2, `m1` is defined and contains at least 2 elements, `r2` is 2.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `m1` is defined and contains at least 2 elements, `r2` is 2**
