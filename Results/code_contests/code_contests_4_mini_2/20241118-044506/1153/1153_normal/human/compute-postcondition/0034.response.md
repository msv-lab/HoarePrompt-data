Output State: **`r2` is the index of the first occurrence of `s2[1][0]` in `m1` if it exists, otherwise `r2` remains unchanged; `i` is the length of `m1`, `m1` is defined and contains at least 0 elements. If `m1` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `i` remains 0, while `r2` remains unchanged.**
