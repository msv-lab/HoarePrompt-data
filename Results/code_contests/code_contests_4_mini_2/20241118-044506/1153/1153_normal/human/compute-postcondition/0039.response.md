Output State: **`r2` is the index of the first occurrence of `s2[1][0]` in `m1` if it exists, otherwise `r2` remains unchanged; `i` is the length of `m1`, which could be any non-negative integer, and `m1` is defined and contains at least 0 elements; `s2[0][1]` is equal to `s2[1][1]`, and `r1` is greater than `r2`; therefore, 'YES' is printed.**
