The value of `i` is initialized to 0. Since the initial state mentions that if `s2` is empty, then `i` is 0 and `r1` is undefined, the initialization of `i` remains consistent with this condition. The value of `r1` remains undefined since there is no further code affecting it. 

Output State: **`i` is 0, `r1` is undefined**
