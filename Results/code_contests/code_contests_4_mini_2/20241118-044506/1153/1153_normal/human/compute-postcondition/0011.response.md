Postcondition: ***`trump_suit` is a string ("S", "H", "D", or "C"), `card1` is a string with two characters, `card2` is a string with two characters, `s2` is a list of substrings from the input string, `m1` is '6789TJQKA', `i` is 2, and `ts` is '8'. If `ts` is equal to the first character of the first substring in `s2`, then `r1` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 2. If `ts` is not equal to that character, `r1` remains unchanged at its initial value of 0.***
