Postcondition: ***`r2` is the index of the first occurrence of `s2[1][0]` in `m1` if it exists, otherwise `r2` remains unchanged; `i` is the length of `m1`, which could be any non-negative integer, and `m1` is defined and contains at least 0 elements. If `s2[0][1]` is equal to `s2[1][1]` and `r1` is greater than `r2`, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, if `s2[0][1]` is not equal to `s2[1][1]` or `r1` is less than or equal to `r2`, then 'NO' is printed.***
