Postcondition: ***`trump_suit` is a string ("S", "H", "D", or "C"), `card1` and `card2` are strings with two characters each, `s2` is a list of substrings from the input string, `m1` is '6789TJQKA', `i` is 4, and `ts` is 'T'. If the first character of the first substring in `s2` is equal to `ts`, then `r1` is set to 4. If the first character of `s2[0]` is not equal to `ts`, `r1` remains unchanged.***
