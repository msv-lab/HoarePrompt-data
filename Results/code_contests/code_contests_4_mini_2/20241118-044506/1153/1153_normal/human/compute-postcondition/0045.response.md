Functionality: ** The function accepts user input consisting of a trump suit and two cards, each described by a rank and a suit. It retrieves the ranks of the two cards and compares them along with their suits to determine the output. If the suit of the first card matches the trump suit and it has a different suit than the second card, it prints 'YES'. If both cards have the same suit and the rank of the first card is higher than that of the second card, it also prints 'YES'. In all other cases, it prints 'NO'. Note that if the input does not conform to the expected format or range, it may lead to undefined behavior or errors since there are no checks for input validity.**
