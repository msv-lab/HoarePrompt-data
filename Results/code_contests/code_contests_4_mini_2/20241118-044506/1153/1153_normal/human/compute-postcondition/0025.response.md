According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the collection `m1`. If `m1` contains more than 1 element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `m1` contains at least 1 element, and `r2` remains unchanged. For the loop to be executed one more time, we need to ensure that `m1` has at least 2 elements and that `ts` corresponds to the second element in the collection. Therefore, `i` should be adjusted to 2 to reflect the next iteration.

State: **`i` is 2, `m1` is defined and contains at least 2 elements, `r2` remains unchanged**
