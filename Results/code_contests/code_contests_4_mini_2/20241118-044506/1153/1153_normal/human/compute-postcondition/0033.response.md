According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the iterable `m1`. The loop will execute again if there are more elements in `m1` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 5. Since the loop variable `ts` iterates over `m1`, and assuming `m1` has at least 6 elements (given that `i` starts from 0), for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` should be incremented to 6.

State: **`i` is 6**
