Postcondition: ***`r2` is the index of the first occurrence of `s2[1][0]` in `m1` if it exists, otherwise `r2` remains unchanged; `i` is the non-negative integer length of `m1`, which could be 0 or more. If `s2[0][1]` is not equal to `s2[1][1]` and is equal to `s[0]`, 'YES' is printed. If `s2[0][1]` is equal to `s2[1][1]` and `r1` is greater than `r2`, 'YES' is printed. In all other cases, including when `s2[0][1]` is equal to `s2[1][1]` but `r1` is less than or equal to `r2`, or when `s2[0][1]` is not equal to `s2[1][1]`, 'NO' is printed.***
