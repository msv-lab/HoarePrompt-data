The code snippet assigns values to `n` and `k` through user input, where `raw_input()` (which is used in Python 2) reads a line from input and splits it into two strings. The values assigned to `n` and `k` will depend on what the user inputs, but since we have no specific input provided, we can only state that they will be received as strings. The previous values of `n` and `k` are not affected, but they will be converted into integers later in the program.

Output State: **`n` is a string input in the range 1 to 2000, `k` is a string input in the range 1 to 5, and `arr` remains unchanged**.
