Functionality: ** The function accepts two parameters, `n` (an integer representing the number of elements) and `k` (an integer between 1 and 5), and a list `arr` of integers obtained from user input. It counts how many elements in `arr` satisfy the condition that each element plus `k` is less than or equal to 5. Finally, it returns the integer result of the floor division of this count by 3. If `n` is 0, the count remains 0 and the output will also be 0. The function does not directly return any value but prints the result instead. **
