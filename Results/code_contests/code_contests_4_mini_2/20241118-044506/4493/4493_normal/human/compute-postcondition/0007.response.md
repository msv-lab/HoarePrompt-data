Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer in the range 1 to 2000, `k` is an integer in the range 1 to 5, `arr` is a list of integers assigned new values from input, `count` is a floating-point number. If `arr[0] + k` is less than or equal to 5, `count` is increased by 1.0; otherwise, `count` remains 0.0. This covers the case where `arr[0]` could be at its minimum or maximum value, ensuring that the boundary conditions are considered.***
