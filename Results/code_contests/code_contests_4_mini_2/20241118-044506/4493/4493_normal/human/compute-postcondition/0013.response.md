Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer in the range [1, 2000], `k` is an integer in the range [1, 5], `arr` is a list of integers, `count` is a floating-point number, and `i` is equal to `n`. If the sum of `arr[i]` and `k` is less than or equal to 5, `count` is increased by 1.0. If `arr[i]` is such that `arr[i] + k` is greater than 5, the value of `count` remains unchanged.***
