Output State: **`count` is the number of elements in `arr` such that `arr[i] + k` is less than or equal to 5 for all indices `i` from 0 to `n-1`. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute and `count` remains 0.0. If all elements of `arr` are such that `arr[i] + k` exceeds 5, `count` remains unchanged at 0.0. If `arr` contains values that satisfy the condition, `count` will reflect the total number of such elements.**
