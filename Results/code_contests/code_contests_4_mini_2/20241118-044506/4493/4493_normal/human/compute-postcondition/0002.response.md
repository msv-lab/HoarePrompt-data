The code assigns the value of `arr` to the result of `map(int, raw_input().split())`. The `raw_input()` function expects input from the user and splits it into separate string values, which are then converted to integers by `map(int, ...)`. Since `arr` is stated to remain unchanged, the output state reflects that `arr` is now assigned the new values based on the input but does not specify what those values are.

Output State: **`n` is an integer in the range 1 to 2000, `k` is an integer in the range 1 to 5, and `arr` is assigned the new integer values from input**.
