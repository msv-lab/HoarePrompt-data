Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer in the range 1 to 2000, `k` is an integer in the range 1 to 5, `arr` is a list of integers, `count` is a floating-point number, and `i` is equal to `n`. If the value of `arr[i]` added to `k` is less than or equal to 5, then `count` is increased by 1.0. This condition accounts for the edge case where `arr[i]` is at its minimum value (which would occur if `arr[i]` is 0 when `k` is 5, leading to `count` being incremented) and the maximum scenario where `arr[i]` is 5, resulting in no increase to `count`.***
