The values of `n` and `k` are converted from strings to integers. The initial state specifies that `n` is a string input in the range 1 to 2000, and `k` is a string input in the range 1 to 5. After the conversion, `n` will be an integer within the range 1 to 2000, and `k` will be an integer within the range 1 to 5. The variable `arr` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer in the range 1 to 2000, `k` is an integer in the range 1 to 5, and `arr` remains unchanged**
