The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `arr`. The parameter `n` is an integer in the range 1 to 2000, representing the number of students. The parameter `k` is an integer in the range 1 to 5, representing the maximum number of participations considered. The parameter `arr` is a list of integers where each integer `yi` is in the range 0 to 5, representing the number of times each student has participated in the ACM ICPC world championship. 

The function processes these parameters and returns a specific output based on the values in `arr` compared to `k`. Specifically, it counts the number of students who have participated in ACM ICPC at least `k` times and returns this count.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `n` (an integer between 1 and 2000), a parameter `k` (an integer between 1 and 5), and a parameter `arr` (a list of integers between 0 and 5), then returns the count of students who have participated in the ACM ICPC world championship at least `k` times.**
