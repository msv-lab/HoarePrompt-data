Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 5, `arr` contains integers from user input, `count` is a floating point number initialized to 0.0, and `i` is 1. If `arr[i] + k` is less than or equal to 5, then `count` is incremented by 1.0. If `arr[i] + k` is greater than 5, `count` remains unchanged at 0.0.***
