Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 5, `arr` contains integers from user input, `count` is 0.0, and `i` is 0. If the sum of `arr[i]` and `k` is less than or equal to 5, `count` is incremented by 1.0. If the sum exceeds 5, `count` remains unchanged at 0.0.***
