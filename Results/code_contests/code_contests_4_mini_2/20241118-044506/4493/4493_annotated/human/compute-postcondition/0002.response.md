The variable `arr` is assigned the result of `map(int, raw_input().split())`, which means it will hold an iterable of integers obtained from user input. The specific values of `n` and `k` do not affect this assignment directly, but they suggest that the input will be constrained by the ranges provided. Therefore, the output state reflects that `arr` contains integers based on user input. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 5; `arr` contains integers from user input**
