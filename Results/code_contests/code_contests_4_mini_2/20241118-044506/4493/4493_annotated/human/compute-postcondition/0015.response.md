Output State: **`count` is the number of elements in `arr` for which the sum of the element and `k` is less than or equal to 5. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute and `count` remains 0.0. If all elements in `arr` are such that their sum with `k` exceeds 5, `count` will also remain 0.0. The final value of `i` will be `n-1` after the loop completes, provided `n` is greater than 0.**
