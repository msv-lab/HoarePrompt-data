The variables `n` and `k` are both converted to integers from their previous values, which were strings obtained from `raw_input()`. The initial constraints for `n` are that it is an integer between 1 and 2000, and for `k`, it is an integer between 1 and 5. After the execution of the code, `n` and `k` will still satisfy these constraints, but they are now explicitly integers.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 5**
