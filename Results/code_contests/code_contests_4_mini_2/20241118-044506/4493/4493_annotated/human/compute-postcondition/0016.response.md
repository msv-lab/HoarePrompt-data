Output State: **`count` is the number of elements in `arr` for which the sum of the element and `k` is less than or equal to 5; if `n` is 0, `count` remains 0.0, and if all elements in `arr` exceed this sum, `count` is also 0.0; the result of `int(math.floor(count / 3))` is 0, given that `count` is 0.0.**
