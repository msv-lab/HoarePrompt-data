Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 5, `arr` contains integers from user input, `count` is a floating point number initialized to 0.0, and `i` is 2. If the sum of `arr[i]` and `k` is less than or equal to 5, then `count` is increased by 1.0; otherwise, `count` remains unchanged.***
