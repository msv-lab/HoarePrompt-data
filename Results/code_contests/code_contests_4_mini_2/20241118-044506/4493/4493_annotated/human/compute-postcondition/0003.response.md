The variable `count` is assigned the value `0.0`. The previous values of `n`, `k`, and `arr` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 5; `arr` contains integers from user input; `count` is 0.0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2000; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 5; `arr` contains integers from user input; `count` is 0.0**
