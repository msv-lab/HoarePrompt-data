Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers, `n` and `k`, followed by a list of `n` integers. It counts how many elements in the list, when added to `k`, are less than or equal to 5. Finally, it prints the integer value of `count / 3`, rounded down to the nearest whole number. The function does not handle cases where `n` is 0 or where the input may lack sufficient integers. If `n` is 0, the function will not execute the loop and the result printed will be 0. **
