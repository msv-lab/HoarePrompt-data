To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the problem description and the code step by step.

### Problem Description:
The task is to remove duplicate integers from an array while preserving the rightmost occurrence of each integer. The output should include the count of unique elements and the unique elements themselves in their original order.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The first line reads an integer `n`, which represents the number of elements in the array.
   - The second line reads the array of integers.

2. **Reversing the List**: 
   - The array is reversed (`a = a[::-1]`), which allows for iterating from the last element to the first. This way, when we collect unique elements, the rightmost occurrences are considered first.

3. **Unique Collection**: 
   - A set `vis` is used to track which elements have already been added to the result list `ans`.
   - The program iterates through the reversed array and appends an element to `ans` only if it has not been seen before (`if ai in vis: continue`).

4. **Final Output**:
   - The count of unique elements is printed, followed by the unique elements in their original order (reversed back with `ans[::-1]`).

### Output Hints:
The hints state that the function extracts unique elements while maintaining the order of their first appearance. It mentions handling cases where all elements are duplicates and what happens if the array is empty.

### Edge Cases:
1. **Single Element**: If the input is `1` and the element is `1`, the output should be correct.
2. **All Duplicates**: For input like `6 6 6 6 6`, the output should be `1` followed by `6`, which the code correctly handles.
3. **No Duplicates**: If the input has all unique elements, it should return the count of those elements and list them.
4. **Multiple Duplicates**: The ordering must remain intact for the rightmost occurrences.

### Potential Issues:
Upon inspecting the code carefully, there is an edge case concerning the output format when all elements are duplicates. While the current implementation seems to handle that, let's consider the output when there are no valid unique elements (like an empty array). 

However, based on the problem description:
- The minimum size of the array is `1` as specified (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), so there won't be a case of an empty array.

### Conclusion:
The program handles all described cases correctly, including edge cases for single elements, duplicates, and maintaining the original order. The output hints confirm that the logic correctly identifies the rightmost entries and prints them in the required format.

Correctness: **True**. 

The code is correct as it adheres to the problem description for all potential cases, correctly handles inputs, and the output hints align with the code's behavior.
