The code `ans.append(ai)` appends the value of `ai` to the list `ans`. Since `ai` is defined as the second element of the list `a`, the value of `ai` is determined by the current state of the list `a`. The variable `vis` remains unchanged, and there are no other variables affected by this operation.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is a list of n integers, `vis` does not include the second element of `a`, `ai` is the second element of `a`, and the list `ans` now includes `ai`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is a list of n integers, `vis` does not include the second element of `a`, `ai` is the second element of `a`, and `ans` includes `ai`.**
