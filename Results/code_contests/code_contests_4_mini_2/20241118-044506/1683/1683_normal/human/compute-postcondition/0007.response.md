The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but causes the loop to skip the remaining code in the current iteration and move to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is a list of n integers where n is at least 1, `ans` is an empty list, `vis` is a set containing the element `ai`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
