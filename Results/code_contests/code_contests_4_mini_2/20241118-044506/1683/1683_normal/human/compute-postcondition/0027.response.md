Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers from standard input, then reverses the list and extracts unique elements while maintaining the order of their first appearance. It prints the number of unique elements followed by these elements in their original order. If all elements are duplicates, it will only print the first unique element. If `a` is empty, it will print `0` and an empty line. **
