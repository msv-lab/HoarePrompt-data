The code initializes `vis` as an empty set. The previous values of the affected variables are `n` (which is an integer between 1 and 50), `a` (a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 1000), and `ans` (an empty list). The initialization of `vis` does not impact any of these variables; it simply creates a new empty set.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50; `a` is a list of n integers created from input, where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000; `ans` is an empty list; `vis` is an empty set.**
