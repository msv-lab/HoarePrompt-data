According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. The loop will iterate over each element in `a`, so for the loop to execute, `a` must contain at least one integer. Since `n` is defined as an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `n` must be at least 1, ensuring that the list `a` is not empty.

At the start of the loop, `ai` will take on the value of the first element in the list `a`. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `ai` is equal to the first element of `a`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is a list of n integers where n is at least 1, `ans` is an empty list, `vis` is an empty set, `ai` is the first element in `a`**
