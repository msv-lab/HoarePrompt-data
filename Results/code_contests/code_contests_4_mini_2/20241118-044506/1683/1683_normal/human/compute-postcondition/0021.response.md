Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 3, `a` is a list of `n` integers, and `ai` is the third element of `a`. If `ai` is already present in `vis`, the loop continues to the next iteration without any changes to `ans` or `vis`. Otherwise, `ai` is added to both `ans` and `vis`, ensuring `vis` now includes `ai` and `ans` reflects the inclusion of `ai`.***
