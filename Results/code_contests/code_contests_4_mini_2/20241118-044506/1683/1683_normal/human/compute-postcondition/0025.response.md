The code prints the elements of `ans` in reverse order, separated by spaces. The length of `ans` is either 0 or 1. If `ans` is empty, nothing is printed. If `ans` contains one element, that element is printed. The output state is determined by the contents of `ans`.

Output State: **`ans` length is either 0 or 1 depending on the contents of `a`, and the function prints the elements of `ans` in reverse order**.
