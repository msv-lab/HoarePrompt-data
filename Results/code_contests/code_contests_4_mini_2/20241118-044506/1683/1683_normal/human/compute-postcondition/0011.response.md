Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is a list of n integers where n is at least 1, if the first element `ai` of `a` is already in the set `vis`, the program continues to the next iteration without modification to `ans` or `vis`. Otherwise, `ans` contains the first element of `a`, `vis` now includes the first element `ai`, and the program proceeds with the next iteration.***
