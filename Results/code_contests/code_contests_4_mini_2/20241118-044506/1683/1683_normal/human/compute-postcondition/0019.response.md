`ans` is a list, and `ai` is the third element of `a`, which is included in `vis`. The code appends `ai` to the list `ans`. The values of `n`, `a`, and `vis` do not change with this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is at least 3, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `ai` is the third element of `a`, `vis` does not include `ai`, and `ans` now includes `ai`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `ai` is the third element of `a`, `vis` does not include `ai`, and `ans` now includes `ai`.**
