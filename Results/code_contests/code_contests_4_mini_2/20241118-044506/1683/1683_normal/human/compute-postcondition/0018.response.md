The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is at least 3, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `ai` is the third element of `a`, and `vis` does not include `ai`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
