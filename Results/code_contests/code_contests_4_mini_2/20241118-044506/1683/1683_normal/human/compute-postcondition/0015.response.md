In the given code, `vis.add(ai)` adds the value of `ai` (which is the second element of the list `a`) to the set `vis`. Since `vis` does not include the second element of `a` before this operation, it will now include it after the execution. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is a list of n integers, `vis` now includes the second element of `a`, `ai` is the second element of `a`, and `ans` includes `ai`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is a list of n integers, `vis` now includes the second element of `a`, `ai` is the second element of `a`, and `ans` includes `ai`**.
