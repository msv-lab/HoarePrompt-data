Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `ai` is the second element of `a`, and `vis` does not include `ai`. If `ai` is in `vis`, the loop continues to the next iteration without modification to `ans` or `vis`. Otherwise, `vis` now includes `ai`, and `ans` includes `ai`, ensuring that `vis` contains unique elements from `a`, and `ans` accumulates the second element of `a` that are not already in `vis`.***
