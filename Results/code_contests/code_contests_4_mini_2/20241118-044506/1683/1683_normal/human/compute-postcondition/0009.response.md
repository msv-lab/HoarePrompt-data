The code `ans.append(ai)` appends the value of `ai` to the list `ans`. Since `ai` is defined as the first element of the list `a`, this means that the first element of `a` will be added to the `ans` list. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `vis`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is a list of n integers, `ans` contains the first element of `a`, `vis` is a set that does not contain the first element of `a`, and `ai` is the first element in `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is a list of n integers, `ans` contains the first element of `a`, `vis` is a set that does not contain the first element of `a`, and `ai` is the first element in `a`**
