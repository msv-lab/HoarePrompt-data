The code `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of `n`, `a`, `vis`, and `ai` remain unchanged, but the flow of execution is affected as it will skip the rest of the code inside the loop where `continue` is executed. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is a list of n integers, `vis` does not include the second element of `a`, `ai` is the second element of `a`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is a list of n integers, `vis` does not include the second element of `a`, `ai` is the second element of `a`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
