The code prints the length of `ans`. The current state of `ans` is determined by the initial conditions provided. If `a` is an empty list, `ans` is empty, resulting in a length of 0. If `a` contains duplicates, `ans` will contain only the first unique element, resulting in a length of 1. 

Therefore, the output state will vary based on the contents of `a`:

1. If `a` is empty: `ans` is empty, so `len(ans)` is 0.
2. If `a` contains duplicates, `ans` will contain one unique element, so `len(ans)` is 1.

Since we don't know the specific contents of `a`, we can't determine the exact output length.

Output State: **`ans` length is either 0 or 1 depending on the contents of `a`.**
