Output State: **`ans` contains the unique elements of `a` in the order they first appear, `vis` contains the same elements as a set, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50. If `a` is an empty list, the loop does not execute, leaving `ans` empty and `vis` empty. If all elements of `a` are duplicates, `ans` will contain only the first unique element and `vis` will reflect that unique element.**
