The operation `a = a[::-1]` reverses the list `a`. The values in the list `a` are not specified, but they are integers between 1 and 1000. The length of the list is `n`, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 50`. Therefore, after execution, the list `a` will contain the same integers but in reverse order. The initial state of `n` and the values in `a` are not affected apart from the order of elements in `a`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50; `a` is a list of n integers created from input, where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000, and `a` is reversed.**
