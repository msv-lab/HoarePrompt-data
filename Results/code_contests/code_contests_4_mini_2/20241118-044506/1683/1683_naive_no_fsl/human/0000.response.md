Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It processes the input array by reversing it to ensure that when checking for duplicates, the rightmost occurrences are prioritized. 

Here's the step-by-step breakdown of how the program works:

1. It reads the number of elements and the input array.
2. It reverses the input array to analyze the elements from the last to the first.
3. It initializes an empty list `ans` to store the unique elements and a set `vis` to keep track of the elements that have already been encountered.
4. As it iterates through the reversed array:
   - If an element has already been seen (exists in `vis`), it skips adding it to `ans`.
   - If it hasn't been seen, it adds the element to `ans` and marks it as seen by adding it to `vis`.
5. After processing all elements, it prints the count of unique elements and the unique elements in the correct order (by reversing `ans` back).

The program adheres to the problem description and handles the edge cases described in the examples effectively. Thus, I cannot find any case where the program fails to meet the requirements.

Therefore, the output is correct, and the program is valid for all potential cases within the given constraints.
