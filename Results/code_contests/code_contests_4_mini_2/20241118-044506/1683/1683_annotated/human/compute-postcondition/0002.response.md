The code `a = a[::-1]` reverses the list `a`. The initial state indicates that `a` is a list of integers created from an input line, but the specific values of `a` are not provided. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `a` has been reversed, but will not specify its contents.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 50; `a` is the reversed list of integers.**
