The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables, but it causes the program to skip the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop and move to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged, but it indicates that the loop continues without executing the remaining statements for the current iteration.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `a` is a reversed list of integers with at least 2 elements, `ai` is the second element in `a`, and `vis` remains unchanged; the loop continues.**
