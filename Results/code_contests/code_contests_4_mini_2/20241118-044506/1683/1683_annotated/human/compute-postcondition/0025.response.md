The code prints the elements of the list `ans` in reverse order, converting each element to a string and joining them with spaces. The previous state of `ans` is a list containing unique elements from the reversed list `a`. The state of `vis` is unchanged, and the output does not modify any variables. Therefore, the output state reflects the current state of `ans` and its length.

Output State: **`ans` is a list containing the unique elements from the reversed list `a`, `vis` is a set containing all elements that have been added to `ans`, and the printed output is the elements of `ans` in reverse order joined by spaces.**
