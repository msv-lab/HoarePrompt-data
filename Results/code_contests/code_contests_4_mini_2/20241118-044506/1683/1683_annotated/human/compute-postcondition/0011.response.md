Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `a` is a reversed list of integers with at least 1 element, `ai` is the first element in `a`. If `ai` is already in the set `vis`, the iteration skips to the next element without any changes to `ans` or `vis`. Otherwise, `ai` is appended to the list `ans`, and `ai` is added to the set `vis`.***
