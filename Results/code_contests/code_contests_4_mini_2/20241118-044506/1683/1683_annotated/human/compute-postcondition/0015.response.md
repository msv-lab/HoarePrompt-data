The code `vis.add(ai)` adds the element `ai` to the set `vis`. Since `ai` is the second element in the list `a`, and `vis` remains unchanged before this operation, the output state would reflect that `ai` has been added to `vis`. 

The initial values of `n`, `a`, and `vis` remain the same. The state of `ans` does not change because the operation only affects `vis`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `a` is a reversed list of integers with at least 2 elements, `ai` is the second element in `a`, `vis` has `ai` added to it, and `ai` has been appended to `ans`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `a` is a reversed list of integers with at least 2 elements, `ai` is the second element in `a`, `vis` has `ai` added to it, and `ai` has been appended to `ans**
