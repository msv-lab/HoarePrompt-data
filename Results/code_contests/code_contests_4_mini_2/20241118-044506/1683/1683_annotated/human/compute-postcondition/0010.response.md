The `vis` set is updated to include `ai`, which is the first element in the list `a`. Since `vis` originally does not contain `ai`, it now adds `ai` to its elements. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects this update.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `a` is a reversed list of integers with at least 1 element, `ai` is the first element in `a`, `ans` is a list containing `ai`, and `vis` now contains `ai`.**
