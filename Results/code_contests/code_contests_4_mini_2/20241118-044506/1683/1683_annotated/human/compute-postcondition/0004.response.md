The variable `vis` is initialized as an empty set. The other variables `n`, `a`, and `ans` remain unaffected at this point. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `a` is the reversed list of integers; `ans` is an empty list; `vis` is an empty set.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `a` is the reversed list of integers; `ans` is an empty list; `vis` is an empty set**
