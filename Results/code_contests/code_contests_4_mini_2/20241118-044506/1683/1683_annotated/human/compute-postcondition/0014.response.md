The operation `ans.append(ai)` appends the value of `ai` to the list `ans`. Since `ai` is defined as the second element in the list `a`, it will have a specific integer value based on the content of the list `a`. The other variables, including `n` and `vis`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the addition of `ai` to the `ans` list, while the values of `n`, `a`, and `vis` are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `a` is a reversed list of integers with at least 2 elements, `ai` is the second element in `a`, `vis` remains unchanged, and `ai` has been appended to `ans`.**
