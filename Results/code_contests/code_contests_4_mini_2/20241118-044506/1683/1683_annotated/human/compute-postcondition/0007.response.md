The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Since the values of the variables do not change, the output state remains the same. The program continues to the next iteration without altering the values of `n`, `a`, `ai`, `ans`, or `vis`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `a` is a reversed list of integers with at least 1 element, `ai` is the first element in `a`, `ans` is an empty list, `vis` is an empty set, and `ai` is an element in the set `vis`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
