The code appends the value of `ai` to the list `ans`. The value of `ai` is the first element of the list `a`, which is a reversed list of integers. The states of the variables `n`, `vis`, and `ans` remain unchanged in terms of their values, but `ans` will now have one additional element.

Since `ai` takes on the value of the first element of `a`, it does not affect the output state of `n`, `vis`, or `a`, but `ans` will reflect the addition of `ai`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `a` is a reversed list of integers with at least 2 elements, `ai` is the first element in `a`, `vis` remains unchanged, and `ans` now includes `ai` as an additional element.**
