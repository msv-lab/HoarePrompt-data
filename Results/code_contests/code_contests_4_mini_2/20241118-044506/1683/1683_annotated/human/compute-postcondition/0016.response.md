Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `a` is a reversed list of integers with at least 2 elements, and `ai` is the second element in `a`. If `ai` is already in `vis`, the loop continues without any changes to `vis` or `ans`. Otherwise, `ai` is added to `vis`, and `ai` is appended to `ans`.***
