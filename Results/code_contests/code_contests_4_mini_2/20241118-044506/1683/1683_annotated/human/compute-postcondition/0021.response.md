Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `a` is a reversed list of integers with at least 2 elements, and `ai` is the first element in `a`. If `ai` is already present in `vis`, the program continues to the next iteration without modifying `ans` or `vis`. Otherwise, `ai` is added to both `vis` and `ans`, resulting in `vis` including `ai` and `ans` containing `ai` as an additional element.***
