Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of integers to be read, and then reads a list of integers `a`. It reverses the list and constructs a new list `ans` containing unique elements from `a` in the order they first appeared (after reversing). Finally, it prints the count of unique elements and the unique elements themselves in their original order (not reversed). If `a` is empty, it will print `0` for the count and nothing for the list. The function does not handle any exceptions related to input, so it assumes that the input will always be within the specified constraints. **
