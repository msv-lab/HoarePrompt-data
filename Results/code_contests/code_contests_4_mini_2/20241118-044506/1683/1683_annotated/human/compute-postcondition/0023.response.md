Output State: **`ans` is a list containing the unique elements from the reversed list `a`, in the order they first appeared in `a`. `vis` is a set containing all elements that have been added to `ans`. If `a` is an empty list, the loop does not execute and both `ans` and `vis` remain empty. If `a` has elements, the loop will execute for each unique element in `a`, with `n` still being an integer in the range 1 to 50.**
