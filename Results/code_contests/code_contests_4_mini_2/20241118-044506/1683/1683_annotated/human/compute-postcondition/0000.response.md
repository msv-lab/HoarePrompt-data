The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())`, where `sys.stdin.readline()` reads a line of input, and `strip()` removes any surrounding whitespace. The value of `n` is constrained to be an integer between 1 and 50. Therefore, the output state will specify that `n` is an input integer within this range, and `a` remains unchanged as the code does not affect it.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50; `a` is a list of integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000**
