The code appends the value of `ai`, which is the first element of the list `a`, to the list `ans`. Since `ans` starts as an empty list, after executing this line, `ans` will contain the element `ai`. The values of the other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `a` is a reversed list of integers with at least 1 element, `ai` is the first element in `a`, `ans` is a list containing `ai`, `vis` is a set that does not contain `ai`.**
