The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration in the loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `a` is a reversed list of integers with at least 2 elements, `ai` is the first element in `a`, `vis` remains unchanged, `ans` remains unchanged, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
