To evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program step by step:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `n`, which indicates the number of elements in the array, and then reads the array `a` of integers.

2. **Reversing the Array**: The array `a` is reversed (`a = a[::-1]`). This is a crucial step because the task requires that we preserve the rightmost occurrences of each element while maintaining their relative order.

3. **Removing Duplicates**: The program initializes an empty list `ans` and a set `vis` to track seen elements. It iterates through the reversed array `a`:
   - If an element `ai` is already in the set `vis`, it continues to the next element.
   - If not, it appends `ai` to `ans` and adds `ai` to `vis`.

4. **Output**: Finally, it prints the length of `ans` and the elements of `ans` in reversed order to restore their original relative order.

### Potential Edge Cases

1. **Single Element Array**: For an input of `1` and an array like `1`, the expected output should be:
   ```
   1
   1
   ```
   The program handles this correctly.

2. **All Elements Identical**: For an input of `5` and an array like `6 6 6 6 6`, the expected output is:
   ```
   1
   6
   ```
   The program handles this correctly as it keeps only one occurrence of `6`.

3. **Different Orders**: For an input of `5` and an array like `1 2 1 2 1`, the expected output should be:
   ```
   2
   2 1
   ```
   The program handles this correctly as well.

4. **Multiple Occurrences**: For an input of `6` and an array like `1 5 5 1 6 1`, the expected output should be:
   ```
   3
   5 6 1
   ```
   The program handles this correctly.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to remove duplicates by keeping only the rightmost occurrences and prints the results in the required format. After analyzing the edge cases and the general logic, it appears that the program will function correctly for all valid inputs as per the problem description.

Correctness: **True**.
