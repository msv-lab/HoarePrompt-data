According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, we have:

- `p` has been increased by 1.
- `n` is at least `p * p + p`.
- `i` is `p * p + p`, which means that `i` is equal to `n` since `n` is at least `p * p + p`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by `p`. Therefore, `i` will be `i + p`, which means `i` will become `p * p + p + p` or `p * p + 2p`. 

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `n` must be at least `i`, which means `n` must be at least `p * p + 2p`.

State: **`p` is increased by 1, `n` is at least `p * p + 2p`, `i` is `p * p + 2p`, and `prime[i]` is set to False**
