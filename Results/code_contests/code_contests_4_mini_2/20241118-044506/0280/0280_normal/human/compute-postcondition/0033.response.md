Postcondition: ***`p` is increased by 1, and `n` is at least `(p + 1) * (p + 1)`. If `prime[p]` is True, the loop iterates from `p * p` to `n`, marking all multiples of `p` as False in the `prime` array. If `n` is less than `p * p`, the loop does not execute and the `prime` array remains unchanged. Thus, after execution, `prime[i]` will be False for all multiples of `p` within the range if the loop runs, otherwise `prime` stays the same.***
