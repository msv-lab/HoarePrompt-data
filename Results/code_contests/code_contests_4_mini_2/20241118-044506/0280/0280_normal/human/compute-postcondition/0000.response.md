The variable `prime` is assigned a list of boolean values, all set to `True`, with a length of `n + 1`. Since `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, the length of the list will be between 2 and 101. Other variables in the initial state are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `prime` is a list of length `n + 1` with all values set to `True`.**
