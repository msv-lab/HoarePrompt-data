The value of `p` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `p` is unknown, so the output state is: variable `p` is increased by 1. The state of `n` and `prime` remains unchanged since they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **variable `p` is increased by 1; `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `prime` is a list of length `n + 1` with all values initially set to `True`**
