Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `prime` is a list of length `n + 1` with all values initially set to `True`. If `prime[p]` is `True`, and if `n` is at least 4, then `prime[4]` is marked as `False`; if `n` is at least 6, then `prime[6]` is marked as `False`; if `n` is at least 8, then `prime[8]` is marked as `False`. If `n` is less than 4, `prime` remains unchanged except for `prime[2]` being `True`.***
