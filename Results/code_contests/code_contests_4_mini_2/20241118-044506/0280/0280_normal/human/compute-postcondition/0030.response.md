The line of code `prime[i] = False` sets the value of `prime[i]` to `False`. The previous state indicates that `prime[i]` was already set to `False`, so there is no change in the state of `prime[i]`. The other variables `p`, `n`, and `i` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the initial values of these variables along with the unchanged state of `prime[i]`.

Output State: **`p` is increased by 1, `n` is at least `p^2 + 2p + 1`, `i` is `p^2 + 2p`, and `prime[i]` is set to False**
