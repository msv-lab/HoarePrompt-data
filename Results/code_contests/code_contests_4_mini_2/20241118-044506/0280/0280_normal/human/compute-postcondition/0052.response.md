The function `func_8` accepts a positive integer `n` and generates a list of prime numbers that are less than `n`. It uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to identify non-prime numbers by marking their indices as `False` in a list called `prime`. If `n` is less than 2, the function returns an empty list since there are no prime numbers less than 2. If `n` is 2 or greater, the function correctly identifies and appends all prime numbers less than `n` to the list `f`, which is returned at the end. 

Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns a list containing all prime numbers less than `n`. If `n` is less than 2, it returns an empty list. **
