The variable `p` is assigned the value 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `prime` is a list of length `n + 1` with all values set to `True`; `p` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `prime` is a list of length `n + 1` with all values set to `True`; `p` is 2**
