According to the code, the loop executes for values of `i` starting from `p * p` up to `n` (inclusive) in steps of `p`. For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `i` is still less than or equal to `n` after the last iteration.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `p^2 + 2p`, and since `n` is at least `p^2 + 2p + 1`, the current value of `i` is less than `n`. To execute the loop one more time, `i` should be incremented by `p`, which will make `i` equal to `p^2 + 2p + p = p^2 + 3p`.

Therefore, we need to adjust the states as follows: 
- `n` must still be at least `p^2 + 3p` for the loop to execute again.
- The value of `i` should be updated to `p^2 + 3p`.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`p` is increased by 1, `n` is at least `p^2 + 3p`, `i` is `p^2 + 3p`, and `prime[i]` is set to False**
