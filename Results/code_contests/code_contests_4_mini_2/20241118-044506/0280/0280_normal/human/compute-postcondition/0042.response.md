According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as `p` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `p` is 2 and `n` is greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to be executed one more time, `p` needs to be incremented. 

If `p` is currently 2, for the loop to execute again, `p` will need to be 3 in the next iteration. Additionally, `n` must be greater than 3 for the loop to continue executing, since `p` must still be less than `n`. 

Thus, we need to adjust `n` to be greater than 3 to ensure the loop can execute again with `p` incremented to 3. 

State: **`f` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 3, `p` is 3**
