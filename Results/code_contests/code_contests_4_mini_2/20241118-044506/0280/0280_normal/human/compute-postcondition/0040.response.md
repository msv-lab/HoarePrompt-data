The code appends the value of `p` to the list `f`. Since `p` is 2, the list `f` will now contain the value `[2]`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `f` is `[2]`, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `p` is 2, and `prime[p]` is true.

Output State: **`f` is [2], `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `p` is 2, and `prime[p]` is true**
