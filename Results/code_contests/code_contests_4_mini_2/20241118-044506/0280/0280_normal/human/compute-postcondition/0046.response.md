The list `f` is updated by appending the value of `p`, which is 4. Therefore, after execution, `f` will become `[3, 4]`. The variables `n` and `p` remain unaffected. Thus, the output state is: `f` is [3, 4], `n` is greater than 3, `p` is 4.

Output State: **`f` is [3, 4], `n` is greater than 3, `p` is 4**
