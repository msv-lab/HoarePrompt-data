According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop will iterate as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, we have:
- `p` is increased by 1,
- `n` is at least `(p + 1) * (p + 1)`, meaning `n` is at least `p^2 + 2p + 1`,
- `i` is `p * p + p`, which simplifies to `p^2 + p`.

To ensure the loop executes one more time, the next value of `i` will be `i + p`, which is `(p^2 + p) + p = p^2 + 2p`.

We need to check if this new value of `i` is less than or equal to `n`. Given that `n` is at least `p^2 + 2p + 1`, we can see that `i + p` will be less than or equal to `n` if we adjust `n` to be at least `p^2 + 2p + 1`.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to:
- `n` must be at least `p^2 + 2p + 1`, and
- `i` must be updated to `p^2 + 2p`.

State: **`p` is increased by 1, `n` is at least `p^2 + 2p + 1`, `i` is `p^2 + 2p`, and `prime[i]` is set to False**
