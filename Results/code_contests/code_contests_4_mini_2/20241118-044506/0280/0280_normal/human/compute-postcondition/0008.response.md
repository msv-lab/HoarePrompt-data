The code assigns `False` to `prime[i]`. The value of `i` is 8, so `prime[8]` is set to `False`. The other variables `n`, `prime`, `p`, and the previously assigned value of `prime[6]` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than or equal to 8; `prime` is a list of length `n + 1` with the value at index 4 set to `False`, `prime[6]` is set to `False`, `p` is 2, `i` is 8, and `prime[8]` is set to `False`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 8; `prime` is a list of length `n + 1` with the value at index 4 set to `False`, `prime[6]` is set to `False`, `p` is 2, `i` is 8, and `prime[8]` is set to `False**
