According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `p * p + 2p`, and `n` is at least `p * p + 2p`. 

To check if the loop can execute again, we need to ensure that `i` is updated correctly for the next iteration. Since `i` is currently `p * p + 2p`, the next value of `i` will be `i + p`, which is `(p * p + 2p) + p = p * p + 3p`.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that this new value of `i` (`p * p + 3p`) is still less than or equal to `n`. Therefore, we adjust `n` to be at least `p * p + 3p`.

State: **`p` is increased by 1, `n` is at least `p * p + 3p`, `i` is `p * p + 3p`, and `prime[i]` is set to False**
