According to the code, the loop will execute based on the values of `i`, `p`, and `n`. The loop starts with `i` initialized to `p * p` and increments by `p` until it reaches `n + 1`. 

Given that `p` is 2, we can calculate `p * p`, which is 4. Thus, the starting value of `i` will be 4. 

For the loop to execute, `i` must be less than or equal to `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `n` must be at least 4 for the loop to execute, as `i` starts at 4. 

Therefore, for the loop to be executed, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 4, `i` is initialized to 4, and `p` is 2, which is already given.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 4, `prime` is a list of length `n + 1` with all values set to `True`, `p` is 2, `i` is 4, and the value at index `p` of the `prime` list is `True`**
