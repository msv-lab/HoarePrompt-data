According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `p * p`, and `n` is at least `(p + 1) * (p + 1)`. Since `n` is at least `(p + 1) * (p + 1)`, we can deduce that `n` is at least `p * p + 2p + 1`. 

The loop increments `i` by `p` in each iteration. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `p * p + p` (which is `i + p`), and we need to ensure that `i` remains less than or equal to `n`.

Thus, the updated state needs to reflect that `i` is now `p * p + p`, and `n` must still be at least `(p + 1) * (p + 1)`.

State: **`p` is increased by 1, `n` is at least `(p + 1) * (p + 1)`, `i` is `p * p + p`, and `prime[i]` is set to False**
