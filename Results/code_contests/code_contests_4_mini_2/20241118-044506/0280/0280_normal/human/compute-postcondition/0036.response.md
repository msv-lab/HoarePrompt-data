Output State: **`if n is at least 2, then the loop will execute until p is greater than sqrt(n), with `p` ending at the smallest integer greater than sqrt(n). The `prime` list will have `True` for prime indices and `False` for non-prime indices up to `n`. If n is less than 2, the loop doesn't execute, and `prime` remains all `True` for indices 0 and 1 (as they are not prime).**
