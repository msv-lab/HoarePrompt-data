Output State: **`i` will take values starting from `p * p` up to `n` in increments of `p`. If `n` is less than `p * p`, the loop does not execute and `i` is not defined; `prime` remains unchanged. If `n` is at least `(p + 1) * (p + 1)`, the loop executes for each multiple of `p` starting from `p * p` until `n`, setting `prime[i]` to False for each executed iteration.**
