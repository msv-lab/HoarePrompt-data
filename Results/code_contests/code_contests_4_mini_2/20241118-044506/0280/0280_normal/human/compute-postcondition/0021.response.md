Output State: **If `p` is at least 1, the loop will execute for `p` times, setting `prime[i]` to False for `i` values starting from `p * p` up to `n`, incremented by `p`. After the loop, `i` will be `p * p + (p - 1) * p`, and `prime` will have `False` values at indices `p * p, p * p + p, ..., up to n`. If `n` is less than `p * p`, the loop will not execute, and `prime` will remain unchanged (all values set to `True`).**
