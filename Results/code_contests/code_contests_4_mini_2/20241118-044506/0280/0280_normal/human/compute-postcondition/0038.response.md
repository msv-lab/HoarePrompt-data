According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than or equal to 2, as the range starts from 2. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `n` must be at least 2. Additionally, before the loop starts, `p` is initialized to 2, which is the first value in the range. 

State: **`f` is an empty list, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `p` is 2**
