The line `prime[i] = False` assigns the value `False` to the index `i` of the list or array `prime`. The value of `i` is calculated as `p * p + 2p`, and since `n` is at least `i`, this assignment is valid. The initial state suggests that `prime[i]` was previously set to either `True` or some other value, but after this assignment, it will be `False`. The values of `p` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`p` is increased by 1, `n` is at least `p * p + 2p`, `i` is `p * p + 2p`, and `prime[i]` is set to False**
