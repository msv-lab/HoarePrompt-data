According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `p * p`, `n` is at least `p * p + p`, and `prime[i]` is set to False. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by `p` (the step size), which means `i` will become `p * p + p`. Since `n` is at least `p * p + p`, `i` will still be less than or equal to `n` after this increment. 

Thus, the states need to be adjusted so that `i` becomes `p * p + p` and `prime[i]` should be set to False for this new value of `i`.

State: **`p` is increased by 1, `n` is at least `p * p + p`, `i` is `p * p + p`, and `prime[i]` is set to False**
