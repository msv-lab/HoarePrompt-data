Postcondition: ***`p` is increased by 1, `n` is a positive integer such that `n` is at least `(p + 1) * (p + 1)`, and `prime` is a list of length `n + 1` initially set to `True`. If `prime[p]` is `True`, the loop executes, marking `prime[i]` as `False` for all `i` from `p * p` to `n`, incremented by `p`, resulting in `False` values at indices `p * p, p * p + p, ..., up to n`. If `n` is less than `p * p`, the loop does not execute, and `prime` remains unchanged with all values set to `True`.***
