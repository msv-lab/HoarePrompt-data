The code `prime[i] = False` assigns the value `False` to the index `i` in the list `prime`. The value of `i` is previously defined as `p * p`, which is based on the value of `p`. The values of `p` and `n` are not directly altered by this operation. Therefore, only the value at the index `i` in the list `prime` is changed to `False`.

Since we do not have specific values for `p`, `n`, or `prime`, we can only describe the effect of the assignment operation:

- `p` is increased by 1.
- `n` is at least `p * p + p`.
- `i` is `p * p`.
- The list `prime` has its value at index `i` set to `False`.

Output State: **`p` is increased by 1, `n` is at least `p * p + p`, `i` is `p * p`, and `prime[i]` is set to False.**
