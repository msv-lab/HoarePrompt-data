The code `f.append(p)` appends the value of `p`, which is 3, to the list `f`. Before this operation, `f` is an empty list. After execution, `f` will contain the single element `[3]`. The values of `n` and `p` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `f` is `[3]`, `n` is greater than 3, `p` is 3.

Output State: **`f` is [3], `n` is greater than 3, `p` is 3**
