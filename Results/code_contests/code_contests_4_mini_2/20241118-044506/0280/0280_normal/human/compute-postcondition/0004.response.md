The value at index `i` (which is 4) of the `prime` list is set to `False`. The other variables (`n`, `prime`, `p`, and `i`) are not affected by this operation. Since `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `prime` is a list of length `n + 1` with all values initially set to `True`, and now the value at index 4 is changed to `False`. 

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `prime` is a list of length `n + 1` with the value at index 4 set to `False`, `p` is 2, and `i` is 4.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 4, `prime` is a list of length `n + 1` with the value at index 4 set to `False`, `p` is 2, and `i` is 4**
