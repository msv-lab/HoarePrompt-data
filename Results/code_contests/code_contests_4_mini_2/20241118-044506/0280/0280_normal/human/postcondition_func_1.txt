The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and returns an iterable of integers obtained by mapping the output of `func_4()` after splitting it into separate values. However, it is important to note that since `map` returns an iterator in Python 3, the output may need to be converted into a list or another data structure to be fully utilized, which is not indicated in the annotations.
