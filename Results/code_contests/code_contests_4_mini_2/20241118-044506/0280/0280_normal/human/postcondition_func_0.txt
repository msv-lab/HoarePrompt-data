The function accepts two parameters, `n` (an integer between 1 and 100) and `p` (an integer), and returns `n` raised to the power of `(p - 2)` modulo `p`. It does not handle any edge cases related to the values of `p` that could lead to issues, such as when `p` is less than 2, resulting in a negative exponent. It also assumes that `n` is always within the specified range without validation.
