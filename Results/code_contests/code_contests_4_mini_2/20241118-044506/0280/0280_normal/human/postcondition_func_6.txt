The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns a list of its divisors up to the square root of `n`. If `n` is less than 1, the function returns an empty list as no divisors are calculated. The list will include both the divisor `i` and the corresponding quotient `n // i` when applicable, ensuring that perfect squares only include their square root once. If `n` is greater than 100, the function still operates normally, returning the correct divisors within the specified range.
