Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not correctly compute the expected number of unique elements in the chosen segment of the array from index l to index r. The logic used in the program only calculates the number of unique elements in the entire array (`len(set(arr))`) and then adds 1, which does not account for the random segments defined by l and r. 

For example, consider the following input:

```
3
1 2 2
```

The possible segments (l, r) are:
- (1, 1) → unique elements = {1} → count = 1
- (1, 2) → unique elements = {1, 2} → count = 2
- (1, 3) → unique elements = {1, 2} → count = 2
- (2, 2) → unique elements = {2} → count = 1
- (2, 3) → unique elements = {2} → count = 1
- (3, 3) → unique elements = {2} → count = 1

The expected value is calculated as the average of these counts, which would be (1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1) / 6 = 1.3333, rather than `len(set(arr)) + 1) / 2 = (2 + 1) / 2 = 1.5`.

Thus, the method used in the program is fundamentally flawed and does not comply with the problem's requirements.
