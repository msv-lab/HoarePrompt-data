Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description. The expected value of the number of unique elements in a segment from index `l` to index `r` is not calculated properly.

**Issues with the program:**

1. The program calculates the number of unique elements in the entire array using `len(set(arr))`, which is not what the problem asks for. The unique elements should be calculated for all possible segments `[l, r]` of the array, which means the program should consider every possible combination of `l` and `r`.

2. The expression `(req + 1) / 2` is incorrect in the context of calculating the expected number of unique elements. The expected value should be derived from the counts of unique elements across all possible segments, not simply averaging the total unique values.

**Counterexample:**
For the input:
```
3
1 2 1
```
- The possible segments are:
  - `[1,1]` -> unique elements: `{1}` -> count = 1
  - `[1,2]` -> unique elements: `{1, 2}` -> count = 2
  - `[1,3]` -> unique elements: `{1, 2}` -> count = 2
  - `[2,2]` -> unique elements: `{2}` -> count = 1
  - `[2,3]` -> unique elements: `{1, 2}` -> count = 2
  - `[3,3]` -> unique elements: `{1}` -> count = 1

This gives the counts of unique elements as: 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1. The expected value is the average of these counts, which is `(1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1) / 6 = 1.5`.

However, the program will incorrectly output `2` for this input since it calculates the total unique elements across the array. This demonstrates that the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description.
