The expression evaluates `print(req + 1) / 2`, where `req` is the count of unique integers in `arr`. The value of `req` is known from the initial state, and the operation adds 1 to it before dividing by 2. Other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is that `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers, and the function prints `(req + 1) / 2`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers, and the function prints `(req + 1) / 2`**
