The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input and converts it to an integer. Since `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^6, the specific value of `n` will now be that input integer. Other variables, including `arr`, remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, and `arr` is a list of n positive integers.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, and `arr` is a list of n positive integers**
