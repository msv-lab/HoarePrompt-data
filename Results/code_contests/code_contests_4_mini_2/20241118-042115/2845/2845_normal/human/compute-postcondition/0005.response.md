Functionality: ** The function reads an integer input `n` and a list of `n` integers from the user. It calculates the number of distinct integers in the list and returns half of this count (plus one, if the count is odd). However, the function does not handle any potential errors such as invalid input or an empty list, and it does not return any value; instead, it prints the result directly. **
