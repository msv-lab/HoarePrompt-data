The variable `arr` is assigned the value of `map(int, raw_input().split(' '))`, where `raw_input()` accepts a space-separated string of integers, and `split(' ')` divides that string into individual string elements. The `map(int, ...)` then converts each of those string elements into integers. Since `n` is a positive integer and `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers, the output state will reflect that `arr` now contains a list of `n` integers based on the input provided.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers based on the input**
