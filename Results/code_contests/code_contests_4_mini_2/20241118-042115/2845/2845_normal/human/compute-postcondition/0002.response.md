The code assigns the value of `len(set(arr))` to `req`. The `set(arr)` converts the list `arr` into a set, which removes any duplicate values, and `len` then counts the number of unique elements in that set. Since `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers, `req` will hold the count of unique integers in the list. The values of `n` and `arr` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `n` and `arr` along with the new computed value of `req`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers; `req` is the count of unique integers in `arr`**
