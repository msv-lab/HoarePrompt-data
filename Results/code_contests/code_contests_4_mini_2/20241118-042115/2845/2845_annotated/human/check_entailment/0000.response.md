To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the code:

```python
def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    arr = map(int, raw_input().split(' '))
    req = len(set(arr))
    print(req + 1) / 2
```

### Problem Description:
The task is to calculate the expected number of unique elements in a randomly chosen segment of an array, defined by indices `l` and `r`. If `l > r`, we swap them. The expected value should be calculated based on the unique elements in all possible segments `[l, r]`.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The first line reads `n`, the number of elements.
   - The second line reads the array `arr` of integers.

2. **Unique Elements**:
   - `req = len(set(arr))` calculates the number of unique elements in the entire array.

3. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - The code calculates `(req + 1) / 2` and prints it.

### Issues in the Code:
- **Incorrect Calculation of Expected Value**: The expected value of the number of unique elements in the segments `[l, r]` cannot simply be derived as `(number of unique elements + 1) / 2`. This formula does not reflect how the segments are formed or how the unique counts would aggregate over all possible segments. 

### Counterexample:
Consider the following case:

Input:
```
3
1 2 2
```

- The unique elements are `{1, 2}`, so `len(set(arr))` returns `2`.
- The expected value calculated by the code would be `(2 + 1) / 2 = 1.5`, which is not the expected value of unique elements in all segments:
  - Segment `[1, 1]`: unique count = 1 (1)
  - Segment `[1, 2]`: unique count = 2 (1, 2)
  - Segment `[1, 3]`: unique count = 2 (1, 2)
  - Segment `[2, 2]`: unique count = 1 (2)
  - Segment `[2, 3]`: unique count = 2 (2)
  - Segment `[3, 3]`: unique count = 1 (2)
  
Total unique counts: 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 9 for 6 segments, which gives an expected value of `9 / 6 = 1.5`. However, the formula used does not generalize to all cases and is not mathematically sound for all potential inputs.

### Conclusion:
Since the program does not correctly calculate the expected number of unique elements for all possible cases, it fails to meet the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **False**
