Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `arr` of `n` integers, calculates the number of unique integers in `arr`, and returns the integer value of `(number of unique integers + 1) / 2`. Note that the function does not validate the input for `n` or the contents of `arr`, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the input is not as expected. **
