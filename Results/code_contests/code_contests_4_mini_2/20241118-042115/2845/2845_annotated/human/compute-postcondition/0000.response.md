The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since `n` is defined as a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) in the initial state, it will now hold the value retrieved from the input. The other variables, including `arr`, remain unaffected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6), and `arr` is a list of n positive integers where each integer is in the range (1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^6)**
