The code assigns the value of `len(set(arr))` to the variable `req`. The `set(arr)` function creates a set from the list `arr`, which removes any duplicate values. Therefore, `len(set(arr))` gives the count of unique integers in the list `arr`. The variable `n` remains unchanged, and only the new variable `req` is affected, which will hold the count of unique integers in `arr`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6), `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers where each integer is in the range (1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^6), `req` is the number of unique integers in `arr`**
