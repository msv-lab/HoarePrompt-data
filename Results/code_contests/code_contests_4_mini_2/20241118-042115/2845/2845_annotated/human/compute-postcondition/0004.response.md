The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `arr`. `n` is a positive integer that represents the number of elements in the list `arr`, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6`. The parameter `arr` is a list containing `n` positive integers, with each integer in the range of `1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^6`. After executing the function body, the specific output and behavior of the function are not provided. Therefore, based on the constraints, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a list `arr` of `n` positive integers. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n and a list arr of n positive integers.**
