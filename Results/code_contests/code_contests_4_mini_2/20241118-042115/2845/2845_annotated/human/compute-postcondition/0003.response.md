To determine the output state, we first analyze the initial state and the provided code snippet.

Initial State:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6)
- `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers where each integer is in the range (1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^6)
- `req` is the number of unique integers in `arr`

The code snippet executes the expression `print(req + 1) / 2`.

Step-by-step analysis:
1. The code calculates `req + 1`. Here, `req` is the number of unique integers in `arr`.
2. This value is then divided by `2`.
3. The result of the calculation is printed, but it does not change any variable states.

Since we do not have the specific value of `req`, we will express the output in terms of `req`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6), `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers where each integer is in the range (1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^6), `req` is the number of unique integers in `arr`, and the output is (req + 1) / 2.**
