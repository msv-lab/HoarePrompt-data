The variable `arr` is assigned the value of `map(int, raw_input().split(' '))`, which means it takes input in the form of a space-separated string of integers, splits that string into individual string elements, converts each of those string elements into integers, and then maps them to the variable `arr`. This results in `arr` being a list of integers. The initial state indicates that `n` is a positive integer representing the number of elements in `arr`, and all integers in `arr` are positive and within the given range. Therefore, `arr` will hold `n` integers, each in the specified range.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6), `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers where each integer is in the range (1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^6)**
