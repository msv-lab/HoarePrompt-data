According to the code, the loop iterates from `n - 1` down to `0`. For the loop to execute one more time, the variable `i` must be adjusted to the next value in the iteration sequence, which is `i - 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at `0` (the loop would have just executed for the last time with `i` as `0`). Since the loop decrements `i` in each iteration, the next value of `i` would be `-1`, which indicates that the loop cannot execute again.

Thus, to enable the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be adjusted to `-1`, and `n` must be greater than `0` to ensure the loop is valid for the next iteration.

State: **`ans` is updated by adding `sm - diff - a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt)`; `sm` is updated by adding `a[i]`; `m` reflects the count of occurrences of `a[i]`; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is -1**
