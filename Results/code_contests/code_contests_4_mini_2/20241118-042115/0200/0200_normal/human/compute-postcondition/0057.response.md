The value of `sm` is incremented by `a[i]`, but the previous value of `sm` is unknown. The initial state mentions that `ans` has already been updated, but does not affect the other variables. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `sm`.

Output State: **`ans` is updated by adding `sm - diff - a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt)`; `sm` is updated by adding `a[i]`**
