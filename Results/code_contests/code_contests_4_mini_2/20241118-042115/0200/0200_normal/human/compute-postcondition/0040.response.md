The value of `a[i]` is accessed where `i` is set to -1. This means that `a[-1]` retrieves the last element of the array `a`, which affects the calculation of `sm`. The value of `sm` is incremented by `a[i]`, where `i` is -1. The variables `cnt`, `diff`, and the previous value of `ans` remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the output state indicates that `sm` has been updated based on the last element of array `a`.

Output State: **`ans` is updated based on the expression `sm - diff - a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt)`, while `sm` is now `sm + a[-1]`, `cnt` remains unchanged, `diff` remains unchanged, and `i` is -1.**
