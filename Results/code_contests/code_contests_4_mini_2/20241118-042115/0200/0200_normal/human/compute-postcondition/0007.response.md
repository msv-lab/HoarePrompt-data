The code initializes a variable `diff` with the value `0`. This assignment does not affect any of the previously defined variables (`n`, `a`, `sm`, `m`, `ans`, `i`, `cnt`). Therefore, the output state remains unchanged except for the addition of the new variable `diff`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer ai satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9, `sm` is 0, `m` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is 0, `i` is n - 1, `cnt` is 0, `diff` is 0**
