Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ 10^9, `sm` is 0, `m` is a dictionary, `ans` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, and `cnt` and `diff` are updated based on the existence of `a[i] + 1` in `m`. If `a[i] + 1` is found in `m`, `cnt` is incremented by the count of occurrences of `a[i] + 1` in `m`, and `diff` is updated to include the product of `a[i] + 1` and its count in `m`. If `a[i] + 1` is not in `m`, `cnt` remains unchanged, and `diff` does not change. This means that `cnt` can either increase or remain the same, while `diff` will only be updated if `a[i] + 1` exists in the dictionary `m`.***
