The value of `cnt` is incremented by `m[a[i]]`. Given that `a[i]` exists as a key in the dictionary `m`, `m[a[i]]` retrieves the corresponding value from the dictionary. The previous value of `cnt` is 0, so after execution, `cnt` will have the value of `m[a[i]]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9, `sm` is 0, `m` is a dictionary containing at least one key-value pair, `ans` is 0, `i` is n - 1, `cnt` is `m[a[i]]`, `diff` is 0, and the value `a[i]` exists as a key in the dictionary `m`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9, `sm` is 0, `m` is a dictionary containing at least one key-value pair, `ans` is 0, `i` is n - 1, `cnt` is `m[a[i]]`, `diff` is 0, and the value `a[i]` exists as a key in the dictionary `m`.**
