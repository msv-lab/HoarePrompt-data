Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ 10^9. If `a[n - 1] - 1` exists in the dictionary `m`, `cnt` is increased by the count of occurrences of `a[n - 1] - 1` in `m`, and `diff` is updated by adding (a[n - 1] - 1) multiplied by its count in `m`. If `a[n - 1] - 1` does not exist in `m`, `cnt` remains unchanged and `diff` is unaffected. Thus, `cnt` may increase or stay the same, while `diff` may increase or remain the same depending on the presence of `a[n - 1] - 1` in `m.***
