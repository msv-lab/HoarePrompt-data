Output State: **`ans` is updated based on the expression `sm - diff - a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt)`; `sm` is updated to `sm + a[-1]`; if `a[i]` exists in `m`, then `cnt` is incremented by `m[a[i]]`, and `diff` is updated to `a[i] * m[a[i]]`; if `a[i]` is not in `m`, `cnt` remains 0 and `diff` remains 0; `i` is equal to `n - 1`; `cnt` is incremented by `m[a[i] + 1]`.**
