Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ 10^9, `sm` is 0, `m` is a dictionary, `ans` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `cnt` is the count of occurrences of `a[i]` in `m` (if `a[i]` is a key in `m`, otherwise `cnt` remains 0), and `diff` is updated to `a[i] * m[a[i]]` if `a[i]` is found in `m`. If `a[i]` is not in `m`, `cnt` and `diff` remain unchanged.***
