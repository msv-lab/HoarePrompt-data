Output State: **`ans` is updated by adding `sm - diff - a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt)`, `sm` is increased by `a[i]`, `m` has the updated count of `a[i]`, `i` is -1, `cnt` is updated by adding `m[a[i]]`, and `diff` is updated to `diff + (a[i] + 1) * m[a[i] + 1]` if `a[i]` exists in `m`, otherwise `cnt` is updated by adding `m[a[i] + 1]` and the values of `ans`, `sm`, `m`, and `diff` remain unchanged.**
