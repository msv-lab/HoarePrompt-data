The expression `m[a[i]] = 1` is attempting to assign the value `1` to the key `a[i]` in the dictionary (or list) `m`. Given that `i` is -1, `a[-1]` refers to the last element of the list `a`. The initial state indicates that `sm` has been updated to `sm + a[-1]`, while `cnt` and `diff` remain unchanged, and `i` is -1. The value of `a[-1]` is thus crucial for the assignment.

Since `a[-1]` is the last element of the array `a`, we can denote it as `last_element`. The assignment will modify the dictionary (or list) `m` such that `m[last_element]` is set to `1`. 

As a result, the output state reflects that `m` has been updated with a new value for the key `a[-1]`, and the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans` is updated based on the expression `sm - diff - a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt)`; `sm` is now `sm + a[-1]`; `cnt` remains unchanged; `diff` remains unchanged; `i` is -1; and `m[a[-1]]` is set to 1.**
