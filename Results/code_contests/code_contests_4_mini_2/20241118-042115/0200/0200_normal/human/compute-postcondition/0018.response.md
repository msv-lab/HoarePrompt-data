The line of code updates the value of `diff` by adding the product of `(a[i] - 1)` and the count of that value in the dictionary `m`. The variable `i` is initially set to `n - 1`, which means it references the last element of the list `a`. The output state will reflect the new value of `diff` based on the calculation involving `a[i]` and `m`.

Since the initial state provides that `cnt` is updated based on `m[a[i] - 1]`, we assume that the relevant count and product can be calculated directly from `m`. The specific values of `m`, `a`, and `diff` prior to this operation are not provided, but we will indicate that `diff` is updated.

Output State: **`diff` is updated by adding (a[n - 1] - 1) * m[a[n - 1] - 1]**
