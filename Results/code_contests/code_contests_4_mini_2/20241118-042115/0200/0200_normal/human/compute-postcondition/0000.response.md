The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` takes an input value and `int()` converts it to an integer. The other variable `a` is not affected by this line of code. Since `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, after execution, `n` will hold the value of the input integer. The output state reflects this change.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, and `a` is a list of n integers where each integer ai satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9**
