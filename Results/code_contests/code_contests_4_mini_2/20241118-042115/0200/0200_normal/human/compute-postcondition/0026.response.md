Postcondition: ***`ans` is updated by adding `sm - diff - a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt)` and `sm` is increased by `a[i]`. The count of `a[i]` in dictionary `m` is incremented by 1 if `a[i]` is already a key in `m`; otherwise, `m[a[i]]` is set to 1, indicating that `a[i]` has been added to the dictionary.***
