Postcondition: ***`ans` is updated based on the expression `sm - diff - a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt)`, where `sm` is updated to `sm + a[-1]`. The variable `cnt` remains unchanged, `diff` remains unchanged, and `i` is -1. The dictionary `m` is updated such that if `a[-1]` is already a key in `m`, its value is incremented by 1; otherwise, the key `a[-1]` is added to `m` with a value of 1.***
