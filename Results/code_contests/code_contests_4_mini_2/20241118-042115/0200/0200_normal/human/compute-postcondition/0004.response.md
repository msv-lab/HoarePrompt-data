The variable `ans` is assigned the value `0`, and it does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged for the other variables. The output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer ai satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9; `sm` is 0; `m` is an empty dictionary; `ans` is 0.
