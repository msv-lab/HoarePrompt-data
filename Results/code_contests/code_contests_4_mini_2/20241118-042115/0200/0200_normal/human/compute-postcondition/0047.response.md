The variable `cnt` is incremented by the value of `m[a[i]]`. The previous value of `cnt` is 0, and since `i` is `n - 1`, `a[i]` refers to the last element of the array `a`. The last element of `a` is accessed through `m`, which contains this value incremented by 1. Therefore, `cnt` will now hold the value of `m[a[n - 1]]`.

The values of `ans`, `sm`, `diff`, and `i` remain unchanged. Thus, the output state reflects the updated value of `cnt`.

Output State: **`ans` is updated based on the expression `sm - diff - a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt)`; `sm` is updated to `sm + a[-1]`; `cnt` is `m[a[n - 1]]`; `diff` is 0; `i` is `n - 1`**
