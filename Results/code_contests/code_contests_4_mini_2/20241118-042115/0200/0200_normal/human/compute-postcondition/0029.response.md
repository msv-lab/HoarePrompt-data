The variable `diff` is assigned the value `0`. This assignment does not affect the other variables (`ans`, `sm`, `m`, `i`, and `cnt`). Therefore, the output state remains unchanged regarding those variables. 

Output State: **`ans` is updated by adding `sm - diff - a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt)`, `sm` is increased by `a[i]`, `m` has the updated count of `a[i]`, `i` is -1, and `cnt` is 0; `diff` is 0**
