Postcondition: ***`ans` is updated based on the expression `sm - diff - a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt)`, where `sm` is updated to `sm + a[-1]`. If `a[i]` exists in `m`, then `cnt` is incremented by `m[a[i]]`, and `diff` is updated to `a[i] * m[a[i]]`. If `a[i]` is not in `m`, `cnt` remains 0 and `diff` remains 0. It is also ensured that `i` is equal to `n - 1`. All variables maintain their relationships described in the precondition.***
