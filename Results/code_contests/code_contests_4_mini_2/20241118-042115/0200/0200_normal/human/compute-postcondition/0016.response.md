Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ 10^9, `sm` is 0, `m` is a dictionary, `ans` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `cnt` is updated based on the count of occurrences of `a[i] - 1` in `m`, and `diff` includes the product of `a[i] - 1` and its count in `m`. The condition `(a[i] - 1 in m)` is true.***
