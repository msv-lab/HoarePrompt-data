The value of `m[a[i]]` is incremented by 1. The previous values of `ans`, `sm`, `diff`, `a[i]`, `n`, and `cnt` are not affected directly by this operation. However, `m` is updated based on the value of `a[i]`, which is an index in the list or array `m`. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in the `m` variable.

Output State: **`ans` is updated by adding `sm - diff - a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt)`; `sm` is updated by adding `a[i]`; `m[a[i]]` is incremented by 1**
