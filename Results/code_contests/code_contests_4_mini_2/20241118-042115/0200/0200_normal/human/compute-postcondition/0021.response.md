The variable `sm` is updated by adding `a[i]` to its current value. The previous value of `sm` is unknown, but it is incremented by `a[i]`. The states of the other variables `ans`, `diff`, `a`, `n`, and `cnt` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is updated by adding `sm - diff - a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt)`, `sm` is increased by `a[i]`.

Output State: **`ans` is updated by adding `sm - diff - a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt)`, `sm` is increased by `a[i]`**
