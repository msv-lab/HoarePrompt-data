The variable `sm` is initialized to 0. There are no other variables affected by this line of code, and the previous values remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer ai satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9; `sm` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer ai satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9; `sm` is 0**
