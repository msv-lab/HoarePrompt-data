The variable `cnt` is assigned the value `0`. The previous values of the affected variables remain unchanged as the statement only updates `cnt`. Therefore, the output state indicates the current state of all variables, including the updated value of `cnt`.

Output State: **`ans` is updated by adding `sm - diff - a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt)`, `sm` is increased by `a[i]`, `m` has the updated count of `a[i]`, `i` is -1, and `cnt` is 0.**
