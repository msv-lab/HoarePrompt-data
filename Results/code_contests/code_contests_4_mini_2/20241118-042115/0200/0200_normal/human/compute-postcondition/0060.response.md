Postcondition: ***`ans` is updated by adding `sm - diff - a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt)`; `sm` is updated by adding `a[i]`; if `a[i]` is already in `m`, then `m[a[i]]` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `m[a[i]]` is set to 1. This ensures that `m` reflects the count of occurrences of `a[i]` while maintaining the updates to `ans` and `sm` based on the value of `a[i]`.***
