Output State: **`ans` is updated by adding `sm - diff - a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt)`, `sm` is increased by `a[i]`, `m` has the updated count of `a[i]`, `i` is -1, `cnt` is updated by adding `m[a[i]]`, and `diff` is updated to `diff + a[i] * m[a[i]]` if `a[i]` exists in `m`. If `a[i]` does not exist in `m`, there are no changes to `cnt` and `diff`, and the values of `ans`, `sm`, `m`, and `diff` remain unchanged. Therefore, `cnt` is updated by adding `m[a[i] + 1]`.**
