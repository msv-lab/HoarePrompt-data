The code snippet `m[a[i]] = 1` assigns the value `1` to the dictionary (or list) `m` at the index (or key) `a[i]`. This operation updates the state of `m` but does not affect the other variables `ans`, `sm`, or `a`. The previous states of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans` is updated by adding `sm - diff - a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt)`; `sm` is updated by adding `a[i]`; `m[a[i]]` is set to 1.**
