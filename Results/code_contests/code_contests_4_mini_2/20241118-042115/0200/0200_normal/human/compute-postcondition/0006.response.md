The variable `cnt` is initialized to 0. This does not affect any other variables, as none of them have been changed. The values of `n`, `a`, `sm`, `m`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer ai satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9, `sm` is 0, `m` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is 0, `i` is n - 1, and `cnt` is 0.
