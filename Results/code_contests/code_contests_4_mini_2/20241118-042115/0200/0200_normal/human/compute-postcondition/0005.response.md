According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop iterates from `n - 1` down to `0`, meaning it will execute if `n` is at least `1`. Given that `n` is a positive integer satisfying the condition `1 ≤ n ≤ 200000`, the loop will indeed execute since `n` is guaranteed to be at least `1`.

At the start of the loop, the variable `i` will take the value of `n - 1`, which is the last index of the list `a`. Therefore, the initial states need to reflect that `i` is `n - 1`. 

Thus, the adjusted states before the loop starts should be:
State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer ai satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9, `sm` is 0, `m` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is 0, `i` is n - 1**
