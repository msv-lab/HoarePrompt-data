Postcondition: ***`ans`, `sm`, `m`, `cnt`, and `diff` are updated based on the value of `a[i]`. If `a[i] - 1` exists in `m`, then `cnt` is increased by `m[a[i] - 1]`, `diff` is updated by adding `(a[i] - 1) * m[a[i] - 1]`, `ans` is updated by adding `sm - diff - a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt)`, and `sm` is increased by `a[i]`. The value of `m` is updated with the count of `a[i]`. If `a[i] - 1` does not exist in `m`, the values of `cnt`, `ans`, `sm`, and `diff` remain unchanged, and `i` is set to -1 in either case.***
