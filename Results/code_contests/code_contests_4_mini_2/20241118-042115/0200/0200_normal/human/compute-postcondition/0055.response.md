Postcondition: ***`ans` is updated based on the expression `sm - diff - a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt)`; `sm` is updated to `sm + a[-1]`; if `a[i] - 1` exists in `m`, `cnt` is incremented by the value of `m[a[i] - 1]` and `diff` is updated by adding `(a[i] - 1) * m[a[i] - 1]`. If `a[i] - 1` does not exist in `m`, `cnt` remains unchanged and `diff` is unaffected, while all variables maintain their relationships as described in the precondition.***
