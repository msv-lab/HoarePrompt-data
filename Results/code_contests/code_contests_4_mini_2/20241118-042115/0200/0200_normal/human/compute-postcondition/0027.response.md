According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the value of `i` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has been decremented from its previous value. The loop starts with `i` at `n - 1`. 

Since `i` is iterating from `n - 1` down to `0`, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to set `i` to `-1`, which indicates that the loop has completed all its iterations.

No other states such as `ans`, `sm`, or `m` need to be adjusted since they are updated during the loop body and are not directly related to the loop's control variable.

State: **`ans` is updated by adding `sm - diff - a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt)`, `sm` is increased by `a[i]`, `m` has the updated count of `a[i]`, `i` is -1**
