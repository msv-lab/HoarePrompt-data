Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9, `sm` is 0, `m` is a dictionary containing at least one key-value pair, `ans` is 0, `i` is n - 1, `cnt` is 0, `diff` is 0, and the value `a[i]` exists as a key in the dictionary `m`.***
