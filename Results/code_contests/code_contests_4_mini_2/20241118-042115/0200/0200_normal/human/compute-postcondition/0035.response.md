Postcondition: ***`ans`, `sm`, `m`, `cnt`, and `diff` are updated based on the value of `a[i]`. If `a[i] + 1` exists in `m`, then `cnt` is increased by `m[a[i] + 1]`, and `diff` is updated by adding `(a[i] + 1) * m[a[i] + 1]`. The value of `ans` is updated by adding `sm - diff - a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt)`, `sm` is increased by `a[i]`, and `m` is updated with the count of `a[i]`. If `a[i] + 1` does not exist in `m`, then `cnt` remains unchanged, and the values of `ans`, `sm`, and `diff` will not be updated. In either case, `i` is set to -1.***
