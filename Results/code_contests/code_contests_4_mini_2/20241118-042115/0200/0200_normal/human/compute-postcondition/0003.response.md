The code initializes `m` as an empty dictionary. The variables `n`, `a`, and `sm` are not affected by this operation, so their values remain the same. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer ai satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9; `sm` is 0; and `m` is an empty dictionary.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer ai satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9; `sm` is 0; `m` is an empty dictionary**
