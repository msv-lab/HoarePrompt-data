The function accepts an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It computes a value `ans` based on the sum of elements in `a` and their occurrences, using a dictionary to track counts of each element. The result, `ans`, is printed at the end of execution. The function does not handle cases where `n` is less than 1, and if `n` is 0, it will simply print 0. The range of `n` is constrained between 1 and 200,000, and each integer in the list can be between 1 and 10^9.
