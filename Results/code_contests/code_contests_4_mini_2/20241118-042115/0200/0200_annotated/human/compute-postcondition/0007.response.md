The code initializes `diff` to 0. The previous values of the affected variables remain unchanged as this is a new variable assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the initialization of `diff` along with the existing values of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `i` is `n - 1`, `sm` is 0, `m` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is 0, `cnt` is 0, and `diff` is 0**
