Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `i` is `n - 2`, `sm` is `a[n - 2]`, and `ans` is increased by `a[n - 2] - diff - a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt)`. If `a[i]` is in `m`, then `cnt` is increased by `m[a[i]]` and `diff` is updated to `a[i] * m[a[i]]`. If `a[i]` is not in `m`, `cnt` remains 0 and `diff` remains 0. The overall state of the program reflects these updates based on the presence or absence of `a[i]` in `m`.***
