The variable `cnt` is assigned the value of 0. The values of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `sm`, `m`, `ans`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `i` is `n - 1`, `sm` is 0, `m` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is 0, and `cnt` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `i` is `n - 1`, `sm` is 0, `m` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is 0, and `cnt` is 0**
