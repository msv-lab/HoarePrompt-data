According to the code, the loop executes a range from `n - 1` down to `0`, inclusive. For the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 1, which it is according to the given state. The variable `i` will start at `n - 1` and will decrement until it reaches `0`. 

Since `n` is a positive integer and falls within the range of 1 to 200000, we can assume that `i` will be initialized to `n - 1`. The initial value of `sm`, `m`, and `ans` do not affect the execution of the loop but represent other program states.

Therefore, to summarize the necessary states for the loop to execute:

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `i` is `n - 1`, `sm` is 0, `m` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is 0**
