Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `i` is `n - 1`, `sm` is 0, `m` is a dictionary that may or may not contain keys, `ans` is 0, `cnt` is increased by `m[a[i] + 1]` if `a[i] + 1` is a key in `m`, and `diff` is increased by `(a[i] + 1) * m[a[i] + 1]` if `a[i] + 1` is a key in `m`; otherwise, `diff` remains unchanged.**
