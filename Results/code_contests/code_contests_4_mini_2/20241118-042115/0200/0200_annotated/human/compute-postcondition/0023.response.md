The operation `m[a[i]] += 1` increments the count of the key `a[i]` in the dictionary `m`. The previous value of `m[a[i]]` is not specified, but it is assumed to exist since `a[i]` is given as a key in the dictionary. The values of `n`, `i`, `sm`, and `ans` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `i` is `n - 1`, `sm` is `a[n - 1]`, `m[a[i]]` is increased by 1, `ans` is increased by `sm - diff - a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt)`**
