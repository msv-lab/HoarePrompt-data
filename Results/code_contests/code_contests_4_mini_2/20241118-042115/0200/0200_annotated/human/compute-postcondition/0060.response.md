Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000) and `i` is `n - 3`. If `a[i]` exists in the dictionary `m`, then `m[a[i]]` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` does not exist in `m`, then `m[a[i]]` is set to 1, `sm` is updated by adding `a[i]`, and `ans` is updated by adding `sm - diff - a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt)`.***
