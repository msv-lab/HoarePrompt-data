The variable `diff` is assigned the value `0`. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `sm`, `cnt`, `ans`, and `m[a[i]]`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the updates to `diff` while maintaining the previous states of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `i` is `n - 3`, `sm` is updated accordingly, `cnt` is 0, `diff` is 0, `ans` is updated accordingly, `m[a[i]]` is incremented or initialized as appropriate.**
