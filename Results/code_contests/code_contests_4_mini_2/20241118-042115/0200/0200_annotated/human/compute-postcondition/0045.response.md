The code initializes `cnt` to 0. No other variables have been affected by this operation, as it directly assigns a value to `cnt`. The previous values of other variables like `n`, `i`, `sm`, `diff`, `ans`, and `m[a[i]]` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `cnt` while indicating that the other variables retain their original states.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `i` is `n - 3`, `sm` is updated accordingly, `cnt` is 0, `diff` is updated accordingly, `ans` is updated accordingly, `m[a[i]]` is incremented or initialized as appropriate.**
