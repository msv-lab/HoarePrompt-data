The value of `sm` is incremented by `a[i]`, where `a[i]` is the value at index `i` in the list `a`. The previous value of `sm` is 0, and since `i` is `n - 1`, the value of `a[i]` refers to the last element of the list `a`. Therefore, `sm` becomes equal to `a[n - 1]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `i` is `n - 1`, `sm` is `a[n - 1]`, `m` is a dictionary, `ans` is increased by `sm - diff - a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt)`**
