The variable `diff` is updated by adding the product of `(a[i] + 1)` and `m[a[i] + 1]`. The specific values of `a[i]` and `m[a[i] + 1]` are not provided, but they influence the calculation. The values of `n`, `i`, `sm`, `cnt`, and `ans` remain unchanged, and `diff` is updated accordingly. Therefore, the output state reflects that `diff` has been modified based on the current values of `a[i]` and `m[a[i] + 1]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `i` is `n - 3`, `sm` is updated accordingly, `cnt` is increased by the value of `m[a[i] + 1]`, and `diff` is updated by adding `(a[i] + 1) * m[a[i] + 1]`.**
