Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `i` is `n - 1`, `sm` is 0, `m` is a dictionary that may or may not contain keys, `ans` is 0. If `a[i] + 1` is a key in `m`, then `cnt` is increased by `m[a[i] + 1]`, and `diff` is increased by `(a[i] + 1) * m[a[i] + 1]`. If `a[i] + 1` is not a key in `m`, then `cnt` remains unchanged and `diff` remains unchanged. The state of `cnt` and `diff` thus reflects the presence or absence of `a[i] + 1` in the dictionary `m`.***
