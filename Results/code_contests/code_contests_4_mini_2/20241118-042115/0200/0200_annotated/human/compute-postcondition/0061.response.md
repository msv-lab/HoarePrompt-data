According to the code, the loop iterates from `n - 1` down to `0`. The loop continues as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 3`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented to `n - 4`. 

Since `i` is currently `n - 3`, we update it to `n - 4`. The loop will execute again as long as `i` remains non-negative, which it will since `n` is a positive integer and `n - 4` will be non-negative for values of `n` greater than or equal to 4.

No other states need to be adjusted because the values of `n`, `m`, `sm`, `ans`, and `cnt` do not change for this iteration; they will only be affected by the loop's body.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `i` is `n - 4`**
