The expression `diff += (a[i] - 1) * m[a[i] - 1]` updates the value of `diff` by adding the product of `(a[i] - 1)` and `m[a[i] - 1]`. The variable `i` is previously defined as `n - 3`, and since `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 200000, `i` will also be a non-negative integer due to this definition. 

The other variables `cnt`, `sm`, and `ans` have no direct impact from this operation, but their previous states remain unchanged. The value of `a[i]` depends on the array `a`, which is not specified in the initial state, and thus we cannot determine a specific value for `diff` after this operation without knowing `a[i]` and `m[a[i] - 1]`. 

Therefore, the output state will reflect the update of `diff` while acknowledging that `a[i]` and `m[a[i] - 1]` must be known to determine the exact change.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `i` is `n - 3`, `diff` is updated by adding (a[i] - 1) * m[a[i] - 1]**
