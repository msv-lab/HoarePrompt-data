Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `i` is `n - 2`, `sm` is `sm + a[i]`, `cnt` is increased by `m[a[i] - 1]` if `a[i] - 1` exists in `m`, `diff` is updated by adding `(a[i] - 1) * m[a[i] - 1]` if `a[i] - 1` exists in `m`, and `ans` is updated by adding `sm - diff - a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt)` regardless of the presence of `a[i] - 1` in `m`.**
