Output State: **`ans` is the cumulative result calculated from the elements of the list `a`, `sm` is the sum of all elements in `a`, and `m` is a dictionary holding the counts of each unique integer in `a`. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `sm` remains 0, `ans` remains 0, and `m` remains an empty dictionary. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute exactly `n` times, processing each element of `a` from the last index to the first.**
