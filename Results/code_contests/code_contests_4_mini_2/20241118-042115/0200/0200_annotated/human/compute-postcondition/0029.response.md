The variable `diff` is assigned the value `0`. The other variables `n`, `i`, `sm`, `ans`, and `cnt` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state will reflect the unchanged values of these variables along with the new value of `diff`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `i` is `n - 2`, `sm` is `a[n - 2]`, `ans` is increased by `a[n - 2] - diff - a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt)`, `cnt` is 0, `diff` is 0**
