Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `i` is `n - 1`, `sm` is 0, `m` is a dictionary, and `ans` is 0. If `a[i] - 1` is a key in `m`, then `cnt` is increased by the value of `m[a[i] - 1]` and `diff` is increased by `(a[i] - 1) * m[a[i] - 1]`. If `a[i] - 1` is not a key in `m`, `cnt` and `diff` remain unchanged. Thus, the state of `cnt` and `diff` reflects the presence or absence of `a[i] - 1` in the dictionary `m`.***
