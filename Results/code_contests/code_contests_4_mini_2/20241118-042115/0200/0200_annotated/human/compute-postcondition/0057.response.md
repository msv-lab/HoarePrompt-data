The variable `sm` is updated by adding the value of `a[i]` to it. The value of `i` is `n - 3`, which means `a[i]` corresponds to the value of the array `a` at the index `n - 3`. The initial state does not provide the exact value of `a[i]`, but we know that `a[i]` is a specific value from the array `a`. The other variables (`n`, `i`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state reflects that `sm` has been updated, while the other variables remain in their initial state.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000); `i` is `n - 3`; `ans` is updated by adding `sm - diff - a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt)`; `sm` is updated by adding `a[i]`.**
