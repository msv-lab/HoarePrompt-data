To analyze the impact of the code, we need to consider the following:

1. **Initialization of Variables**:
   - `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000).
   - `i` is initialized as `n - 1`.
   - `sm` is initialized to `0`.
   - `m` is a dictionary where `a[i]` is a key.
   - `ans` is initialized to `0`.
   - `cnt` is increased by `m[a[i]]`, which implies `cnt` is updated based on the value in the dictionary for the key `a[i]`.
   - `diff` is initialized to `0`.

2. **Execution of the Code**:
   - The line `diff += a[i] * m[a[i]]` calculates the product of `a[i]` and `m[a[i]]`, which is then added to `diff`.
   - The value of `a[i]` is determined by the value of `i`, which is `n - 1`.

Now, let's summarize the output state:

- The variable `diff` is updated by the value of `a[i] * m[a[i]]`, but we don't have specific values for `a[i]` or `m[a[i]]`, so we cannot specify the exact numerical outcome of `diff`.
- The states of other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state reflects the changes and current values of the involved variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `i` is `n - 1`, `sm` is 0, `m` is a dictionary containing `a[i]` as a key, `ans` is 0, `cnt` is increased by `m[a[i]]`, `diff` is updated by `a[i] * m[a[i]]`**
