The code initializes `m` as an empty dictionary. The values of other variables (`n`, `a`, and `sm`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of these variables along with the new state of `m`.

Output State: **`n` is the input positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000; `a` is a list of n integers; `sm` is 0; `m` is an empty dictionary**.
