Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `i` is `n - 2`, `sm` is updated to `sm + a[i]`, `cnt` is increased by `m[a[i] - 1]` if `a[i] - 1` exists in `m`, `diff` is updated by adding `(a[i] - 1) * m[a[i] - 1]` if `a[i] - 1` exists in `m`, and `ans` is updated by adding `sm - diff - a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt)` regardless of the presence of `a[i] - 1`. Additionally, `m[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 if it already exists in `m`, or it is initialized to 1 if it does not exist. This ensures that all possible scenarios regarding the existence of `a[i]` in `m` are handled properly.***
