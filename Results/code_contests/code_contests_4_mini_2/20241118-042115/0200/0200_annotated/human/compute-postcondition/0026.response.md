Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `i` is `n - 1`, `sm` is `a[n - 1]`, and `ans` is increased by `sm - diff - a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt)`. If `a[i]` is already a key in the dictionary `m`, then its value is increased by 1. Otherwise, `a[i]` is added as a key in the dictionary `m` with a value of 1.***
