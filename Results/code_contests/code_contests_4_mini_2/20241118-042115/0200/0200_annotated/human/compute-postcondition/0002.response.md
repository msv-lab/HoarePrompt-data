The variable `sm` is initialized to 0. The initial state of `n` and `a` is not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `n` and `a`, along with the new value of `sm`.

Output State: **`n` is the input positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000; `a` is a list of n integers; `sm` is 0**
