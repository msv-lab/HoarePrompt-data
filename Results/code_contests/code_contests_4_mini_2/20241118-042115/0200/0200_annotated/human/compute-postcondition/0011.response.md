Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `i` is `n - 1`, `sm` is 0, `m` is a dictionary that may or may not contain `a[i]` as a key, `ans` is 0, if `a[i]` is a key in `m`, then `cnt` is increased by `m[a[i]]` and `diff` is updated by `a[i] * m[a[i]]`; otherwise, `cnt` and `diff` remain unchanged.***
