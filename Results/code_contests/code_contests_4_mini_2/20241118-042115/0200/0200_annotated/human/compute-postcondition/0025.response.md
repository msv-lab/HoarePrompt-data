The code assigns the value `1` to the key `a[i]` in the dictionary `m`. Since `a[i]` is not already a key in the dictionary, it is added to `m` with a corresponding value of `1`. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `sm`, `ans`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `n`, `i`, `sm`, and `ans`, while stating that `a[i]` has been added to the dictionary `m`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `i` is `n - 1`, `sm` is `a[n - 1]`, `ans` is increased by `sm - diff - a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt)`, and `a[i]` is now a key in the dictionary `m` with a value of 1.**
