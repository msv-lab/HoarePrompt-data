The variable `cnt` is incremented by `m[a[i]]`. The value of `m[a[i]]` is determined based on the current state of the array `m` at index `a[i]`. Since the exact value of `m[a[i]]` is not provided in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact change to `cnt`. However, we can state that `cnt` is increased by whatever value `m[a[i]]` holds.

The output state reflects that `cnt` is updated, but we do not know the specific value of `m[a[i]]`, only that it affects `cnt`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `i` is `n - 3`, `sm` is updated accordingly, `cnt` is increased by `m[a[i]]`, `diff` is 0, `ans` is updated accordingly, `m[a[i]]` is incremented or initialized as appropriate.**
