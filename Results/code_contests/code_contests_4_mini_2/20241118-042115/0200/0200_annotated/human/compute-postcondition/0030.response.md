The variable `cnt` is incremented by the value of `m[a[i]]`. The previous value of `cnt` is 0, so after the execution, `cnt` becomes `m[a[i]]`. The values of `n`, `i`, `sm`, `ans`, `diff`, and the element `a[i]` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `i` is `n - 2`, `sm` is `a[n - 2]`, `ans` is increased by `a[n - 2] - diff - a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt)`, `cnt` is `m[a[i]]`, `diff` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `i` is `n - 2`, `sm` is `a[n - 2]`, `ans` is increased by `a[n - 2] - diff - a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt)`, `cnt` is `m[a[i]]`, `diff` is 0**
