Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `i` is `n - 1`, `sm` is 0, `m` is a dictionary that may or may not contain keys, `ans` is 0, `cnt` is increased by `m[a[i] + 1]` if `a[i] + 1` is a key in `m`, and `diff` is updated by `(a[i] + 1) * m[a[i] + 1]`; if `a[i] + 1` is not a key in `m`, then `cnt` and `diff` remain unchanged.***
