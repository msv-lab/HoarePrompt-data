The statement `m[a[i]] = 1` assigns the value `1` to the key `a[i]` in the dictionary `m`. The variable `i` is currently `n - 3`, which means `a[i]` references the element at index `n - 3` in the list `a`. 

Assuming `a` is a list that contains valid indices, the existing value of `m[a[i]]` is updated to `1`. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `ans`, `sm`) remain unchanged during this operation.

Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `n`, `i`, `ans`, and `sm`, while noting that the dictionary `m` has been modified.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000); `i` is `n - 3`; `ans` is updated by adding `sm - diff - a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt)`; `sm` is updated by adding `a[i]`; `m[a[i]]` is set to 1**
