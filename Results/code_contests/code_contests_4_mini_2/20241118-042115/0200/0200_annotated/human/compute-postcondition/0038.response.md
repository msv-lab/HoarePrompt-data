Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `i` is `n - 2`, `sm` is `a[n - 2]`. If `a[i] - 1` exists in `m`, then `cnt` is increased by `m[a[i] - 1]`, `diff` is updated by adding `(a[i] - 1) * m[a[i] - 1]`, and `ans` is updated by the value of `a[n - 2] - diff - a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt)`. If `a[i] - 1` does not exist in `m`, `cnt` remains unchanged, `diff` is set to 0, but `ans` is still updated under the same initial conditions, ensuring that all updates reflect the presence or absence of `a[i] - 1` in `m`.***
