Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `i` is `n - 3`, `sm` is updated accordingly, if `a[i]` exists in the dictionary `m`, then `cnt` is increased by the value of `m[a[i]]`, and `diff` is updated by adding `a[i] * m[a[i]]`. Additionally, `ans` is updated accordingly, and `m[a[i]]` is incremented or initialized as appropriate. If `a[i]` is not in `m`, `cnt` remains 0, and `diff` remains 0, but the state of `sm`, `ans`, and `m` will reflect any other updates that were made prior to this check.***
