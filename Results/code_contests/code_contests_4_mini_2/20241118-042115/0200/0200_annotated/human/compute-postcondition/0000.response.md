The value of `n` is assigned the result of `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input as a string and `int()` converts it to an integer. The other variable `a` is not affected, so the output state will only reflect the new value of `n`. 

Output State: **`n` is the input positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer ai satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9**
