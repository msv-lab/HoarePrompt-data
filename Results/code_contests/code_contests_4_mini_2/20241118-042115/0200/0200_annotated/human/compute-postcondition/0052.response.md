Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `i` is `n - 3`, and if `a[i] + 1` exists in the dictionary `m`, then `cnt` is increased by the value of `m[a[i] + 1]`, and `diff` is updated by adding `(a[i] + 1) * m[a[i] + 1]`. If `a[i] + 1` does not exist in `m`, then `cnt` remains unchanged and `diff` remains unchanged, while the state of `sm`, `ans`, and `m` reflects any previous updates made before this check.***
