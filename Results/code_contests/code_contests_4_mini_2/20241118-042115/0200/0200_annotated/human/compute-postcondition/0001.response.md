The line of code assigns a new list to the variable `a`. This list is created by taking input from the user as a string, splitting that string into individual components, converting each component to an integer, and then mapping those integers into a list. The previous state of `n` is unchanged, as it simply indicates the number of integers that will be input. Therefore, the output state reflects the new state of `a` based on the user's input.

Output State: **`n` is the input positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 200000; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer ai is the result of the user's input.**
