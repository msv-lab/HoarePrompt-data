According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `i`, which starts from `n - 1` and decrements until it reaches `-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented to `n - 3`. 

The loop will still execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `0`. Since `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `n - 3` is still a valid index as long as `n` is greater than or equal to 3. Therefore, no other states besides the index need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `i` is `n - 3`, `sm` is updated accordingly, `cnt` is updated accordingly, `diff` is updated accordingly, `ans` is updated accordingly, `m[a[i]]` is incremented or initialized as appropriate.**
