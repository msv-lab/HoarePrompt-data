The variable `ans` is assigned the value of 0. This does not affect any other variables in the initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the other variables along with the new value of `ans`.

Output State: **`n` is the input positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000; `a` is a list of n integers; `sm` is 0; `m` is an empty dictionary; `ans` is 0**
