Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `i` is `n - 2`, and `sm` is `a[n - 2]`. If `a[i] + 1` exists in `m`, `cnt` is increased by `m[a[i] + 1]` and `diff` is updated by adding `(a[i] + 1) * m[a[i] + 1]`. The variable `ans` is increased by the value of `a[n - 2] - diff - a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt)`. If `a[i] + 1` is not present in `m`, `cnt` remains unchanged and `diff` remains 0, but `ans` is still updated reflecting the initial conditions. Thus, the overall state of the program accounts for the presence or absence of `a[i] + 1` in `m`, ensuring that `cnt` and `diff` are accurately calculated based on this condition.***
