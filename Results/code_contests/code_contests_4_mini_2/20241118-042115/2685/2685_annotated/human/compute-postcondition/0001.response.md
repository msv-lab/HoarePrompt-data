The variable `res` is initialized to 0. This means that the current value of `res` changes from an undefined state to 0. The other variables (`k`, `n`, `candy_array`, and `res_map`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. 

Output State: **`k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), `candy_array` is a list of integers, `res_map` is an empty dictionary, and `res` is 0**
