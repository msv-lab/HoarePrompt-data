According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `candy_array`. If `candy_array` has at least 3 elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `candy` is the second element in `candy_array`, which indicates that there is at least one more element available. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `candy` should be updated to the third element in `candy_array`, and the loop should iterate with the next index.

State: **`k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), `candy_array` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `candy` is the third element in `candy_array`, and `res_map` is a dictionary.**
