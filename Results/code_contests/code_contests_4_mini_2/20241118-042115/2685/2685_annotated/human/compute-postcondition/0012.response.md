In the provided code snippet, `res_map[candy % k]` is updated based on the current value of `candy`. 

1. Calculate `candy % k`: The value of `candy` is directly obtained from `candy_array`, which has at least 2 elements, so `candy` is defined and valid.
2. Check if `candy % k` exists in `res_map`: If it does, increment its value by 1; if it does not exist, initialize it to 1.

The exact state of `res_map` will depend on the values of `candy`, `k`, and the current contents of `res_map`. Since `k` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, and `candy` is a positive integer pulled from `candy_array`, we can summarize the changes:

- If `candy % k` was not previously in `res_map`, it will be added with a value of 1.
- If `candy % k` was already present, its count will increase by 1.

Therefore, the output state reflects the potential changes in `res_map` without specifying exact values since they are dependent on the initial state of the variables.

Output State: **`k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), `candy_array` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `candy` is the second element in `candy_array`, `res_map` is updated based on `candy % k`.**
