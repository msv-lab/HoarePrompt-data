Postcondition: ***`k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), `candy_array` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `candy` is the first element in `candy_array`, and `res_map` is a dictionary. If `res_map` contains the key `k - candy % k` and its value is greater than 0, then `res` is increased by 2, the value of `res_map[k - candy % k]` is decremented by 1, and `res_map[candy % k]` remains unchanged or is incremented if it already exists. Otherwise, `res_map[candy % k]` is set to 1 if it did not exist, and `res` remains 0. The overall state of `res_map` reflects the counts of remainders from previous candies processed, ensuring no values are negative.***
