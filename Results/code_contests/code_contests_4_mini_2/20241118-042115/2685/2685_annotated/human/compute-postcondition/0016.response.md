The statement `res_map[k - candy % k] = res_map[k - candy % k] - 1` modifies the `res_map` dictionary. 

1. The expression `candy % k` computes the remainder when `candy` is divided by `k`.
2. The value `k - candy % k` is calculated, which gives a specific key in the `res_map` dictionary.
3. The current value at this key in `res_map` is decreased by 1.

Since `k` and `candy` are positive integers, `k - candy % k` will also yield a valid key in the dictionary (assuming it exists). 

The other variables, such as `k`, `n`, `candy_array`, and `res`, remain unaffected by this operation.

Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value in the `res_map` for the key `k - candy % k`.

Output State: **`k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), `candy_array` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `candy` is the third element in `candy_array`, `res_map` is updated at key `k - candy % k`, `res` is increased by 2.**
