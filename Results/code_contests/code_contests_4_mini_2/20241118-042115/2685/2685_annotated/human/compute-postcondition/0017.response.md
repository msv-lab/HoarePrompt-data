To evaluate the impact of the provided code snippet, we analyze the existing state of the variables and how they interact with the operation performed by the code.

1. `candy` is defined as the third element in `candy_array`, which is an integer.
2. `k` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100.
3. The expression `candy % k` calculates the remainder when `candy` is divided by `k`.
4. The dictionary `res_map` is updated based on whether the key `candy % k` already exists in `res_map`.
   - If the key exists, the value associated with that key is incremented by 1.
   - If the key does not exist, it is initialized with a value of 1.

Since `res_map` is being modified based on the value of `candy % k`, the output state will reflect the updated state of `res_map`.

Output State: **`k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), `candy` is the third element in `candy_array`, and `res_map` is updated with the value of `res_map[candy % k]` being incremented by 1 or set to 1.**
