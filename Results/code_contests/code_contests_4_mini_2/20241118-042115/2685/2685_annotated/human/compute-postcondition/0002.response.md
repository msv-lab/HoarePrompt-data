According to the code, the ability for the loop to execute depends on the `candy_array`. If `candy_array` contains at least one element, the loop can execute. Given that `k` is a positive integer and `n` is also a positive integer, we can assume that `candy_array` is expected to have `n` elements. To ensure the loop executes, we need to confirm that `candy_array` is not empty. 

So, for the loop to be executed, `candy_array` must have at least 1 element, and `candy` would be the first element in the `candy_array` during the first iteration.

State: **`k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), `candy_array` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `candy` is the first element in `candy_array`, `res_map` is an empty dictionary, `res` is 0**
