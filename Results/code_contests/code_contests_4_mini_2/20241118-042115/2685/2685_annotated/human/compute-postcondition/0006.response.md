Postcondition: ***`k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), `candy_array` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `candy` is the first element in `candy_array`, `res_map` is an empty dictionary, `res` is 0. The value of `k - candy % k` does not exist as a key in `res_map`, or if it does exist, its value is less than or equal to 0.***
