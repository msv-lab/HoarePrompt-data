Postcondition: ***`k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), `candy_array` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, and `candy` is the third element in `candy_array`. If `res_map` contains the key `k - candy % k` and its value is greater than 0, then `res` is increased by 2, and the value of `res_map[k - candy % k]` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `res_map[candy % k]` is incremented by 1 if it already exists; otherwise, it is set to 1. This ensures that `res_map` is updated accordingly based on the condition of whether the key `k - candy % k` is present and has a positive value.***
