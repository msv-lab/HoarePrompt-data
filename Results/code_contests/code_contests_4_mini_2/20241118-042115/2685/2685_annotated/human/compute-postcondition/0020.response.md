Output State: **If `candy_array` is a list with at least one element, `res` will contain the count of pairs of candies that satisfy the condition based on their remainders when divided by `k`. The `res_map` dictionary will hold the counts of the remainders of candies processed so far. If `candy_array` is empty, the loop will not execute; thus, `res` will remain 0, and `res_map` will remain an empty dictionary. The value of `k` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 100), and `n` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5).**
