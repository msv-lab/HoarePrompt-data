The statement `res_map[k - candy % k] = res_map[k - candy % k] - 1` modifies the dictionary `res_map`. It decreases the value associated with the key `k - candy % k` by 1. 

To determine the output state, we need to check the previous values:

- `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 100).
- `candy` is the first element in `candy_array`, and thus `candy % k` will yield a value between 0 and k-1.
- The key `k - candy % k` is guaranteed to exist in `res_map` based on the initial state.
- The value associated with this key in `res_map` is decremented by 1.

Since no other variables are affected by this operation, the output state reflects the change in `res_map`.

Output State: **`k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), `candy` is the first element in `candy_array`, `res_map[k - candy % k]` is decremented by 1, `res` is 2**
