The code initializes `res_map` as an empty dictionary. It does not affect any of the other variables (`k`, `n`, or `candy_array`), and the previous values of these variables remain unchanged. Thus, the output state reflects only the initialization of `res_map`.

Output State: **`k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), `candy_array` is a list of integers, and `res_map` is an empty dictionary.**
