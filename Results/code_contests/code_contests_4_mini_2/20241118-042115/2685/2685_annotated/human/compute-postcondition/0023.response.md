Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `k` and a list of integers `candy_array`. It calculates the number of pairs of candies whose remainders when divided by `k` complement each other to `k`. For each candy in `candy_array`, it checks if there is a previously encountered candy whose remainder would pair with the current candy's remainder to form a valid pair. The function counts these pairs and prints the total count. If `candy_array` is empty, the function will print 0. It does not return any value. **
