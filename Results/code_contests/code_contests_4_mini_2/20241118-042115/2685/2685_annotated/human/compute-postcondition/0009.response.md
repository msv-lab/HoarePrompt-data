According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `candy_array`. The loop will iterate over each element in `candy_array`, starting from the first element. At the end of the last iteration, `candy` is the first element in `candy_array`. To proceed to the next iteration, we need to adjust `candy` to represent the next element in the array and ensure that the index (or count of elements processed) reflects this.

Since `candy_array` has at least 1 element, for the loop to execute one more time, `candy` should be the next element in `candy_array`. Additionally, if `candy` is currently the first element, it implies that the loop has just processed this first element, and thus we need to ensure that we track which element is being processed next.

State: **`k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), `candy_array` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `candy` is the second element in `candy_array`, and `res_map` is a dictionary.**
