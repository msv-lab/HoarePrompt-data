Postcondition: ***`k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), `candy_array` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `candy` is the second element in `candy_array`, and `res_map` is a dictionary. If `res_map` has the key `k - candy % k` and its value is greater than 0, then `res` is increased by 2 and the value of `res_map[k - candy % k]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `res_map[candy % k]` is incremented by 1 if it already exists; otherwise, it is created with an initial value of 1. This ensures that `res_map` is updated correctly based on the modulo operation with `candy` and `k`.***
