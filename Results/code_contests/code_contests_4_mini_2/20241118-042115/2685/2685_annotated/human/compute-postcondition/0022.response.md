The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `k` and `candy_array`. The parameter `k` is a positive integer constrained between 1 and 100, and `candy_array` is a list of integers, where each integer in the list represents the number of candies in the respective box and is constrained to be a positive integer between 1 and 10^9. 

After executing the function body, it returns the total number of candies distributed among the boxes based on the value of `k`. The exact nature of the distribution and what the function calculates based on `k` is unspecified, but it ultimately results in a single output value.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer k and a list of integers candy_array, and returns the total number of candies distributed based on the value of k.**
