The code updates the `res_map` dictionary by setting the value for the key `candy % k`. Since `res_map` is initially empty, the key `candy % k` does not exist, so the code assigns it a value of 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), `candy_array` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `candy` is the first element in `candy_array`, `res_map` is `{candy % k: 1}`, and `res` is 0.

Output State: **`k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), `candy_array` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `candy` is the first element in `candy_array`, `res_map` is `{candy % k: 1}`, `res` is 0**
