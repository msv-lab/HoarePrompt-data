The value of `res` is incremented by 2. Since the initial value of `res` is 0, after execution, `res` becomes 2. The states of the other variables do not change. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), `candy_array` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `candy` is the first element in `candy_array`, `res_map` is a dictionary containing the key `k - candy % k`, and `res` is 2.

Output State: **`k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), `candy_array` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `candy` is the first element in `candy_array`, `res_map` is a dictionary containing the key `k - candy % k`, and `res` is 2**.
