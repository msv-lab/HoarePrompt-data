The value of `candy` is taken from the second element of `candy_array`, which is an integer. The expression `candy % k` is calculated, and then `k - candy % k` is computed. This value is used as a key in the `res_map` dictionary. The value associated with this key in `res_map` is decreased by 1.

Since `res_map` is a dictionary, its state is modified based on the calculation involving `candy`. The other variables are not affected directly by this line of code.

Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), `candy_array` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `candy` is the second element in `candy_array`, `res_map[k - candy % k]` is decreased by 1, and `res` remains increased by 2.

Output State: **`k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), `candy_array` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `candy` is the second element in `candy_array`, `res_map[k - candy % k]` is decreased by 1, and `res` is increased by 2.**
