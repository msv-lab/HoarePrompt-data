To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the code and its logic.

### Code Analysis
1. **Function Signature**: The function `func_1(k, candy_array)` takes two arguments, `k` (the number of girls) and `candy_array` (the list of candy counts in boxes).

2. **Logic**:
   - A dictionary `res_map` is used to keep track of the counts of the remainders of the candy counts when divided by `k`.
   - The program iterates through each `candy` in `candy_array`:
     - It checks if there exists a complement (i.e., `k - candy % k`) in `res_map` that can form a valid pair.
     - If a pair is found, it increments the result count `res` by 2 (since one pair consists of two boxes) and decrements the count of the complement in `res_map`.
     - If no pair is found, it updates the count of the current remainder in `res_map`.

3. **Output**: Finally, it prints the total number of boxes that can be used in gifts.

### Potential Issues
The code has a few logical flaws:
- The method `has_key()` is deprecated and should be replaced with the `in` keyword.
- The way pairs are counted may overlook certain combinations because of the way `res_map` is updated. 
- It does not handle cases where `candy % k == 0` correctly. Specifically, if two candies both give a remainder of 0, they should be paired together.

### Counterexample
Let's consider the following input that could expose a flaw in the logic:

**Input:**
```
4 2
2 2 2 2
```

**Expected Output:**
The expected output should be `4` because all boxes can be paired as follows:
- (1, 2)
- (3, 4)

**Actual Output with Current Code**:
- The program starts with `res_map` as an empty dictionary.
- It processes the first `2`, and adds it to `res_map` (`res_map` becomes `{0: 1}`).
- It processes the second `2`, finds a complement that can form a gift, and updates `res` to `2` and `res_map` to `{0: 0}`.
- The third `2` will not find a complement (since `0` count is decremented), so it adds to `res_map` again.
- The fourth `2` will do the same.
- The result will be `2` instead of `4`.

### Conclusion
Given the counterexample where the program fails to correctly count all the usable boxes, we can conclude:

Correctness: **False**
