According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `candy_array`. The loop will execute for each element in `candy_array`. At the end of the last iteration, `candy` is the third element in `candy_array`, which means that up to this point, the loop has processed the first three elements. For the loop to execute one more time, `candy` must be updated to the fourth element in `candy_array`.

Since `candy_array` has at least 3 elements, we need to ensure that `candy` reflects the fourth element to allow the loop to continue. Therefore, we need to adjust the state regarding `candy`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 100; `candy_array` is a list of integers with at least 4 elements; `candy` is the fourth element in `candy_array`.**
