The value of `res` is incremented by 2, but its previous value is not provided. The other variables remain unaffected as they are not involved in this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 100; `candy_array` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements; `candy` is the second element in `candy_array`; `res` is increased by 2.
