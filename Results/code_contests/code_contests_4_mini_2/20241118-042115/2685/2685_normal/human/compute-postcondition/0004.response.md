The variable `res` is incremented by 2. The initial value of `res` is 0, so after the execution, `res` becomes 2. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `candy_array`, `candy`, `res_map`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 100, `candy_array` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `candy` is the first element in `candy_array`, `res_map` is a dictionary containing at least one key-value pair where the key is `k - candy % k` and the value is greater than 0, and `res` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 100, `candy_array` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `candy` is the first element in `candy_array`, `res_map` is a dictionary containing at least one key-value pair where the key is `k - candy % k` and the value is greater than 0, and `res` is 2.**
