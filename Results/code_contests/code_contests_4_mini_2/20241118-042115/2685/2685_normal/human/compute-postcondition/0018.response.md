Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 100; `candy_array` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements; `candy` is the third element in `candy_array`. If `res_map` has a key `k - candy % k` with a value greater than 0, then `res` is increased by 2 and `res_map[k - candy % k]` is decreased by 1. If the key does not exist or its value is 0, then `res_map[candy % k]` is incremented by 1, or set to 1 if it did not previously exist.**
