According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `candy_array`. For the loop to execute, `candy_array` must contain at least one element. Given that `n` is a positive integer, it indicates the number of elements in `candy_array`, which should be at least 1. At the end of the last iteration, `res` is 0, and `candy` will be equal to the first element in `candy_array` during the first iteration. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 100, `candy_array` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `candy` is the first element in `candy_array`, `res_map` is {}, and `res` is 0**
