According to the code, the loop depends on the `candy_array`. The loop will execute again if there are more elements left in `candy_array` after the current `candy` has been processed. At the end of the last iteration, `candy` is the first element in `candy_array`. 

To execute the loop one more time, we need to adjust the state to reflect that we are now processing the second element in `candy_array`. Since there is at least one element in `candy_array`, we can safely assume that there is a second element.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 100; `candy_array` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements; `candy` is the second element in `candy_array`.**
