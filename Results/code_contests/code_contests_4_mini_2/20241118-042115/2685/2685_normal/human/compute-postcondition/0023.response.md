Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `k` and a list of integers `candy_array`. It counts and prints the number of pairs of candies such that the sum of their remainders when divided by `k` is equal to `k`. The function uses a dictionary to track occurrences of remainders of candies when divided by `k`. If `candy_array` is empty, the function will print 0, as there will be no pairs to count. However, the function does not return any value; it only prints the result. **
