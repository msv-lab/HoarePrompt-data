The code initializes `res_map` as an empty dictionary. This assignment does not affect the values of `n`, `k`, or `candy_array`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `res_map` is now an empty dictionary, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 100, `candy_array` is a list of integers where each integer d_i (1 ≤ d_i ≤ 1,000,000,000), `res_map` is {}**
