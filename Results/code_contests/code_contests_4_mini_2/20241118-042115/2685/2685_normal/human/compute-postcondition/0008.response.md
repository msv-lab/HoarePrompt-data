Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 100; `candy_array` is a list of integers with at least 1 element; `candy` is the first element in `candy_array`. If `res_map` has a key `k - candy % k` with a value greater than 0, then `res` is incremented by 2, `res_map[k - candy % k]` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `res_map` is updated such that `res_map[candy % k]` is set to 1 if it was previously absent, or incremented by 1 if it was present, and `res` remains 0.***
