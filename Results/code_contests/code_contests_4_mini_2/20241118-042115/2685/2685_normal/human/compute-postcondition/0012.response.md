To determine the output state after the execution of the code snippet, we analyze the provided initial state and the operation performed.

1. **Initial State Description**:
   - `n` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 200,000 \).
   - `k` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq k \leq 100 \).
   - `candy_array` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements.
   - `candy` is the second element in `candy_array`.

2. **Code Operation**:
   - The code checks if `candy % k` is a key in `res_map`.
   - If it is, the value corresponding to that key in `res_map` is incremented by 1.
   - If it is not, the key is created in `res_map` with an initial value of 1.

3. **Variable Impact**:
   - The state of `res_map` will change based on the value of `candy % k`.
   - The other variables (`n`, `k`, `candy_array`, and `candy`) remain unchanged.

4. **Output State**:
   - Since the specific values for `candy`, `k`, and the contents of `res_map` are not provided, we can only describe the change in `res_map` based on the operation performed.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 100; `candy_array` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements; `candy` is the second element in `candy_array`; `res_map` is updated based on the value of `candy % k`**.
