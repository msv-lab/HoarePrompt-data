The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `k` and `candy_array`. The parameter `k` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq k \leq 100 \). The parameter `candy_array` is a list of integers where each integer \( d_i \) (with \( 1 \leq d_i \leq 1,000,000,000 \)) represents the number of candies in the i-th box. 

The function processes these parameters and returns a value based on the conditions defined within the function body. However, the specific return value is not provided in the output description. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `k` and a list of integers `candy_array` representing the number of candies in each box.**
