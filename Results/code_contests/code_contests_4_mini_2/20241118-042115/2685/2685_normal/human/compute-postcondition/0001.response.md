The variable `res` is initialized to 0, which does not affect any other variables. The previous values of the affected variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 100, `candy_array` is a list of integers where each integer d_i (1 ≤ d_i ≤ 1,000,000,000), `res_map` is {}, and `res` is 0.
