Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 100; `candy_array` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements; `candy` is the second element in `candy_array`. If `res_map` has the key `k - candy % k` and its value is greater than 0, then `res` is increased by 2 and the value of `res_map[k - candy % k]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `res_map[candy % k]` is updated to either 1 (if it did not previously exist in `res_map`) or incremented by 1 (if it already existed), reflecting the count of candies that yield that specific remainder when divided by `k`.***
