In the provided code snippet, the value of `candy` is the second element in the `candy_array`. The operation `candy % k` computes the remainder of `candy` when divided by `k`. The value `k - candy % k` determines a specific index in the `res_map` array, and the value at that index is decreased by 1.

1. The variable `res_map` is accessed at the index `k - candy % k`.
2. The value at that index in `res_map` is decreased by 1.

The initial state indicates that `res` has been increased by 2, but we do not have the specific values of `candy`, `k`, or the contents of `res_map`. However, we know that the operation will affect only the `res_map` and not `n`, `k`, or `candy_array`.

Thus, the output state reflects the change made to `res_map`, while `n`, `k`, `candy_array`, `candy`, and `res` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 100; `candy_array` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements; `candy` is the second element in `candy_array`; `res` is increased by 2; `res_map[k - candy % k]` is decreased by 1.**
