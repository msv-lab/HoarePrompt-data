The variable `res_map` is being updated based on the values of `k` and `candy`. The expression `candy % k` is calculated, and then `k - candy % k` is computed. The value at `res_map[k - candy % k]` is reduced by 1. The variables `n`, `k`, `candy_array`, and `candy` are not affected directly by this operation, but the state of `res_map` changes.

Given that `res` has already increased by 2, the output state will include the current value of `res_map` after the modification.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 100; `candy_array` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements; `candy` is the third element in `candy_array`; `res` has increased by 2; `res_map[k - candy % k]` is decreased by 1.**
