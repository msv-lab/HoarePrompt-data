The function accepts a tuple `no` representing a node, a graph `grafo`, a list `visitados` to track visited nodes, an integer `depth` for the current depth of traversal, and a dictionary `cand` to store a candidate value. It updates the candidate value based on the first element of the node tuple if the second element is true, marks the node as visited, and recursively visits each unvisited neighbor in the graph. The function does not return any value but modifies the `cand` dictionary and the `visitados` list.
