The function `func_1` accepts the following parameters:
- `no`: an integer representing a node in a graph.
- `grafo`: a data structure (likely a list or dictionary) that represents the graph, which consists of roads described by three positive integers.
- `visitados`: a data structure that keeps track of visited nodes (likely a list or set).
- `depth`: an integer representing the current depth in a search or traversal of the graph.
- `cand`: a variable that may represent candidates or conditions relevant to the graph traversal.

The function's output is not explicitly described, but based on the context, it performs operations related to graph traversal. The exact return value is not detailed in the provided information.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters related to graph traversal, including a node, the graph structure, visited nodes, the current depth, and candidates. The specific return value is not defined in the provided context.**
