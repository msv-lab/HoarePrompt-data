Output State: **If `grafo[no[0]]` is not empty, the loop iterates over each neighbor `vizinho` in `grafo[no[0]]`. For each iteration, if `visitados[vizinho[0]]` is False, `func_1` is called with parameters (`vizinho`, `grafo`, `visitados`, depth + 1, cand). If `grafo[no[0]]` is empty, the loop does not execute, and the state of the variables remains unchanged. After the loop, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `visitados[no[0]]` is True, and `grafo[no[0]]` could have multiple elements depending on its structure.**
