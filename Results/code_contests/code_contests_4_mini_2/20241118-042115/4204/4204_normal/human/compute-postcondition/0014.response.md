According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `grafo[no[0]]`. The loop iterates over each `vizinho` in `grafo[no[0]]`. At the end of the last iteration, `vizinho` is the third element in `grafo[no[0]]`, which means the current index of iteration is 2 (0-based indexing). 

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that there is at least a fourth element in `grafo[no[0]]`. Given that `grafo[no[0]]` has at least 3 elements, we can state that the next `vizinho` should be the fourth element in the list, which would correspond to index 3.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `vizinho` is now the fourth element in `grafo[no[0]]`, and the index should be incremented accordingly.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `visitados[no[0]]` is True, `grafo[no[0]]` has at least 4 elements, and `vizinho` is the fourth element in `grafo[no[0]]`.**
