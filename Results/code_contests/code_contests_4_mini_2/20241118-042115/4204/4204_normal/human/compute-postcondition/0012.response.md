The function `func_1` is called with parameters `vizinho`, `grafo`, `visitados`, `depth + 1`, and `cand`. The initial state specifies that `visitados[no[0]]` is `True`, indicating that the current node has been visited. The `grafo[no[0]]` contains at least 3 elements, and `vizinho` is the third element in that list. The variables `n`, `depth`, and `cand` are not directly modified by this function call; rather, they are passed as parameters to `func_1`.

Since `func_1` returns no value, it does not change the state of the variables in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged in terms of the values of `n`, `visitados`, and `grafo`, but `depth + 1` indicates that the depth of the traversal has increased.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `visitados[no[0]]` is True, `grafo[no[0]]` has at least 3 elements, `vizinho` is the third element in `grafo[no[0]]`, and the function `func_1` is called with increased depth.**
