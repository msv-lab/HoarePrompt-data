Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `visitados[no[0]]` is True, `grafo[no[0]]` has at least 3 elements, and `vizinho` is the third element in `grafo[no[0]]`. If `visitados[vizinho[0]]` is False, the function `func_1` is called with `vizinho`, `grafo`, `visitados`, an incremented depth, and `cand`. If `visitados[vizinho[0]]` is True, `func_1` is not called, and the state remains unchanged.***
