The function `func_1` accepts the following parameters: 

1. `no`: an integer representing a node in a graph.
2. `grafo`: a data structure (presumably a list or dictionary) that represents the graph, which contains edges or connections between nodes.
3. `visitados`: a data structure (likely a list or set) that keeps track of visited nodes to prevent revisiting.
4. `depth`: an integer that likely indicates the current depth in a traversal or recursive process.
5. `cand`: a data structure (possibly a list) that holds candidate nodes for further processing.

The function returns no explicit value as specified in the output. It likely performs operations on the provided parameters but does not return a specific result. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a node `no`, a graph representation `grafo`, a record of visited nodes `visitados`, a depth indicator `depth`, and a list of candidates `cand`, while performing operations related to graph traversal or processing based on these inputs. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters no (an integer node), grafo (a graph representation), visitados (a record of visited nodes), depth (an integer), and cand (a list of candidates), and processes them without returning an explicit value.**
