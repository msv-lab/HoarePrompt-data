Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `visitados[no[0]]` is True; `grafo[no[0]]` is a list that may contain 0 or more elements. If `grafo[no[0]]` is empty, the loop does not execute, and the state remains unchanged. If `grafo[no[0]]` contains at least one element, the loop will iterate over each `vizinho`. If `visitados[vizinho[0]]` is False, `func_1` is called with `vizinho`, `grafo`, `visitados`, `depth + 1`, and `cand`. If `visitados[vizinho[0]]` is True, `func_1` is not called, and the state remains unchanged with respect to the parameters passed. The number of iterations may vary depending on the number of unvisited neighbors.**
