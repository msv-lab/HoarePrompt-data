Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `visitados[no[0]]` is True, and `grafo[no[0]]` is a list with at least 1 element. If `visitados[vizinho[0]]` is False, then `func_1` is called with parameters `vizinho`, `grafo`, `visitados`, `depth + 1`, and `cand`. If `visitados[vizinho[0]]` is True, then `func_1` is not called, and the state of the program remains unchanged with respect to the parameters passed.***
