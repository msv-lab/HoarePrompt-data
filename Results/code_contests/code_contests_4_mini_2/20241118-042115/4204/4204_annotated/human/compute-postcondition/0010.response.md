Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `visitados[no[0]]` is True, and `grafo[no[0]]` is a list with at least 2 elements. If `visitados[vizinho[0]]` is False, then `func_1` is called with parameters (vizinho, grafo, visitados, depth + 1, cand). If `vizinho[0]` is already visited, `func_1` is not executed, and the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
