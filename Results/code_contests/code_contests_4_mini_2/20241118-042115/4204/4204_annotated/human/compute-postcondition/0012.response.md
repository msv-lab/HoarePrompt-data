The function `func_1` is called with the parameters `vizinho`, `grafo`, `visitados`, `depth + 1`, and `cand`. The values of `vizinho`, `grafo`, and `visitados` are not altered by this function call in the current context provided. The parameter `depth` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `depth` is not given. The variable `cand` remains unchanged as well.

The output state reflects that the function is invoked with the specified parameters, but since `depth` is incremented, we note that change.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `visitados[no[0]]` is True; `grafo[no[0]]` is a list with at least 2 elements; `vizinho` is the second element in `grafo[no[0]]`; `depth` is incremented by 1; `cand` remains unchanged.**
