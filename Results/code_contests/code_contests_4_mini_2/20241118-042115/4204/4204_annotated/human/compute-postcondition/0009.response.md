The function `func_1` is called with specific parameters: `vizinho`, `grafo`, `visitados`, `depth + 1`, and `cand`. The initial state indicates that `visitados[no[0]]` is True, which suggests that the current node (referenced by `no[0]`) has already been visited. The variable `n` is an integer within the specified range, and `grafo[no[0]]` contains at least two elements, indicating that there are unvisited neighbors to process.

The call to `func_1` does not alter the values of `n`, `visitados`, or `grafo`, but it may affect the state of the program based on the logic inside `func_1`. However, since we do not have information about the internals of `func_1`, we can only say that the function is invoked with the current parameters.

Thus, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the initial state along with the indication that `func_1` has been called. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `visitados[no[0]]` is True, `grafo[no[0]]` is a list with at least 2 elements, and `func_1` has been called with parameters (vizinho, grafo, visitados, depth + 1, cand)**.
