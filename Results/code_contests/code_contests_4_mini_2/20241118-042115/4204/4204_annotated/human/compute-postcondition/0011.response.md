According to the code, the loop iterates over the elements in `grafo[no[0]]`. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `grafo[no[0]]` has at least 2 elements and `vizinho[0]` refers to the first neighbor in that list. If `visitados[vizinho[0]]` is False, then `func_1` would be called with the first neighbor. However, if `vizinho[0]` is already visited, `func_1` is not executed, which means that for the loop to execute again, we need to look at the subsequent neighbors in `grafo[no[0]]`.

Given that there are at least 2 elements in `grafo[no[0]]`, we need to ensure that `vizinho` moves to the next neighbor in the list. If `vizinho` currently refers to `grafo[no[0]][0]`, then for the loop to execute again, it should refer to `grafo[no[0]][1]` (the second neighbor). 

Thus, the relevant states that need to be adjusted are:
- `vizinho` should refer to the second element in `grafo[no[0]]`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `visitados[no[0]]` is True, `grafo[no[0]]` is a list with at least 2 elements, vizinho is the second element in grafo[no[0]]**
