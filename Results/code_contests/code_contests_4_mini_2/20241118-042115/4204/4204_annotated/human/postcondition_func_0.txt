The function accepts an integer `no`, a graph representation `grafo`, a list of visited nodes `visitados`, an integer `depth`, and a dictionary `cand`. It updates `cand['value']` to the maximum of its current value and `no[0]` if `no[1]` is true. It marks the node `no[0]` as visited, and recursively explores its unvisited neighbors in the graph, processing each neighbor by calling itself with updated parameters. The function does not return any value explicitly.
