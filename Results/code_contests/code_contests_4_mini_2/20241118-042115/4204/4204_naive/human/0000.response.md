To determine the correctness of the program, we must analyze the provided code and check if it meets the requirements stated in the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires finding a subset of candidates such that if all candidates from this subset are elected, all problem roads in the city will be repaired. A problem road is defined as one where `ti = 2`. The candidates are located in different districts, and each candidate can repair problem roads leading back to district 1.

### Code Analysis
1. **Graph Representation**: The graph is represented as an adjacency list `grafo`, which is correctly initialized.
2. **Input Handling**: The program reads `n - 1` roads and stores them correctly in the adjacency list, marking whether a road is a problem road or not.
3. **Candidate Selection Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` is a recursive function that traverses the graph.
   - It checks if a node is a problem road and updates the candidate list accordingly.
   - It uses a dictionary `cand` with a key 'value' to track the maximum candidate index that can repair problem roads.
4. **Candidate Collection**: The program gathers candidates who can repair problem roads based on the traversal.

### Potential Issues
Now, let's consider if there are any cases where the program might fail to capture all necessary candidates:
- The program initializes `visitados` and marks district 1 as visited, but it does not reset the `visitados` list for each candidate search. This can lead to incorrect behavior when exploring multiple candidates since once a node is marked visited, it will not be revisited.
- If there is a candidate in a district connected to multiple problem roads, the logic might not include all necessary candidates due to the lack of resets in the visitation tracking.
- The program assumes that if a candidate is found to be capable of repairing a road, it will only track the highest candidate index instead of all candidates that can repair problem roads.

### Example Case to Illustrate Failure
Consider the following input:
```
4
1 2 2
1 3 1
2 4 2
```
In this case:
- District 1 is connected to District 2 (problem road).
- District 2 is connected to District 4 (problem road).
- District 3 is connected to District 1 (non-problem road).

The expected output should be:
```
2
2 4
```
However, due to the visitation logic, the program may only capture one candidate (the maximum) instead of both candidates 2 and 4, which are required to repair all problem roads.

### Conclusion
Given that the program does not correctly handle the visitation and candidate collection logic, it will fail to account for all necessary candidates in some cases.

Correctness: **False**.
