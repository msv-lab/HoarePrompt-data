To determine the correctness of the provided program with respect to the problem description, we need to closely analyze how the code works and if it addresses all possible cases.

### Analysis of the Code:
1. The code accepts input defining a tree structure with districts and roads.
2. It builds a graph representation of the districts and their connections.
3. The `func_1` is designed to traverse the graph recursively and find candidates whose paths contain problem roads.
4. It keeps track of the farthest candidate that can address a problem road.
5. Finally, it aggregates the candidates and prints the count and their indices.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Candidate Selection Logic**: The variable `maxi['value']` is used to store the candidate index of the farthest district with a problem road. This logic can be flawed. If a candidate has a problem road, but is not the farthest candidate, the program may miss including this candidate.
2. **Handling of Problem Roads**: The code only checks connections from the root (district 1) to its immediate neighbors. It does not ensure that all problem roads are covered by the selected candidates. In scenarios where a problem road exists further down the tree, the current logic may not select the correct candidates.
3. **Multiple Problem Roads**: The program needs to ensure that if a candidate's path to the root includes multiple problem roads, all relevant candidates are selected. The current implementation might overlook some candidates based on the traversal logic.

### Example Case to Illustrate Failure:
Consider a simple tree:
```
1 --(2)-- 2
1 --(2)-- 3
2 --(2)-- 4
```
- Here, roads from 2 to 4 and 3 to 1 are problem roads.
- The expected output should be candidates 2, 3, and 4 to ensure all problem roads are repaired.
- However, the current logic might not select candidate 3 correctly if it doesn't check that candidate 3 has a problem road in the traversal from 1.

### Conclusion:
Given the above points, the program does not cover all potential cases, particularly when it comes to ensuring all problem roads are addressed by the elected candidates. 

Correctness: **False**
