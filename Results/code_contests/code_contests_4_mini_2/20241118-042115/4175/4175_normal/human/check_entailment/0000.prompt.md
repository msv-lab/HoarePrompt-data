You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those output hints describes certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.


Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_divisible(number1, number2):
    if number1 % number2 == 0:
        return True
''' 

Output hints for function1:  The function accepts 2 numbers as input, if number 1 is divisible than number2 then the function returns True.
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if is_divisible(n,i):
            return True
    return False
''' 

Output hints for function 2:  The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation: The program initially seems to do what the description says. Lets see if the hints also agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the program is incorrect. The output hints seem to agree with the program code and from their contents they reenforce our reasoning that the code is correct.
The function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints for function number 1 : The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The function initially seems to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the code is incorrec. Indeed they agree with the code and they show that the code might not always follow the program description. The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.


# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to find the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string.

Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def get_list_size(list):
    return len(list)
''' 

Output hint for function1:  The function accepts a string and returns the size of that string
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def find_Rotations(str1):
    n = get_list_size(str1)
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if str1[i:] + str1[:i] == str1:
            return i
''' 

Output hint for function 2: If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value and the variable n remains unchanged, holding the length of the string str1. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer i such that 0 < i < n, where n is the length of the string str1, and i represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. If no such rotation exists, then the function does not return a value.

Example Answer 3:
Explanation: The code initially does not seem to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and reenforce our belief that the code is incorrect. The hints do seem to agree with the code and they also show that the code does not always follow the program description. If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value, and the variable `n` remains unchanged, holding the length of the string `str1`. This behavior is correct as the specification states that the rotation count must be greater than 0. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer `i` such that `0 < i < n`, where `n` is the length of the string `str1`. The value `i` represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. However, the code iterates from `1` to `n-1`, meaning it does not include `n`. This omission is problematic because it fails to check the complete rotation case, where `i` could be equal to `n`. Consequently, the function does not meet the specification as it should return the rotation count up to `n` times. Therefore, it does not meet the specification.

Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Given are a positive integer N and a sequence of length 2^N consisting of 0s and 1s: A_0,A_1,\ldots,A_{2^N-1}. Determine whether there exists a closed curve C that satisfies the condition below for all 2^N sets S \subseteq \\{0,1,\ldots,N-1 \\}. If the answer is yes, construct one such closed curve.

* Let x = \sum_{i \in S} 2^i and B_S be the set of points \\{ (i+0.5,0.5) | i \in S \\}.
* If there is a way to continuously move the closed curve C without touching B_S so that every point on the closed curve has a negative y-coordinate, A_x = 1.
* If there is no such way, A_x = 0.



For instruction on printing a closed curve, see Output below.

Constraints

* 1 \leq N \leq 8
* A_i = 0,1 \quad (0 \leq i \leq 2^N-1)
* A_0 = 1

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
A_0A_1 \cdots A_{2^N-1}


Output

If there is no closed curve that satisfies the condition, print `Impossible`.

If such a closed curve exists, print `Possible` in the first line. Then, print one such curve in the following format:


L
x_0 y_0
x_1 y_1
:
x_L y_L


This represents the closed polyline that passes (x_0,y_0),(x_1,y_1),\ldots,(x_L,y_L) in this order.

Here, all of the following must be satisfied:

* 0 \leq x_i \leq N, 0 \leq y_i \leq 1, and x_i, y_i are integers. (0 \leq i \leq L)
* |x_i-x_{i+1}| + |y_i-y_{i+1}| = 1. (0 \leq i \leq L-1)
* (x_0,y_0) = (x_L,y_L).



Additionally, the length of the closed curve L must satisfy 0 \leq L \leq 250000.

It can be proved that, if there is a closed curve that satisfies the condition in Problem Statement, there is also a closed curve that can be expressed in this format.

Functions with output description for each function:
Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(a):
    return [-v for v in a]
''' 

 Output decription for function1:  The function accepts a sequence `a` of integers and returns a list where each element is the negation of the corresponding element in `a`. It works for any sequence of integers, not limited to just 0 or 1.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(s):
    assert len(s) > 0
    pre_s = s[:-1]
    v = s[-1]
    if len(pre_s) == 0:
        return [v]
    return func_2(pre_s) + [v] + func_1(func_2(pre_s)) + [-v]
''' 

 Output decription for function2:  The function accepts a string `s` consisting of '0's and '1's, and recursively processes it to return a list. If `s` has a length of 1, it returns a list containing the last character of `s`. For longer strings, it combines the result of the recursive processing of the substring excluding the last character and adds the last character, along with the result of another function `func_1` applied to the recursive result, and the negative value of the last character. The exact behavior of `func_1` is not defined within the provided code, which may lead to uncertainty in the output. Thus, the function's behavior heavily relies on the definition of `func_1`.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3(v):
    if v > 0:
        return [(i, 0) for i in range(1, v + 1)] + [(v, 1), (v - 1, 1)] + [(i, 0) for i in range(v - 1, 0, -1)]
    elif v < 0:
        return func_3(-v)[::-1]
    assert False
''' 

 Output decription for function3:  The function accepts an integer `v`. If `v` is greater than 0, it returns a list of tuples structured as follows: pairs (i, 0) for i from 1 to `v`, followed by the tuples (v, 1) and (v - 1, 1), then pairs (i, 0) for i from `v - 1` down to 1. If `v` is less than 0, it returns the reversed list produced by calling `func_3` with the positive value of `v`. If `v` equals 0, the function does not return any value and effectively results in no output. The function does not raise any errors but does not handle the case where `v` is not an integer.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4(v):
    return func_3(v) + [(0, 0)]
''' 

 Output decription for function4:  The function accepts a list `v` of integers (specifically 0s and 1s) with a length of 2^N (where 1 <= N <= 8 and A[0] = 1) and returns the result of `func_3(v)` concatenated with the tuple (0, 0). The behavior of `func_3(v)` and its handling of the input list is not specified here, so it is assumed to be a separate function that processes the list `v`. The function does not handle cases where `v` does not meet the specified length or content criteria, which could potentially lead to unexpected behavior.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5():
    func_6('1', '11')
''' 

 Output decription for function5:  The function `func_5` does not take any parameters but calls `func_6` with two string arguments '1' and '11'. It operates under constraints that N is a positive integer (1 <= N <= 8) and A is a string of length 2^N consisting of '0' and '1', with A[0] being '1'. However, since the function does not handle any parameters directly, it lacks the necessary functionality to enforce or validate these constraints itself.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6(s1, s2):
    ok = True
    n = int(s1)
    ret_gp = []
    for i in range(2 ** n - 1, -1, -1):
        s = [v + 1 for v in range(n) if (i >> v) % 2 == 1]
        if s2[i] == '0':
            for ind in range(n):
                if (i >> ind) % 2 == 0 and s2[i + 2 ** ind] == '1':
                    ok = False
            ret_gp += func_2(s)
    ret_path = [(0, 0)] + [p for v in ret_gp for p in func_4(v)]
    if ok:
        print('Possible')
        print(len(ret_path) - 1)
        for (x, y) in ret_path:
            print(str(x) + ' ' + str(y))
    else:
        print('Impossible')
s1 = raw_input()
s2 = raw_input()
func_6(s1, s2)
''' 

 Output decription for function6:  The function accepts two string parameters `s1` and `s2`, where `s1` is expected to represent a non-negative integer in string format and `s2` is a binary string of length \(2^n\) (where \(n\) is derived from `s1`) that is guaranteed to have its first character as '1'. The function processes combinations based on the binary representation of indices and checks certain conditions within `s2`. It constructs a list of paths (`ret_path`) based on results from another function `func_4` applied to elements derived from `ret_gp`. The function concludes by printing 'Possible' along with the length of `ret_path` and the pairs from `ret_path` if certain conditions are met; otherwise, it prints 'Impossible'. The function does not return any value but prints output directly.



First I want you to try to see if the program (including all the functions) does what the description says. Look at only the code and the description and make an initial assesment.Try to think of any edge cases that the code might not be handling.

Then I want you to see if the output hints agree with the code. Sometimes the output hints hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the output hints says are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to make a more informed decision and detrmine if the code is correct or not.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code.
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
