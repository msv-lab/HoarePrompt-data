The function `func_5` does not take any parameters but calls `func_6` with two string arguments '1' and '11'. It operates under constraints that N is a positive integer (1 <= N <= 8) and A is a string of length 2^N consisting of '0' and '1', with A[0] being '1'. However, since the function does not handle any parameters directly, it lacks the necessary functionality to enforce or validate these constraints itself.
