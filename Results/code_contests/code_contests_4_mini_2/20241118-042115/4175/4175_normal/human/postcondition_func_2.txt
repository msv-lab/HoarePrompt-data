The function accepts an integer `v`. If `v` is greater than 0, it returns a list of tuples structured as follows: pairs (i, 0) for i from 1 to `v`, followed by the tuples (v, 1) and (v - 1, 1), then pairs (i, 0) for i from `v - 1` down to 1. If `v` is less than 0, it returns the reversed list produced by calling `func_3` with the positive value of `v`. If `v` equals 0, the function does not return any value and effectively results in no output. The function does not raise any errors but does not handle the case where `v` is not an integer.
