You are given a programming problem description and a program that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Program:
```
R = 3
C = 3
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
	tc = [[0 for x in range(C)] for x in range(R)]
	tc[0][0] = cost[0][0]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		tc[i][0] = tc[i-1][0] + cost[i][0]
	for j in range(1, n+1):
		tc[0][j] = tc[0][j-1] + cost[0][j]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		for j in range(1, n+1):
			tc[i][j] = min(tc[i-1][j-1], tc[i-1][j], tc[i][j-1]) + cost[i][j]
	return tc[m][n]
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Program:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
  res = tuple(set(test_tup1) & set(test_tup2))
  return (res) 
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
import math
def is_not_prime(n):
    result = False
    for i in range(2,int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            result = True
    return result
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Program:
```
import heapq as hq
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
  largest_nums = hq.nlargest(n, nums)
  return largest_nums
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Program:
```
def count_ways(n):
  A = [0] * (n + 1)
  B = [0] * (n + 1)
  A[0] = 1
  A[1] = 0
  B[0] = 0
  B[1] = 1
  for i in range(2, n+1):
    A[i] = A[i - 2] + 2 * B[i - 1]
    B[i] = A[i - 1] + B[i - 2]
  return A[n] 
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Your task

Problem description: Given are a positive integer N and a sequence of length 2^N consisting of 0s and 1s: A_0,A_1,\ldots,A_{2^N-1}. Determine whether there exists a closed curve C that satisfies the condition below for all 2^N sets S \subseteq \\{0,1,\ldots,N-1 \\}. If the answer is yes, construct one such closed curve.

* Let x = \sum_{i \in S} 2^i and B_S be the set of points \\{ (i+0.5,0.5) | i \in S \\}.
* If there is a way to continuously move the closed curve C without touching B_S so that every point on the closed curve has a negative y-coordinate, A_x = 1.
* If there is no such way, A_x = 0.



For instruction on printing a closed curve, see Output below.

Constraints

* 1 \leq N \leq 8
* A_i = 0,1 \quad (0 \leq i \leq 2^N-1)
* A_0 = 1

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
A_0A_1 \cdots A_{2^N-1}


Output

If there is no closed curve that satisfies the condition, print `Impossible`.

If such a closed curve exists, print `Possible` in the first line. Then, print one such curve in the following format:


L
x_0 y_0
x_1 y_1
:
x_L y_L


This represents the closed polyline that passes (x_0,y_0),(x_1,y_1),\ldots,(x_L,y_L) in this order.

Here, all of the following must be satisfied:

* 0 \leq x_i \leq N, 0 \leq y_i \leq 1, and x_i, y_i are integers. (0 \leq i \leq L)
* |x_i-x_{i+1}| + |y_i-y_{i+1}| = 1. (0 \leq i \leq L-1)
* (x_0,y_0) = (x_L,y_L).



Additionally, the length of the closed curve L must satisfy 0 \leq L \leq 250000.

It can be proved that, if there is a closed curve that satisfies the condition in Problem Statement, there is also a closed curve that can be expressed in this format.
