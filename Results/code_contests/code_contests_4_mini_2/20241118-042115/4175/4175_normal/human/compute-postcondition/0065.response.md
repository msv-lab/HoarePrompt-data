Output State: **If `ret_path` has at least one element, the loop will execute for each element in `ret_path`, printing the pairs as "x y". The final state will include the last values of `x` and `y` corresponding to the last element of `ret_path` processed. If `ret_path` is empty, the loop will not execute, and `x` and `y` will not be defined, while `ok` remains true and the output stays 'Possible'.**
