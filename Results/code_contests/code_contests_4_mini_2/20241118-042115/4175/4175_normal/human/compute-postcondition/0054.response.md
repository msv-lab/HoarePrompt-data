The code constructs a new list `ret_path` by starting with the tuple `(0, 0)` and adding elements generated from a list comprehension. The list comprehension iterates over `ret_gp` (which is assumed to be previously defined) and for each element `v`, it calls `func_4(v)` and unpacks its return values into `p`. The previous state of `ret_path` is influenced by this operation, but since the specific contents of `ret_gp` and the output of `func_4(v)` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact values being added.

Since `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 8, we can conclude that the code successfully executes and alters `ret_path`. However, without specific values for `ret_gp` and `func_4`, we can only refer to the structure of the new list.

Output State: **`ret_path` is updated to include (0, 0) and the results of func_4 for each element in ret_gp.**
