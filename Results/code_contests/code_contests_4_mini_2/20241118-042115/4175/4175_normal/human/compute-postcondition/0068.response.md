Postcondition: ***If `ok` is true, the function prints 'Possible' followed by the length of `ret_path` minus one; if `ret_path` contains elements, it prints each pair as "x y", with `x` and `y` corresponding to the last element processed in the loop. If `ret_path` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `x` and `y` remain undefined. If `ok` is false, 'Impossible' is printed, and `ret_path` is updated to include (0, 0) alongside the results from `func_4` applied to each element in `ret_gp`.***
