According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `ind` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `ind` is 0 and `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `ind` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1. Additionally, since the loop has not yet reached `n`, no changes are needed for `n`. Therefore, `ind` should be adjusted to 1.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 8, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `ind` is 1, `s2` is a string of length 2^N consisting of '0's and '1's with `s2[0] = '1'`, `ok` is set to False if `(i >> ind) % 2` equals 0 and `s2[i + 2`**
