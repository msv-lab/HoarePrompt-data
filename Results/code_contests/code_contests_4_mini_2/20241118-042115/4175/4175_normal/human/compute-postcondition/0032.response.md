According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `ind` and the value of `n`. The loop will execute as long as `ind` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `ind` is 2, and `N` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 8\). For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 2, and `ind` should be incremented to 3 for the next iteration.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 8, `ind` is 3**
