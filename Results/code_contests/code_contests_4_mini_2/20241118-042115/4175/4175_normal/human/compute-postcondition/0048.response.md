According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `ind` and `n`. The loop will continue as long as `ind` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `ind` is 2, and `N` is greater than or equal to 1. 

To allow the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 2, and `ind` should be adjusted to 3 for the next iteration. 

Thus, the necessary adjustments to the states are:
- `N` must be greater than or equal to 3 for `n` to be greater than 2.
- `ind` should be 3.

State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 3, `ind` is 3, `s` is either [] (if `N` = 1) or [2] (if `N` >= 2), and `i` is an integer.**
