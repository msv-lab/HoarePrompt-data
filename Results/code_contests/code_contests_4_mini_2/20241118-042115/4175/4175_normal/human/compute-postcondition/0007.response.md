Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 8, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `ind` is 0, `s2` is a string of length 2^N consisting of '0's and '1's where s2[0] = '1', `ok` is set to True, `ret_gp` is an empty list, `s` is [2], the character at index `i` of `s2` is '0', and the value of `(i >> ind) % 2` is 0, and `s2[i + 2 ** ind]` is '1'.***
