The variable `ok` is assigned the value `False`. The values of `N` and `ind` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 8, `ind` is 1, and `ok` is False.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 8, `ind` is 1, and `ok` is False**
