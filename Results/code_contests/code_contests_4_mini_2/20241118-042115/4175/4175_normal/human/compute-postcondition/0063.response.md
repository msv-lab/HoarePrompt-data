The code prints the string representation of `x` and `y` separated by a space. The values of `x` and `y` are derived from the third element of `ret_path`, which is confirmed to have a length greater than 2. The variable `ok` is true, and the output is 'Possible'. 

Since `x` is the first item of the third element and `y` is the second item of the third element of `ret_path`, the state of `x` and `y` will be printed but their specific values are not known from the given initial state.

Therefore, the Output State is: `ret_path` length is greater than 2, `ok` is true, output is 'Possible', and the printed output is str(x) + ' ' + str(y).
Output State: **`ret_path` length is greater than 2, `ok` is true, output is 'Possible', and the printed output is str(x) + ' ' + str(y)**
