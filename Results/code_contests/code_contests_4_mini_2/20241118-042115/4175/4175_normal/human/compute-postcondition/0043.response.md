The variable `ok` is assigned the value `False`. This does not affect any of the previously defined variables, which remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is greater than or equal to 1, `ind` is 1, `s` is either [] or [2], `i` is an integer, and `ok` is False.

Output State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 1, `ind` is 1, `s` is either [] or [2], `i` is an integer, and `ok` is False**
