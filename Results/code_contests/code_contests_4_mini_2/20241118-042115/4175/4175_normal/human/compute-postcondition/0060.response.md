According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `ret_path`. For the loop to execute one more time, `ret_path` must contain at least one more element. At the end of the last iteration, `ret_path` has a length greater than 0, and `x` and `y` are set to the first element's items in `ret_path`.

To ensure that the loop can execute again, the `ret_path` must have at least 2 elements, and `x` and `y` must then refer to the second element in `ret_path`. Therefore, the state must be adjusted to reflect that `ret_path` has a length greater than 1, and `x` and `y` need to be set to the second element's items in `ret_path`.

State: **`ret_path` length is greater than 1, `ok` is true, output is 'Possible', `x` is the second element's first item of `ret_path`, `y` is the second element's second item of `ret_path`, and the output is str(x) + ' ' + str(y)**
