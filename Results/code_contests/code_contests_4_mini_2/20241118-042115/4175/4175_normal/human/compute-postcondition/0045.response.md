According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `ind` and the value of `N`. The loop will execute while `ind` is less than `N`. 

At the end of the last iteration, the states are as follows:
- `N` is greater than or equal to 1, 
- `ind` is 1, 
- `s` is either [] (if `N` = 1) or [2] (if `N` >= 2), 
- `i` is an integer, and the condition `(i >> ind) % 2 == 0` holds true while `s2[i + 2]` is considered.

To allow the loop to execute one more time, `ind` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, if `N` is greater than 1, then `ind` should become 2. The state of `s` does not need to change, as it will not affect the loop execution criteria.

Thus, the adjusted states are:
- `N` remains the same,
- `ind` is incremented to 2.

However, if `N` is 1, then the loop cannot execute again since `ind` would equal `N`. 

To summarize, if `N` is greater than 1, the states need to be adjusted to reflect that `ind` is now 2. 

State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 1, `ind` is 2, `s` is either [] (if `N` = 1) or [2] (if `N` >= 2), `i` is an integer, and if the condition `(i >> ind) % 2 == 0` holds true while `s2[i + 2]` is considered.**
