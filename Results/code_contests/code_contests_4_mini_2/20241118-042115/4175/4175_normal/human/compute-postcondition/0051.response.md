Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 8; `s` is either [] (if `N` = 1) or [2] (if `N` >= 2); `i` is 2; and `s2` contains the necessary indices. If `s2[i]` is '0', then for each index `ind` in the range of `n`, if `(i >> ind) % 2 == 0` and `s2[i + 2 ** ind]` is '1', the variable `ok` remains unchanged. In this case, `ret_gp` is increased by the return value of `func_2(s)`; otherwise, if the conditions are not met, `ok` may be set to False, and `ret_gp` does not change. There is no else part to handle.***
