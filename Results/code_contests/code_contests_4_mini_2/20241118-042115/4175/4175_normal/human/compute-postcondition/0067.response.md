The `print('Impossible')` statement outputs the string 'Impossible' to the console. The values of `ret_path`, `ret_gp`, and `ok` remain unchanged after this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `ret_path` is updated to include (0, 0) and the results of `func_4` for each element in `ret_gp`, `ok` is false, and 'Impossible' is printed.

Output State: **`ret_path` is updated to include (0, 0) and the results of `func_4` for each element in `ret_gp`, `ok` is false, and 'Impossible' is printed.**
