According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `ind` in relation to `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `ind` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `ind` is 1 and `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 8. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `ind` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `ind` should be adjusted to 2. Since `n` is still valid (greater than `ind`), no further adjustments to `n` are required.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 8, `ind` is 2**
