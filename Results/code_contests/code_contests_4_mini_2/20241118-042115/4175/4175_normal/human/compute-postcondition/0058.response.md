According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `ret_path`. The loop will iterate over pairs (x, y) in `ret_path`. For the loop to execute, `ret_path` must contain at least one pair. At the end of the last iteration, `ret_path` has not been altered, and the variables `x` and `y` will take the values of the first pair in `ret_path`. 

Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `ret_path` must have at least 1 element, `x` will take the value of the first element's first item, and `y` will take the value of the first element's second item. 

State: **`ret_path` length is greater than 0, `ok` is true, output is 'Possible', `x` is the first element's first item of `ret_path`, `y` is the first element's second item of `ret_path`**
