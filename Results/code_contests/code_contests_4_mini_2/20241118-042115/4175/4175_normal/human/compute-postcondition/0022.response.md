According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `N`, which determines the range of the loop. The loop will execute if `N` is at least 1, which is guaranteed since `N` is defined as a positive integer (1 <= N <= 8). The variable `ind` will start from 0 and increase by 1 with each iteration until it reaches `N - 1`.

For the loop to execute, the relevant states are:
- `N` must be a positive integer (which it is, given the constraints).
- `ind` should start at 0 since it initializes the loop.

Therefore, the state adjustments needed are:
- `N` remains as a positive integer between 1 and 8.
- `ind` starts at 0.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 8, `ind` is 0**
