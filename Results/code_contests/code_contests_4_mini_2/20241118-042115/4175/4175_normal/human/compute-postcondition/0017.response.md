Output State: **`ok` is set to False if there exists any `ind` in the range of `n` such that `(i >> ind) % 2 == 0` and `s2[i + 2 ** ind] == '1'. If `n` is 0, or if there are no indices for which the condition holds true, `ok` remains True. `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 8, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 2, and `s2` is a string of length 2^N consisting of '0's and '1's with `s2[0] = '1'`.**
