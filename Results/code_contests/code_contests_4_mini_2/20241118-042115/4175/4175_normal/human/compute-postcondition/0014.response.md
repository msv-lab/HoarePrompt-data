The variable `ok` is assigned the value `False`. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the other variables alongside the new value of `ok`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 8, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `ind` is 2, `s2` is a string of length 2^N consisting of '0's and '1's with `s2[0] = '1'`, and `ok` is False**
