Functionality: ** The function accepts two string parameters `s1` and `s2`, where `s1` is expected to represent a non-negative integer in string format and `s2` is a binary string of length \(2^n\) (where \(n\) is derived from `s1`) that is guaranteed to have its first character as '1'. The function processes combinations based on the binary representation of indices and checks certain conditions within `s2`. It constructs a list of paths (`ret_path`) based on results from another function `func_4` applied to elements derived from `ret_gp`. The function concludes by printing 'Possible' along with the length of `ret_path` and the pairs from `ret_path` if certain conditions are met; otherwise, it prints 'Impossible'. The function does not return any value but prints output directly. **
