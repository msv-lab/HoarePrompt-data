Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 8, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `ind` is 2, `s2` is a string of length 2^N consisting of '0's and '1's with `s2[0] = '1'`. If the condition `(i >> ind) % 2 == 0` holds true and `s2[i + 2 ** ind]` is '1', then `ok` is set to False. Otherwise, `ok` remains unchanged.***
