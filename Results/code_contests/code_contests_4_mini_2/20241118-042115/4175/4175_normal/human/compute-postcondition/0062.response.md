According to the code, for the loop to execute one more time, `ret_path` must have at least 3 elements, as each iteration processes a pair of elements `(x, y)` from `ret_path`. At the end of the last iteration, `ret_path` has a length greater than 1, so it must be adjusted to indicate that it now has at least 3 elements. The variables `x` and `y` are currently the second element's first and second items of `ret_path`, respectively, meaning they must be updated to reflect the next pair in the list.

Thus, in order for the loop to execute one more time, `ret_path` needs to have at least 3 elements, and `x` and `y` need to represent the third element's first and second items of `ret_path`.

State: **`ret_path` length is greater than 2, `ok` is true, output is 'Possible', `x` is the third element's first item of `ret_path`, `y` is the third element's second item of `ret_path`, and the output is str(x) + ' ' + str(y)**
