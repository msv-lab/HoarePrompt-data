Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 8, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `ind` is 1, `s2` is a string of length 2^N consisting of '0's and '1's with `s2[0] = '1'`. If `(i >> ind) % 2` equals 0 and `s2[i + 2 ** ind]` is '1', then `ok` is set to False. If `(i >> ind) % 2` is not 0 or `s2[i + 2 ** ind]` is not '1', the value of `ok` remains unchanged.***
