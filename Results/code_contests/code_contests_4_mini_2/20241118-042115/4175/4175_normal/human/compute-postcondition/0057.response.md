The `print` statement outputs the length of `ret_path` minus 1. Since `ret_path` has been updated to include (0, 0) and the results of `func_4` for each element in `ret_gp`, the length of `ret_path` is determined by how many elements were added to it. However, the exact length of `ret_path` is not explicitly given, so we will denote it as `len(ret_path)`. 

The output state will include the current value of `ok`, which is `true`, and the output message 'Possible' remains unchanged. 

Therefore, the output state is: `ret_path` length is `len(ret_path)`, `ok` is true, and the output is 'Possible'.

Output State: **`ret_path` length is `len(ret_path)`, `ok` is true, and the output is 'Possible'**
