Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 8, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `ind` is 0, `s2` is a string of length 2^N consisting of '0's and '1's with `s2[0] = '1'`, `ok` is set to False if `(i >> ind) % 2` equals 0 and `s2[i + 2 ** ind]` is '1', while remaining True otherwise; `ret_gp` remains an empty list, and `s` is [2], with the character at index `i` of `s2` being '0'.***
