Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 8, `s2` is a string of length 2^N consisting of '0's and '1's where s2[0] = '1', `ok` is a boolean variable which remains True unless for some `ind` in the range of `n`, `(i >> ind) % 2 == 0` and `s2[i + 2 ** ind] == '1'`, in which case `ok` is set to False. Regardless of the value of `ok`, `ret_gp` is updated by appending the result of `func_2(s)`. Additionally, `i` is equal to 2 and `s` is a list containing the integer 2.***
