The variable `ok` is assigned the value `False`. The previous values of the affected variables do not change as the assignment does not depend on any of their values. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 8, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `ind` is 1, `s2` is a string of length 2^N consisting of '0's and '1's with `s2[0] = '1'`, and `ok` is set to False.
