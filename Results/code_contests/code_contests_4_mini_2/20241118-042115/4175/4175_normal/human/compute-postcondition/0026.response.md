According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `ind` and the value of `n`. The loop will execute as long as `ind` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `ind` is 0 and `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 8. For the loop to execute one more time, `ind` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1. 

Since `N` is between 1 and 8, `n` must still be at least 2 for the loop to continue executing after the increment. Therefore, we need to adjust `n` to be greater than 1. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 8, `ind` is 1**
