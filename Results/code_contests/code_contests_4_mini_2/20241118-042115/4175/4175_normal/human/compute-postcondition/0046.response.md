The variable `ok` is assigned the value `False`. The previous values of `N`, `ind`, `s`, and `i` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is greater than or equal to 1, `ind` is 2, `s` is either [] or [2], `i` is an integer, and `ok` is False.

Output State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 1, `ind` is 2, `s` is either [] or [2], `i` is an integer, and `ok` is False**
