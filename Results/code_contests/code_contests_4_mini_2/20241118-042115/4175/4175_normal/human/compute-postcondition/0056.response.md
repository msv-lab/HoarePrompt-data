The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'Possible'. The values of the variables `ret_path`, `ret_gp`, and `ok` remain unchanged, as the print statement does not modify them. Therefore, the output state reflects the current states of these variables along with the printed output.

Output State: **`ret_path` is updated to include (0, 0) and the results of func_4 for each element in `ret_gp`, `ok` is true, and the output is 'Possible'**.
