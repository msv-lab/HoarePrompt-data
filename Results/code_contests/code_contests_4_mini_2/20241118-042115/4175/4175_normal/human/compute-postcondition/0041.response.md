Postcondition: ***`N` is greater than or equal to 1, `ind` is 0, `s` is either [] (if `N` = 1) or [2] (if `N` >= 2), and `i` is an integer. If the condition `(i >> ind) % 2 == 0` holds true and `s2[i + 2 ** ind]` equals '1', then `ok` is set to False. If the condition does not hold, the value of `ok` remains unchanged.***
