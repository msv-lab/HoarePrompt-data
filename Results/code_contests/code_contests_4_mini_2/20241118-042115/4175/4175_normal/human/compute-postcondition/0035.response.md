Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 8, and `s` is either [] (if `N` = 1) or [2] (if `N` >= 2). If `s2[i]` is '0', for each `ind` in the range from 0 to `N-1`, if `(i >> ind) % 2 == 0` and `s2[i + 2 ** ind]` is '1', then `ok` is set to False. Additionally, `ret_gp` is increased by the value returned from `func_2(s)`. If `s2[i]` is not '0', the program does not alter `ok` or `ret_gp`.***
