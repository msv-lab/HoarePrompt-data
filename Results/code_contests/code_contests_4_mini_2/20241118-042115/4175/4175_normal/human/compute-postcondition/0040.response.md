The value of `ok` is assigned `False`, and this assignment does not depend on any other variables. The previous values of the affected variables remain unchanged; thus, the output state includes the unchanged values of `N`, `ind`, `s`, and `i`, along with the new state of `ok`.

Output State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 1, `ind` is 0, `s` is either [] (if `N` = 1) or [2] (if `N` >= 2), `i` is an integer, `ok` is False**
