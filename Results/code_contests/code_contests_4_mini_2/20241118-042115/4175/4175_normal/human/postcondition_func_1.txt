The function accepts a string `s` consisting of '0's and '1's, and recursively processes it to return a list. If `s` has a length of 1, it returns a list containing the last character of `s`. For longer strings, it combines the result of the recursive processing of the substring excluding the last character and adds the last character, along with the result of another function `func_1` applied to the recursive result, and the negative value of the last character. The exact behavior of `func_1` is not defined within the provided code, which may lead to uncertainty in the output. Thus, the function's behavior heavily relies on the definition of `func_1`.
