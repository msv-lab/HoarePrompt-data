The function accepts two parameters, `s1`, which is a string representing a positive integer N (where 1 <= N <= 8), and `s2`, a string of length 2^N consisting of '0's and '1's with the first character being '1'. It processes the binary representation of integers from 0 to 2^N-1 to determine if a certain condition is met based on the values in `s2`. If the condition is fulfilled, it prints 'Possible', the number of valid coordinates derived from a helper function, and the coordinates themselves; otherwise, it prints 'Impossible'. However, the function does not return any values, which may limit its usability in a broader context.
