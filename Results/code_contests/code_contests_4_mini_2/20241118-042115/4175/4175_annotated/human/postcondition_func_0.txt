The function accepts a sequence `a` and returns a new list containing the negation of each element in `a`. There are no constraints enforced on the length of `a`, so it can be of any length, not limited to `2^N`. Additionally, it does not check if the first element of `a` is equal to 1, nor does it enforce the constraints on `N`, meaning it can accept any list of numerical values.
