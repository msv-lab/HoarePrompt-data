Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 8, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `s` is a list containing the integer 2, the third element of `s` (s[2]) is equal to '0', and `ind` is 2. If the condition `(i >> ind) % 2 == 0` is true and `s2[i + 2 ** ind]` is equal to '1', then `ok` is set to False. Otherwise, `ok` remains unchanged. This accounts for scenarios where the condition may or may not be met, while ensuring that the initial constraints on the variables are preserved.***
