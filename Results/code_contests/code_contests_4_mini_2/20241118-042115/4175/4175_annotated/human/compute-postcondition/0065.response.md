Output State: **if `ret_path` is a list with at least one element, the loop will print each (x, y) coordinate from `ret_path`, where `x` and `y` will take values from the respective elements of `ret_path`. If `ret_path` is empty, the loop does not execute, and the values of `N`, `n`, `i`, and `ok` remain unchanged, while `ret_path` will still be an empty list.**
