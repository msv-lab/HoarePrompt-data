The code snippet prints the values of `x` and `y`, which are derived from the `ret_path` list. The output will show the values of `x` and `y` as strings concatenated with a space in between. Since `ret_path` has at least 3 elements, we can assume `x` and `y` are taken from the first two elements of `ret_path`, which are the coordinates.

Assuming `ret_path` is given as `[(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2)]`, then `x` will be the first x-coordinate `1` and `y` will be the first y-coordinate `1`. 

Since you didn't provide specific values for `ret_path`, I will keep the output state general based on the description of the initial state.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 8, `n` is an integer between 1 and 8 inclusive, `i` is 2, `ret_path` is a list starting with (0, 0) and having at least 3 elements, `ok` is true, `x` is the next x-coordinate from `ret_path`, `y` is the next y-coordinate from `ret_path` and the function prints the values of `x` and `y`.**
