The variable `ok` is assigned the value `False`. The previous values of the affected variables remain unchanged, as this assignment only impacts the variable `ok`. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 8, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3 and less than or equal to 8, `i` is 1, `ind` is 2, and `ok` is False.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 8, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3 and less than or equal to 8, `i` is 1, `ind` is 2, and `ok` is False**
