According to the code, the loop depends on the variable `ind` which is controlled by the `range(n)` function. For the loop to execute one more time, `ind` must be less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `ind` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1, which means that `n` could be 2 or more. 

To allow the loop to execute again, the state of `ind` should be adjusted to 2 (the next value in the range) and we need to ensure that `n` is at least 3 to guarantee that the loop can run one more time when `ind` is 2. 

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
- `ind` should be 2.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 8, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 0, `s` is a list, `ind` is 2**
