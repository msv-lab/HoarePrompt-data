The variable `ok` is assigned the value `False`. The other variables (`N`, `n`, `i`, `s`, and `ind`) remain unchanged as this assignment does not affect them. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 8, `n` is between 1 and 8 inclusive, `i` is 2, `s` is a list containing the integer 2, the third element of `s` (s[2]) is equal to '0', `ind` is 1, and `ok` is set to False.
