Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 8, `n` is an integer between 1 and 8 inclusive, `i` will take values from `2**n - 1` down to `0`. The variable `s` will contain a list of integers based on the binary representation of `i`. If `s2[i]` is '0', then `ok` may be set to `False` depending on conditions involving `s2` and the indices derived from `i`. The list `ret_gp` will be updated by the return value of `func_2(s)` if `s2[i]` is '0'. If `n` is less than 1 or if `i` is less than 0, the loop does not execute, leaving `ret_gp` as an empty list, `ok` as True, and `n` unchanged. If `s2` does not contain enough characters (less than `2^n`), it may lead to an index error, which is not handled.**
