The code prints the string representation of `x` and `y`, which are both 0. The values of other variables are not affected by this print statement. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 8, `n` is an integer between 1 and 8 inclusive, `i` is 2, `ret_path` is a list starting with (0, 0) and its length is greater than or equal to 1, `ok` is true, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, and it prints "0 0".
