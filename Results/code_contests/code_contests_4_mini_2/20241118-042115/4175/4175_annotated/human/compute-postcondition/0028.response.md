Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 8, `n` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 8, `i` is 1, `ind` is 1, and if the expression `(i >> ind) % 2 == 0` evaluates to true and `s2[i + 2 ** ind]` equals '1', then `ok` is set to False. If the condition is not met, `ok` remains unchanged.***
