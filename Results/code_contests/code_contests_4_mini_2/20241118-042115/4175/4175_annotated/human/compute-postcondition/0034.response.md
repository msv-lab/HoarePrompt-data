The function `func_2(s)` is called, and its return value is added to `ret_gp`. The values of `n`, `i`, `ind`, and `ok` are not modified by this line. However, the state of `ret_gp` changes based on the return value of `func_2(s)`. Since `n` is within the specified range (1 to 8), the loop conditions are met, but without the actual implementation of `func_2(s)`, we cannot define what `ret_gp` will be incremented by. Nevertheless, we can state that `ret_gp` will be updated.

Output State: **`ret_gp` is updated by the return value of `func_2(s)`, `n` is between 1 and 8, `i` is 1, and `ind` ranges from 0 to n-1, and `ok` remains unchanged.**
