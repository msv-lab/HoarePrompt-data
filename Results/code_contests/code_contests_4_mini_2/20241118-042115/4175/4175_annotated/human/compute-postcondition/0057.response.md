The code prints the length of `ret_path` minus one. The initial state indicates that `ret_path` is a list starting with (0, 0), which implies that its length is at least 1. The length of `ret_path` will determine the output when decremented by 1. The values of `N`, `n`, and `i` do not directly affect the outcome of this print statement. The variable `ok` being true and the function printing 'Possible' indicates that prior conditions were met, but they do not alter the length of `ret_path`.

Thus, the output state focuses on the length of `ret_path`. Since we don't have the exact length of `ret_path`, we can denote it as `len(ret_path)`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 8, `n` is an integer between 1 and 8 inclusive, `i` will take values from `2`, `ret_path` is a list starting with (0, 0) and its length is `len(ret_path)`, `ok` is true, and the function prints `len(ret_path) - 1`.**
