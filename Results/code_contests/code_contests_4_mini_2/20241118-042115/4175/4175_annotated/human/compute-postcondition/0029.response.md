To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the current state and the loop condition.

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates `n` times, starting from `ind = 0` and going up to `ind = n-1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `ind` must be less than `n` at the beginning of the next iteration.

2. **Current State**: 
   - `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 8.
   - `n` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 8.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `ind` is 1.

3. **Next Iteration**: 
   - The current value of `ind` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `ind` needs to be incremented by 1. Thus, `ind` will become 2 in the next iteration.
   - We also need to ensure that `ind` (which will be 2 after the increment) is still less than `n`.

4. **Adjustments**: 
   - Since `ind` is currently 1, for the loop to run again, `n` must be at least 3 (i.e., `ind` should be less than `n`, which will hold true if `n` is 3 or greater).
   - Therefore, `n` must be adjusted to be at least 3.

Putting all this together, the adjusted state to allow the loop to execute one more time is:

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 8, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3 and less than or equal to 8, `i` is 1, `ind` is 2**
