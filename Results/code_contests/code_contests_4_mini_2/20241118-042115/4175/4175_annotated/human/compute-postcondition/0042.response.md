To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the provided state and the for loop statement.

1. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `ind` is less than `n`. Since `n` is greater than 0, the loop is currently executing and will continue until `ind` reaches `n - 1`.

2. **Current State Analysis**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `ind` was equal to the last value it took in the range, which is currently `ind = 0`.
   - The next value of `ind` after the current iteration will be `1`.

3. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since `n` is greater than 0, and `ind` is currently `0`, for the loop to execute again, the only requirement is that `ind` must be less than `n`.
   - We need to verify that `ind` will remain within the bounds of `n` for the next iteration. If `n` was 1, the loop would stop after this iteration. Since `N` is a positive integer between 1 and 8, we can ensure that `n` is at least 2 for the loop to execute one more time.

4. **Conclusion**: 
   - Therefore, `n` must be adjusted to be greater than 1 to ensure that `ind` will be less than `n` in the next iteration.
   - The value of `ind` will change to `1` for the next iteration.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 8, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, and `s` is a list. `ind` is 1**
