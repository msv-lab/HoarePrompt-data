The provided code snippet `ret_gp += func_2(s)` suggests that the function `func_2` is called with the list `s` as an argument. However, to determine the output state, we need to know the result of `func_2(s)` and how it affects `ret_gp`. 

Since the initial state does not provide specific values for `ret_gp` or the output of `func_2(s)`, we cannot definitively calculate the new value of `ret_gp`. Therefore, we can only note that `ret_gp` is modified by adding the result of `func_2(s)`. 

The rest of the variables (`N`, `n`, `i`, `s`, `ind`) remain unchanged by this operation. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 8, `n` is between 1 and 8 inclusive, `i` is 2, `s` is a list containing the integer 2, the third element of `s` (s[2]) is equal to '0', `ind` is between 0 and n-1, and `ret_gp` is increased by the return value of `func_2(s)`.**
