According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `ind` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `ind` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `ind` is 2 and `n` is greater than or equal to 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `ind` needs to be incremented to 3.

No other states need to be adjusted since the other variables (`N`, `i`, `s`) do not directly affect the loop execution in this context.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 8, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 0, `s` is a list, and `ind` is 3**
