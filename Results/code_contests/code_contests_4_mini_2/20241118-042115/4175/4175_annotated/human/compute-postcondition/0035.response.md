Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 8, `n` is an integer between 1 and 8 inclusive, `i` is 1, and `s` is [1]. If `s2[i]` is '0', then `ret_gp` is updated by the return value of `func_2(s)`, `n` is within the range of 1 to 8, `i` remains 1, `ind` iterates from 0 to n-1, and the variable `ok` remains unchanged. There are no changes to `ret_gp`, `ok`, or any other variables if the condition `s2[i]` is not '0'.***
