The variable `ok` is assigned the value `False`. The previous values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 8, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `s` is a list containing the integer 2, the third element of `s` (s[2]) is equal to '0', `ind` is 2, and `ok` is False.
