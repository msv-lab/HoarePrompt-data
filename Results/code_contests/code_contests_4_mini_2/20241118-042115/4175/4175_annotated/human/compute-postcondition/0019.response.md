Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 8, `n` is an integer between 1 and 8 inclusive, `i` is 2, and `s` is a list containing the integer 2. If the third element of `s` (s[2]) is equal to '0', for each `ind` in the range from 0 to `n-1`, if `(i >> ind) % 2 == 0` and `s[i + 2 ** ind]` is '1', then the variable `ok` remains unchanged, and `ret_gp` is increased by the return value of `func_2(s)`. If none of the conditions are satisfied, `ret_gp` remains unchanged.***
