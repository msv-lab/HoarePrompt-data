The variable `ok` is assigned the value `False`. The previous values of the other variables (`N`, `n`, `i`, and `ind`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged for those variables.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 8, `n` is an integer between 1 and 8 inclusive, `i` is 1, `ind` is 0, and `ok` is False**
