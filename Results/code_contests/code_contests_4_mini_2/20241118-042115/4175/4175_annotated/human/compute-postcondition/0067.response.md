The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'Impossible'. The variables `N`, `n`, `i`, `ret_path`, and `ok` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the print operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of these variables along with the printed output.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 8, `n` is an integer between 1 and 8 inclusive, `i` is 2, `ret_path` is a list starting with (0, 0) followed by elements derived from the list comprehension involving `ret_gp` and `func_4(v)`, `ok` is false, and the output is 'Impossible'.**
