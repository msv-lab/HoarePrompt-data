According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `ind` compared to `n`. The loop will execute while `ind` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `ind` is 2 and `n` is an integer that is greater than or equal to 3 and less than or equal to 8. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `ind` must be incremented. Thus, after this iteration, `ind` should be 3. Since `n` is still greater than or equal to 3, this condition remains valid.

No other states need to be adjusted since `N`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged for the next iteration.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 8, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3 and less than or equal to 8, `i` is 1, `ind` is 3**
