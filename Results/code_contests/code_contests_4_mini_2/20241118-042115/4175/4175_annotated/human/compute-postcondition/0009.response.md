Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 8, `n` is between 1 and 8 inclusive, `i` is 2, `s` is a list containing the integer 2, the third element of `s` (s[2]) is equal to '0', `ind` is 0. If the value of `i` right shifted by `ind` is even and `s2[i + 2 ** ind]` is '1', then `ok` is set to False. If these conditions are not met, `ok` remains unchanged.***
