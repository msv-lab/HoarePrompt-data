Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 8, `n` is between 1 and 8 inclusive, `i` is 2, `s` is a list containing the integer 2, the third element of `s` (s[2]) is equal to '0', and `ind` is between 0 and n-1. If `(i >> ind) % 2 == 0` and `s2[i + 2 ** ind] == '1'` are both true, then `ok` is set to `False`. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute and `ind` remains undefined, and `ok` remains in its initial state. If `n` is between 1 and 8, the loop executes at least once.**
