Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 8, `n` is an integer between 1 and 8 inclusive, `i` is 0, and `s` is a list. If `s2[i]` is '0', then `ok` will be set to `False` if there exists any `ind` from 0 to `n-1` such that both conditions `(i >> ind) % 2 == 0` and `s2[i + 2 ** ind] == '1'` are true. Regardless of the value of `ok`, `ret_gp` is increased by the result of `func_2(s)`. If `s2[i]` is not '0', then the conditions and changes do not apply.***
