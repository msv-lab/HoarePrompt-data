According to the code, the loop iterates from `2 ** n - 1` down to `0`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `2`. 

To determine the values needed for the next iteration, we need to adjust `i`. The for loop decrements `i` in each iteration. If `i` is currently `2`, in the next iteration it will become `1`. 

We also need to ensure that the value of `n` remains within the specified range (1 to 8 inclusive) and that `N` remains a positive integer within the range (1 to 8). Since these conditions do not change, we can keep them as they are. 

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be updated to `1` for the next iteration.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 8, `n` is an integer between 1 and 8 inclusive, `i` is 1, and `s` is a list containing the integer 2.**
