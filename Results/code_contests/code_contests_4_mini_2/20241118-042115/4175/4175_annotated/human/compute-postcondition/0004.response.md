To determine the output state, we will analyze the provided code snippet along with the initial state of the variables.

Initial State: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 8, `n` is an integer between 1 and 8 inclusive, `i` is `2`.

In the code snippet:
```
s = [(v + 1) for v in range(n) if (i >> v) % 2 == 1]
```
- `range(n)` generates a sequence of integers from `0` to `n-1`.
- The expression `(i >> v) % 2` checks if the `v`-th bit of `i` (which is `2`) is `1`.
- The value of `i`, which is `2` in binary is `10`. Thus, the only bit position that is `1` is at index `1` (0-indexed).

Considering `n` can be between `1` and `8`, we can evaluate the range:
1. If `n` is `1`, `range(n)` produces `[0]`. The expression `(2 >> 0) % 2 == 1` evaluates to `0 % 2 == 1` (False), so `s` would be `[]`.
2. If `n` is `2`, `range(n)` produces `[0, 1]`. For `v = 0`, `(2 >> 0) % 2 == 1` evaluates to `0 % 2 == 1` (False). For `v = 1`, `(2 >> 1) % 2 == 1` evaluates to `1 % 2 == 1` (True), so `s` becomes `[2]`.
3. If `n` is `3`, `range(n)` produces `[0, 1, 2]`. For `v = 0`, `(2 >> 0) % 2` is False, for `v = 1`, it is True, and for `v = 2`, `(2 >> 2) % 2 == 0 % 2 == 1` (False). Thus, `s` is `[2]`.
4. If `n` is `4`, `range(n)` produces `[0, 1, 2, 3]`. The results are the same as when `n` is `3`, so `s` remains `[2]`. 
5. If `n` is `5`, `range(n)` produces `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`, and again the results are the same, so `s` is still `[2]`.
6. If `n` is `6`, `range(n)` produces `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, and it again gives `s` as `[2]`.
7. If `n` is `7`, `range(n)` produces `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, and `s` remains `[2]`.
8. Lastly, if `n` is `8`, `range(n)` produces `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`, and `s` will still be `[2]`.

In conclusion, for any valid value of `n` from `1` to `8`, the list `s` will be `[2]` when `i` is `2`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 8, `n` is an integer between 1 and 8 inclusive, `i` is 2, and `s` is [2]**.
