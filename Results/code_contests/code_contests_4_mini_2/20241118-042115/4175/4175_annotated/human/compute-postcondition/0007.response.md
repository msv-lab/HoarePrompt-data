Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 8, `n` is between 1 and 8 inclusive, `i` is 2, `s` is a list containing the integer 2, the third element of `s` (s[2]) is equal to '0', `ind` is 0, the value of `i` right shifted by `ind` is even, and the element `s2[i + 2 ** ind]` is equal to '1'.***
