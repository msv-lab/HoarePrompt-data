Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 8, `n` is between 1 and 8 inclusive, `i` is 2, `s` is a list containing the integer 2, the third element of `s` (s[2]) is equal to '0', `ind` is 1, and if `(i >> ind) % 2 == 0` and `s2[i + 2 ** ind] == '1'`, then `ok` is set to False. Otherwise, `ok` remains unchanged.***
