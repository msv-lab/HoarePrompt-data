According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `ret_path` list. The loop will iterate over each tuple in `ret_path`, and since `i` is 2, it indicates that the loop has executed twice already. Given that `ret_path` starts with (0, 0) and has at least 3 elements, if the loop is to execute one more time, `ret_path` must have at least 4 elements.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, which means the next index to be accessed would be `i = 3`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `x` and `y` need to be updated to reflect the values from the third tuple in the list. Thus, the states need to be adjusted as follows:

- The length of `ret_path` must be at least 4.
- `i` must be updated to 3.
- `x` and `y` should correspond to the values of the tuple at index 3 in `ret_path`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 8, `n` is an integer between 1 and 8 inclusive, `i` is 3, `ret_path` is a list starting with (0, 0) and having at least 4 elements, `ok` is true, `x` is the next x-coordinate from the 4th element of `ret_path`, `y` is the next y-coordinate from the 4th element of `ret_path`**
