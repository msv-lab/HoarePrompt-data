Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 8, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `s` is a list, `ind` is 1, and if the condition `(i >> ind) % 2 == 0` is true and `s2[i + 2 ** ind] == '1'`, then `ok` is set to False. If the condition is not met, the value of `ok` remains unchanged.***
