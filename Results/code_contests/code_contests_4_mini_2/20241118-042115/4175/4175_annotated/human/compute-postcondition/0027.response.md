The variable `ok` is assigned the value `False`. The values of the other variables `N`, `n`, `i`, and `ind` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 8, `n` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 8, `i` is 1, `ind` is 1, and `ok` is False.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 8, `n` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 8, `i` is 1, `ind` is 1, and `ok` is False**
