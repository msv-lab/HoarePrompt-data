According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `ind` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `ind` is less than `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `ind` is 0 and `n` is between 1 and 8 inclusive. For the loop to execute one more time, `ind` needs to be incremented to 1. Therefore, `ind` must be adjusted to 1, while `n` remains as is because it does not need to change.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 8, `n` is between 1 and 8 inclusive, `i` is 2, `s` is a list containing the integer 2, the third element of `s` (s[2]) is equal to '0', `ind` is 1**
