The variable `ok` is assigned the value `False`. The values of the other variables (`N`, `n`, `i`, `s`, and `ind`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 8, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 0, `s` is a list, `ind` is 2, and `ok` is False.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 8, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 0, `s` is a list, `ind` is 2, and `ok` is False**
