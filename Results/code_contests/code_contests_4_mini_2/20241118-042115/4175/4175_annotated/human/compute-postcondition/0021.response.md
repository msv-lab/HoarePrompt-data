To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we will analyze the components step by step.

1. **Initial Values**: 
   - `N` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 8\).
   - `n` is an integer between 1 and 8 inclusive.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `s` is a list containing the integer 2.

2. **List Comprehension**:
   The code uses a list comprehension to construct a new list `s`:
   ```
   s = [(v + 1) for v in range(n) if (i >> v) % 2 == 1]
   ```

3. **Understanding the Conditions**:
   - `range(n)` generates a sequence of integers from 0 to \(n-1\).
   - The expression `(i >> v) % 2 == 1` checks if the \(v\)-th bit of `i` (which is 1 in this case) is set (i.e., if it equals 1).

4. **Bitwise Operation**:
   - For `i = 1` (binary `0001`), the bits are as follows:
     - For \(v = 0\): `i >> 0` is `1` (binary `0001`), and `1 % 2` is `1` (condition is True).
     - For \(v = 1\): `i >> 1` is `0` (binary `0000`), and `0 % 2` is `0` (condition is False).
     - For \(v = 2\) and higher: `i >> v` also results in `0`, thus the condition will be False.

5. **Resulting List**:
   - The only value of `v` that satisfies the condition is \(v = 0\).
   - Therefore, \(v + 1\) results in \(1\) for \(v = 0\).
   - Thus, `s` becomes `[1]`.

6. **Final Output State**:
   The values of the variables after executing the code snippet are:
   - The list `s` now contains the integer 1.
   - The initial values of `N`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 8, `n` is an integer between 1 and 8 inclusive, `i` is 1, and `s` is [1]**.
