Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 8, `n` is an integer between 1 and 8 inclusive, and `i` is 2. If `ok` is true, the output will indicate 'Possible', it will print the length of `ret_path` minus one, and will print each coordinate (x, y) from `ret_path`. If `ok` is false, the output will indicate 'Impossible', and `ret_path` remains unchanged, with its initial value containing at least the element (0, 0) and possibly additional elements depending on prior computations. In either case, the values of `N`, `n`, `i`, and `ok` remain unchanged.***
