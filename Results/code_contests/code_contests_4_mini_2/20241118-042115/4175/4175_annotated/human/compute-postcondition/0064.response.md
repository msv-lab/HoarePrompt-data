According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `ret_path` list. The loop will iterate over `ret_path`, and since `i` is currently 3, it indicates that the 4th element of `ret_path` has just been processed. 

Given that `ret_path` has at least 4 elements, for the loop to execute one more time, the list must have at least 5 elements. Therefore, after processing the current iteration, the next values of `x` and `y` would come from the 5th element of `ret_path`.

Thus, we need to adjust the states as follows:
- The `ret_path` should have at least 5 elements.
- `i` should be adjusted to 4, as it will move to the next iteration.
- `x` and `y` should be set to the x and y coordinates from the 5th element of `ret_path`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 8, `n` is an integer between 1 and 8 inclusive, `i` is 4, `ret_path` is a list starting with (0, 0) and having at least 5 elements, `ok` is true, `x` is the x-coordinate from the 5th element of `ret_path`, `y` is the y-coordinate from the 5th element of `ret_path`.**
