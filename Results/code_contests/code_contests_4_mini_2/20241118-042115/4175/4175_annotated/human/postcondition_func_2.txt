The function accepts an integer `v` and returns a list of tuples based on the value of `v`. If `v` is greater than 0, it generates a list of tuples where the first part contains pairs (i, 0) for i in the range from 1 to `v`, followed by the pairs (v, 1) and (v - 1, 1), and then pairs (i, 0) for i in the range from `v - 1` down to 1. If `v` is negative, it returns the reverse of the output from the function applied to the positive integer value of `-v`. If `v` is 0, it does not return a value and remains unchanged. Therefore, the function effectively handles positive values by producing a specific structure of tuples, reverses the output for negative values, and has no output for zero.
