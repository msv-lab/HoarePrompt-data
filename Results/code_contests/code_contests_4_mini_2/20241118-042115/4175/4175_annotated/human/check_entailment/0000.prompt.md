You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
We have added some annotations within the code to help you understand the code and its logic. The annotations are in the form of comments and are inserted automatically so double check whether the annotations are correct or not and describe the code correctly.
If the annotations are correct use them along with the code to determine the correctness of the code. If the annotations are incorrect then you can ignore them and just use the code to determine the correctness.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Given are a positive integer N and a sequence of length 2^N consisting of 0s and 1s: A_0,A_1,\ldots,A_{2^N-1}. Determine whether there exists a closed curve C that satisfies the condition below for all 2^N sets S \subseteq \\{0,1,\ldots,N-1 \\}. If the answer is yes, construct one such closed curve.

* Let x = \sum_{i \in S} 2^i and B_S be the set of points \\{ (i+0.5,0.5) | i \in S \\}.
* If there is a way to continuously move the closed curve C without touching B_S so that every point on the closed curve has a negative y-coordinate, A_x = 1.
* If there is no such way, A_x = 0.



For instruction on printing a closed curve, see Output below.

Constraints

* 1 \leq N \leq 8
* A_i = 0,1 \quad (0 \leq i \leq 2^N-1)
* A_0 = 1

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
A_0A_1 \cdots A_{2^N-1}


Output

If there is no closed curve that satisfies the condition, print `Impossible`.

If such a closed curve exists, print `Possible` in the first line. Then, print one such curve in the following format:


L
x_0 y_0
x_1 y_1
:
x_L y_L


This represents the closed polyline that passes (x_0,y_0),(x_1,y_1),\ldots,(x_L,y_L) in this order.

Here, all of the following must be satisfied:

* 0 \leq x_i \leq N, 0 \leq y_i \leq 1, and x_i, y_i are integers. (0 \leq i \leq L)
* |x_i-x_{i+1}| + |y_i-y_{i+1}| = 1. (0 \leq i \leq L-1)
* (x_0,y_0) = (x_L,y_L).



Additionally, the length of the closed curve L must satisfy 0 \leq L \leq 250000.

It can be proved that, if there is a closed curve that satisfies the condition in Problem Statement, there is also a closed curve that can be expressed in this format.

#Function 1:

    return [(-v) for v in a]
    #The program returns a list containing the negation of each element in the sequence A of length 2^N, where A[0] = 1.

In all other cases where `pre_s` is not empty, the function does not return any value.
    return func_2(pre_s) + [v] + func_1(func_2(pre_s)) + [-v]
    #The program returns a list containing the last element of the sequence 's', which is 'v', along with the computed values from 'func_2(pre_s)' and 'func_1(func_2(pre_s))' with '-v' appended at the end.

If `v` is negative, the function returns the reverse of the output of `func_3` applied to the positive integer value of `-v`. If `v` is 0, there is no return value specified, and the state of the program remains unchanged.

If `v` is greater than 0, the function returns a list of tuples containing pairs (i, 0) for i in the range from 1 to v, followed by the pairs (v, 1) and (v - 1, 1), and then pairs (i, 0) for i in the range from v - 1 down to 1. If `v` is negative, the function returns the reverse of the output of `func_3` applied to the positive integer value of `-v`. If `v` is 0, the state of the program remains unchanged, and there is no return value specified.

#Function 4:

If `ret_path` is empty, the loop does not execute, and the values of `N`, `n`, `i`, and `ok` remain unchanged, while `ret_path` will still be an empty list.
    else :
        print('Impossible')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 8, `n` is an integer between 1 and 8 inclusive, and `i` is 2. If `ok` is true, the output will indicate 'Possible', it will print the length of `ret_path` minus one, and will print each coordinate (x, y) from `ret_path`. If `ok` is false, the output will indicate 'Impossible', and `ret_path` remains unchanged, with its initial value containing at least the element (0, 0) and possibly additional elements depending on prior computations. In either case, the values of `N`, `n`, `i`, and `ok` remain unchanged.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
