The function accepts a sequence `s` and recursively processes it. If `s` is empty except for the last element, it returns a list containing just that last element. Otherwise, it constructs a list that includes the last element of `s`, the result of a recursive call to `func_2` with the rest of the sequence, the result of `func_1` applied to that recursive result, and finally the negative of the last element. The function may not handle cases where `s` is empty at the beginning properly, potentially resulting in an error or unexpected behavior. Additionally, the behavior of `func_1` is not defined in the context provided, which may affect the output.
