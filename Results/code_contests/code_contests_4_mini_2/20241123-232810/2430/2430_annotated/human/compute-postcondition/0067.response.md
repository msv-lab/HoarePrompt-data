According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `res` list. The loop will execute if the length of `res` is greater than 0. Given that `res` is in its initial state (uninitialized), we need to ensure that it contains at least one element. Additionally, since the maximum value in `res` is less than or equal to 51, we can assume that the elements in `res` are within this limit. The variable `ind` should start at 0 for the loop to begin executing.

State: **`queue` is empty, `res` is a list with at least 1 element (with maximum value â‰¤ 51), `val` is unchanged, `HM` is 51, `ind` is 0**
