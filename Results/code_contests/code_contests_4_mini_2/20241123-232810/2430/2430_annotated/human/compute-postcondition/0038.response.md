The code appends a list containing `sosed` and `val` to `queue`. The value of `sosed` is taken from the third element of `nodes[ind]`, and `val` is assumed to be a previously defined variable but is not specified in the initial state. The state of the `queue` will change as a new element is added, while `nodes[ind]` and `sosed` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated state of `queue`.

Output State: **`nodes[ind]` is a list with at least three elements, `sosed` is the third element of `nodes[ind]`, and a new element [sosed, val] is appended to `queue`.**
