The variable `val` is assigned the value of `res[ind]`. The initial state indicates that `res` is a list with at least one element, and since `ind` is 0, `val` will take the value of the first element of `res`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `queue` is empty, `res` is a list with at least 1 element, `val` is the first element of `res`, `HM` is 51, `ind` is 0.

Output State: **`queue` is empty, `res` is a list with at least 1 element, `val` is the first element of `res`, `HM` is 51, `ind` is 0**
