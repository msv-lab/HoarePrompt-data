The value of `val` is incremented by 1. Since the previous value of `val` is equal to `cur[1]`, which is not specified but is less than or equal to `HM`, the output state reflects that `val` has been increased by 1, while the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `queue` is one element shorter; `cur` is the first element of the original `queue`; `val` is equal to `cur[1] + 1`; `ind` is equal to `cur[0]`; `res[ind]` is assigned the value of `val`.

Output State: **`queue` is one element shorter; `cur` is the first element of the original `queue`; `val` is equal to `cur[1] + 1`; `ind` is equal to `cur[0]`; `res[ind]` is assigned the value of `val`.**
