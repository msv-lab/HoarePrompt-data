The variable `val` is assigned the value of `res[ind]`. Since `ind` is 1, `val` takes on the value of the second element of `res`. The other variables, `queue`, `res`, `HM`, and `ind`, remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state will reflect the current values of all variables, including the newly assigned value of `val`.

Output State: **`queue` is empty, `res` is a list with at least 2 elements, `val` is the second element of `res`, `HM` is 51, `ind` is 1**
