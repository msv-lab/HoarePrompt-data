The code attempts to assign a value `val` to `res[ind]`. However, since `cur[1]` leads to an error, it suggests that `ind` may not be a valid index for `res`, or `res` may not be properly defined. As a result, the execution cannot proceed successfully without resolving the error related to accessing `cur[1]`. The values of `HM` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`HM` is 51, `n` is unknown, and accessing `cur[1]` leads to an error**
