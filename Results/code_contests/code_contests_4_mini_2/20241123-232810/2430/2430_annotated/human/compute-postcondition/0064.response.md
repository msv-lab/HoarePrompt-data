Postcondition: ***`queue` is not empty, `res` is a list of integers with some elements processed, `val` is an integer greater than `HM` (51), and at least one element of `res` exceeds `HM`. The values of `res` have been set based on the processing of elements from the queue, and `val` has been incremented accordingly. If `nodes[ind]` is empty, the specific element of `res` corresponding to that index remains unchanged.***
