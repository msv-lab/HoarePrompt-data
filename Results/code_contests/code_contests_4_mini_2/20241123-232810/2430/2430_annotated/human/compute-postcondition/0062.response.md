According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `queue`. If `queue` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `queue` contains elements `[sosed, val]` for each `sosed` in `nodes[ind]` where `res[sosed]` is equal to 0. 

If `nodes[ind]` is empty, then `queue` will contain one more element than its initial state, but we have no information about whether this additional element allows the loop to execute again. On the other hand, if `nodes[ind]` has elements but all `res[sosed]` values are not equal to 0, then `queue` remains unchanged from its previous state. 

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state to indicate that `queue` must contain at least one element. Thus, we need to ensure that either `nodes[ind]` is not empty, or that at least one `res[sosed]` is equal to 0 for some `sosed` in `nodes[ind]`.

State: **`queue` contains at least one element**
