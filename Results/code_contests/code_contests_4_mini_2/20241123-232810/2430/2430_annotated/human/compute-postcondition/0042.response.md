To determine if the `while queue:` loop can execute one more time, we need to focus on the variable `queue`. 

The loop will continue as long as `queue` is not empty. Therefore, in the previous iteration, if `queue` was not empty, it means the loop executed at least once. For the loop to execute again, `queue` needs to contain at least one element after the last iteration.

Since the state provided is the end of the previous iteration, we need to ensure that `queue` either remains unchanged or has been modified to include at least one element based on the logic described.

If `queue` was empty at the end of the last iteration, the loop cannot execute again, and we would not modify the state.

However, since we need to ensure the loop can execute at least one more time, we can adjust the state of `queue` to indicate it must contain at least one element. 

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, we can say:
- The state of `queue` must indicate it is not empty.

State: **`queue` is not empty**
