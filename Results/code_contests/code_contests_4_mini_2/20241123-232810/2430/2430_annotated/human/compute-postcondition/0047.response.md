The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `queue` is now one element shorter; `cur` is the first element of the original `queue`; `val` is equal to `cur[1]`; `ind` is equal to `cur[0]`; `res[ind]` is assigned the value of `val`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
