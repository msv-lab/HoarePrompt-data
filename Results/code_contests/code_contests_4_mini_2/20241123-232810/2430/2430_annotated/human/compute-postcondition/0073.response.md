According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `ind` and the length of `res`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `ind` is less than the length of `res`. At the end of the last iteration, `ind` is 2, and `res` has at least 3 elements. For the loop to execute one more time, `ind` should be incremented by 1, making it 3, and we must ensure that `res` has at least 4 elements to satisfy the condition for the next iteration. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted accordingly.

State: **`queue` is empty, `res` is a list with at least 4 elements, `val` is the fourth element of `res`, `HM` is 51, `ind` is 3**
