Output State: **`queue` remains empty, `res` is a list where each element is either unchanged (if it was less than or equal to 26) or transformed (if it was greater than 26, it becomes `2 * 26 - val`). `val` is the last element of `res` processed in the loop, `HM` is 51, and `ind` is equal to the length of `res` minus 1 after the loop completes. If `res` is empty, the loop does not execute, leaving `queue` empty, `res` unchanged, and `val` uninitialized.**
