Output State: **`queue` will contain elements `[sosed, val]` for each `sosed` in `nodes[ind]` where `res[sosed]` is equal to 0, and `val` is equal to `cur[1] + 1`. If `nodes[ind]` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `queue` remains one element longer than its initial state. If all `res[sosed]` values are not equal to 0 for elements in `nodes[ind]`, then `queue` remains unchanged from its previous state.**
