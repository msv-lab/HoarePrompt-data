The code appends a list containing `sosed` and `val` to `queue`. The value of `sosed` is the second element of `nodes[ind]`. The state of `nodes[ind]` is not affected, and `val` is used as it is. Therefore, the output state describes the state of `nodes[ind]`, `sosed`, and indicates that a new element has been added to `queue`.

Output State: **`nodes[ind]` is a list with at least two elements, `sosed` is the second element of `nodes[ind]`, and a new list [sosed, val] has been appended to `queue`.**
