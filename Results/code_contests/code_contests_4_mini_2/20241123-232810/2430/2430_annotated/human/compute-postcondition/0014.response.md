According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nodes[ind]` list. The loop will continue executing as long as there are more elements in the `nodes[ind]` list. At the end of the last iteration, `nodes[ind]` has at least 1 element, which means it can execute one more time if there is still at least 1 more element in the list.

Since `val` has been increased by 1, we do not need to modify it for the next iteration, but we need to consider the next item from `nodes[ind]`. Therefore, we need to ensure that the list `nodes[ind]` has at least 2 elements for the loop to execute once again, and we must also adjust `sosed` to represent the next element in the list.

State: **`HM` is 51, `val` has been increased by 1, `nodes[ind]` is a list with at least 2 elements, `cur` is in a valid state, and `queue` remains unchanged**.
