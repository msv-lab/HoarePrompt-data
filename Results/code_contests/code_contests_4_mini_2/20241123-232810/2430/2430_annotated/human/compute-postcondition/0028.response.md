Postcondition: ***`nodes[ind]` is a list with at least one element, `res[sosed]` is 0 for at least one `sosed`, `cur` is the first element of `queue`, `queue` has been modified to remove its first element, `val` is assigned the second element of `cur`, `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`, and `res[ind]` is assigned the value of `val`. If `val` is greater than `HM`, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, the program continues executing the subsequent statements in the loop or block. Additionally, if `val` is equal to or less than `HM`, the state of the program is maintained for further processing.***
