The variable `val` is assigned the value of `cur[1]`. The initial state indicates that `cur` is the first element of the original `queue`, which implies that `cur` is a tuple or list with at least two elements (since we are accessing the second element at index 1). The value of `cur[1]` is determined by the contents of `cur`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `queue` is now one element shorter; `cur` is the first element of the original `queue`; `val` is equal to `cur[1]`.

Output State: **`queue` is now one element shorter; `cur` is the first element of the original `queue`; `val` is equal to `cur[1]`**
