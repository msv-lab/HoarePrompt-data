Postcondition: ***`queue` has one additional element if `res[sosed]` is 0, which now contains the previous elements plus [sosed, val]. The index `ind` is incremented, and `nodes[ind]` contains valid elements. If `res[sosed]` is not 0, the state of `queue`, `ind`, and `nodes[ind]` remains unchanged.***
