According to the code, the loop iterates over the elements in `nodes[ind]`. Given that at the end of the last iteration, `nodes[ind]` is a list with at least 2 elements, we need to consider the current state of the loop.

Since `val` has been increased by 1, we can assume that the loop may have processed an element from `nodes[ind]`. To allow the loop to execute one more time, we need to realize that the next value of `sosed` will be the next element in the `nodes[ind]` list.

Since `nodes[ind]` has at least 2 elements and the loop has already executed once, we can conclude that `sosed` will now need to represent the next element in the list. 

Therefore, if we assume the indexing starts at 0, the index `sosed` must be adjusted to point to the next element in the list. If the current index of `sosed` was `0` during the last iteration, we need to set it to `1` for the next iteration. If it was `1`, we should set it to `2`, and so on, but we know that `nodes[ind]` still contains at least 1 more element.

Thus, we can conclude that:

1. `nodes[ind]` remains unchanged, but we need to express that it still has at least 2 elements.
2. `sosed` needs to be incremented to point to the next element.

State: **`HM` is 51, `val` has been increased by 1, `nodes[ind]` is a list with at least 2 elements, `cur` is in a valid state, `sosed` is the next element in the list, and `queue` remains unchanged.**
