Output State: **If `nodes[ind]` is a list with at least one element, then `queue` will contain pairs `[sosed, val]` for each `sosed` in `nodes[ind]` where `res[sosed]` is 0, and `val` has been increased by the number of iterations of the loop. If `nodes[ind]` is empty, the loop does not execute, `queue` remains unchanged, `HM` is still 51, and `val` is increased by 1 only once.**
