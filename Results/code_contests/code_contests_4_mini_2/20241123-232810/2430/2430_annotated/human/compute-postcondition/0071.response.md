According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the `res` list and the value of `ind`. The loop iterates as long as `ind` is less than the length of `res`. At the end of the last iteration, `res` has at least 2 elements, `val` is the second element of `res`, and `ind` is 1. 

For the loop to be executed one more time, the length of `res` must be at least 3, and `ind` needs to be incremented to 2 to execute the next iteration.

State: **`queue` is empty, `res` is a list with at least 3 elements, `val` is the third element of `res`, `HM` is 51, `ind` is 2**
