According to the code, the loop will execute again if there is at least one more element in the list `nodes[ind]` beyond the second element. At the end of the last iteration, `nodes[ind]` has at least two elements, and `sosed` is the second element of the list. For the loop to execute one more time, `sosed` must be updated to the next element in the list, which would be the third element. Additionally, since `nodes[ind]` has at least three elements, it should be stated that the list must have at least three elements.

State: **`nodes[ind]` is a list with at least three elements, `sosed` is the third element of `nodes[ind]`**
