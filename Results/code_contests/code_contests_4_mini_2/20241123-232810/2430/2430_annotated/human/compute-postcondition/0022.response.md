According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `queue`. If `queue` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, if `nodes[ind]` is a list with at least one element, then `queue` must contain pairs for each `sosed` in `nodes[ind]` where `res[sosed]` is 0. Since the loop has executed at least once, `val` has been increased by the number of iterations of the loop. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `queue` must still contain elements. However, we do not have information about the contents of `queue` at the end of the last iteration. If `queue` is empty, the loop cannot execute. If `nodes[ind]` is still a list with at least one element, and `res[sosed]` is still 0 for at least one `sosed`, then we can ensure that `queue` can be populated again.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state to guarantee that `queue` contains pairs for at least one `sosed` in `nodes[ind]`. 

State: **`nodes[ind]` is a list with at least one element, `res[sosed]` is 0 for at least one `sosed`, and `queue` contains pairs `[sosed, val]` for each `sosed` in `nodes[ind]` where `res[sosed]` is 0**
