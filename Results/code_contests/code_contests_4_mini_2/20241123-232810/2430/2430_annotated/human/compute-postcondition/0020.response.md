According to the code, the loop iterates over the elements in `nodes[ind]`. For the loop to execute one more time, `nodes[ind]` must have at least 3 elements, as it currently has at least 2 elements at the end of the last iteration. Additionally, the variable `sosed` will need to be updated to reflect the next element in the list.

Since `val` has been increased by 1, it should not change for the next iteration. The other states, such as `HM`, `cur`, and `queue`, remain unchanged unless specified. 

Therefore, the conditions for the loop to execute one more time are:
- `nodes[ind]` needs to have at least 3 elements.
- `sosed` should reflect the next element in `nodes[ind]`, which would be the third element (if considering the current increment).

State: **`HM` is 51, `val` is increased by 1, `nodes[ind]` is a list with at least 3 elements, `cur` is in a valid state, `sosed` is the third element in the list, and `queue` remains unchanged unless `res[sosed]` is 0, in which case a new element [sosed, val] has been appended to `queue`.**
