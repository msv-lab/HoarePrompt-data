The `queue.append([sosed, val])` operation adds a new element, which is a list containing `sosed` and `val`, to the `queue`. The value of `val` has been increased by 1, but we don't know the exact value of `sosed`. The other variables `HM`, `nodes[ind]`, and `cur` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that a new element has been added to the queue.

Output State: **`HM` is 51, `val` has been increased by 1, `nodes[ind]` is a list with at least 2 elements, `cur` is in a valid state, and a new element [sosed, val] has been appended to `queue`.**
