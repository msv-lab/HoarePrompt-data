According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the contents of `nodes[ind]`. If `nodes[ind]` has at least two elements, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `nodes[ind]` is a list with at least one element, and `sosed` is the first element of that list. 

To determine the state at the beginning of the next iteration, we need to adjust `sosed` to the second element in `nodes[ind]` (if it exists) and ensure that the list `nodes[ind]` has at least two elements to allow the loop to continue.

Thus, for the loop to be executed one more time, `nodes[ind]` must have at least two elements, and `sosed` should be the second element in the list.

State: **`nodes[ind]` is a list with at least two elements, `sosed` is the second element of `nodes[ind]`**
