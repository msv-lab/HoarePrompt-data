Postcondition: ***`queue` is one element shorter; `cur` is the first element of the original `queue`; `val` is equal to `cur[1]`; `ind` is equal to `cur[0]`; `res[ind]` is assigned the value of `val`. If `val` is greater than `HM`, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, indicating that further processing is halted. If `val` is less than or equal to `HM`, the program continues execution without breaking.***
