According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the contents of `nodes[ind]`. The loop will execute for each element in `nodes[ind]`. At the end of the last iteration, `nodes[ind]` is a list with at least three elements, and `sosed` is currently the third element in that list.

For the loop to execute one more time, `sosed` needs to be updated to the next element in the list, which would be the fourth element. Therefore, `nodes[ind]` must have at least four elements for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`nodes[ind]` is a list with at least four elements, `sosed` is the fourth element of `nodes[ind]`**
