Output State: **`if queue is not empty, then for each element processed, res[ind]` is set to `val`, and `val` is incremented by 1. If any `val` exceeds `HM` (51), the loop will terminate early. If `nodes[ind]` is empty, the loop does not execute, `queue` remains unchanged, and `HM` stays 51. If `queue` is empty at the start, the loop does not execute, and the values of `res` and `val` remain unchanged, with `res` retaining its initial state (uninitialized).**
