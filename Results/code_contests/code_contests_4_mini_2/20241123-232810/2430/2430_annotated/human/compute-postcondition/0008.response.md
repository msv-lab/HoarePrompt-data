Postcondition: ***`HM` is 51, and if `val` is greater than 51, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `val` is less than or equal to 51, the program continues executing without interruption. The state of `n` remains unknown, and accessing `cur[1]` continues to lead to an error.***
