Postcondition: ***`queue` is one element longer, `cur` is the first element of the original `queue`, `val` is equal to `cur[1] + 1`, `ind` is equal to `cur[0]`, `nodes[ind]` is not empty, and if `res[sosed]` is equal to 0, then `[sosed, val]` is appended to `queue`. If `res[sosed]` is not equal to 0, the state of `queue` remains unchanged.***
