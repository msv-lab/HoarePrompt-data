According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the length of the `res` list and the variable `ind`. The loop will execute as long as `ind` is less than `len(res)`. At the end of the last iteration, `ind` is 0, and `res` is a list with at least 1 element. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `ind` needs to be incremented to 1, and `len(res)` must remain at least 2 to ensure that the loop condition (`ind < len(res)`) is satisfied.

State: **`queue` is empty, `res` is a list with at least 2 elements, `val` is the second element of `res`, `HM` is 51, `ind` is 1**
