Postcondition: ***If the maximum value in `res` exceeds `HM` (51), the function returns 'Impossible!'. Otherwise, for each element in `res`, if it is greater than 26, it is transformed to `2 * 26 - val`. The final output is a string created by joining the characters corresponding to the transformed values of `res`, with `HM` remaining 51, and `queue` and `val` remaining unchanged if it does not process any elements. If `res` is empty, the loop does not execute, leaving `res` unchanged and `val` uninitialized.***
