Postcondition: ***`HM` is 51, `val` has been increased by 1, `nodes[ind]` is a list with at least 2 elements, `cur` is in a valid state, `sosed` is the next element in the list, and `queue` remains unchanged unless `res[sosed]` is 0, in which case a new element [sosed, val] has been appended to `queue`. If `res[sosed]` is not 0, `queue` remains unchanged.***
