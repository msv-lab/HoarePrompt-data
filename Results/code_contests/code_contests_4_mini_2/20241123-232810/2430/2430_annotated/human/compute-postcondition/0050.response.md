According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `ind` and the structure `nodes`. The loop will execute as long as `nodes[ind]` contains at least one element. Before the loop starts, `queue` is one element shorter, which suggests that there is at least one element left in `queue`, and `cur` is set to the first element of the original `queue`. The variable `val` is set to `cur[1] + 1`, and `ind` is equal to `cur[0]`. 

To ensure the loop can execute, `nodes[ind]` must contain at least one element. Therefore, we need to confirm that `ind` is a valid index for `nodes`, and `nodes[ind]` is not empty. 

State: **`queue` is one element shorter, `cur` is the first element of the original `queue`, `val` is equal to `cur[1] + 1`, `ind` is equal to `cur[0]`, `nodes[ind]` is not empty**
