The code snippet appends a list containing `sosed` and `val` to the `queue`. The values of `sosed` and `val` are not affected by this operation. The state of `queue` is modified to include a new entry, but the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nodes[ind]` is a list with at least one element, `sosed` is the first element of `nodes[ind]`, the value of `res[sosed]` is equal to 0, and `queue` now includes the entry `[sosed, val]`.**
