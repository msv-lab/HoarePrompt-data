The value of `cur` is assigned the first element of `queue` by executing `queue.pop(0)`. Since `queue` contains pairs `[sosed, val]` for each `sosed` in `nodes[ind]` where `res[sosed]` is 0, `cur` will hold the first pair from `queue`. The values of `nodes[ind]`, `res`, and the remaining contents of `queue` are not affected by this operation, so they remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nodes[ind]` is a list with at least one element, `res[sosed]` is 0 for at least one `sosed`, `cur` is the first element of `queue`, and `queue` has been modified to remove its first element.**
