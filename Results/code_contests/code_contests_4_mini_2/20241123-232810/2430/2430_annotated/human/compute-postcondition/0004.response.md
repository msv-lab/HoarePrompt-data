The code attempts to access the first element of the variable `cur`, which is undefined. This will result in an error because `cur` does not hold any value or structure. Therefore, the values of `HM` and `n` remain unchanged, but the operation cannot complete successfully due to the error. 

Output State: **`HM` is 51, `n` is unknown, and accessing cur[1] leads to an error**
