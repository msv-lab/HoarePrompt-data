The variable `cur` is assigned the value of `queue.pop(0)`, which removes and returns the first element from the `queue`. Since `queue` is not empty, `cur` will hold that first element, and the state of `queue` will now be one element shorter. The specific value of `cur` depends on the first element of `queue`, which is not provided. Therefore, the output state reflects the changes made to the `queue` and the assignment to `cur`.

Output State: **`queue` is now one element shorter; `cur` is the first element of the original `queue`**
