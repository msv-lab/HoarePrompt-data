The value of `val` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `val` is unknown, and since `HM` is 51, whether the program breaks out of the loop or continues executing depends on the new value of `val`. However, the state of `n` remains unknown, and accessing `cur[1]` will still lead to an error. Therefore, the output state reflects that `val` is increased by 1, but its exact new value cannot be determined.

Output State: **`HM` is 51; `val` is increased by 1; state of `n` remains unknown; accessing `cur[1]` continues to lead to an error.**
