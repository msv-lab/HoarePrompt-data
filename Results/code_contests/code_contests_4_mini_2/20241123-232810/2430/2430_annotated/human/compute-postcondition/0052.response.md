The code appends a new element `[sosed, val]` to the `queue`. The previous state indicates that `queue` is one element shorter, so after this operation, the number of elements in `queue` increases by one. The values of `sosed` and `val` are used directly in the new element being added. The other variables' states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`queue` is one element longer, `cur` is the first element of the original `queue`, `val` is equal to `cur[1] + 1`, `ind` is equal to `cur[0]`, `nodes[ind]` is not empty, and `res[sosed]` is equal to 0.**
