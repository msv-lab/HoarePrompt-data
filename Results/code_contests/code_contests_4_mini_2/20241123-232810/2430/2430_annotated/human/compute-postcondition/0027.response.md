The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop of the if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `nodes[ind]` is a list with at least one element, `res[sosed]` is 0 for at least one `sosed`, `cur` is the first element of `queue`, `queue` has been modified to remove its first element, `val` is assigned the second element of `cur`, `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`, and `res[ind]` is assigned the value of `val`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
