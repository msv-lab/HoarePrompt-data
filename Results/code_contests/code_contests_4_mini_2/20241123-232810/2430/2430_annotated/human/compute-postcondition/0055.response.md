The `queue` is modified by appending a new element `[sosed, val]`. The current state indicates that `cur` is the first element of the original `queue`, `val` is `cur[1] + 1`, and `ind` is `cur[0]`. Since `nodes[ind]` is not empty and `sosed` is defined as the next element in `nodes[ind]`, we can conclude that the new element being added to `queue` is valid based on the previous states of the variables. Therefore, the output state reflects the new length of `queue` and the new element that has been appended.

Output State: **`queue` is one element longer, `cur` is the first element of the original `queue`, `val` is equal to `cur[1] + 1`, `ind` is equal to `cur[0]`, `nodes[ind]` is not empty, `sosed` is the next element in `nodes[ind]`, and the new element `[sosed, val]` is appended to `queue`.**
