According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `nodes[ind]` list. The loop will execute for each element in `nodes[ind]`. At the end of the last iteration, `cur` is the first element of the original `queue`, and `ind` is equal to `cur[0]`. Since `nodes[ind]` is not empty, there are still elements left to iterate over.

To determine the state for the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust the variables accordingly. If the loop has executed for a certain number of elements in `nodes[ind]`, we need to ensure that `sosed` reflects the next element in the list for the next iteration.

Assuming that the loop has not iterated through all elements in `nodes[ind]`, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `sosed` is now pointing to the next element in `nodes[ind]`.

Therefore, we need to ensure that `sosed` is the next element in the `nodes[ind]` list for the loop to continue, and we do not need to modify the values of `queue`, `cur`, or `val` since they are not directly related to the continuation of the loop.

State: **`queue` is one element longer, `cur` is the first element of the original `queue`, `val` is equal to `cur[1] + 1`, `ind` is equal to `cur[0]`, `nodes[ind]` is not empty, sosed is the next element in `nodes[ind]`**
