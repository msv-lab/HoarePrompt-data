The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `queue`, `n`, and `nodes`. The parameter `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\). The function processes these parameters and produces an output based on specific conditions. If the maximum value in the list `res` exceeds 51, the function returns the string 'Impossible!'. Otherwise, for each element in `res`, if an element is greater than 26, it is transformed according to the formula \(2 \times 26 - val\). The final output is a string formed by joining the characters that correspond to the transformed values in `res`. Importantly, the parameters `HM`, `queue`, and `val` remain unchanged if no elements are processed. If `res` is empty, no transformations occur, leaving `res` unchanged and `val` uninitialized.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `queue`, `n`, and `nodes`, and returns 'Impossible!' if the maximum value in `res` exceeds 51; otherwise, it returns a string created by joining characters corresponding to transformed values from `res`.**
