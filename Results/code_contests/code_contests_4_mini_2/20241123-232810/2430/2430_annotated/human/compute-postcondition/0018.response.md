The code `queue.append([sosed, val])` adds a new element, which is a list containing `sosed` and `val`, to the end of the `queue`. The value of `val` has been previously increased by 1, but the specific value of `sosed` is not provided. The other variables, `HM`, `nodes[ind]`, and `cur`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged values of these variables and indicates that a new element has been appended to the `queue`.

Output State: **`HM` is 51, `val` is increased by 1, `nodes[ind]` is a list with at least 2 elements, `cur` is in a valid state, `sosed` is the next element in the list, and a new element [sosed, val] has been appended to `queue`.**
