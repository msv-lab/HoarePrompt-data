The code attempts to access the second element of the `cur` variable, which is not initialized due to the undefined `queue`. Therefore, the program cannot retrieve a value from `cur`, and the state of the other variables remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`HM` is 51, `n` is unknown, and `cur` is undefined, leading to an error accessing cur[1]**
