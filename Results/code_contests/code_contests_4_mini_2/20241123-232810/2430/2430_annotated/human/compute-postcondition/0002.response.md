The `cur` variable is assigned the value of the first element popped from the `queue`. However, since `queue` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine what value `cur` will have. The state of `HM` remains unchanged, and the value of `n` is still unknown. Therefore, the output state reflects the uncertainty regarding the `cur` variable due to the absence of the `queue`.

Output State: **`HM` is 51, `n` is unknown, and `cur` cannot be initialized due to an undefined `queue`**
