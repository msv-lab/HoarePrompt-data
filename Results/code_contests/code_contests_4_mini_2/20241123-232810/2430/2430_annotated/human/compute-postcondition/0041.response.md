Output State: **If `nodes[ind]` is a list with at least one element, the loop will iterate over each element `sosed` in `nodes[ind]`. For each `sosed`, if `res[sosed]` is equal to 0, then `queue` will include the entry `[sosed, val]`. If `res[sosed]` is not equal to 0, the state of `queue` remains unchanged. If `nodes[ind]` is empty, the loop will not execute, and `queue` will remain unchanged. After the loop, `nodes[ind]` will still be a list, and `res` will retain its values for each `sosed` checked.`**
