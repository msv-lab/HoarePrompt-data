According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nodes[ind]`. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements in `nodes[ind]` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, if `res[sosed]` is 0, `queue` has one additional element, and `ind` has been incremented. If `res[sosed]` is not 0, the state remains unchanged.

To execute one more time, we need to ensure that there are still elements in `nodes[ind]` to iterate over. The state of `ind` should reflect the current index of `nodes`, and `sosed` should be the next element in `nodes[ind]` that has not yet been processed.

Assuming `ind` has been incremented by 1, we need to check the state of `nodes[ind]`. If `nodes[ind]` still contains valid elements, we can proceed with that. If it does not, we would need to adjust `ind` again or check a previous state.

Since we don't have information on the exact number of elements in `nodes[ind]` or its prior state, we can only conclude that `ind` must be set to a value that allows for the next valid element in `nodes[ind]` to be `sosed`.

State: **`queue` has one additional element if `res[sosed]` is 0, `ind` is incremented to a valid state, and `sosed` is the next element in `nodes[ind]`**.
