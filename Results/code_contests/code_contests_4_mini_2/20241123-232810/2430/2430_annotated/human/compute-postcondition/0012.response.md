The code appends a list containing `sosed` and `val` to the `queue`. The previous state indicates that `val` has been increased by 1, but the specific value of `sosed` is not provided. Other variables such as `HM`, `nodes[ind]`, `cur`, and `res[sosed]` are not affected by this operation. Thus, the output state reflects the change made to the `queue`.

Output State: **`HM` is 51, `val` is increased by 1, `nodes[ind]` is a list with at least 1 element, `cur` is in a valid state, `res[sosed]` is 0, and `queue` now includes [sosed, val].**
