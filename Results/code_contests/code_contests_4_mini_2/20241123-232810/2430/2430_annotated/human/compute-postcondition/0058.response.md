The code `queue.append([sosed, val])` appends a new element, which is a list containing `sosed` and `val`, to the `queue`. The `queue` was previously one element longer, meaning it had at least one element before executing this code. The variable `ind` is incremented, indicating that it has been increased by 1, but this does not directly affect the `queue`. Since `nodes[ind]` has valid elements, it implies that `sosed` and `val` are likely valid as well. The output state will reflect the modified `queue` and the state of `ind`.

Output State: **`queue` has one additional element (now containing the previous elements plus [sosed, val]), `ind` is incremented, and `nodes[ind]` has valid elements**
