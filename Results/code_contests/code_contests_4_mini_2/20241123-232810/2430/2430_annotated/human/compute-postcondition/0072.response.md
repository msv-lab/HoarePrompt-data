The value of `val` is assigned the value of `res[ind]`. Given that `ind` is 2, `val` will take the value of the third element of `res`. Other variables, such as `queue`, `HM`, and `ind`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `queue` is empty, `res` is a list with at least 3 elements, `val` is the third element of `res`, `HM` is 51, `ind` is 2.

Output State: **`queue` is empty, `res` is a list with at least 3 elements, `val` is the third element of `res`, `HM` is 51, `ind` is 2**
