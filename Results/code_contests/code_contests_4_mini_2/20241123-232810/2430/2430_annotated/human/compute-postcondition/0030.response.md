According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `nodes[ind]`. For the loop to execute, `nodes[ind]` must contain at least one element, which is already stated in the current state. The variable `sosed` will take on each element in `nodes[ind]` during the iterations.

Since `nodes[ind]` is confirmed to have at least one element, we can proceed to determine the initial values of `sosed`. At the start of the loop, `sosed` will be set to the first element of `nodes[ind]`.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are as follows:

- `nodes[ind]` is a list with at least one element (this is already satisfied).
- `sosed` must be the first element of `nodes[ind]`.

State: **`nodes[ind]` is a list with at least one element, `sosed` is the first element of `nodes[ind]`**
