The variable `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`, where `cur` is the first element of the original `queue`. The state of the other variables, `queue` and `val`, remains unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `queue` is now one element shorter; `cur` is the first element of the original `queue`; `val` is equal to `cur[1]`, and `ind` is equal to `cur[0]`.

Output State: **`queue` is now one element shorter; `cur` is the first element of the original `queue`; `val` is equal to `cur[1]`; `ind` is equal to `cur[0]**
