Postcondition: ***`res` contains at least one value greater than `HM`, indicating that the loop has encountered a value in `res` that exceeds the threshold, while `queue` may still contain elements that have not yet been processed. The state of `res` remains updated at indices corresponding to previously popped elements, and `val` has not exceeded `HM` for all iterations prior to this condition being met.***
