The variable `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`. The previous state of `cur` indicates that it is a tuple or list, and `ind` is now set to the first element of that structure. The other variables remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `ind` based on the value of `cur[0]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res` is a list of length `n`, `cur` is updated to the first element of the queue after popping, `val` is `cur[1]`, `ind` is `cur[0]`, `nodes[ind]` is not empty, and there exists at least one `sosed` such that `res[sosed] == 0; `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]**
