The value of `val` is incremented by 1. Since `val` is updated from `cur[1]`, which is not explicitly stated but is assumed to be 51 or less in this context, this means `val` will now become 52 if it was initially 51. The condition checks if `val` exceeds `HM` (which is 51). Given that `val` is now 52, the program will break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `HM` is 51; `res` is a list of length `n`; `cur` is updated to the first element of the queue after popping; `ind` is `cur[0]`; `queue` contains at least one element; `val` is 52, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
