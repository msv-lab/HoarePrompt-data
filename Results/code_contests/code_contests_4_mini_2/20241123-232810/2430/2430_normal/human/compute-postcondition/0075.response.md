Postcondition: ***If the maximum value in `res` exceeds `HM`, the function returns 'Impossible!'. Otherwise, after the loop, `res` may contain modified values where each element greater than 26 is transformed into `2 * 26 - val`, while elements less than or equal to 26 remain unchanged. If the loop does not execute (either because `res` is empty or all values are less than or equal to 26), `res` remains unchanged. Therefore, the final state of `res` reflects the transformations applied to elements greater than 26 or remains as the original values if no modifications were made.***
