The code appends the list `[sosed, val]` to the `queue`. The `queue` is affected by this operation, with the new element being added. The values of other variables are not directly changed by this operation, but they are part of the context.

The initial state indicates that `cur` has been updated to the first element of the queue after popping, and `val` has been incremented by 1. The variable `ind` is set to `cur[0]`, which means it is referencing an index in the `nodes` structure where `nodes[ind]` has at least `m + 1` neighbors. The variable `sosed` is the next neighbor in `nodes[ind]` after the current one.

Since we do not know the previous state of the `queue`, we can only state that it has now been modified to include the new element.

Output State: **`queue` is updated to include the element `[sosed, val]`**
