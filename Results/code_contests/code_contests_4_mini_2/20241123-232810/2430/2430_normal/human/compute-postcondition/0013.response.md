Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res` is a list of length `n` with one index updated to `val`, `cur` is assigned the value of the first element of the queue after popping it, `val` is `cur[1] + 1`, `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`, and `nodes[ind]` is a non-empty list. If the element at index `sosed` in the `res` list is equal to 0, the queue now contains the appended element `[sosed, val]`. If `res[sosed]` is not equal to 0, the queue remains unchanged.***
