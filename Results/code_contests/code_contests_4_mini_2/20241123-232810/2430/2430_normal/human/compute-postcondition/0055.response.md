The code appends a new list containing `sosed` and `val` to the `queue`. The values of `sosed` and `val` are known, where `val` is 52, and `sosed` is the second element of `nodes[ind]`. The state of the other variables is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res` is a list of length `n`, `cur` is updated to the first element of the queue after popping, `ind` is `cur[0]`, `queue` now contains an additional element `[sosed, 52]`, `val` is 52, `nodes[ind]` contains at least 2 elements, and `sosed` is the second element of `nodes[ind]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res` is a list of length `n`, `cur` is updated to the first element of the queue after popping, `ind` is `cur[0]`, `queue` now contains an additional element `[sosed, 52]`, `val` is 52, `nodes[ind]` contains at least 2 elements, and `sosed` is the second element of `nodes[ind]`.**
