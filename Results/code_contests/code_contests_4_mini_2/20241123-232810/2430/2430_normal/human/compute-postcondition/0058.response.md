The code appends a new list `[sosed, val]` to the `queue`. The value of `sosed` is a unique element from `nodes[ind]` that hasn't been processed yet, and `val` is 52. This operation modifies the `queue` by adding a new element but does not affect the other variables. Therefore, the output state is `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res` is a list of length `n`, `cur` is updated to the first element of the queue after popping, `ind` is `cur[0]`, `queue` now has one more element `[sosed, 52]`, `val` is 52, `nodes[ind]` contains at least 3 elements, and `sosed` is the next unique element in `nodes[ind]` that hasn't been processed yet.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res` is a list of length `n`, `cur` is updated to the first element of the queue after popping, `ind` is `cur[0]`, `queue` now has one more element `[sosed, 52]`, `val` is 52, `nodes[ind]` contains at least 3 elements, and `sosed` is the next unique element in `nodes[ind]` that hasn't been processed yet.**
