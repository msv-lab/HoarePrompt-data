Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res` is a list of length `n`, `cur` is updated to the first element of the queue after popping, `val` is incremented by 1, `ind` is `cur[0]`, `nodes[ind]` is not empty, there exists at least one `sosed` such that `res[sosed]` is equal to 0, and the value of `res[sosed]` is 0.***
