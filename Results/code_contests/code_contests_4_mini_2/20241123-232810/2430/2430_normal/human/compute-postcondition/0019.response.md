Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res` is a list of length `n`, `cur` is the first element of the queue after popping, `val` is `cur[1] + 1`, `ind` is `cur[0]`, and `nodes[ind]` contains at least one more element. If `res[sosed]` is 0, a new element `[sosed, val]` is appended to the `queue`, indicating that `sosed` was not previously processed. If `res[sosed]` is not 0, no changes are made to the `queue`.***
