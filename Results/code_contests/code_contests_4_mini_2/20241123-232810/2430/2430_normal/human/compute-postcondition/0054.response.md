According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `nodes[ind]` variable. The loop will execute for each element in `nodes[ind]`. At the end of the last iteration, `ind` is pointing to an index with `nodes[ind]` containing at least 1 element. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `nodes[ind]` must have at least 2 elements, thus allowing `sosed` to take on another value. Additionally, since `sosed` is updated to the first element of `nodes[ind]`, it should be adjusted to take on the next element in the list, which would mean that after the current iteration, we need to have `sosed` as the second element of `nodes[ind]`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res` is a list of length `n`, `cur` is updated to the first element of the queue after popping, `ind` is `cur[0]`, `queue` contains at least one element, `val` is 52, `nodes[ind]` contains at least 2 elements, and `sosed` is the second element of `nodes[ind]`.**
