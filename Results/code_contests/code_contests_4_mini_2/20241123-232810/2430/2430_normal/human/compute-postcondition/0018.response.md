The code appends a new list `[sosed, val]` to the `queue`. The variable `sosed` is the next element in the list, and `val` is calculated as `cur[1] + 1`, where `cur` is the first element of the queue after popping. The values of `n`, `HM`, `res`, `cur`, and `ind` remain unchanged in this operation. 

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res` is a list of length `n`, `cur` is the first element of the queue after popping, `val` is `cur[1] + 1`, `ind` is `cur[0]`, `nodes[ind]` has at least one more element, `sosed` is the next element in the list, and a new element `[sosed, val]` is appended to the `queue`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res` is a list of length `n`, `cur` is the first element of the queue after popping, `val` is `cur[1] + 1`, `ind` is `cur[0]`, `nodes[ind]` has at least one more element, `sosed` is the next element in the list, and a new element `[sosed, val]` is appended to the `queue`.**
