The code appends a new list containing `sosed` and `val` to the `queue`. The variables affected in this operation are `queue`, `sosed`, and `val`. The values of `sosed` and `val` are defined in the initial state, and since `val` is 52, the list appended to `queue` will be `[sosed, 52]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res` is a list of length `n`, `cur` is updated to the first element of the queue after popping, `ind` is `cur[0]`, `queue` contains at least one element and now contains the new element [sosed, 52], `val` is 52, `nodes[ind]` contains at least 1 element, `sosed` is the first element of `nodes[ind]`, and the value of `res[sosed]` is 0.**
