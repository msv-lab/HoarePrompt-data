According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nodes` data structure, specifically the entry at index `ind`. For the loop to execute, `nodes[ind]` must contain at least one element; otherwise, the loop will not run. 

Given that `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`, we need to ensure that `ind` is a valid index and that `nodes[ind]` is not empty. Since `n` is between 2 and 100,000, we also assume `ind` is within this range.

Thus, for the loop to be executed, it should be ensured that `ind` is a valid index and `nodes[ind]` contains at least one element. Therefore, we can state the necessary conditions:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res` is a list of length `n` with one index updated to `val`, `cur` is assigned the value of the first element of the queue after popping it, `val` is `cur[1] + 1`, `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`, `nodes[ind]` is a non-empty list**
