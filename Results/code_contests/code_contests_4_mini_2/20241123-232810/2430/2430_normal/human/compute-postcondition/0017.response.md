According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nodes[ind]` list. If this list has at least one more element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ind` is the index of the current node, and `nodes[ind]` is a non-empty list with at least one more element. This means that there are additional elements in `nodes[ind]` that can be iterated over.

The loop iterates over `nodes[ind]`, and since `nodes[ind]` has at least one more element, if the loop has executed once, `sosed` will be assigned the first element of `nodes[ind]` in the next iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `sosed` must be assigned the next element in the list.

Since `nodes[ind]` contains at least one more element, we need to ensure that the state reflects that the next `sosed` is the next element in the `nodes[ind]` list. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to indicate that `sosed` is the next element in the list.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res` is a list of length `n`, `cur` is the first element of the queue after popping, `val` is `cur[1] + 1`, `ind` is `cur[0]`, and `nodes[ind]` has at least one more element, sosed is the next element in the list**
