Output State: **After the loop executes, `res` may contain modified values where each value greater than 26 is transformed according to the rule `res[ind] = 2 * 26 - val`. If the queue (or the collection that determines the length of `res`) is empty, the loop does not execute, and `res` remains unchanged. If all values in `res` are less than or equal to 26, the loop also does not execute, resulting in `res` remaining unchanged. Therefore, if the loop executes, `res` contains the modified values of the original elements, and if the loop does not execute, `res` remains as it was initially.**
