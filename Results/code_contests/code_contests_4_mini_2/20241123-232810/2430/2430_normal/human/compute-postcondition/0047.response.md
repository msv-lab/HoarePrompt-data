The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `HM` is 51; `res` is a list of length `n`; `cur` is updated to the first element of the queue after popping; `val` is updated to `cur[1]`; `ind` is `cur[0]`, and `queue` contains at least one element; `res[ind]` is assigned the value of `val`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
