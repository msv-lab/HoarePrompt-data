According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `res` and the value of `ind`. The loop will execute again if `ind` is less than the length of `res`. At the end of the last iteration, `ind` is 0, and `res` contains at least 1 element, meaning its length is at least 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `ind` needs to be incremented to 1, and `val` must be updated to the element at index 1 of `res`. Also, since `res` must still contain elements, it needs to have at least 2 elements.

State: **`res` contains at least 2 elements, `ind` is 1, `val` is the element at index 1 of `res`**
