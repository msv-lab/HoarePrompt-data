The code appends a new list `[sosed, val]` to the queue. The variable `sosed` represents the next neighbor in `nodes[ind]`, and `val` has been incremented by 1. The values of `n`, `HM`, `res`, `cur`, and `ind` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is that the queue has been updated with the new element.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res` is a list of length `n`, `cur` is updated to the first element of the queue after popping, `val` is incremented by 1, `ind` is `cur[0]`, `nodes[ind]` has at least `m + 1` neighbors, `sosed` is the next neighbor in `nodes[ind]`, and the queue is updated with `[sosed, val]`.**
