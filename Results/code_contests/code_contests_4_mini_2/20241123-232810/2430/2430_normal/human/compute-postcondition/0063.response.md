Output State: **`if the queue is not empty, the loop iterates while elements are present; `res` will have updated values at indices corresponding to the popped elements until `val` exceeds `HM`, at which point the loop terminates. If `nodes[ind]` has neighbors, `queue` will include `[sosed, val]` for each neighbor with `res[sosed] == 0`. If the queue is empty before the loop starts, `res` remains unchanged, and `queue` is empty. If `res` contains values greater than 0 for all neighbors of any current node, the queue does not change; if `val` never exceeds `HM`, the loop continues until `queue` becomes empty.**
