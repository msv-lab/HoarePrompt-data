According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `res`. If `res` is empty, the loop will not execute. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `res` must contain at least one element, and `ind` should start at 0 to reference the first element in `res`.

State: **`res` contains at least 1 element, `ind` is 0**
