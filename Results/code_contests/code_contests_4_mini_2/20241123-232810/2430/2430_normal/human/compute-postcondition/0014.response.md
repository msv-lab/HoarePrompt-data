According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nodes[ind]` list. If this list has at least one more element than it did in the previous iteration, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ind` has been assigned a value, and `nodes[ind]` is a non-empty list. Since `sosed` is being iterated over the elements of `nodes[ind]`, we need to ensure that there is at least one more element available for the loop to execute once more.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust the state to indicate that there is at least one more element in `nodes[ind]`. Therefore, the state of `sosed` must be updated to reflect the next index in the `nodes[ind]` list.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res` is a list of length `n` with one index updated to `val`, `cur` is assigned the value of the first element of the queue after popping it, `val` is `cur[1] + 1`, `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`, and `nodes[ind]` is a non-empty list containing at least one more element, `sosed` is the next element in `nodes[ind]`**.
