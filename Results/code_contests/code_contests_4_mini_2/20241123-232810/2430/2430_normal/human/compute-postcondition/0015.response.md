The code appends a list containing `sosed` and `val` to the `queue`. The values of `sosed` and `val` are determined from the initial state, where `val` is calculated as `cur[1] + 1` and `sosed` is the next element in `nodes[ind]`. The states of other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res` is a list of length `n` with one index updated to `val`, `cur` is assigned the value of the first element of the queue after popping it, `val` is `cur[1] + 1`, `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`, `nodes[ind]` is a non-empty list containing at least one more element, and `sosed` is the next element in `nodes[ind]`. The `queue` now includes the appended list `[sosed, val]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res` is a list of length `n` with one index updated to `val`, `cur` is assigned the value of the first element of the queue after popping it, `val` is `cur[1] + 1`, `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`, `nodes[ind]` is a non-empty list containing at least one more element, `sosed` is the next element in `nodes[ind]`, and the `queue` now includes `[sosed, val]`.**
