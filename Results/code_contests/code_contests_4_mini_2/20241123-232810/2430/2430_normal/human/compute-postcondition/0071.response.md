According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `ind` relative to the length of `res`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `ind` is less than the length of `res`. At the end of the last iteration, `ind` is 1, and `res` contains at least 2 elements, meaning its length is at least 2.

For the loop to execute one more time, `ind` must be adjusted to 2, and `val` must be updated to reflect the element at index 2 of `res`, which requires that `res` contains at least 3 elements.

State: **`res` contains at least 3 elements, `ind` is 2, `val` is the element at index 2 of `res`**
