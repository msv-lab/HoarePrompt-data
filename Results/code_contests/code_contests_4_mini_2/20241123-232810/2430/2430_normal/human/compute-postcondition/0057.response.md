According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nodes[ind]` list. For the loop to execute one more time, `nodes[ind]` must have at least one more element that hasn't already been processed in the previous iteration. 

At the end of the last iteration, `ind` is `cur[0]`, and `nodes[ind]` contains at least 2 elements. If `sosed` has taken the value of one of those elements in the last iteration, then for the loop to execute again, `nodes[ind]` must have at least one more element that hasn't been processed yet. Therefore, we need to ensure that `nodes[ind]` contains at least 3 elements.

Additionally, since `sosed` is an element in `nodes[ind]`, we need to adjust `sosed` to reflect the next element in the `nodes[ind]` list that has not been processed yet. If `nodes[ind]` initially had 2 elements and `sosed` was one of them, this means we need to adjust `nodes[ind]` to have at least 3 elements.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res` is a list of length `n`, `cur` is updated to the first element of the queue after popping, `ind` is `cur[0]`, `queue` contains at least one element, `val` is 52, `nodes[ind]` contains at least 3 elements, and `sosed` is the next unique element in `nodes[ind]` that hasn't been processed yet.**
