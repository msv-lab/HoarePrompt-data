Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res` is a list of length `n`, `cur` is updated to the first element of the queue after popping, `ind` is `cur[0]`, `queue` contains at least one element, and `val` is 52. After the loop executes, if `nodes[ind]` contains at least one element and `res[sosed]` is 0 for at least one `sosed`, the queue is updated to include new elements `[sosed, 52]` for each such `sosed`. If `res[sosed]` is not 0 for all elements in `nodes[ind]`, the queue remains unchanged. If `nodes[ind]` is empty, the loop does not execute and the queue remains unchanged, with `cur`, `ind`, and the rest of the variables retaining their previous values.**
