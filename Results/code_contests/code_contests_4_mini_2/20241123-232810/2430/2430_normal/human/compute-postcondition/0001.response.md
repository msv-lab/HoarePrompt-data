`res` is assigned a list of length `n`, initialized with zeros. Since `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `res` will be a list with `n` elements, all set to 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `HM` is 51; `res` is a list of length `n` initialized with zeros.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `HM` is 51; `res` is a list of length `n` initialized with zeros**
