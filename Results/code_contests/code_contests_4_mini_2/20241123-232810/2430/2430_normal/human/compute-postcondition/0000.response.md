The variable `HM` is assigned the value of `2 * 26 - 1`. The calculation is as follows:

1. Calculate `2 * 26`, which equals `52`.
2. Subtract `1` from `52`, resulting in `51`.

No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `HM` is 51.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `HM` is 51**
