According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `queue`. If `queue` is non-empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the state indicates that there exists at least one `sosed` such that `res[sosed]` is equal to 0, which means that the `queue` may have had additional elements added to it during the iteration. However, we need to ensure that after the last iteration, the `queue` is not empty for the loop to execute again.

Since `nodes[ind]` is mentioned, if it is empty, then `queue` would not have had any additional elements added during the last iteration, and thus it could potentially be empty now. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to adjust the state of `queue` to indicate that it contains at least one element.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res` is a list of length `n`, `cur` is updated to the first element of the queue after popping, `val` is incremented by 1, and `ind` is `cur[0]`, and `queue` contains at least one element**
