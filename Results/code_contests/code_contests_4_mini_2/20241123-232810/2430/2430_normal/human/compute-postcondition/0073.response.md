According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `ind` and the length of `res`. The loop continues as long as `ind` is less than the length of `res`. At the end of the last iteration, `ind` is 2 and `res` contains at least 3 elements. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `ind` must be incremented to 3, and since `res` contains at least 3 elements, the length of `res` must be at least 4 for the loop to continue executing. 

Thus, the states need to be adjusted to reflect that `ind` is now 3 and that `res` must contain at least 4 elements.

State: **`res` contains at least 4 elements, `ind` is 3, `val` is the element at index 3 of `res`**
