Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res` is a list of length `n`, `cur` is the first element of the queue after popping, `val` is `cur[1] + 1`, `ind` is `cur[0]`, and `nodes[ind]` is a non-empty list with at least one more element. If `res[sosed]` is 0, the `queue` now includes `[sosed, val]`. If `res[sosed]` is not 0, the state of the `queue` remains unchanged.***
