The variable `val` is assigned the value of the element at index `ind` from the list `res`. Since `ind` is 2, `val` will hold the value of `res[2]`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains at least 3 elements, `ind` is 2, and `val` is the element at index 2 of `res`.

Output State: **`res` contains at least 3 elements, `ind` is 2, and `val` is the element at index 2 of `res`**
