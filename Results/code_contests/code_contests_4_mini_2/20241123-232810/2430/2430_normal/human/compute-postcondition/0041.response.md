Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res` is a list of length `n`, `cur` is updated to the first element of the queue after popping, `val` is incremented by 1, and `ind` is `cur[0]`. If there exists at least one `sosed` such that `res[sosed]` is equal to 0, `queue` will have additional elements `[sosed, val]` for each such `sosed`. If all `sosed` have `res[sosed]` not equal to 0, the `queue` remains unchanged. If `nodes[ind]` is empty, the loop will not execute, and the state of `queue`, `res`, and other variables remains the same.**
