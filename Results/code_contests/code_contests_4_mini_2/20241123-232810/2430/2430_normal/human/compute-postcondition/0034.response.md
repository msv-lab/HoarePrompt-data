According to the code, the loop will execute for each element in `nodes[ind]`. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `ind` is equal to `cur[0]`, meaning that the loop will iterate over the neighbors (or "sosed") of the current node represented by `ind`. 

To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to consider the state of `nodes[ind]`. The loop will execute again if `nodes[ind]` has at least one more element than it did in the previous iteration. Since `sosed` represents an element in `nodes[ind]`, we need to ensure that `nodes[ind]` has at least one more neighbor than the last iteration.

Since the current loop iteration processes each `sosed` in `nodes[ind]`, we can assume that in the previous iteration, the loop processed the first `len(nodes[ind])` neighbors. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, we need to ensure that `nodes[ind]` still has unprocessed neighbors.

If `nodes[ind]` had `m` neighbors at the end of the last iteration, we need to adjust the state to reflect that the index of the neighbor being processed is now `m` (if `m` was the last index processed). Furthermore, `sosed` will need to represent the next neighbor in the list.

Thus, the adjusted states would be:
- `nodes[ind]` must still contain neighbors (at least `m + 1`).
- `sosed` must now represent the next neighbor (which would be the `m`-th neighbor).

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res` is a list of length `n`, `cur` is updated to the first element of the queue after popping, `val` is incremented by 1, `ind` is `cur[0]`, `nodes[ind]` has at least `m + 1` neighbors, `sosed` is the next neighbor in `nodes[ind]`.**
