The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res` is a list of length `n`, `cur` is updated to the first element of the queue after popping, `val` is `cur[1]`, `ind` is `cur[0]`, `nodes[ind]` is not empty, there exists at least one `sosed` such that `res[sosed] == 0; `res[ind]` is assigned the value of `val`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
