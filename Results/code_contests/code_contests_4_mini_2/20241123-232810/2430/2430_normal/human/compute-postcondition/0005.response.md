The value of `res[ind]` is assigned the value of `val`. Since `cur` has been assigned from the queue, `cur[0]` gives the index `ind` and `cur[1]` gives the value `val`. The previous state of `res` is a list of zeros of length `n`, and now the value at index `ind` in `res` will be updated to `val`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `HM` is 51; `res` is a list of length `n` with one index updated to `val`; `cur` is assigned the value of the first element of the queue after popping it; `val` is assigned the value of `cur[1]`; `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]**.
