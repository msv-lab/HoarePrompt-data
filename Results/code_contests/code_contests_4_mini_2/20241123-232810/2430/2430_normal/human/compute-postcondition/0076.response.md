The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `queue`, `n`, and `nodes`. 

- `queue` is a data structure that holds elements (its specific type is not defined here).
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `nodes` is a collection representing the tree structure with \(n - 1\) pairs of integers (a, b) where \(1 \leq a, b \leq n\) and \(a \neq b\).

After executing the function body, if the maximum value in `res` exceeds `HM`, the function returns the string 'Impossible!'. Otherwise, `res` may contain modified values where each element greater than 26 is transformed into \(2 \times 26 - val\), while elements less than or equal to 26 remain unchanged. If the loop does not execute (either because `res` is empty or all values are less than or equal to 26), `res` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a data structure `queue`, an integer `n`, and a collection of tree edges `nodes`, and return 'Impossible!' if the maximum value in `res` exceeds `HM`, or return the modified `res`, reflecting transformations on elements greater than 26, or the original `res` if no modifications were made. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `queue`, an integer `n`, and a collection `nodes`, and returns 'Impossible!' if the maximum value in `res` exceeds `HM`. Otherwise, it returns the modified `res` with values greater than 26 transformed, or the original `res` if no modifications were made.**
