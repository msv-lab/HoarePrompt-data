Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `HM` is 51; `res` is a list of length `n`; `cur` is updated to the first element of the queue after popping; `val` is updated to `cur[1]`; `ind` is `cur[0]`, and `queue` contains at least one element; `res[ind]` is assigned the value of `val`. If `val` is greater than `HM`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise the execution continues without breaking. This means that if `val` exceeds 51, the loop is exited, while if `val` is 51 or less, the program continues to process the remaining elements in the queue.***
