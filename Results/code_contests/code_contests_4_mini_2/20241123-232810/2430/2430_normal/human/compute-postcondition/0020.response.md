To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the loop's structure and the current state.

1. The loop iterates over `nodes[ind]`, which means that for the loop to execute again, `nodes[ind]` must contain additional elements that have not been processed yet.
2. The state indicates that `nodes[ind]` already contains at least one more element, which implies that there are unprocessed nodes available for iteration.
3. As `sosed` will take on each value from `nodes[ind]`, we need to ensure that when the loop starts again, `sosed` should take on the next value from `nodes[ind]` that has not yet been processed.

Since `sosed` is taken from `nodes[ind]`, it will be the next element in the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, we need to adjust `sosed` to reflect the next element in `nodes[ind]`, and it must be ensured that the length or contents of `nodes[ind]` is sufficient to allow another iteration.

Given that we have no specific information about the contents or length of `nodes[ind]`, we can only state that `sosed` should be adjusted to the next element, and we need to ensure that `nodes[ind]` remains in a state that allows this.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res` is a list of length `n`, `cur` is the first element of the queue after popping, `val` is `cur[1] + 1`, `ind` is `cur[0]`, and `sosed` is the next element in `nodes[ind]` that has not yet been processed, with `nodes[ind]` containing at least one more unprocessed element.**
