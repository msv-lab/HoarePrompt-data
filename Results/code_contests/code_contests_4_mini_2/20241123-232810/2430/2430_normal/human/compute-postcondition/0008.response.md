Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `HM` is 51; `res` is a list of length `n` with one index updated to `val`; `cur` is assigned the value of the first element of the queue after popping it; `val` is an integer assigned the value of `cur[1]`, and `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`. If `val` is greater than 51, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, the program continues execution without breaking.***
