Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res` is a list of length `n`, `cur` is updated to the first element of the queue after popping, `ind` is `cur[0]`, `queue` contains at least one element. If `res[sosed]` is 0, then the queue is updated to include the new element `[sosed, 52]`. If `res[sosed]` is not 0, the queue remains unchanged. Additionally, `val` is 52, `nodes[ind]` contains at least 1 element, and `sosed` is the first element of `nodes[ind]`.***
