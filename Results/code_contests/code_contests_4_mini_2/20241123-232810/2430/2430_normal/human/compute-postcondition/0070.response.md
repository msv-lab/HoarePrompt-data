The code assigns the value of `res[ind]` to `val`. Since `ind` is 1, `val` takes the value of the element at index 1 of the list `res`. The other variables `res` and `ind` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `val` is now equal to the element at index 1 of `res`, while the states of `res` and `ind` remain as they were.

Output State: **`res` contains at least 2 elements, `ind` is 1, `val` is the element at index 1 of `res`**
