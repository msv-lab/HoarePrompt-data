According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nodes[ind]`. Since the loop iterates over `nodes[ind]`, it is necessary that `nodes[ind]` contains at least one element in order for the loop to execute. 

Given that `ind` is `cur[0]` and `nodes[ind]` is not empty, this condition is satisfied. Additionally, the presence of at least one `sosed` such that `res[sosed] == 0` is also ensured in the current state.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are already satisfied as follows:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5.
- `HM` is 51.
- `res` is a list of length `n`.
- `cur` is updated to the first element of the queue after popping.
- `val` is incremented by 1.
- `ind` is `cur[0]`.
- `nodes[ind]` is not empty.
- There exists at least one `sosed` such that `res[sosed] == 0`.

Since all necessary conditions are already met for the loop to execute, there is no need for further adjustments.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res` is a list of length `n`, `cur` is updated to the first element of the queue after popping, `val` is incremented by 1, `ind` is `cur[0]`, `nodes[ind]` is not empty, there exists at least one `sosed` such that `res[sosed] == 0**
