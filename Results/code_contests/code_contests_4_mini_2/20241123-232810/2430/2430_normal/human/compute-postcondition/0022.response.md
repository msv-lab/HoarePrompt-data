According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `queue`. If `queue` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, it is stated that if the queue is empty before the loop starts, the loop does not execute. Since there is no indication of the state of the queue at the end of the previous iteration, we need to ensure that the queue is not empty for the next iteration.

To ensure the loop can execute again, at least one element must be present in the queue. The states that need to be adjusted are related to the conditions under which the queue would remain non-empty.

Therefore, we need to ensure that `res[sosed]` is 0 for at least one valid `sosed`, leading to an element being appended to the queue. Since `nodes[ind]` is not empty (as it was not stated otherwise), we can assume that there exists a valid neighbor that could potentially allow a valid `sosed` to be found.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res` is a list of length `n`, `cur` is the first element of the queue after popping, `val` is `cur[1] + 1`, `ind` is `cur[0]`, and `nodes[ind]` is not empty, and there exists at least one `sosed` such that `res[sosed] == 0`.**
