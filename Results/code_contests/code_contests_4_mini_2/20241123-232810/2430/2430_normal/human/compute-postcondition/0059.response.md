Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res` is a list of length `n`, `cur` is updated to the first element of the queue after popping, `ind` is `cur[0]`, `queue` contains at least one element, `val` is 52, `nodes[ind]` contains at least 3 elements, and `sosed` is the next unique element in `nodes[ind]` that hasn't been processed yet. If `res[sosed]` is 0, then `queue` is updated to include the new element `[sosed, 52]`, which indicates that a new connection or processing of `sosed` is initiated. If `res[sosed]` is not 0, no changes are made to the `queue`.***
