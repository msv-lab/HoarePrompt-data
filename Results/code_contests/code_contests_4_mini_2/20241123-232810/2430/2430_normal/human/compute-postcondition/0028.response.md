Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res` is a list of length `n`, `cur` is updated to the first element of the queue after popping, `val` is `cur[1]`, `ind` is `cur[0]`, `nodes[ind]` is not empty, and there exists at least one `sosed` such that `res[sosed] == 0`. If `val` is greater than `HM`, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement without making any changes to `res`. Otherwise, `res[ind]` remains assigned the value of `val`. In this context, the program ensures that if `val` exceeds the threshold defined by `HM`, it does not proceed with further processing, while if it is within the acceptable range, it retains the assignment of `val` to `res[ind]`.***
