According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `nodes[ind]` variable. The loop iterates over the neighbors of `nodes[ind]`. At the end of the last iteration, `ind` is `cur[0]`, and `nodes[ind]` has at least `m + 1` neighbors. The variable `sosed` is the next neighbor in `nodes[ind]` after the current one.

For the loop to execute one more time, `sosed` must be updated to the next neighbor in the list, which means we need to ensure that there is at least one more neighbor to iterate over. Since `nodes[ind]` has at least `m + 1` neighbors, if `sosed` is currently the last neighbor in that list, the loop won't execute again. 

Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect that there is at least one more neighbor available for iteration. We can set `sosed` to the next neighbor, and the total count of neighbors (`nodes[ind]`) can be adjusted accordingly.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res` is a list of length `n`, `cur` is updated to the first element of the queue after popping, `val` is incremented by 1, `ind` is `cur[0]`, `nodes[ind]` has at least `m + 2` neighbors, and `sosed` is the next neighbor in `nodes[ind]` after the current one (which is now updated to the next neighbor).**
