According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `queue`. If `queue` contains at least one element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, it is stated that `queue` contains at least one element. Therefore, the loop can execute one more time without any need for adjustments to the state.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res` is a list of length `n`, `cur` is updated to the first element of the queue after popping, `ind` is `cur[0]`, `queue` contains at least one element, and `val` is 52.**
