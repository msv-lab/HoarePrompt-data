Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res` is a list of length `n`, `cur` is the first element of the queue after popping, `val` is `cur[1] + 1`, `ind` is `cur[0]`, and `nodes[ind]` is a list of neighbors for the current node. If `nodes[ind]` is empty, the loop will not execute. If there are no neighbors in `nodes[ind]` that result in `res[sosed] == 0`, the queue remains unchanged. If `res[sosed]` is 0, the queue will contain the appended element `[sosed, val]` for each valid `sosed`. If the queue is empty before the loop starts, the loop does not execute, leaving `res` unchanged and the queue empty.**
