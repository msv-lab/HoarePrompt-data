Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res` is a list of length `n`, `cur` is updated to the first element of the queue after popping, `val` is incremented by 1, `ind` is `cur[0]`, `nodes[ind]` has at least `m + 1` neighbors, and `sosed` is the next neighbor in `nodes[ind]`. If `res[sosed]` is 0, then the queue is updated with the element `[sosed, val]`. Otherwise, no changes are made to the queue.***
