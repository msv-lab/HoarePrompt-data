The code appends a new item, `[sosed, val]`, to the `queue`. The value of `sosed` is determined by the condition that there exists at least one `sosed` such that `res[sosed]` is equal to 0. This means that `sosed` is an index where the value in the `res` list is 0. The variable `val` is incremented by 1 before the code runs, which means it holds its new incremented value when appended to the `queue`.

The previous state of other variables (`n`, `HM`, `res`, `cur`, `ind`, `nodes[ind]`) is not altered by this operation, so they retain their values as stated.

Thus, the output state reflects the unchanged values of these variables and indicates the new append operation to the `queue`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `HM` is 51; `res` is a list of length `n`; `cur` is updated to the first element of the queue after popping; `val` is incremented by 1; `ind` is `cur[0]`; `nodes[ind]` is not empty; there exists at least one `sosed` such that `res[sosed]` is equal to 0; and `queue` now has an additional element `[sosed, val]`.**
