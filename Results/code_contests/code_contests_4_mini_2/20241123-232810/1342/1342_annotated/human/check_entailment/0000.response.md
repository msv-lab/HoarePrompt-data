To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and the annotations.

The problem requires calculating the minimum tax Mr. Funt has to pay, which is determined by finding the maximum divisor of his income \( n \) that is not equal to \( n \). The main points to consider are:

1. If \( n \) is a prime number, the only divisor is 1, and thus he pays 1 burle.
2. If \( n \) is composite, we need to find its maximum divisor which is less than \( n \).
3. All parts split from \( n \) must be at least 2, meaning we cannot have parts that are 1.

Now, let's look at the provided code:

```python
def func_1():
    return str(stdin.readline())

def func_2():
    return int(raw_input())

def func_3():
    return map(int, raw_input().split())

def func_4():
    return [int(i) for i in raw_input().split()]

def func_5(x):
    return stdout.write(str(x))

def func_6(list):
    return eval('*'.join(str(item) for item in list))

def func_7(n):
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5 + 100)):
        if n % i == 0 and n != i:
            return False
    return True
```

### Analyzing the Code:
- `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4` appear to be related to input handling, but their usage in the context of the tax calculation is not clear.
- `func_5` writes an output, but we don't see the output of the tax calculated in the code.
- `func_6` computes the product of a list of integers, which is unrelated to the tax calculation.
- `func_7` checks if \( n \) is prime. However, it does not calculate the maximum divisor or tax.

### Missing Logic:
1. Thereâ€™s no function that calculates the maximum divisor of \( n \), which is essential for determining the tax.
2. If \( n \) is prime, the function should return 1, but there's no logic handling that scenario to compute the tax correctly.
3. The functions provided do not interact in a way that leads to the calculation of the minimum tax Mr. Funt has to pay.

### Conclusion:
The code does not implement the necessary logic to calculate the tax based on the problem description. It lacks a way to evaluate the maximum divisor of \( n \) and does not correctly derive the tax payment based on the conditions stated.

Correctness: **False** 

The program is incorrect because it does not compute the maximum divisor of \( n \) correctly or return the appropriate tax Mr. Funt has to pay. For instance, for \( n = 27 \), it should return 3, but with the current logic, it doesn't handle this case at all.
