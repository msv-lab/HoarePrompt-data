According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` in relation to the upper limit defined by `int(n ** 0.5 + 100)`. Given that `i` is currently 2, the loop will continue as long as `i` remains less than `int(n ** 0.5 + 100)`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2. To allow the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented. Therefore, `i` will become 3 in the next iteration.

The condition for the loop to continue is that `int(n ** 0.5 + 100)` must still be greater than the new value of `i`. Since `n` is at least 2, `int(n ** 0.5 + 100)` is at least 100 (because the square root of 2 is approximately 1.41, and when 100 is added, it results in around 101.41). Thus, 3 is less than 101.41, allowing the loop to execute again.

So, the adjustment needed is for `i` to be incremented to 3. No changes are required for `n` since it remains unchanged and sufficient for the loop's continuation.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 3**
