According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit of the loop, which is `int(n ** 0.5 + 100)`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than this upper limit.

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2. The value of `i` is not provided, but we know that for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `int(n ** 0.5 + 100)`.

Since `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `int(n ** 0.5)` will be at least 1. Therefore, `int(n ** 0.5 + 100)` will be at least 101. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be less than 101. 

To adjust the state for the next iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1, since it is assumed that the loop was running and `i` is currently less than the upper limit.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is less than 101**
