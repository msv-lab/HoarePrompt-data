According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the value of `n`. The loop iterates over the range starting from 2 up to `int(n ** 0.5 + 100)`. 

1. Since `n` is given as an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^9, we can calculate the starting point of the loop:
   - The loop starts at 2, which is always valid as `n` is at least 2.

2. The stopping point of the loop is `int(n ** 0.5 + 100)`. We need to check if this value is greater than 2 for the loop to execute at least once:
   - `n ** 0.5` will be at least 1.41 when `n` is 2, thus `int(n ** 0.5 + 100)` will be at least 101.
   - Therefore, the upper limit will always be greater than 2, ensuring that the loop can execute.

3. The loop index `i` starts at 2. 

Thus, for the loop to execute correctly, we need the following states:
- `n` must be an integer greater than or equal to 2 (which it is).
- The initial value of `i` is set to 2.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2**
