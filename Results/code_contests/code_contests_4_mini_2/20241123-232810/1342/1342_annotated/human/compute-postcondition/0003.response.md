Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, and `i` is 2. If `n` is divisible by `i` and `n` is not equal to `i`, the function returns False. If `n` equals 2, the function does not return False, and if `n` is an odd integer greater than 2, the function also does not return False.***
