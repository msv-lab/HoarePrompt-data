Output State: **If n is a prime number or equal to 2, the loop does not return False and will execute at least once with i being 2. If n is equal to 2, the function does not return False immediately. If n is an odd integer greater than 2, the loop may execute multiple times with i taking on odd values starting from 3. If n is not divisible by any i in the range, the function does not return any value. If n is composite, it will return False when it finds a divisor i (where n % i == 0). If n is less than 2, the loop does not execute at all, but this case is not applicable here as n is stated to be at least 2.**
