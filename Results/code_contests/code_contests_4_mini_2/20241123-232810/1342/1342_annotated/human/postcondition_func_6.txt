The function accepts an integer `n` and checks if it is a prime number. It returns `True` if `n` is a prime number or equal to 2. If `n` is composite (i.e., not prime), it returns `False` upon finding a divisor. However, if `n` is less than 2, the function does not account for this case, as it should ideally handle inputs less than 2, which are neither prime nor composite. Therefore, the function does not explicitly handle inputs less than 2.
