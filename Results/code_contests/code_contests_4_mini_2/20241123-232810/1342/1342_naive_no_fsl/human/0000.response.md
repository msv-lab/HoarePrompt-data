To determine the correctness of the provided Python program according to the problem description, let's analyze the logic step-by-step.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input**: An integer `n` where `2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9`.
2. **Output**: The minimal tax Mr. Funt has to pay, which is determined by how he splits `n` into parts `n1 + n2 + ... + nk`, with the condition that each part `ni` must be ≥ 2.
3. The tax for each part is the maximum divisor of that part (not equal to the part itself).

### Key Points:
- For any even `n`, we can split it into two parts of `n/2`, which results in a tax of `n/2`.
- For odd values of `n`, we can check if `n-2` is prime. If it is, we can split `n` into `2` and `n-2`, resulting in a tax of `2 + (n-2)/2` which is `2 + (n/2) - 1 = (n/2) + 1`. If `n-2` is not prime, we would need to check further splits.

### Program Analysis:
- The function `func_7(n)` is supposed to determine if `n` is prime.
- If `n` is prime, it returns `1` (which is incorrect because the tax should be based on splits).
- If `n` is even, it returns `2`, which is correct since the split can be `n/2 + n/2`.
- If `n` is odd and `n-2` is prime, it returns `2`, which is again incorrect because the tax should be `2 + (n-2)/2`.
- If `n` is odd and `n-2` is not prime, it returns `3`, which seems to be an arbitrary decision without proper justification.

### Edge Cases:
Let’s consider a few edge cases:
1. For `n = 3`:
   - The program checks if `3` is prime (`func_7(3)` returns `True`) and outputs `1`. However, the minimum tax should actually be `2` (by splitting as `2 + 1` which is not allowed, hence `3` should remain single part, but that shouldn't happen).
   
2. For `n = 6`:
   - The program outputs `2` which is correct.
   
3. For `n = 9`:
   - The program should ideally split `9` into `3 + 6` or `2 + 7`, resulting in a tax of `3` (since the max divisor of `3` is `1` and `6` is `3`).
   - The program checks if `9` is prime (`func_7(9)` returns `False`), checks evenness and outputs `3`, which is arbitrary.
   
4. For `n = 11`:
   - The program checks if `11` is prime (`func_7(11)` returns `True`) and outputs `1`. This is incorrect; the minimum tax should be `2` (splitting as `2 + 9`).

### Conclusion:
The program fails to account for the required conditions and outputs incorrect values for several cases. Therefore, it does not fulfill the problem requirements correctly.

Correctness: **False**
