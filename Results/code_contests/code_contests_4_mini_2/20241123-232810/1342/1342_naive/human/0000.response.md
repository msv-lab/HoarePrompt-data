To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the program in the context of the requirements outlined.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. Mr. Funt has an income `n` and must pay taxes based on the maximum divisor of `n` (not equal to `n`).
2. He can split `n` into parts, where each part must be at least 2.
3. The goal is to minimize the total tax paid.

### Key Points from the Program:
- The function `func_7(n)` checks if `n` is prime. If `n` is prime, it prints 1 (this is correct because a prime number can't be split without including 1).
- If `n` is even, it prints 2 (which is also correct, as the maximum divisor of any even number is 2).
- If `n` is odd and `n - 2` is prime, it prints 2 (this is correct, as it allows splitting into two parts of 2).
- If none of the above conditions are met, it prints 3.

### Potential Cases:
1. **Prime Number Case**: For `n = 3`, the program will print 1, which is correct since Mr. Funt can't split 3 into parts of at least 2 without including 1.
2. **Even Number Case**: For `n = 4`, the program will print 2, which is correct.
3. **Odd Number Case**: For `n = 27`, the program will print 3, which is correct because 27 is not prime, and it cannot be split into parts all of at least 2 that will yield a lower tax than 3.

### Edge Cases:
- For `n = 2`, the program correctly identifies that 2 is prime and prints 1.
- For `n = 5`, the program will print 1, which is correct.
- For `n = 9` (which is odd and not prime), it will check `9 - 2 = 7` (which is prime) and thus print 2. This is also correct.
- For `n = 15`, the program will print 3, which is correct since 15 can be divided into parts like 3 and 12, but the maximum divisor tax would still lead to a minimum of 3.

However, there is a flaw in the logic when `n` is an odd composite number that cannot be expressed as the sum of two primes. For example:
- For `n = 9`, it will print 2, but 9 can only be split as (2, 2, 5) or (3, 6), both yielding a maximum divisor of 3. 

### Conclusion:
Given that the program does not correctly handle all potential cases (specifically, it can misinterpret certain odd composite numbers), the correctness of the program is as follows:

Correctness: **False**. 

### Explanation:
The program fails to account for all odd composite numbers properly, particularly those that should yield a tax of 3 but are incorrectly assessed as yielding a tax of 2.
