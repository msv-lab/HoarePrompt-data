To assess the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's break down the problem and the program step by step, including the provided functions and their outputs.

### Problem Description Recap:
Mr. Funt has an income `n` and needs to pay taxes based on the maximum divisor of `n` that is not equal to `n`. He wants to split `n` into parts where each part is at least `2`, and the goal is to minimize the total tax he pays.

### Functions and Their Logic:
1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: Reads a string input. This function is not directly relevant to the tax calculation.
   
2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: Reads an integer input but lacks error handling for the input range (2 to 2·10^9).

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**: Reads a list of integers, but again, does not check for valid input.

4. **Function 4 (`func_4`)**: Similar to function 3 but returns a list and does not handle input errors.

5. **Function 5 (`func_5`)**: Outputs an integer but has no checks for the value of `x`.

6. **Function 6 (`func_6`)**: Calculates the product of a list of integers but will raise a `SyntaxError` if the list is empty.

7. **Function 7 (`func_7`)**: Checks if `n` is prime. The upper limit for checking factors is incorrectly set and may lead to incorrect results for certain values of `n`.

### Main Logic:
After defining the functions, the main logic evaluates `n`:
- If `n` is prime, it prints `1` (indicating tax based on `n` itself).
- If `n` is even, it prints `2` (the maximum divisor of any even number ≥ 4 is `n/2`).
- If `n` is odd and `n-2` is prime, it prints `2` (indicating splitting `n` into `2` and `n-2`).
- Otherwise, it prints `3`, implying a more complex splitting is required.

### Potential Edge Cases:
1. **Even Values**: For even values of `n`, the output seems correct. For example, with `n=4`, the output is `2` (which is correct).

2. **Odd Prime Values**: If `n` is an odd prime (e.g., `n = 3`), it returns `1`, which is correct since the only divisor is `1`.

3. **Large Values**: The program handles values up to `2·10^9`, but error handling for input values is lacking, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

4. **Edge cases where `n` is small**: The function does not explicitly handle cases for the smallest inputs in a robust way.

5. **Incorrect upper limit in `func_7`**: The upper limit for checking if `n` is prime is set incorrectly. It should be `int(n ** 0.5) + 1`. This could lead to failing to identify certain non-prime numbers correctly, which would affect subsequent logic.

### Output Hints Check:
- The output hints for each function suggest that the functions do not handle input errors and edge cases well, as noted above.
- Specifically, `func_7` will not correctly identify non-prime numbers for certain inputs due to the incorrect upper bound.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to correctly handle all potential cases, particularly due to the incorrect implementation of the primality test in `func_7`. This impacts the overall tax calculation logic since it might incorrectly classify a non-prime number as prime, leading to incorrect tax results.

Correctness: **False**. 

The failure case could be when `n` is a composite number with divisors, and the program incorrectly identifies it as prime due to the flawed logic in `func_7`.
