According to the code, the loop iterates over values of `i` starting from 2 up to `int(n ** 0.5 + 100)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3. For the loop to execute one more time, the next value of `i` should be 4. 

Since `n` is between 2 and 2,000,000,000 and `i` is currently 3, we need to ensure that `i` is incremented to 4. The condition for the loop to run further is determined by the upper limit `int(n ** 0.5 + 100)`, which must be at least 4 in order for the loop to continue executing.

Thus, we do not need to change `n` because it is already a valid integer that allows the loop to execute again with `i` incremented. 

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 2,000,000,000, `i` is 4**
