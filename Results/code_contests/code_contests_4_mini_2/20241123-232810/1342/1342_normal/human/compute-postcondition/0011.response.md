Output State: **If `n` is a prime number, the loop will execute until `i` reaches `int(n ** 0.5 + 100)` without returning False. If `n` is not a prime number and is divisible by an integer `i` in the range starting from 2, the function will return False. If `n` is equal to `i`, the loop will continue without returning. If `n` is 2, the loop will not execute at all since the range starts at 2, resulting in no checks performed. Therefore, if `n` is 2, the output will be that the function does not return False and the loop does not execute. If `n` is greater than 2, the output will depend on the divisibility of `n` by integers `i` from 2 to `int(n ** 0.5 + 100)`.**
