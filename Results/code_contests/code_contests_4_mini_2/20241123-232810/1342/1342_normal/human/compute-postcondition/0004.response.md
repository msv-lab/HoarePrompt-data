According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i`, which starts at 2 and increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches the upper limit `int(n ** 0.5 + 100)`. The current state indicates that `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 2,000,000,000, and that `i` is currently 2.

At the end of the last iteration, since `i` is 2 and the loop is designed to run until `i` reaches `int(n ** 0.5 + 100)`, we need to adjust `i` to the next integer, which would be 3. The upper limit of the loop does not need to be adjusted because it is dependent on `n`, which remains unchanged.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be adjusted to 3.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 2,000,000,000, `i` is 3**
