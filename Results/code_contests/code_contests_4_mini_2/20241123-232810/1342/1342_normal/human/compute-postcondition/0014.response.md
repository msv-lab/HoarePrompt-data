Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` and returns `True` if `n` is a prime number; otherwise, it returns `False`. However, the upper limit for checking factors is incorrectly set to `int(n ** 0.5 + 100)`, which may allow for unnecessary checks beyond the square root of `n`. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where `n` is less than 2, which should return `False` since numbers less than 2 are not prime. Therefore, the function does not correctly identify non-prime cases for numbers less than 2. **
