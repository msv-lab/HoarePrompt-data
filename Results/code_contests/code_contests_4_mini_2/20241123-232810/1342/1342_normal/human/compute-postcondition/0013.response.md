The function `func_7` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 2,000,000,000. If `n` is a prime number, the function proceeds to execute a loop. If the loop confirms that `n` is prime, the function returns `True`, indicating that `n` is indeed a prime number. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_7` is to accept an integer `n` and return `True` if `n` is a prime number. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n and returns True if n is a prime number.**
