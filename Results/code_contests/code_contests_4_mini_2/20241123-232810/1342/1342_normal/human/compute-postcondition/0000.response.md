According to the code, the loop execution depends on the value of `n`. The loop will execute for `i` starting from 2 up to `int(n ** 0.5 + 100)`. Since `n` is guaranteed to be at least 2, the starting value of `i` is 2, which is valid. 

To determine the end of the loop, we need to calculate `int(n ** 0.5 + 100)`. Since `n` is at least 2, `n ** 0.5` will be at least 1.414, making `int(n ** 0.5 + 100)` at least 101. Therefore, `i` will take values from 2 to at least 101.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` will be equal to 101 if `n` is such that `n ** 0.5` is just under 100. For `n` values larger than that, `i` will take on higher values accordingly.

Thus, the state needs to reflect the starting value of `i` which is 2, and we need to ensure that `n` is set such that the upper limit of the range is valid.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 2,000,000,000, `i` is 2**
