According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variable `i` and its range. The loop iterates for values of `i` starting from 2 up to `int(n ** 0.5 + 100)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must increase to 5, and it should still be within the upper limit of the range. The upper limit is calculated as `int(n ** 0.5 + 100)`. Since `n` is an integer between 2 and 2,000,000,000, `int(n ** 0.5)` will vary based on the specific value of `n`.

To ensure that the loop can run again, we can conclude:
- `i` needs to be adjusted to 5.
- The condition for the upper limit should still be valid after this adjustment, meaning that `n` must be sufficiently large to ensure that `int(n ** 0.5 + 100)` is greater than 5.

Since we know that `n` is an integer between 2 and 2,000,000,000, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 25 for the upper limit to be greater than 5, we can set the condition for `n` accordingly.

Thus, the adjustments to the states would be:
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 25, `i` is 5**
