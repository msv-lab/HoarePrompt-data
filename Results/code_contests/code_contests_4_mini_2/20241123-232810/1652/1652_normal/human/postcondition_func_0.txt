The function reads lines of input where each line contains integers. It initializes two variables `a` and `b` based on the first two integers of each line. It then processes subsequent integers in the line, updating `a` and `b` based on their divisibility by the previously assigned values. The function does not return any value but writes the final values of `a` and `b` to standard output for each line processed. If no input is provided, `a` and `b` remain unchanged and nothing is output. The function lacks explicit parameter acceptance and output specification details.
