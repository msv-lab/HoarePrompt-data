The variable `a` is assigned the value of `d`. The value of `d` is specified as the fourth element of `list_divisors`, but the specific value of `d` is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the value of `a` becomes equal to the value of `d`, while the other variables remain unchanged. The output state reflects that `a` is now equal to `d`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `d` is the fourth element of `list_divisors`, `list_divisors` has at least 4 elements, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 3, and `a` is equal to `d`**
