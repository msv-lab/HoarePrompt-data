Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `d` is an integer equal to `list_divisors[2]`, `list_divisors` is a list with at least 3 elements, `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, `d` is not divisible by `b`, and if `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`. If `d` is not divisible by `a`, the value of `a` remains unchanged.***
