Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `d` is the last element of `list_divisors`, `list_divisors` has at least `n` elements, `nb_test` is 0, and `idx` is `n-1`. If `list_divisors` is empty or has less than 3 elements, the loop does not execute, and both `a` and `b` remain undefined. If the loop executes, `a` and `b` will be updated based on their divisibility relations with the elements of `list_divisors`, and their final values depend on the provided conditions and the values of the divisors processed. If `a` and `b` were never defined during the loop execution, they will remain undefined.**
