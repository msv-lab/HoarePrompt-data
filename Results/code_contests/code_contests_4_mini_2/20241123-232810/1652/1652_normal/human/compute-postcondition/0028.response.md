Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `d` is equal to `list_divisors[3]`, and `list_divisors` is a list with at least 4 elements. If `b` is divisible by `d`, then `b` is set to `d`. If `b` is not divisible by `d` and if `a` is divisible by `d`, then `a` is set to `d`. If neither `b` nor `a` is divisible by `d`, then both `a` and `b` remain unchanged.***
