Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `d` is the fourth element of `list_divisors` with at least 4 elements, and if `d` is greater than or equal to `a`, then if `d` is divisible by `a`, `a` is assigned the value of `d`. If `d` is not divisible by `a`, then `a` remains unchanged. If `d` is less than `a`, there is no change to `a`.***
