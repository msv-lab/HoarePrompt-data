Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128 and `d` is the fifth element of `list_divisors`, which contains at least 5 elements. If `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, then if `d` is divisible by `b`, `b` is updated to `d`; if `d` is divisible by `a`, `a` is updated to `d`. After these checks, `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`. If `d` is less than `b` but greater than or equal to `a`, and if `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`. In all cases, if `d` is less than both `a` and `b`, then both `a` and `b` remain unchanged.***
