The code `list_divisors = map(int, line.strip().split(' '))` processes the `line` input by first stripping any whitespace and then splitting the line into a list of substrings based on spaces. Each substring is then converted into an integer using the `map` function. 

Since `line` is being read from `sys.stdin`, it is guaranteed to have at least one line of input available. The specific contents of `line` are not provided, but it will yield a list of integers after the operations. The other variables `n`, `d`, `nb_test`, and `idx` are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 128, `d` is a list of n integers, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is an integer not equal to 0, and `list_divisors` is a map object containing integers from the input line.**
