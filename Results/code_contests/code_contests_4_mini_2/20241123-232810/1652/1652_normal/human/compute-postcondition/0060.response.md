Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `d` is the third element of `list_divisors`, `list_divisors` has at least 3 elements, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 2, and `d` is not divisible by `b`. If `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is assigned the value of `d`. If `d` is not divisible by `a`, the value of `a` remains undefined. In all cases, `d` is not divisible by `b`.***
