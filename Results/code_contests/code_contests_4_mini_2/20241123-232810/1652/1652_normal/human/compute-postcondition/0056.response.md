The value of `b` is assigned the value of `d`. Since `d` is greater than or equal to `b` before the assignment, this condition holds true after the assignment as well. The values of `n`, `list_divisors`, `nb_test`, and `idx` remain unaffected, and `a` remains undefined. Therefore, the output state is `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `d` is the third element of `list_divisors`, `list_divisors` has at least 3 elements, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 2, `a` is undefined, `b` is assigned the value of `d`, and `d` is divisible by `b`.
