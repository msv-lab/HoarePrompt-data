Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `d` is a list of `n` integers, `nb_test` is 0, and `idx` is 0. If `idx` is not 0, the program processes `list_divisors` from the input, updating the values of `a` and `b` based on the divisibility conditions of the elements in `list_divisors`. The final output will be the integers `a` and `b`, which represent the two smallest divisors from the list that meet the specified conditions, ensuring that the output maintains the relationship that `a` is less than or equal to `b` and all divisibility checks are respected. If `idx` is 0, no action is taken, and `a` and `b` remain unchanged.***
