Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `d` is equal to `list_divisors[3]`, and if `d` is greater than or equal to `a`, then if `d` is divisible by `a`, `a` is assigned the value of `d`. If `d` is not divisible by `a`, the value of `a` remains unchanged. If `d` is less than `a`, the value of `a` is unchanged.***
