According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `list_divisors`. The loop iterates over the elements of `list_divisors` starting from the third element (index 2), and the current `idx` is 3, which means we are currently processing the fourth element of `list_divisors`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `d` is the fourth element of `list_divisors`, and `idx` is 3, indicating that the loop has processed the element at index 3. For the loop to execute one more time, the index (`idx`) must be incremented to 4, and `d` will then be the fifth element of `list_divisors`.

Since `list_divisors` has at least 4 elements, `d` must be updated to the fifth element in the list, meaning the state must reflect that `d` is now the fifth element of `list_divisors` and `idx` is updated to 4.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `d` is the fifth element of `list_divisors` which has at least 5 elements, `nb_test` is 0, and `idx` is 4**
