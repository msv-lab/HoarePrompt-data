Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `d` is the fifth element of `list_divisors`, which has at least 5 elements. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a`, and `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is assigned the value of `d`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a` but not divisible by `a`, the value of `a` remains unchanged. If `d` is less than `a`, the value of `a` is also unchanged.***
