Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `d` is the third element of `list_divisors`, and `list_divisors` has at least 3 elements. If `d` is divisible by `b`, then `b` is assigned the value of `d`. If `d` is not divisible by `b` but is divisible by `a`, then `a` is assigned the value of `d`; otherwise, `a` remains undefined. In all cases, `d` is not divisible by `b`.***
