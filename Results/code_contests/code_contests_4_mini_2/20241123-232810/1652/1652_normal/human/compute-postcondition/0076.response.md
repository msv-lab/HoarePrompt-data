The value of `a` is assigned the value of `d`. The variable `d` is known to be the fourth element of `list_divisors`, but the specific value of `d` is not provided. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `a` takes on the value of `d`, while the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `d` is the fourth element of `list_divisors`, `list_divisors` has at least 4 elements, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 3, and `a` is assigned the value of `d`.**
