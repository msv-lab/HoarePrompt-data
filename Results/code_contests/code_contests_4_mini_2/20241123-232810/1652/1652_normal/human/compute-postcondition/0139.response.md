Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `d` is a list of `n` integers, `nb_test` is 0, and `idx` is 3. If `idx` is not equal to 0, the program processes the `list_divisors` derived from the input line, updating the variables `a` and `b` based on their divisibility and value comparisons. The final values of `a` and `b` are written to the output in the format '%d %d\n'. If `idx` is equal to 0, the program does not execute the if block, leaving `a` and `b` unchanged.***
