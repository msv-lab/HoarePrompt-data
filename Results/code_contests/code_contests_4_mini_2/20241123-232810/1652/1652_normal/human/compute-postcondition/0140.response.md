The value of `idx` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 3 to 4. The variables `a` and `b` remain unchanged since the code does not execute any further if the value of `idx` is not equal to 0. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `idx` while keeping `a` and `b` as they were initially.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `d` is a list of `n` integers, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 4, and `a` and `b` remain unchanged.**
