`a` is assigned the value of `d`. The value of `d` is not specified but is known to be an integer that is divisible by `a`. The variable `b` remains undefined, and all other variables retain their previous states. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `d` is the third element of `list_divisors`, `list_divisors` has at least 3 elements, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 2, `a` is equal to `d`, `b` is undefined, `d` is not divisible by `b`, and `d` is divisible by `a`.
