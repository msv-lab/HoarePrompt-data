Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `d` is an integer equal to `list_divisors[2]`, `list_divisors` is a list with at least 3 elements, and `d` is less than `b`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a` and `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a` but not divisible by `a`, the value of `a` remains unchanged. If `d` is less than `a`, the value of `a` also remains unchanged.***
