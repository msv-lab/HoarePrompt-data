The value of `idx` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. Since `idx` was initially 0, no further action is taken regarding the processing of `list_divisors`, and the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `idx` while keeping `a` and `b` unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `d` is a list of `n` integers, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 1, and `a` and `b` remain unchanged**.
