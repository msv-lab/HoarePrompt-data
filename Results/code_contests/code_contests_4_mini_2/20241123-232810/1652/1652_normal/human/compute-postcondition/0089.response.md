Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `d` is the fifth element of `list_divisors`, `nb_test` is 0, and `idx` is 4. If `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, then if `d` is divisible by `b`, `b` is updated to `d`; if `d` is divisible by `a` but not by `b`, `a` is updated to `d`. After these conditions, the values of `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`. If `d` is less than `b` but greater than or equal to `a`, and `d` is divisible by `a`, `a` is updated to `d`; otherwise, `a` remains unchanged. In all other cases, both `a` and `b` remain unchanged.***
