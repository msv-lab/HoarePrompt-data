Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128; `d` is equal to `list_divisors[4]`, and `list_divisors` is a list with at least 5 elements. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a`, then if `d` is divisible by `a`, `a` is updated to the value of `d`; otherwise, the value of `a` remains unchanged. If `d` is less than `a`, the value of `a` remains unchanged.***
