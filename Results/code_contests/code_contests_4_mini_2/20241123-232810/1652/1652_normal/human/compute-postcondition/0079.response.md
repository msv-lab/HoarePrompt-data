Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `d` is the fourth element of `list_divisors` which has at least 4 elements, `nb_test` is 0, and `idx` is 3. If `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, then if `d` is divisible by `b`, `b` is updated to `d`; if `d` is divisible by `a`, `a` is updated to `d`. After these conditions, `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` was greater than `b`. If `d` is not greater than or equal to `b` but is greater than or equal to `a`, and if `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`. Otherwise, both `a` and `b` remain unchanged.***
