Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128; `d` is equal to `list_divisors[4]`, which is an element from a list with at least 5 elements. If `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, then if `d` is divisible by `b`, `b` is updated to `d`; if `d` is divisible by `a`, `a` is updated to `d`. After this, if `a` is greater than `b`, their values are swapped. If `d` is less than `b` but greater than or equal to `a`, and `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`. If none of these conditions are met, both `a` and `b` remain unchanged. The postconditions ensure that `a` and `b` are updated according to the divisibility checks with respect to `d`.***
