Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `d` is the third element of `list_divisors`, `list_divisors` has at least 3 elements, `nb_test` is 0, and `idx` is 2. If `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, then if `d` is divisible by `b`, `b` is updated to `d`; if `d` is not divisible by `b` but is divisible by `a`, `a` is updated to `d`. After that, `a` and `b` are assigned values based on their comparison and swapped if `a` is greater than `b`. If `d` is less than `b` but greater than or equal to `a`, and if `a` is defined, `a` is updated to `d` if `d` is divisible by `a`. If `d` is not divisible by `a`, `a` remains unchanged, and if `a` is undefined, it remains undefined.**
