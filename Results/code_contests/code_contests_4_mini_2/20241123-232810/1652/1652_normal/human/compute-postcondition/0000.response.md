The variable `nb_test` is assigned the value `0`. The initial state of the variable does not change any existing values, and no other variables are affected. Therefore, the output state is that `n` remains within the range specified, `d` is a list of integers, and `nb_test` is now `0`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 128, `d` is a list of n integers, and `nb_test` is 0**
