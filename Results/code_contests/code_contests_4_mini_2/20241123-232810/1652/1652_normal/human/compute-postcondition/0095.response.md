According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are lines to read from `sys.stdin`. Since there is no condition based on the state variables provided (`n`, `d`, `nb_test`, `idx`), we must focus on whether there will be another line to read from standard input.

At the end of the last iteration, `nb_test` is 0 and `idx` is 3, but these states do not influence the ability to read from `sys.stdin`. The crucial point is that as long as there are additional lines in the standard input, the loop will continue to execute.

Therefore, to ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to assume that there is at least one more line of input available to read.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `d` is a list of `n` integers, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 3, and there is at least one more line in sys.stdin**
