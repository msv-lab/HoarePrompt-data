Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `d` is the third element of `list_divisors`, and `list_divisors` has at least 3 elements. If `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, then if `d` is divisible by `b`, `b` is updated to `d`; if not, but `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`. Afterward, `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` was greater than `b`. If `d` is less than `b` but greater than or equal to `a`, and `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`; otherwise, both `a` and `b` remain unchanged. If `d` is less than both `a` and `b`, the values of `a` and `b` stay the same.***
