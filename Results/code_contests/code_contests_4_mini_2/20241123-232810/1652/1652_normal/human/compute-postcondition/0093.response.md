Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `d` is a list of `n` integers, `nb_test` is 0, and `idx` is 2. If `idx` is not equal to 0, `list_divisors` is populated from the input line. The first two elements of `list_divisors`, `a` and `b`, are defined and assigned based on the values of these elements, such that `a` is the minimum and `b` is the maximum. For the remaining elements in `list_divisors`, if any element `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, `b` is updated if `d` is divisible by `b`, or `a` is updated if `d` is divisible by `a`. Additionally, `a` and `b` are reassigned to maintain their order. If `d` is between `a` and `b`, `a` is updated if `d` is divisible by `a`. Finally, the program outputs the values of `a` and `b`. If `idx` is 0, there are no changes to `a` and `b`.***
