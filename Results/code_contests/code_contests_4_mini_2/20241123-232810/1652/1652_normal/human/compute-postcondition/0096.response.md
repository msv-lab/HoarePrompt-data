The variable `list_divisors` is assigned the value of `map(int, line.strip().split(' '))`, which means it will create an iterable that converts each space-separated string from the `line` input into an integer. The initial state of `n`, `d`, `nb_test`, and `idx` is not directly affected by this assignment, but `line` must contain values for the mapping to have any effect. Since the initial state indicates that there is at least one more line in `sys.stdin`, we can infer that `list_divisors` will contain a mapped list of integers based on that input line. However, the exact output depends on the content of `line`.

As such, the output state reflects the assignment of `list_divisors`, but the specific values that it contains cannot be determined without knowing the contents of `line`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `d` is a list of `n` integers, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 3, and `list_divisors` is an iterable created from the integers in the line input.**
