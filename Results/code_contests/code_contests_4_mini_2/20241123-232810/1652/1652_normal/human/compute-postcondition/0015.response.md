Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128 and `d` is an integer equal to `list_divisors[2]`, where `list_divisors` is a list with at least 3 elements. If `d` is divisible by `b`, then `b` is updated to the value of `d`. If `d` is not divisible by `b` but is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`. If `d` is neither divisible by `b` nor by `a`, both `a` and `b` remain unchanged. Additionally, it is guaranteed that `d` is greater than or equal to `b`.***
