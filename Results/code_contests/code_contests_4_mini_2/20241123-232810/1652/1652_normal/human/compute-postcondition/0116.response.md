According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `list_divisors`. The loop will execute as long as there are more elements in `list_divisors` starting from the third element (index 2). At the end of the last iteration, `list_divisors` has at least 3 elements, and `d` is currently the third element in that list.

To execute the loop one more time, we need to ensure that there is at least one more element after the current `d`. Therefore, the size of `list_divisors` must be at least 4. Since `d` is the third element, we can update `d` to be the fourth element of `list_divisors` for the next iteration.

Thus, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
- `list_divisors` must have at least 4 elements.
- `d` should be updated to the fourth element of `list_divisors`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `d` is the fourth element of `list_divisors`, and `list_divisors` has at least 4 elements.**
