According to the code, the loop iterates over lines in `sys.stdin`. For the loop to execute one more time, there needs to be at least one more line of input available in standard input. Given that `nb_test` is 0, it indicates that there are no tests processed yet, but it doesn't directly affect the loop execution since the loop condition is related to the availability of input lines.

At the end of the last iteration, `idx` is 1. To execute the loop one more time, the `idx` should increment to 2, indicating that the loop will process the second line of input.

Since there's no specific condition mentioned regarding `n`, `d`, `a`, or `b`, these states remain unchanged.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `d` is a list of `n` integers, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 2, and `a` and `b` remain unchanged**
