Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128; `d` is the fourth element of `list_divisors`; if `d` is divisible by `b`, then `b` is assigned the value of `d`; if `d` is not divisible by `b`, and `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is assigned the value of `d`; if neither condition holds, then the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged; the values of `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`.**
