According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `list_divisors`. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are more elements in `list_divisors` starting from the index 2. 

At the end of the last iteration, `idx` is 2, indicating that the current element being processed is `list_divisors[2]`, which is `d`. For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that there is at least one more element in `list_divisors` beyond the current index.

Since `list_divisors` has at least 3 elements, the next index would be 3. Therefore, `d` needs to be the fourth element of `list_divisors`, and `idx` should be updated to 3.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `d` should be updated to `list_divisors[3]` (the fourth element).
- `idx` should be incremented to 3.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `d` is the fourth element of `list_divisors`, `list_divisors` has at least 4 elements, `nb_test` is 0, and `idx` is 3.**
