Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `d` is an integer equal to `list_divisors[2]`, and `list_divisors` is a list with at least 3 elements. If `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, then if `d` is divisible by `b`, `b` is updated to `d`; if `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`. After this, `a` and `b` are assigned values such that if `a` is greater than `b`, `a` takes the value of `b` and `b` takes the value of `a`, otherwise they remain unchanged. If `d` is less than `b` but greater than or equal to `a`, and if `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`, otherwise `a` remains unchanged. If `d` is less than both `a` and `b`, the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.***
