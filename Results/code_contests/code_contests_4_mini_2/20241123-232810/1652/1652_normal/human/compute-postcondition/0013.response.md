The variable `a` is assigned the value of `d`. Given that `d` is an integer that meets the specified conditions (greater than or equal to `b`, not divisible by `b`, and divisible by `a`), the state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new assignment.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `d` is an integer equal to `list_divisors[2]`, `list_divisors` is a list with at least 3 elements, `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, `d` is not divisible by `b`, `d` is divisible by `a`, and `a` is equal to `d`.**
