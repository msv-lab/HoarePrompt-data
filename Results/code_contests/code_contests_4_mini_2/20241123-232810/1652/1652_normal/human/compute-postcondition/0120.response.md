Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `d` is the fourth element of `list_divisors` with at least 4 elements. If `d` is divisible by `b`, then `b` is assigned the value of `d`. If `d` is not divisible by `b`, and `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is assigned the value of `d`. If neither condition holds, then the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.***
