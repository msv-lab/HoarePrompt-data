According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the input being read from `sys.stdin`. The loop continues until there are no more lines to read from standard input. 

At the end of the last iteration, `idx` is 4, which indicates that 4 lines have been processed from `sys.stdin`. Since `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, it does not directly affect the loop's execution in this case, as the loop reads lines from `sys.stdin` until EOF (End Of File).

For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more line available in `sys.stdin`. Consequently, we need to adjust the state to reflect that an additional line can be read.

Assuming that `sys.stdin` has at least one more line, the relevant states to adjust are `idx`, which should increase by 1, indicating that one more line has been processed. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `d` is a list of `n` integers, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 5, and `a` and `b` remain unchanged**
