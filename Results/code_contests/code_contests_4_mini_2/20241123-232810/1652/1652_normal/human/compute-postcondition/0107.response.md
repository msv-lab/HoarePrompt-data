Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `d` is the third element of `list_divisors`, and `d` is greater than or equal to `b`. If `d` is divisible by `b`, then `b` is assigned the value of `d`. If `d` is not divisible by `b` but is divisible by `a`, then `a` is set to `d`. If `d` is not divisible by either `b` or `a`, the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.***
