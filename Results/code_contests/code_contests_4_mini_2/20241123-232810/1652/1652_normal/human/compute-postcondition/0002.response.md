According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the input from `sys.stdin`. For the loop to execute, there must be at least one line of input available when the loop begins. The variables `n`, `d`, `nb_test`, and `idx` do not directly affect the execution of the loop since they pertain to the state before the loop starts.

However, we can infer that we should maintain the state of `nb_test` and `idx` as they might be relevant for the loop body, but for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that there is input available. 

Thus, for the loop to be able to execute, we need to establish that the input stream (`sys.stdin`) has at least one line available to process.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 128, `d` is a list of n integers, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 0, and `sys.stdin` has at least one line of input available.**
