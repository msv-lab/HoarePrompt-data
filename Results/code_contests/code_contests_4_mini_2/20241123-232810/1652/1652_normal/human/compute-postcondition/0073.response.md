Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `d` is the fourth element of `list_divisors`, `list_divisors` has at least 4 elements, `nb_test` is 0, and `idx` is 3. If `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to be equal to `d`. If `d` is not divisible by `a`, the value of `a` remains unchanged.***
