The variable `a` is assigned the value of `d`. The value of `d` is defined as the third element of `list_divisors`, and it is known that `d` is less than `b`, greater than or equal to `a`, and divisible by `a`. However, since `a` was previously undefined, this assignment now defines `a` as equal to `d`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `d` is the third element of `list_divisors`, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 2, `b` is defined, `d` is less than `b`, `d` is greater than or equal to `a`, `d` is divisible by `a`, and `a` is now equal to `d`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `d` is the third element of `list_divisors`, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 2, `b` is defined, `d` is less than `b`, `d` is greater than or equal to `a`, `d` is divisible by `a`, and `a` is now equal to `d`.**
