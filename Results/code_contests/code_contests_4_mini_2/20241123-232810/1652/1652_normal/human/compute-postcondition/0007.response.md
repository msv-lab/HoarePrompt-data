According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `list_divisors`. The loop iterates over the elements of `list_divisors` starting from the third element (index 2). For the loop to execute, `list_divisors` must contain at least 3 elements. 

Given the current state:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, which does not directly affect the loop execution.
- `d` is a list of `n` integers, but its content is not directly relevant since it is not used in the loop.
- `nb_test` is initialized to 0, which does not impact the loop execution.
- `idx` is an integer not equal to 0; this doesn’t affect the loop execution either.
- `a` and `b` are assigned values from `list_divisors`, but since we are concerned with the loop executing, we need to focus on `list_divisors`.

To ensure the loop executes, `list_divisors` must contain at least 3 elements. 

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `list_divisors` should be a list with at least 3 elements.
- The variable `d` should be initialized to the third element of `list_divisors`, which is `list_divisors[2]`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `d` is an integer equal to `list_divisors[2]`, `list_divisors` is a list with at least 3 elements.**
