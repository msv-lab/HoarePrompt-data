The value of `a` is assigned the value of `d`. The variable `d` is equal to `list_divisors[4]`, which means `a` will hold the value from the fifth element of the `list_divisors`. The variable `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128; `d` is equal to `list_divisors[4]`, and `a` is equal to `d`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128; `d` is equal to `list_divisors[4]`; `a` is equal to `d`**
