Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128; `d` is equal to `list_divisors[4]`. If `d` is divisible by `b`, then `b` is assigned the value of `d`. If `d` is not divisible by `b` but is divisible by `a`, then `a` is assigned the value of `d`. If `d` is not divisible by either `b` or `a`, their values remain unchanged.***
