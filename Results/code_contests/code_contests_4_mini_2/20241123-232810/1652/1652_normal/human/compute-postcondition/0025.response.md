The variable `b` is assigned the value of `d`. The value of `d` is determined by `list_divisors[3]`, which means `b` will take on the value of the fourth element in the `list_divisors`. The variable `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged value of `n` and the new value of `b` assigned from `d`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128; `b` is equal to `list_divisors[3]**
