Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128; `d` is equal to `list_divisors[3]`, and `list_divisors` is a list with at least 4 elements. If `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, then if `d` is divisible by `b`, `b` is assigned the value of `d`; otherwise, if `d` is divisible by `a`, `a` is assigned the value of `d`. After these checks, the values of `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`. If `d` is less than `b` but greater than or equal to `a`, and if `d` is divisible by `a`, `a` is assigned the value of `d`. If none of the conditions are met, the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged. All conditions ensure that the relationships between `a`, `b`, and `d` are maintained throughout the execution.***
