The variable `a` is assigned the value of `d`. The initial state specifies that `d` is the third element of `list_divisors`, which meets the conditions outlined. The state of `n`, `list_divisors`, and other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `d` is the third element of `list_divisors`, and `a` is assigned the value of `d`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `d` is the third element of `list_divisors`, `a` is assigned the value of `d`**.
