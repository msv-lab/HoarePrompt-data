Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `d` is the fourth element of `list_divisors`, and `list_divisors` has at least 4 elements. If `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, then if `d` is divisible by `b`, `b` is assigned the value of `d`; if not, but `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is assigned the value of `d`. After these checks, the values of `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`. If `d` is less than `b` but greater than or equal to `a`, and if `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is assigned the value of `d`, otherwise `a` remains unchanged. If `d` is less than both `a` and `b`, no changes are made to `a` or `b`. Thus, the values of `a` and `b` are updated based on the divisibility conditions and their relative sizes.***
