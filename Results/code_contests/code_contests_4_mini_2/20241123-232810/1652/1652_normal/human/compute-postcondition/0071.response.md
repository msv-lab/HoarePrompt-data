The variable `b` is assigned the value of `d`, which is the fourth element of `list_divisors`. The initial states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `d` is the fourth element of `list_divisors`, `list_divisors` has at least 4 elements, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 3, and `b` is assigned the value of `d`.
