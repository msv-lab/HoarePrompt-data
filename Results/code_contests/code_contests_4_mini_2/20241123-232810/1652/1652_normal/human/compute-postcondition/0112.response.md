The variable `a` is assigned the value of `d`. The value of `d` is constrained by the initial state (it is less than `b`, the third element of `list_divisors`, greater than or equal to `a`, and divisible by `a`). However, the exact value of `d` is not provided, but it meets the conditions given. The value of `a` will now equal that of `d`, while the states of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `d` is less than `b`, `d` is the third element of `list_divisors`, `list_divisors` has at least 3 elements, `d` is greater than or equal to `a`, and `d` is divisible by `a`; `a` is equal to `d`.**
