The variable `b` is assigned the value of `d`. The initial state indicates that `d` is an integer that is greater than or equal to `b` and is also divisible by `b`. Since `b` is now equal to `d`, the conditions relating to `d` and `b` remain true. The output state will reflect the change in the value of `b`, while `n` and `d` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `d` is an integer equal to `list_divisors[2]`, `list_divisors` is a list with at least 3 elements, `b` is equal to `d`.**
