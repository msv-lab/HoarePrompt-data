Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `d` is less than `b`, `d` is the third element of `list_divisors`, and `list_divisors` has at least 3 elements. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a` and divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to be equal to `d`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a` but not divisible by `a`, the value of `a` remains unchanged. If `d` is less than `a`, the value of `a` also remains unchanged.***
