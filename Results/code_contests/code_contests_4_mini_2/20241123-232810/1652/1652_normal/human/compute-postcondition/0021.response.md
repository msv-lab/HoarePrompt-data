Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `d` is an integer equal to `list_divisors[2]`, and `list_divisors` is a list with at least 3 elements. If `d` is less than `b`, `d` is greater than or equal to `a`, and `d` is divisible by `a` (i.e., `d % a == 0`), then `a` is updated to the value of `d`. If `d` is not divisible by `a`, the value of `a` remains unchanged.***
