The code assigns the result of `map(int, line.strip().split(' '))` to `list_divisors`. Since `line` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine what `list_divisors` will contain. The variables `n`, `d`, `nb_test`, `idx`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state indicates that `list_divisors` is derived from an undefined `line`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `d` is a list of `n` integers, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 2, `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and `list_divisors` is derived from an undefined `line`.**
