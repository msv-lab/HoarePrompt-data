Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `d` is the third element of `list_divisors`, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 2, `b` is defined, `d` is less than `b`, and if `d` is greater than or equal to `a`, then if `a` is defined and `d` is divisible by `a`, `a` is set to `d`. If `a` is undefined or if `d` is not divisible by `a`, `a` remains unchanged.***
