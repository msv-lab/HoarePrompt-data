`b` is assigned the value of `d`, and `d` is the fourth element in the `divisors` list. The values of `n`, `divisors`, and `idx` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `divisors` is a list of at least 5 integers, `d` is the fourth element in `divisors`, `idx` is 3, and `b` is equal to `d`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `divisors` is a list of at least 5 integers, `d` is the fourth element in `divisors`, `idx` is 3, and `b` is equal to `d`.**
