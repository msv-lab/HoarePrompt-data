Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `divisors` is a list of at least 3 integers, and `idx` is increased by 1. If `d` (the third element in the `divisors` list) is greater than or equal to `b`, and `d` is divisible by `b`, then `b` is assigned the value of `d`. If `d` is not divisible by `b` but is divisible by `a`, then `a` is set to `d`. If `d` is neither divisible by `b` nor divisible by `a`, `a` remains unchanged. This captures all scenarios based on the divisibility conditions of `d` with respect to `b` and `a`.***
