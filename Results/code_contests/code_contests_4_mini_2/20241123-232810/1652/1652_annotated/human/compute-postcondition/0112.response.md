The variable `a` is assigned the value of `d`. The value of `d` is known to be greater than or equal to `a` and less than `b`, and `d` is divisible by `a`. Since `d` is assigned to `a`, the previous conditions still hold, but now `a` takes the value of `d`. The values of `n`, `divisors`, `idx`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `divisors` is a list of at least 3 integers, `d` is the first element in `divisors[2:]`, `idx` is the new value reflecting the next line to be read, `a` is `d`, and `b` remains the same.**
