Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `divisors` is a list of at least 4 integers, `d` is the fourth element in `divisors`, and `idx` is 3. If `d` is divisible by `b`, then `b` is updated to the value of `d`. If `d` is not divisible by `b` but is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`. If `d` is neither divisible by `b` nor `a`, both `a` and `b` remain unchanged.***
