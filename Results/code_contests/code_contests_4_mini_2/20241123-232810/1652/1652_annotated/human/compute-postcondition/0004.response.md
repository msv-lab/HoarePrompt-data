The code assigns the result of `map(int, line.strip().split(' '))` to `list_divisors`. This means that `list_divisors` will be an iterable that applies the `int` function to each element of the list created by splitting `line` (which is read from `sys.stdin`) into parts based on whitespace. The current values of `n`, `divisors`, `nb_test`, and `idx` are not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is dictated solely by the assignment to `list_divisors` and the values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 128, `divisors` is a list of n integers, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is an integer not equal to 0, and `list_divisors` is an iterable of integers from the input line.**
