Functionality: ** The function reads multiple lines of input, where each line contains a list of positive integers. For each line, it identifies the two smallest numbers from the list, referred to as `a` and `b`, and updates them based on the conditions provided. It checks if subsequent numbers in the list are divisible by `a` or `b`, and updates the values of `a` and `b` accordingly. The function outputs the final values of `a` and `b` for each line processed. Note that if there are fewer than two integers in the input line, the function does not output anything. Additionally, the function does not handle any potential input errors, such as non-integer values.**
