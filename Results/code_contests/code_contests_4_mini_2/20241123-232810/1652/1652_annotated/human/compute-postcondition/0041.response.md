Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `divisors` is a list of at least 4 integers, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is an integer not equal to 0, and `d` is the fifth element in `divisors`. If `a` is divisible by `d`, then `a` is set to the value of `d`; otherwise, the value of `a` remains unchanged.***
