To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the given conditions and the loop statement carefully.

1. The loop iterates over `list_divisors[2:]`, which starts from the third element of the `list_divisors` (index 2) and goes to the end of the list.
2. At the end of the previous iteration, we have the following states:
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 128\).
   - `divisors` is a list of at least 4 integers.
   - `d` is the new first element in `divisors[3:]`.

Given that `divisors` has at least 4 integers, `divisors[3:]` will contain at least one integer. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that there are still elements left in `divisors` starting from index 2.

Since `d` is currently the first element of `divisors[3:]`, for the loop to continue, we need to adjust `d` to reflect the next value in `divisors[2:]`. This means that `d` must now reference the next integer in the `list_divisors` after the one currently assigned to it.

If `divisors` has a total of \(m\) integers, the index of the last possible value for `d` in `divisors[2:]` is \(m - 1\). Therefore, to allow the loop to execute again, we need to ensure that the next iteration of `d` is taken from the sequence of integers in `divisors` that have not yet been processed.

Thus, assuming `d` is currently pointing to an element at index 3 of `divisors`, we need to increment the index for the next iteration. 

To summarize:
- The value of `d` must be updated to be the next integer in `divisors[3:]`.
- The number of integers in `divisors` needs to be at least 4 to ensure that there are still elements to process.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `divisors` is a list of at least 4 integers, `d` is the next integer in `divisors[3:]`.**
