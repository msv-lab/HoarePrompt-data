Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `divisors` is a list of at least 2 integers, and `idx` is the new value reflecting the next line to be read. If `idx` is not equal to 0, the first two integers from `divisors` are assigned to `a` and `b` in non-decreasing order, and the subsequent integers in `divisors` are processed to potentially update `a` and `b` based on their divisibility. The final values of `a` and `b` are outputted in the format '%d %d\n'. If `idx` is equal to 0, the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and nothing is output. The program accounts for cases where `divisors` may contain multiple integers, ensuring proper handling of all divisibility conditions.***
