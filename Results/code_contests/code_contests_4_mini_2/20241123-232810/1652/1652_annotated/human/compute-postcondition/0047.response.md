Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, and `divisors` is a list of at least 2 integers. If `idx` is not equal to 0, the values of `a` and `b` are determined from the first two integers of `list_divisors`, maintaining their order such that `a` is less than or equal to `b`. The subsequent integers in `list_divisors` may update `a` and `b` based on divisibility conditions, ensuring that `a` and `b` remain the two smallest divisors from the list that satisfy the conditions stated. The final values of `a` and `b` are printed in the format '%d %d\n'. If `idx` is equal to 0, no changes are made to `a` and `b`, and no output occurs.***
