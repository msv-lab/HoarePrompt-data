The variable `a` is assigned the value of `d`. Since `d` is the fourth element in the list `divisors`, its value is determined by that element. The values of `n`, `divisors`, and `idx` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state will reflect the values of these variables as they were, along with the newly assigned value of `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `divisors` is a list of at least 5 integers, `d` is the fourth element in `divisors`, `idx` is 3, and `a` is equal to `d`.**
