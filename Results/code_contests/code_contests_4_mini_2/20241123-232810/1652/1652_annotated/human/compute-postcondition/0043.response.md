Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `divisors` is a list of at least 4 integers, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is an integer not equal to 0, and `d` is the fifth element in `divisors`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, it is checked for divisibility by `b` and `a`, potentially updating `b` or `a` accordingly. After these checks, the values of `a` and `b` are adjusted based on their comparison. If `d` is not greater than or equal to `b` but is greater than or equal to `a`, and if `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`. In all cases, if no conditions are satisfied for updating `a` or `b`, their values remain unchanged. All updates respect the initial constraints imposed by the precondition.***
