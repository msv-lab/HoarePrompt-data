Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `divisors` is a list of at least 4 integers, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is an integer not equal to 0, and `d` is the fourth element in `divisors`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, the value of `b` may be updated to `d` if `d` is divisible by `b`, or the value of `a` may be updated to `d` if `d` is divisible by `a`. After this, `a` and `b` are assigned values based on their comparison. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a` but not divisible by `a`, `a` remains unchanged. If `d` is less than both `a` and `b`, both values remain unchanged. The values of `a` and `b` are adjusted based on the conditions stated, ensuring that their relative values may change depending on the comparisons and divisions with `d`.***
