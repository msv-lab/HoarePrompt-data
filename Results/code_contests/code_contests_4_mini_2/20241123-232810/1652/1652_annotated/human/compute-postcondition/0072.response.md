In the given code, `a` is assigned the value of `d`. Since `d` is defined as the fourth element in the `divisors` list, `a` will take that specific value. The variables `n`, `divisors`, and `idx` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. 

Therefore, the output state reflects that `a` is now equal to `d`, while the other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `divisors` is a list of at least 4 integers, `d` is the fourth element in `divisors`, `idx` is 3, `a` is equal to `d`**.
