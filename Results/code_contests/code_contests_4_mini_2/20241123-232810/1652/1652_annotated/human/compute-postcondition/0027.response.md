Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `divisors` is a list of at least 4 integers, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is an integer not equal to 0, and `d` is the fourth element in `divisors`. If `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is set to `d`. If `d` is not divisible by `a`, the value of `a` remains unchanged.***
