Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `divisors` is a list of at least 2 integers, and `idx` has been increased by 1. If `idx` is not 0, the program processes `divisors` to determine the two smallest integers `a` and `b` from the list based on their divisibility by subsequent elements. The program outputs the final values of `a` and `b`, where `a` is the smallest divisor and `b` is the second smallest divisor, ensuring that `a` ≤ `b`. If no valid divisors are found, the output may retain initial values for `a` and `b`.***
