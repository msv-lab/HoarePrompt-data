The variable `a` is assigned the value of `d`, and since `d` is the third element in the list `divisors`, it holds a specific integer value that satisfies the conditions given (greater than or equal to `b`, not divisible by `b`, and divisible by `a`). The states of the other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 128, `divisors` is a list of at least 3 integers, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is an integer not equal to 0, `d` is the third element in `divisors`, and `a` is equal to `d`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 128, `divisors` is a list of at least 3 integers, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is an integer not equal to 0, `d` is the third element in `divisors`, `a` is equal to `d`**
