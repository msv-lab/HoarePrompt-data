The variable `a` is assigned the value of `d`, which is the fourth element in the list `divisors`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `divisors` is a list of at least 4 integers, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is an integer not equal to 0, and `a` is equal to `d`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `divisors` is a list of at least 4 integers, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is an integer not equal to 0, and `a` is equal to `d**
