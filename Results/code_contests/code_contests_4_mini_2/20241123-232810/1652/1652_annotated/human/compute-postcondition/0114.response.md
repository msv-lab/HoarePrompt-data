Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `divisors` is a list of at least 3 integers, and `d` is the first element in `divisors[2:]`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a` and `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a` but not divisible by `a`, then the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and `d` continues to satisfy the condition of being less than `b`. In all cases, if `a` was originally greater than `b`, they have been swapped, ensuring that the final values reflect the initial conditions. Additionally, `d` must always be less than `b`.***
