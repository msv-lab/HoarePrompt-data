According to the code, the loop iterates over `list_divisors` starting from the third element (index 2). For the loop to execute, `list_divisors` must contain at least 3 elements because the slicing operation `list_divisors[2:]` will only return elements if there are elements at index 2 and beyond. 

Given that `divisors` is a list of at least 2 integers, we need to ensure that the length of `divisors` is at least 3. Additionally, since `idx` is increased by 1, it suggests that `idx` may be used to track the current position in some context, but it does not directly affect the loop execution here. 

Therefore, the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute are:
1. Ensure that `divisors` contains at least 3 integers (so that `list_divisors` has at least 3 elements).
2. Set `d` to the third element in `list_divisors`.

Assuming that `list_divisors` is the same as `divisors`, we have:
State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `divisors` is a list of at least 3 integers, `idx` is increased by 1, `d` is the third element in the divisors list**
