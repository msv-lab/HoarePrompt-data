Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `divisors` is a list of at least 3 integers, `d` is the first element in `divisors[2:]`, `idx` reflects the next line to be read, `a` and `b` are integers, and the values of `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`; otherwise, `a` and `b` remain unchanged.**
