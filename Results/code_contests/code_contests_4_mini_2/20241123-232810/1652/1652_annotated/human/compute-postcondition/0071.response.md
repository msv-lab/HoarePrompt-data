The variable `b` is assigned the value of `d`, which is the fourth element in the list `divisors`. The state of `n`, `divisors`, and `idx` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `divisors` is a list of at least 4 integers, `d` is the fourth element in `divisors`, `idx` is 3, and `b` is equal to `d`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `divisors` is a list of at least 4 integers, `d` is the fourth element in `divisors`, `idx` is 3, and `b` is equal to `d**
