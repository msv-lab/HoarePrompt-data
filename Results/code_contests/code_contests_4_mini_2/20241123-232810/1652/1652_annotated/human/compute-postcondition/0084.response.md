Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `divisors` is a list of at least 5 integers, `d` is the fourth element in `divisors`, and `idx` is 3. If `d` is divisible by `b`, then `b` is set to `d`. If `d` is not divisible by `b` and if `a` is divisible by `d`, then `a` is set to `d`. If neither condition is met, the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.***
