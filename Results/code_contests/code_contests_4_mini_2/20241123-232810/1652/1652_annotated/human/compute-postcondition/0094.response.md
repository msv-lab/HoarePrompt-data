The code increments the value of `idx` by 1. The previous value of `idx` is not given, but it is stated that `idx` has been increased by 1. Other variables, such as `n`, `divisors`, `a`, and `b`, are not affected by this increment operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `idx` while retaining the initial conditions of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `divisors` is a list of at least 2 integers, `idx` has been increased by 1.**
