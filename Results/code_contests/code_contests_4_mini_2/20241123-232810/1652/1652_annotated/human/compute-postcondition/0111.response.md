Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `divisors` is a list of at least 3 integers, `d` is the first element in `divisors[2:]`, `idx` is the new value reflecting the next line to be read, `a` and `b` are swapped if `a > b`, otherwise they remain the same. The value of `d` is greater than or equal to `a` and less than `b`. Additionally, `d` is divisible by `a` (i.e., `d % a == 0`).***
