The variable `b` is assigned the value of `d`, which is the fifth element in `divisors`. The other variables (`n`, `divisors`, `nb_test`, and `idx`) are not affected. Therefore, the output state will reflect the assignment of `b` while maintaining the values of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `divisors` is a list of at least 4 integers, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is an integer not equal to 0, `d` is the fifth element in `divisors`, and `b` is the value of `d`.**
