Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `divisors` is a list of at least 4 integers, and `d` is the fourth element in `divisors`. If `a` is such that `d` is divisible by `a` (i.e., `d % a == 0`), then `a` is assigned the value of `d`. If `d` is not divisible by `a`, the value of `a` remains unchanged.***
