According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `list_divisors`. The slicing operation `list_divisors[2:]` means that the loop will iterate over the elements of `list_divisors` starting from the index 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `list_divisors` must contain at least 3 elements (since the index starts from 0). 

Given that `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 128, this means `divisors` should contain at least 3 integers. Since `idx` is not equal to 0, it does not directly affect the loop's ability to execute. However, we should also account for the fact that `d` will be initialized to the first element of the sliced list.

Thus, the necessary adjustments for the state are that `list_divisors` must have at least 3 elements, and `d` will be initialized with the value of the third element in `list_divisors`. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 128, `divisors` is a list of at least 3 integers, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is an integer not equal to 0, `d` is the third element in `list_divisors`**
