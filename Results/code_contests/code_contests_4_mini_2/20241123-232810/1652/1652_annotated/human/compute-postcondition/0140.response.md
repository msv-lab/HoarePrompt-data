The value of `idx` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `idx` is unknown. This means that the new value of `idx` will be greater than 0 if it was initially greater than or equal to 0. Since there is no further output or change to `a` and `b`, we conclude that they remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `divisors` is a list of at least 2 integers, `idx` is increased by 1, and `a` and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `divisors` is a list of at least 2 integers, `idx` is increased by 1, and `a` and `b` remain unchanged.**
