Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `divisors` is a list of at least 3 integers, `d` is the first element in `divisors[2:]`, `idx` is the new value reflecting the next line to be read, and `a` and `b` are swapped if `a > b`. If `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`. If `d` is not divisible by `a`, the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and `d` continues to satisfy the condition of being greater than or equal to `a` and less than `b`.***
