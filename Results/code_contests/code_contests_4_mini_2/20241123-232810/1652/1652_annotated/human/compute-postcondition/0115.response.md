Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `divisors` is a list of at least 3 integers, and `d` is the first element in `divisors[2:]`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, and if `d` is divisible by `b`, then `b` is updated to `d`. If `d` is not divisible by `b` but is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`. Regardless, after this block, `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` was originally greater than `b`. If `d` is less than `b` but greater than or equal to `a`, and if `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`. If `d` is not divisible by `a`, the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged. In all scenarios, the relationships between `a`, `b`, and `d` reflect the conditions set by the initial precondition, ensuring that `d` remains less than `b`.***
