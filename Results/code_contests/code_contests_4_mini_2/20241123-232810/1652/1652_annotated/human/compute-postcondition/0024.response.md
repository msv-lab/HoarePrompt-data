To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let’s analyze the given conditions step by step.

1. **Understanding the Loop Execution**: The loop iterates over `list_divisors[2:]`, meaning it starts from the third element of `list_divisors` (index 2) and continues until the end of the list. 

2. **Current State**: 
   - `d` is currently the third element in `divisors`.
   - `divisors` contains at least 3 integers, so `list_divisors` has at least 3 elements.
   - Since `n` is an integer between 2 and 128, it does not affect the loop directly.
   - `idx` is not equal to 0, which does not influence the loop iteration either.
   - `nb_test` is 0, but this variable does not affect the loop's ability to run.

3. **Loop Continuation**: For the loop to execute again, there must be more elements in `list_divisors` beyond the current index of `d` (which is `list_divisors[2]`). 

4. **Current Value of `d`**: The value of `d` must be from `divisors`, specifically the third element. Assuming that `d` is at index 2 in `list_divisors`, for the loop to continue, `list_divisors` must have at least 4 elements.

5. **Adjusting the State**: 
   - Since `d` is the third element in the list, if we want to prepare for the next iteration, `d` will need to be set to the next element in `list_divisors`, which will be the fourth element at index 3.
   - Thus, for the loop to execute again, `list_divisors` must have at least 4 elements.

6. **Final Adjustments**: 
   - The state of `d` should be set to the fourth element in `list_divisors`, which means `d` needs to be adjusted accordingly to represent this next element.
   - The list `divisors` must contain at least 4 integers to ensure the loop can iterate again.

Based on this analysis, the adjusted state is as follows:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `divisors` is a list of at least 4 integers, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is an integer not equal to 0, and `d` is the fourth element in `divisors`.**
