Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `divisors` is a list of at least 3 integers, `d` is the first element in `divisors[2:]`, `idx` reflects the next line to be read, `a` and `b` are integers with `b` being updated to `d` if `d` is divisible by `b`, otherwise `a` is updated to `d` if `d` is divisible by `a`. If neither condition holds, `a` and `b` remain unchanged. Additionally, since `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, it also implies that `d` is at least equal to `b` when `b` is updated.***
