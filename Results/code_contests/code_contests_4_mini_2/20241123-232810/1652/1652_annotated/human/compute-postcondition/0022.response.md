Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `divisors` is a list of at least 3 integers, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is an integer not equal to 0, `d` is the third element in `divisors`, and `d` is less than `b`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a` and divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a` but not divisible by `a`, the value of `a` remains unchanged. In all other cases where `d` is less than `a`, the value of `a` also remains unchanged. This ensures that `a` is adjusted only when appropriate, while still respecting the bounds established by `a` and `b`.***
