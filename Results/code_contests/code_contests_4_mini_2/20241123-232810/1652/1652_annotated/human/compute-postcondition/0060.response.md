Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `divisors` is a list of at least 3 integers, and `idx` is increased by 1. If `d` is the third element in the `divisors` list, `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, `d` is not divisible by `b`, and `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is set to `d`. If `d` is not divisible by `a`, then `a` remains unchanged.***
