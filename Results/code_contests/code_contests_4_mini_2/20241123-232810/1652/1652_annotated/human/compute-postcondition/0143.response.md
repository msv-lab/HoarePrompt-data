The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n`, which is an integer constrained such that \(2 \leq n \leq 128\), and `divisors`, which is a list containing `n` integers \(d_i\) where each \(d_i\) is a positive integer constrained such that \(1 \leq d_i \leq 10^4\) and is a divisor of either \(x\) or \(y\). The function does not return a value specified in the output; hence, we cannot describe the return value at this moment. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept an integer `n` within the specified range and a list of positive integers `divisors` that meet the given constraints. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 128) and a list of n positive integers divisors (1 ≤ d_i ≤ 10^4) that are divisors of either x or y.**
