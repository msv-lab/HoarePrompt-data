The variable `a` is assigned the value of `d`, which is the new first element in `divisors[3:]`. The values of `n` and `divisors` remain unchanged, but `a` now holds the value of `d`. Therefore, the output state reflects the values of the variables after assignment.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `divisors` is a list of at least 4 integers, `a` is equal to `d`**
