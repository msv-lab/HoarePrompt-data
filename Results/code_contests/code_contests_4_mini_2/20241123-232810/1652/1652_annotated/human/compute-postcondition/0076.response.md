The variable `a` is assigned the value of `d`, which is the fourth element in the list `divisors`. The value of `d` is defined in relation to the `divisors` list, but the exact integer value of `d` is not specified beyond being an integer. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `divisors` is a list of at least 4 integers, `d` is the fourth element in `divisors`, `idx` is 3, and `a` is assigned the value of `d`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `divisors` is a list of at least 4 integers, `d` is the fourth element in `divisors`, `idx` is 3, and `a` is assigned the value of `d`.**
