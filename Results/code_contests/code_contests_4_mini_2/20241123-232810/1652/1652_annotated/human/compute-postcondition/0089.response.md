Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `divisors` is a list of at least 5 integers, `d` is the fourth element in `divisors`, and `idx` is 3. If `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, if `d` is divisible by `b`, then `b` is set to `d`; if not, and if `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is set to `d`. The values of `a` and `b` may be swapped depending on their relative sizes. If `d` is less than `b` but greater than or equal to `a`, and `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is set to `d`; otherwise, `a` remains unchanged. If `d` is less than both `a` and `b`, then both `a` and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, `a` and `b` are updated based on the conditions involving `d`, with all cases considered, including when `d` is equal to `a` or `b` and when `d` is not divisible by either.***
