Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `divisors` is a list of at least 3 integers, `idx` is increased by 1, and `d` is the third element in the `divisors` list with `d` less than `b`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a` and `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a` but not divisible by `a`, then `a` remains unchanged. If `d` is less than `a`, then `a` also remains unchanged.***
