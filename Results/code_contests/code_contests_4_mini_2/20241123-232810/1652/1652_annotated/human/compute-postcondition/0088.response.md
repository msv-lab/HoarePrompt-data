Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `divisors` is a list of at least 5 integers, `d` is the fourth element in `divisors`, and `idx` is 3. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a` and `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is set to `d`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a` but not divisible by `a`, then `a` remains unchanged. If `d` is less than `a`, the value of `a` remains unchanged.***
