The variable `b` is assigned the value of `d`, which is the new first element in the list `divisors[3:]`. The value of `d` is derived from the portion of the `divisors` list starting from the fourth element onward, but the specific value of `d` is not given in the initial state. Therefore, while `b` will hold the value of `d`, the overall state of `n` and `divisors` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128; `divisors` is a list of at least 4 integers; `b` is assigned the value of `d`**
