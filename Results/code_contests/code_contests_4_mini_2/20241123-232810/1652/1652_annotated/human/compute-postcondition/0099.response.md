According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `list_divisors`. The loop iterates over `list_divisors` starting from the third element (index 2). For the loop to be executed, `list_divisors` must contain at least 3 integers (since the slicing starts from index 2). 

Given that `divisors` is stated to be a list of at least 2 integers, we can deduce that `list_divisors` should have at least 3 integers for the loop to execute.

Additionally, `idx` reflects the next line to be read and does not affect the loop execution directly. The values of `a` and `b` do not influence whether the loop executes but their states need to be clarified.

So, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `list_divisors` has at least 3 elements, and we can set `d` to the first element of the sliced list (i.e., the third element of the original list).

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `divisors` is a list of at least 3 integers, `d` is the first element in `list_divisors[2:]`, `idx` is the new value reflecting the next line to be read, `a` and `b` are swapped if `a > b`, otherwise they remain the same**.
