The variable `a` is assigned the value of `d`. The value of `d` is defined as the third element in the `divisors` list, and it is known that `d` is greater than or equal to `a`, less than `b`, and divisible by `a`. The value of `n` is also within the specified range, but it is not directly affected by this assignment. The previous state of `a` is unknown, but it is now set to the current value of `d`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `divisors` is a list of at least 3 integers, `idx` is increased by 1, `d` is the third element in the `divisors` list, and `a` is now equal to `d`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `divisors` is a list of at least 3 integers, `idx` is increased by 1, `d` is the third element in the `divisors` list, and `a` is now equal to `d`**
