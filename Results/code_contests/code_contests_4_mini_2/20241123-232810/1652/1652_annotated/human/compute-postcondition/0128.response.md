The variable `a` is assigned the value of `d`, which is the next integer in the list `divisors` starting from the fourth element (index 3). The value of `d` is determined by the contents of the `divisors` list. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment and the values of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128; `divisors` is a list of at least 4 integers; `d` is the next integer in `divisors[3:]`; `a` is assigned the value of `d`.**
