According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input from `sys.stdin`. The loop reads lines from standard input, and it will continue executing as long as there are lines available to read. 

Given that `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 128, and we have an initialized index `idx` set to 0, we need to ensure that the state allows for the loop to begin execution. Specifically, we need to ensure that there is at least one line available in `sys.stdin` for the loop to execute at least once.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, we need to confirm that `sys.stdin` contains at least one line of input. 

The adjusted state should reflect that:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 128, `divisors` is a list of n integers, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 0, and `sys.stdin` has at least 1 line of input**
