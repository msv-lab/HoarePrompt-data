Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `divisors` is a list of at least 3 integers, `idx` is increased by 1, `d` is the third element in the `divisors` list, the value of `d` is greater than or equal to `a`, `d` is less than `b`, and `d` is divisible by `a` (i.e., `d % a == 0`)***
