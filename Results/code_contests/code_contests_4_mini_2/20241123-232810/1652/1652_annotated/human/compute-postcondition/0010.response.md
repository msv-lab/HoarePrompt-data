The value of `b` is assigned the value of `d`. The variable `d` is given as the third element in the `divisors` list and has specific constraints. However, the values of `n`, `divisors`, `nb_test`, `idx`, and the specific value of `d` are not provided in this context, so they remain unchanged. The output state reflects the assignment of `d` to `b`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 128, `divisors` is a list of at least 3 integers, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is an integer not equal to 0, `d` is the third element in `divisors`, `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, and `d` is divisible by `b`; `b` is assigned the value of `d`.**
