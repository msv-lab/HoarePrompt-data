Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `divisors` is a list of at least 4 integers, and `d` is the next integer in `divisors[3:]`. If `d` is divisible by `b`, then `b` is assigned the value of `d`. If `d` is not divisible by `b` but is divisible by `a`, then `a` is assigned the value of `d`. If `d` is neither divisible by `b` nor by `a`, then both `a` and `b` remain unchanged.***
