The variable `nb_test` is initialized to 0. This assignment does not change any other variables in the state. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 128, the list of divisors contains n integers d_i where each d_i is a positive integer (1 ≤ d_i ≤ 10^4) that is a divisor of either x or y, and `nb_test` is 0.
