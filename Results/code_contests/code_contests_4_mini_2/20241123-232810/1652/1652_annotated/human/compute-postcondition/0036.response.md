The variable `a` is assigned the value of `d`, which is the fifth element in the list `divisors`. The previous values of the affected variables are as follows: 

- `n` remains unchanged as an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128.
- `divisors` remains unchanged as a list of at least 4 integers.
- `nb_test` remains unchanged as 0.
- `idx` remains unchanged as an integer not equal to 0.
- The value of `d` is determined from the list `divisors`.

After execution, the output state reflects the assignment of `d` to `a`. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `divisors` is a list of at least 4 integers, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is an integer not equal to 0, `d` is the fifth element in `divisors`, and `a` is equal to `d`.**
