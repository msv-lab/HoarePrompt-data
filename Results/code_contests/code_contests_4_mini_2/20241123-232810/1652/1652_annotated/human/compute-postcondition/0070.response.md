According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `list_divisors`. The loop iterates over the elements in `list_divisors` starting from index 2. At the end of the last iteration, `idx` has been increased by 1, which means it is currently equal to 3 (since it started at 2). To execute the loop one more time, `list_divisors` must have at least 4 elements, and the next value of `d` should be the fourth element in the `list_divisors`.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `list_divisors` has at least 4 integers, and `d` must be the fourth integer in `list_divisors`. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `divisors` is a list of at least 4 integers, `d` is the fourth element in `divisors`, `idx` is 3**
