The values of `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`, otherwise they remain the same. Since `a` is defined as the first element of `list_divisors` and `b` as the second element, their exact values influence the output state. The other variables `n`, `divisors`, `nb_test`, and `idx` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state will reflect the possible values of `a` and `b` based on their initial comparison.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 128; `divisors` is a list of n integers; `nb_test` is 0; `idx` is an integer not equal to 0; `a` and `b` are either swapped or remain the same based on their initial values.**
