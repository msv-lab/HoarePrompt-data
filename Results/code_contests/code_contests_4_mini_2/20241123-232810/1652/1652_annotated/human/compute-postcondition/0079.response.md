Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `divisors` is a list of at least 4 integers, `d` is the fourth element in `divisors`, and `idx` is 3. If `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, then if `d` is divisible by `b`, `b` is updated to `d`; if `d` is not divisible by `b` but is divisible by `a`, `a` is updated to `d`. After this, the values of `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`. If `d` is less than `b` but greater than or equal to `a`, `a` is updated to `d` if `d` is divisible by `a`, otherwise `a` remains unchanged. In all cases, if `d` is less than both `a` and `b`, neither variable is updated, and their values remain unchanged.***
