The variable `b` is assigned the value of `d`, which is the fourth element in the list `divisors`. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed, and the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignments made.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `divisors` is a list of at least 4 integers, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is an integer not equal to 0, `d` is the fourth element in `divisors`, and `b` is assigned the value of `d`.**
