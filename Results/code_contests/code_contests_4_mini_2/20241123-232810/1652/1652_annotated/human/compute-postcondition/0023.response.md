Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `divisors` is a list of at least 3 integers, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is an integer not equal to 0, and `d` is the third element in `divisors`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, and if `d` is divisible by `b`, then `b` is set to `d`. If `d` is not divisible by `b` but divisible by `a`, then `a` is set to `d`. After these checks, `a` and `b` are exchanged if `a` is greater than `b`. If `d` is less than `b` but greater than or equal to `a`, and if `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is set to `d`. In all other scenarios where `d` is less than `a`, both `a` and `b` remain unchanged. This ensures that `a` and `b` are only modified when appropriate, reflecting the relationships established by the values of `d`, `a`, and `b`.***
