The variable `list_divisors` is assigned the value of `map(int, line.strip().split(' '))`. This operation takes a line of input, removes any leading or trailing whitespace with `strip()`, splits the line into a list of strings based on spaces with `split(' ')`, and then converts each of those strings into an integer using `map(int, ...)`. The specific values of `n`, `divisors`, and `idx` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `list_divisors` is created from the processed `line`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `divisors` is a list of at least 2 integers, `idx` is the new value reflecting the next line to be read, and `list_divisors` is created from the processed `line`.**
