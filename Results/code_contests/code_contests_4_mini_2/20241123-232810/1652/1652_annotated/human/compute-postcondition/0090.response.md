To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we analyze the provided program state and the for loop statement.

1. **State at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 128\)
   - `divisors` is a list of at least 5 integers
   - `d` is the fourth element in `divisors`
   - `idx` is 3

2. **For loop statement**:
   ```
   for d in list_divisors[2:]:
       # the loop body is omit
   ```

3. **Understanding the loop**:
   - The loop iterates over `list_divisors[2:]`, starting from the index 2 of `list_divisors`.
   - The current value of `d` is the fourth element of `divisors`, which corresponds to `list_divisors[3]` (since list indexing starts at 0).

4. **Determining the next value of `d`**:
   - Since the current index (`idx`) is 3, the next value of `d` in the next iteration will be `list_divisors[4]`. 
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `list_divisors` must contain at least 5 elements.

5. **Adjusting the states**:
   - We need to ensure that `d` will now be the fifth element in the `divisors` list. Thus, we need to state that `d` is the fifth element in `divisors` and `idx` is updated to 4 for the next iteration.

Considering these points, the required adjustments are:

- `d` should reflect the fifth element in the `divisors` list.
- `idx` should be updated to 4.

Final state adjustments:
State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `divisors` is a list of at least 6 integers, `d` is the fifth element in `divisors`, `idx` is 4**
