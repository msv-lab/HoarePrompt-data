Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `divisors` is a list of at least 5 integers, `d` is the fourth element in `divisors`, and `idx` is 3. If `a` is divisible by `d`, then `a` is assigned the value of `d`. If `a` is not divisible by `d`, the value of `a` remains unchanged.***
