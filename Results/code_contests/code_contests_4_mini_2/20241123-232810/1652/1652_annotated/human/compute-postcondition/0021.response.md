Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `divisors` is a list of at least 3 integers, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is an integer not equal to 0, `d` is the third element in `divisors`, `d` is less than `b`, and `d` is greater than or equal to `a`. If `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`. Otherwise, the value of `a` remains unchanged, ensuring that `d` is still within the bounds defined by `a` and `b`. This captures scenarios where `d` is equal to `a` or greater than `a` but not divisible by `a`.***
