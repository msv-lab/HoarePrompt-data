According to the code, the loop iterates over the lines from standard input (sys.stdin). The loop will continue executing as long as there are more lines to read from input. 

At the end of the last iteration, `idx` has been increased by 1, indicating that the loop has processed one line. To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we consider the state of input. Since `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128 and `divisors` is a list of at least 2 integers, these conditions do not directly affect the input lines.

However, since `idx` has been increased by 1, we need to adjust it to reflect the next line that will be processed. Assuming there is still at least one line left to read from input, `idx` should be set to its new value. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `idx` should be adjusted to reflect that it now points to the next line. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `divisors` is a list of at least 2 integers, `idx` is the new value reflecting the next line to be read**
