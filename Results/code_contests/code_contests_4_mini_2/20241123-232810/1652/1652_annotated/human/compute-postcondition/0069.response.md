Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `divisors` is a list of at least 3 integers, and `idx` is increased by 1. If `d`, the third element in `divisors`, is greater than or equal to `b`, then if `d` is divisible by `b`, `b` is updated to `d`; otherwise, if `d` is divisible by `a`, `a` is updated to `d`. After evaluating these conditions, `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`, or they remain unchanged. If `d` is less than `b`, and if `d` is greater than or equal to `a` and divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`; otherwise, `a` remains unchanged if `d` is less than `a`. All cases ensure that both `a` and `b` are updated or remain unchanged based on the given conditions.***
