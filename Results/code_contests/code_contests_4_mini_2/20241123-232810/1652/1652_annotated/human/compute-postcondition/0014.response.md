Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `divisors` is a list of at least 3 integers, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is an integer not equal to 0, `d` is the third element in `divisors`, `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, and `d` is not divisible by `b`. If `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`. Otherwise, `a` remains unchanged, maintaining the original value.***
