Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `divisors` is a list of at least 4 integers, and `d` is the next integer in `divisors[3:]`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, then if `d` is divisible by `b`, `b` is updated to `d`; if not, but `d` is divisible by `a`, `a` is updated to `d`. After these checks, `a` and `b` may be swapped depending on their values. If `d` is less than `b` but greater than or equal to `a`, and if `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`. If `d` is less than both `a` and `b`, then both variables remain unchanged. In all cases, if neither condition is met, the values of `a` and `b` remain the same.***
