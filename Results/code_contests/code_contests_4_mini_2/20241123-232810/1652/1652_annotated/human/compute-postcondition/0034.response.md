According to the code, the loop iterates over the elements of `list_divisors` starting from the third element (index 2). The loop will execute again as long as there are more elements in `list_divisors` to iterate over.

Given that the state at the end of the previous iteration indicates that `d` is currently the fourth element in `divisors`, and `idx` is an integer not equal to 0, we need to determine the state of `list_divisors` at the start of the next iteration.

Since `d` is the fourth element, it implies that `list_divisors` has at least 4 elements. For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that there is at least a fifth element in the list. Therefore, `d` should be updated to the fifth element of `list_divisors`, which we can denote as `d` being the next element in the list.

As we have no information that would change the values of `a`, `b`, or `nb_test` during this iteration, those states will remain the same.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `divisors` is a list of at least 4 integers, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is an integer not equal to 0, and `d` is the fifth element in `divisors`.**
