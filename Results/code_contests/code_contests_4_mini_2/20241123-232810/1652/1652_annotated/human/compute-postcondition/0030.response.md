The variable `a` is assigned the value of `d`, which is the fourth element in the `divisors` list. The values of `n`, `nb_test`, `idx`, and the `divisors` list remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the value of `d` being assigned to `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `divisors` is a list of at least 4 integers, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is an integer not equal to 0, `d` is the fourth element in `divisors`, and `a` is assigned the value of `d`.**
