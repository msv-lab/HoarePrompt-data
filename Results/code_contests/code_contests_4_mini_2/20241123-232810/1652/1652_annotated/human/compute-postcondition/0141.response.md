According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the input from `sys.stdin`. The loop will continue to execute as long as there is more input available. 

At the end of the last iteration, the state indicates that `idx` has been increased by 1. Since `idx` is increased by 1, it suggests that the loop has processed one line of input. For the loop to execute one more time, there must still be more lines available in `sys.stdin`.

No changes are required for `n`, `divisors`, `a`, and `b` since they are not affected by the loop iteration itself. The only relevant state that needs to be noted is that `idx` should reflect the next line of input it will read.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `idx` should be increased by 1 again, and we need to ensure that there is still input available.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `divisors` is a list of at least 2 integers, `idx` is increased by 1, and `a` and `b` remain unchanged**
