Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `divisors` is a list of at least 4 integers, and `d` is the new first element in `divisors[3:]`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, then if `d` is divisible by `b`, `b` is updated to `d`; if `d` is not divisible by `b` but is divisible by `a`, `a` is updated to `d`. After this, the values of `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`. If `d` is less than `b` but greater than or equal to `a`, and if `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`. In all other cases, the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged. This captures all edge cases regarding the relationships and divisibility of `a`, `b`, and `d`.***
