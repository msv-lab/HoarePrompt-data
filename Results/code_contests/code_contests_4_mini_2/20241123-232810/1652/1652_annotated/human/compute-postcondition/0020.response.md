The variable `a` is assigned the value of `d`. Since `d` is the third element in `divisors` and is known to be within the constraints provided (i.e., it is less than `b`, greater than or equal to `a`, and divisible by `a`), this assignment will set `a` to the specific value of `d`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 128, `divisors` is a list of at least 3 integers, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is an integer not equal to 0, `d` is the third element in `divisors`, and `a` is equal to `d`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 128, `divisors` is a list of at least 3 integers, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is an integer not equal to 0, `d` is the third element in `divisors`, and `a` is equal to `d`**
