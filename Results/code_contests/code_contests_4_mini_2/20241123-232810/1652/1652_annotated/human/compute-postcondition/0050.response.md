The code assigns `list_divisors` to the result of mapping the `int` function over the stripped and split contents of `line`, which is read from standard input. The values in `line` will be converted into integers and stored in `list_divisors`. The variable `n` remains unchanged, as does `idx`, which has been increased by 1. The initial state mentions that there is at least one more line in `sys.stdin`, indicating that `line` contains some input to process.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `divisors` is a list of at least 2 integers, `idx` is increased by 1, and `list_divisors` is a list of integers obtained from splitting and converting the next line of input.**
