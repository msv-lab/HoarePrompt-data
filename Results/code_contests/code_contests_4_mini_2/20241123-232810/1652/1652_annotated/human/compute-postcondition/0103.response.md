Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `divisors` is a list of at least 3 integers, `d` is the first element in `divisors[2:]`, `idx` is the new value reflecting the next line to be read, `a` and `b` are integers such that `a` remains the same and `b` remains the same, and `d` is not divisible by `b` (i.e., `d % b != 0`)***
