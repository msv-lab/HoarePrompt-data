The value of `a` is assigned the value of `d`. The previous state indicates that `d` is the third element in the `divisors` list, but we do not have the specific value of `d`. Other variables are not affected by this assignment, so the output state reflects the changes.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `divisors` is a list of at least 3 integers, `idx` is increased by 1, `d` is the third element in the `divisors` list, `a` is equal to `d`, `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, `d` is not divisible by `b`, and `d` is divisible by `a` (i.e., d % a == 0)**
