Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128; `divisors` is a list of at least 3 integers; `d` is the first element in `divisors[2:]`; `idx` is the new value reflecting the next line to be read; `a` is `d`; `b` is an integer such that `d` is not divisible by `b` (i.e., `d % b != 0`), and `d` is divisible by `a` (i.e., `d % a == 0)**
