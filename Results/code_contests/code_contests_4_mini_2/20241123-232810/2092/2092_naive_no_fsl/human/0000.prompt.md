You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Once Bob got to a sale of old TV sets. There were n TV sets at that sale. TV set with index i costs ai bellars. Some TV sets have a negative price — their owners are ready to pay Bob if he buys their useless apparatus. Bob can «buy» any TV sets he wants. Though he's very strong, Bob can carry at most m TV sets, and he has no desire to go to the sale for the second time. Please, help Bob find out the maximum sum of money that he can earn.

Input

The first line contains two space-separated integers n and m (1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 100) — amount of TV sets at the sale, and amount of TV sets that Bob can carry. The following line contains n space-separated integers ai ( - 1000 ≤ ai ≤ 1000) — prices of the TV sets. 

Output

Output the only number — the maximum sum of money that Bob can earn, given that he can carry at most m TV sets.

Program:

r = lambda : map(int, raw_input().split())
(a, b) = r()
print - sum(sorted(r())[:b])
```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
