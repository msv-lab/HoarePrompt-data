The function accepts input for two integers, `a` and `b`, and a list of integers. It calculates the sum of the smallest `b` integers from the list and prints the negative of that sum. However, the function does not explicitly handle the case where `b` is greater than the number of integers provided, which could lead to an error or unexpected behavior. Additionally, the function does not return any value; it only prints the result.
