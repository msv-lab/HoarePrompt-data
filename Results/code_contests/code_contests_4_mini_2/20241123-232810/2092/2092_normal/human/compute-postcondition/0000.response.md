The code defines a lambda function `r` that takes no arguments and uses `raw_input()` to accept a line of input, splits it into separate string components, and then maps each component to an integer. The variables `n`, `m`, and `ai` are not directly affected by this line of code, as it only defines a function. 

Therefore, the output state remains unchanged regarding `n`, `m`, and `ai`, but we note that the function `r` is now available for use to read and process input in the future.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 100, and `ai` is a list of integers where each element `ai` satisfies -1000 ≤ ai ≤ 1000; `r` is a lambda function defined to read input**
