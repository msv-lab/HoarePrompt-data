The function `func` does not explicitly accept parameters as inputs. Instead, it operates on two integer variables `n` and `m`, which must satisfy the constraints 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 100. Additionally, the function works with a list of integers `ai`, where each element of `ai` must satisfy the condition -1000 ≤ ai ≤ 1000. 

The function's return value is not specified in the output provided. Therefore, without specific details on the return value, we can only describe the accepted parameters and their constraints.

Functionality: **The function operates on integers n and m (where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list of integers ai (where each element -1000 ≤ ai ≤ 1000). The specific return value is not defined in the information provided.**
