To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we need to analyze the operation step by step.

1. **Understanding Initial State**:
   - `n` and `m` are integers with constraints 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 100.
   - `ai` is a list of integers where each element satisfies -1000 ≤ ai ≤ 1000.
   - `a` and `b` are inputs read from the lambda function `r()`. 

2. **Code Execution**: 
   - The code `print - sum(sorted(r())[:b])` does the following:
     - Calls the lambda function `r()` which returns a list of integers.
     - Sorts that list in ascending order.
     - Slices the first `b` elements from the sorted list.
     - Sums those `b` smallest elements.
     - Negates the sum (i.e., multiplies it by -1).
     - Finally, it prints the negated sum.

3. **Output State**:
   - The operation affects the state of the output by providing the result of the print statement. The variables `n`, `m`, `ai`, `a`, and `b` retain their values, but we now have a result from the executed code based on the list returned by `r()`.

Since the specific values of the list from `r()` and the input `b` are not provided, we cannot give a numeric output for the sum. Therefore, we state the output generically.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 100; `ai` is a list of integers where each element satisfies -1000 ≤ ai ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are inputs read from the lambda function `r()`; the output is -sum(sorted(r())[:b])**.
