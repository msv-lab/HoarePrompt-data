Functionality: ** The function accepts no direct parameters and reads a series of integers from input. It processes these integers to calculate the sum of the smallest `b` integers from a list of `n` integers, where `b` is derived from the input. It then prints the negative of this sum. The function does not perform input validation or handle any edge cases regarding the constraints specified in the annotations. **
