The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its signature. However, it operates under the constraints that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n, and `ai` are integers such that -1000 ≤ ai ≤ 1000 for each TV set indexed by `i`. 

Since the function does not take parameters but relies on these constraints, the output behavior is presumed to depend on some internal logic or data structure within the function, which is not provided.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is not fully describable without additional context regarding how it utilizes `n`, `m`, and `ai`. However, it can be inferred that it processes these values in some capacity based on the defined constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts no direct parameters but operates under the constraints that n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), m is an integer (1 ≤ m ≤ n), and ai are integers (-1000 ≤ ai ≤ 1000 for each TV set i). The specific output behavior is not defined without further information on how these values are utilized.**
