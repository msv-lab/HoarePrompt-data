Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`; `ai` are integers such that -1000 ≤ `ai` ≤ 1000 for each TV set `i`; `r` is a lambda function that maps input from `raw_input()` to integers; `a` and `b` are assigned values from the lambda function `r()` which processes the input.**
