Postcondition: ***`t` is a deque containing the indices of 'T' characters, `m` is a deque containing the indices of non-'T' characters in `s`, and `poss` is a boolean value. If `poss` is true and `len(t)` is less than 2, `arr` is a list of zeros, `poss` remains true, and both `t` and `m` remain unchanged. If `len(t)` is at least 2, `arr` contains the first `len(t) // 2` elements of `m`, `poss` reflects the cumulative result of the comparisons between each element in `arr` and the first elements of `t`, with `t` having `len(t) - len(t) // 2` elements remaining and `m` having `len(m) - len(t) // 2` elements remaining. If `poss` was initially true, it will be updated based on the comparisons made during the loop; otherwise, it retains its original value.***
