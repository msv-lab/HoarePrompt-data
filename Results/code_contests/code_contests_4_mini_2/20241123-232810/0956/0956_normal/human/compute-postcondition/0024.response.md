Postcondition: ***`args` is a list with at least one element, `at_start` is False after the loop executes. If `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` evaluates to True, the file output buffer is flushed. If `kwargs` does not contain 'flush' or it is set to False, the file output buffer remains unchanged. The elements of `args` will be written to the file, separated by `sep` for elements after the first, and the value of `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` is written to the file.***
