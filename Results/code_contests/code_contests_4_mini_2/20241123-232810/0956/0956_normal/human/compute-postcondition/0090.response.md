Output State: **`t` is a list containing the indices of 'T' characters in the string `s`, `m` is a list containing the indices of characters in `s` that are not 'T', `n` remains unchanged, and `poss` reflects the result of the comparisons made in the previous code execution. The function returns 'YES' if `poss` is true; otherwise, it returns 'NO'.**
