According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and the result of `len(t) // 2`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(t) // 2`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to be 1. Since `len(t) // 2` does not change, it remains the same. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`m` is unchanged, `n` is unchanged, `poss` is updated based on comparison, `arr` is initialized as a list of zeros with length equal to len(t) // 2, `i` is 1, `arr[i]` is assigned the value from `m.popleft()`**
