The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input. The previous value of `n`, which was the length of the string `s`, is now replaced by the new integer input. The other variables `t`, `m`, and `poss` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `n` and the unchanged states of the other variables.

Output State: **`t` is greater than the previous count, `m` contains the indices of 'M' characters in `s`, `n` is an input integer, `poss` remains unchanged**
