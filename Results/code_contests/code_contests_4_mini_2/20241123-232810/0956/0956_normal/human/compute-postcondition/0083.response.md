According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `arr` variable. Specifically, if `arr` has at least one more element, the loop will continue. At the end of the last iteration, `t` has at least 1 element after `popleft`, which indicates that it was used in the loop body, but `arr` remains unchanged. Since `i` takes on each element of `arr` for the loop, we need to ensure that the next element of `arr` is taken into account for the next iteration.

Since `i` will take the next element of `arr` in the subsequent iteration, we also need to know what that next element is. However, we cannot determine any specific changes to `m`, `n`, or `poss` without knowing the contents of `arr` and how `t` interacts with it.

Thus, we can summarize the required adjustments as follows: for the loop to run again, `i` should be updated to the next element in `arr`, and since `arr` remains unchanged, it will still contain its original elements. The state of `t` and `m` may not impact the next iteration directly unless further specified in the loop body, but we do know that `m` was reduced by `len(t) // 2`, and `t` has at least 1 element. 

Therefore, we ensure `i` corresponds to the next index in `arr`, which can be inferred as `i` being the next element in the array.

State: **`t` has at least 1 element after popleft, `arr` remains unchanged, `m` is reduced by `len(t) // 2`, `n` remains unchanged, `poss` is updated based on the comparison `i < t.popleft()`, `i` is the next element in `arr`**
