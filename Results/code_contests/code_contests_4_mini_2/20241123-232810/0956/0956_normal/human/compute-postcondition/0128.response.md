According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `arr`. For the loop to execute again, `arr` must contain at least 1 more element. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` contains at least 1 element, and `i` will take the next element in `arr`. 

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state of `arr` to reflect that it has at least 2 elements, and the variable `i` will point to the next element in `arr`.

Thus, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `arr` has at least 2 elements, and `i` should be the next element in `arr`.

State: **`len(t) >= 2, poss reflects the comparison of the first elements of t and m, arr contains at least 2 elements, t has len(t) - len(t) // 2 elements remaining, m has len(m) - len(t) // 2 elements remaining, poss is updated based on the first element of t being compared to i, i is the next element in arr`**
