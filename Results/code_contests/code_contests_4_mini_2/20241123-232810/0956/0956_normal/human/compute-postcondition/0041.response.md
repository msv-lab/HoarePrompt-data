`poss` is updated based on the comparison of `i` and the first element of `t`. The expression `i < t.popleft()` checks if `i` is less than the first element of `t`, and `t.popleft()` also removes that first element from `t`. The previous values of `i` and `t` are used for this comparison. Other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the output state is: `t` has at least 0 elements left, `i` is the third element of `arr`, and `poss` is updated based on the comparison of `i` and the first element of `t` after `t.popleft()`. 

Output State: **`t` has at least 0 elements left, `i` is the third element of `arr`, and `poss` is updated based on the comparison of `i` and the first element of `t` after `t.popleft()`**.
