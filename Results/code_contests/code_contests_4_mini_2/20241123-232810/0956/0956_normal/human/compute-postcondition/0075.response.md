The code `arr[i] = m.popleft()` will update the list `arr` at index `i` with the value obtained from `m` using the `popleft()` method, which removes and returns the first element of the `m` list. 

- `arr` is a list that initially contains the value from `m` at index 0.
- The operation `m.popleft()` removes the first element of `m` and assigns it to `arr[i]`.
- Since `i` is 1, the value at index 1 of `arr` will be updated with the first element of `m`.

The values of `t`, `n`, and `poss` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. The output state will reflect the new value in `arr` at index `i`.

Output State: **`t` is a list with at least 4 indices, `m` is a list of indices in `s` that are not 'T', `n` remains unchanged, `arr` is updated at index 1 with the first element of `m`, `i` is 1, and `poss` is unchanged.**
