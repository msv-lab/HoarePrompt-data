The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `s`. The parameter `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000. The parameter `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n < 10^5 and is divisible by 3. The parameter `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'T' and 'M'. 

The function returns a value based on the input parameters, but the specific return value is not provided. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept the integer parameters `t` and `n`, as well as the string `s`, which is comprised of characters 'T' and 'M', while adhering to the specified constraints for these parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters t (an integer between 1 and 5000), n (an integer between 3 and less than 100,000, divisible by 3), and s (a string of length n composed of characters 'T' and 'M').**
