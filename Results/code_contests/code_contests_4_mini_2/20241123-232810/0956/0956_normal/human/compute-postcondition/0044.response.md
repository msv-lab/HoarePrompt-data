Postcondition: ***`t` contains the indices of 'T' characters in `s`, `m` contains the indices of 'M' characters in `s`, `n` is the length of the string `s`, and `poss` is a boolean indicating if twice the length of `m` is equal to the length of `t`. If `poss` is True, then after executing the loop, `arr` contains the first half of the indices removed from `m`, `poss` is updated to reflect whether each element of `arr` is less than the corresponding element from `t`, and `t` retains at least `len(t) - len(arr)` elements. If `poss` is False or if the length of `t` is less than 2, `poss` remains unchanged, `m` remains unchanged, and `arr` is a list of zeros with length equal to `len(t) // 2`.***
