The code `t.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the deque `t`. Since `i` is currently 0, the value 0 will be added to `t`. The other variables remain unchanged. Thus, after the execution, `t` will contain one element, which is 0.

Output State: **`t` is a deque containing 0, `m` is an empty deque, `n` remains unchanged, `poss` reflects previous comparisons, `s` is a non-empty string, `i` is 0, `si` is the first character of `s`, and `si` is equal to 'T'**
