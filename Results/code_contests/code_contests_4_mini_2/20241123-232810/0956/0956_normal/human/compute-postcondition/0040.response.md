According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `arr`. If `arr` has at least one more element, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the second element of `arr`. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `arr` must have at least three elements, and `i` needs to be updated to the third element of `arr`.

State: **`t` has at least 0 elements left, `i` is the third element of `arr`, `poss` is updated based on the comparison of `i` and the first element of `t`.**
