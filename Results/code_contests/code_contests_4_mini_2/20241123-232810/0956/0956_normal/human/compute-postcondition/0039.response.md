The line of code `poss &= i < t.popleft()` performs a comparison between the value of `i` and the first element of `t` (which is removed from `t` using `popleft()`). 

1. The expression `t.popleft()` removes and returns the first element of `t`.
2. The comparison `i < t.popleft()` evaluates to either `True` or `False`.
3. The result of this comparison is combined with the current value of `poss` using the `&=` operator, which performs a bitwise AND operation, updating `poss` based on the previous value and the result of the comparison.

Since `i` is the second element of `arr` and `t` has at least one element, the output state will reflect the new value of `poss` after the operation, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` has at least 0 elements left, `i` is the second element of `arr`, and `poss` is updated based on the comparison of `i` and the first element of `t`.**
