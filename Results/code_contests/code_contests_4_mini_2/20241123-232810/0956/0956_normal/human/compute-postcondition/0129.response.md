In the given code snippet, `poss` is updated based on the comparison of the first element of `t` (which is removed from the front of the deque) with `i`. The `popleft()` method removes and returns the first element of `t`, and `i < t.popleft()` evaluates to either `True` or `False`, depending on the values of `i` and the first element of `t`. The value of `poss` is then updated using the bitwise AND operator `&=`, which means `poss` will retain its previous value only if both it and the result of the comparison are `True`.

Since the initial state specifies that `len(t) >= 2`, `t` has at least two elements, and `m` and `arr` are not directly affected by this operation, their states remain unchanged. The state of `t` will change as its first element is removed.

Therefore, the output state is: `len(t) >= 1 after popleft; poss is updated based on comparing the first element of `t` to `i`; `arr` remains unchanged, and `m` remains unchanged`.

Output State: **`len(t) >= 1 after popleft; poss is updated based on comparing the first element of t to i; arr` remains unchanged, and `m` remains unchanged**.
