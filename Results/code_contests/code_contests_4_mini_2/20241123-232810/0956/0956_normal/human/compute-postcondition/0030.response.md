The value of `arr[i]` is assigned the value from `m.popleft()`. The initial state indicates that `m` is unchanged, and since `arr` is initialized as a list of zeros with a length equal to `len(t) // 2`, the value of `arr[i]` will be updated to the first element removed from `m`. The variable `i` is 1, meaning `arr[1]` will hold the value obtained from `m.popleft()`. The states of `n`, `poss`, and other elements of `arr` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `m` is unchanged, `n` is unchanged, `poss` is updated based on the comparison with `t.popleft()`, and `arr[1]` is assigned the value from `m.popleft()`.

Output State: **`m` is unchanged, `n` is unchanged, `poss` is updated based on comparison with `t.popleft()`, `arr[1]` is assigned the value from `m.popleft()`**
