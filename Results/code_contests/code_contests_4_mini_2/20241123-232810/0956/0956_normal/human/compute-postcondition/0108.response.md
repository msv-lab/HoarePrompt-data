The code `m.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `m`. Since `i` is 2, this means that 2 will be added to the list `m`. The previous values of `m` were 0 and 1, and after appending 2, the values will be updated to include 2. The state of `t` and `si` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` contains 0 and 1; `m` contains 0, 1, and 2; `i` is 2; `si` is the third character of the string `s`**
