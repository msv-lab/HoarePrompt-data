The `append` method adds the value of `i` to the list `t`. The value of `i` is 2, and `t` initially contains 0 and 1. After executing the code, `t` will now contain 0, 1, and 2. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` contains 0, 1, 2; `m` contains 0 and 1; `i` is 2; `si` is the third character of the string `s`**
