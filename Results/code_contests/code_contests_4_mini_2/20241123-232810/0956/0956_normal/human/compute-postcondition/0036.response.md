To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, we analyze the given conditions:

1. The loop iterates over `arr`, which is populated based on the length of `t`.
2. The loop executes if and only if the length of `t` is at least 2. If `t` has fewer than 2 elements, the loop will not execute.
3. If the loop is to execute, then `arr` must be populated with elements, which is done based on the processing of `t` and `m`.

Given these points, for the loop to execute:

- The length of `t` must be at least 2.
- The variable `i` will represent each element of `arr` during the loop's execution.

Thus, we need to ensure that `t` has at least 2 elements, and we also need to initialize `arr` appropriately (it should contain the first `len(t) // 2` elements, which would imply that `arr` has been populated correctly).

So, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure:
- Length of `t` is at least 2.
- `i` is the first element of `arr` (which will be populated based on the conditions stated).

State: **`t` has at least 2 elements, `i` is the first element of `arr`**
