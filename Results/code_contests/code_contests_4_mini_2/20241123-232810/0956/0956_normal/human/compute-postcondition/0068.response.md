Postcondition: ***`t` is a list containing the indices of 'T' characters in the string `s`, `m` is a list containing the indices of characters in `s` that are not 'T', `n` remains unchanged, and `len(m) * 2` is equal to `len(t)`, indicating a specific relationship between the counts of 'T' and non-'T' characters in `s`.***
