According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the list `arr`. If `len(t)` is less than 2, the loop does not execute, and `arr` remains a list of zeros. To ensure the loop executes, the condition `len(t) >= 2` must be satisfied, which means `arr` must contain elements. Given that the loop iterates over `arr`, we can conclude that `arr` should have at least 1 element. 

Furthermore, the state of `poss` will depend on the comparison of the first elements of `t` and `m` during the iterations. We must also consider that after the loop runs, the lengths of `t` and `m` will be adjusted based on `len(t) // 2`.

To summarize, for the loop to execute:
- `len(t)` must be at least 2,
- `poss` reflects the comparison of the first elements of `t` and `m`,
- `arr` must contain the first `len(t) // 2` elements of `m`.

Thus, the adjusted state should reflect these conditions.

State: **`len(t) >= 2, poss reflects the comparison of the first elements of t and m, arr contains at least 1 element, t has len(t) - len(t) // 2 elements remaining, m has len(m) - len(t) // 2 elements remaining`**
