According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `arr`. If `arr` has at least 2 elements, the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the first element of `arr`, and `t` has at least 1 element left. However, `i` being the first element means that for the loop to execute one more time, `arr` must have at least 2 elements, and `i` must be updated to the second element of `arr`.

State: **`t` has at least 1 element left, `i` is the second element of `arr`, and `poss` is updated based on the comparison of `i` and the first element of `t`.**
