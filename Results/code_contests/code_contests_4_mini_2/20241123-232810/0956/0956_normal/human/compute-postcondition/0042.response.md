According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `arr`. If `arr` has at least one more element, the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the third element of `arr`, which means there are at least three elements in `arr`. For the loop to execute one more time, `arr` must have at least four elements, and `i` should be updated to the fourth element of `arr`.

State: **`t` has at least 0 elements left, `i` is the fourth element of `arr`, and `poss` is updated based on the comparison of `i` and the first element of `t` after `t.popleft()`**
