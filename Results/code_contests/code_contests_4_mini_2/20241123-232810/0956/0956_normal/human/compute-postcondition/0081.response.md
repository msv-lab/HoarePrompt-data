According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `t`. If the length of `t` is at least 2, then the loop can execute. The loop will run `len(t) // 2` times, which means:

1. `arr` must contain the first `len(t) // 2` elements from `m`.
2. `poss` will be updated based on comparisons between elements popped from `t` and the first element of `m`.
3. The length of `t` will be reduced by `len(t) // 2`.
4. The length of `m` will also be reduced by `len(t) // 2`.
5. `n` remains unchanged.

To ensure the loop executes, the states need to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`t` has at least 2 elements, `arr` contains the first `len(t) // 2` elements from `m`, `poss` is updated based on comparisons, `m` is reduced by `len(t) // 2`, `n` remains unchanged**
