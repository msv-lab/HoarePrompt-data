Output State: **`t` is a deque containing the indices of 'T' characters in the string `s`, `m` is a deque containing the indices of 'M' characters in `s`, `n` is the length of the string `s`, and `poss` is a boolean indicating whether the conditions are satisfied (true if valid pairing exists, otherwise false). If `t` has an unequal number of 'T' characters compared to 'M' (specifically, if `len(m) * 2 != len(t)`), the loop will not execute further checks and `poss` will be false, leading to an output of 'NO'. If `s` contains neither 'T' nor 'M', the loop will execute but `t` and `m` will be empty, resulting in `poss` being false.**
