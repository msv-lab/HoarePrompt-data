Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than the previous count, if the first element of `s` (si) is equal to 'T', then `t` contains the value 0 appended to it; otherwise, `m` has the value of `i` (which is 0) appended to it. The integers `n` and `poss` remain unchanged, `s` is a non-empty user input, and `i` is 0.***
