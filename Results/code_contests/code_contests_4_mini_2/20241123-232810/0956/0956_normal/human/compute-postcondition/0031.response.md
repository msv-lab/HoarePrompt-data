According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the list `t`. The loop iterates for half the length of `t`, specifically for `len(t) // 2` times. 

At the end of the last iteration, since `i` is already in the range of `len(t) // 2`, to allow the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `len(t)` is at least 2 more than it was at the beginning of the last iteration. This means that `len(t)` must be increased to allow for the loop to iterate one more time.

Since `i` is currently at a value that has already iterated through the first half of `t`, the next value for `i` should be `i + 1`. Therefore, `i` needs to be adjusted to reflect the next iteration.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `len(t)` must be increased by at least 2 (so that `len(t) // 2` becomes larger).
- `i` must be incremented by 1 to indicate the next iteration.

State: **`m` is unchanged, `n` is unchanged, `poss` is updated based on comparison with `t.popleft()`, `arr[1]` is assigned the value from `m.popleft()`, `len(t)` is increased to at least 2, `i` is incremented by 1**
