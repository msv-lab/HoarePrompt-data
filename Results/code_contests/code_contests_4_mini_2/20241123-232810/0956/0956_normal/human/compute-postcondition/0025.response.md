The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters directly, but it operates based on the following constraints: `t` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n < 10^5 and n is divisible by 3, and a string consisting of characters 'T' and 'M' with length `n`. 

The output is not explicitly provided in the information given, so we cannot determine the return values or conditions. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is based on these constraints.

Functionality: **The function operates based on the constraints of `t` being an integer between 1 and 5000, `n` being an integer such that 3 <= n < 10^5 and divisible by 3, and a string consisting of 'T' and 'M' characters with length `n`. The specific return value or behavior is not defined.**
