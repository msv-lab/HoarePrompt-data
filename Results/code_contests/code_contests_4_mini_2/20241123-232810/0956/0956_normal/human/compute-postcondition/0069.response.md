The code initializes `arr` as a list of zeros. The length of `arr` is determined by half the length of `t`, which is derived from the relationship given that `len(m) * 2` is equal to `len(t)`. Therefore, `len(t)` is an even number. This means that `arr` will have a size of `len(t) // 2`. The previous values of `t` and `m` are not directly affected, and `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a list containing the indices of 'T' characters in the string `s`, `m` is a list containing the indices of characters in `s` that are not 'T', `n` remains unchanged, and `arr` is a list of zeros with length equal to len(t) // 2**
