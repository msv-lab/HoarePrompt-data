According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `arr`. The loop will continue executing as long as there are more elements in `arr` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the next element in `arr`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be updated to the next element in `arr`, and it needs to be ensured that there is at least one more element in `arr` after the current `i`. 

Since `m` is reduced by `len(t) // 2` and `n` remains unchanged, these states do not need to be adjusted. The key adjustment is to ensure that `i` is set to the next element in `arr`, and that `arr` has more elements remaining.

State: **`arr` remains unchanged, `m` is reduced by `len(t) // 2`, `n` remains unchanged, `poss` is updated based on the comparison `i < t.popleft()`, `i` is the next element in `arr` (after the current element)**
