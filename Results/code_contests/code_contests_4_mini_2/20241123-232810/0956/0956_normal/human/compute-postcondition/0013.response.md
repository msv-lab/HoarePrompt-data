The variable `at_start` is assigned the value `False`. The previous value of `at_start` was `True`, so after this assignment, `at_start` is now `False`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `args`, `x`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= `n` < 10^5 and `n` is divisible by 3, `args` is a list with at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element of `args`, and `at_start` is False.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= `n` < 10^5 and `n` is divisible by 3, `args` is a list with at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element of `args`, and `at_start` is False**
