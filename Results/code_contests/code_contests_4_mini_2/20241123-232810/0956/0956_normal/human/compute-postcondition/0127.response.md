Output State: **`len(t) >= 2`, `poss` reflects the comparison of the first elements of `t` and `m`, `arr` contains at least 1 element, `t` has `len(t) - len(t) // 2` elements remaining, `m` has `len(m) - len(t) // 2` elements remaining, and `poss` is updated based on the first element of `t` being compared to `i`.**
