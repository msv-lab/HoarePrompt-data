According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the length of the list `t`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `len(t) // 2`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, which means the loop has executed once. The condition for the loop to execute again requires that `i` be less than `len(t) // 2`. Since `t` is a list with at least 4 indices, `len(t)` is at least 4, making `len(t) // 2` equal to 2.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 2. 

No other states need to be adjusted since `m`, `n`, `arr`, and `poss` are unchanged and do not affect the loop's ability to continue.

State: **`t` is a list with at least 4 indices, `m` is a list of indices in `s` that are not 'T', `n` remains unchanged, `arr` is updated at index 1 with the first element of `m`, `i` is 2, and `poss` is unchanged**
