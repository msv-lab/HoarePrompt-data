According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the deque `t`. The loop will execute as long as the length of `t` is at least 2 because `len(t) // 2` must be greater than 0 for the range to generate any values. Since `arr` is initialized with a length equal to half the length of `t`, `t` must contain at least 2 indices for the loop to proceed. 

At the end of the last iteration, the index `i` will be equal to `len(t) // 2 - 1`. Therefore, before the loop starts, `t` must contain at least 2 indices, and `i` should be initialized at 0. 

State: **`t` is a deque with at least 2 indices, `m` is a deque containing indices, `poss` is true, `arr` is initialized as a list of zeros with length equal to half the length of `t`, `i` is 0**
