Output State: **If the length of `t` is less than 2, the loop does not execute, and `arr` remains a list of zeros, `poss` remains unchanged, `m` is unchanged, and `n` remains unchanged. If the length of `t` is at least 2, the loop executes len(t) // 2 times, `arr` contains the first len(t) // 2 elements from `m`, `poss` is updated based on comparisons between elements popped from `t` and the first element of `m`, `t` is reduced in size by len(t) // 2, `m` is reduced in size by len(t) // 2, and `n` remains unchanged.**
