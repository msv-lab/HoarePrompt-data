Output State: **`t` is a deque containing the indices of 'T' characters in the string `s`, `m` is a deque containing the indices of non-'T' characters in `s`. If `s` is a non-empty string, the loop executes for each character in `s`, and `i` is the last index of `s`. If `s` is empty, the loop does not execute, and both `t` and `m` remain empty deques.**
