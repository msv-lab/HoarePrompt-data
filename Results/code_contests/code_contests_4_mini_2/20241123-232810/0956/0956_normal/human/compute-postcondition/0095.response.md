The variable `m` is assigned a new empty `deque`. The initial state indicates that `m` was previously a list containing indices, but now it is replaced by an empty `deque`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `poss`, and `s`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is a deque initialized as empty, `m` is an empty deque, `n` remains unchanged, `poss` reflects the result of the comparisons made in the previous code execution, and `s` is an input string.

Output State: **`t` is a deque initialized as empty, `m` is an empty deque, `n` remains unchanged, `poss` reflects the result of the comparisons made in the previous code execution, `s` is an input string**
