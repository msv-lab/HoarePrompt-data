The expression `poss &= i < t.popleft()` uses the bitwise AND assignment operator `&=` to update the value of `poss`. The value of `i` is the first element of `arr`, and `t.popleft()` removes and returns the first element from the deque `t`. 

- `i` is compared to the first element of `t` (let's denote this value as `first_t`).
- The result of the comparison `i < first_t` will yield either `True` (1) or `False` (0).
- `t` will lose its first element after `popleft()`, reducing its size by one.
- The value of `poss` will be updated based on the evaluation of the expression `poss & (result of i < first_t)`.

Since `poss` and `i` are not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine their specific values, but we know that:
- `t` has one less element after the operation.

Therefore, the output state is: `t` has at least 1 element left, `i` is the first element of `arr`, and `poss` is updated based on the comparison of `i` and the first element of `t`.

Output State: **`t` has at least 1 element left, `i` is the first element of `arr`, and `poss` is updated based on the comparison of `i` and the first element of `t`.**
