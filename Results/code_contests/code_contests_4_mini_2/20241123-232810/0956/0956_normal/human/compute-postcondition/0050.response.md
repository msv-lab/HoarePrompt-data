The variable `m` is assigned a new empty deque, which means its previous content is replaced with an empty deque. The other variables remain unchanged as specified. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than the previous count, `m` is an empty deque, `n` is an input integer, `poss` remains unchanged, and `s` is the user input.

Output State: **`t` is greater than the previous count, `m` is an empty deque, `n` is an input integer, `poss` remains unchanged, `s` is the user input**
