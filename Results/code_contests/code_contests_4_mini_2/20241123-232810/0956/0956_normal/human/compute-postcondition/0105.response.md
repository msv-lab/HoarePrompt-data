Postcondition: ***`t` and `m` are deques that contain 0 initially. If the second character `si` of the non-empty string `s` is 'T', then `t` contains 0 and 1 after appending `i`, while `m` remains unchanged. If `si` is not 'T', then `m` contains 0 and 1 after appending `i`, while `t` remains unchanged. In both cases, `i` is 1.***
