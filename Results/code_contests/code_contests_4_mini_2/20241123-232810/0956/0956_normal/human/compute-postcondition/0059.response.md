The value of `m` is modified by appending the value of `i`, which is currently 1. Since `m` previously had the value of 0 appended to it, it will now contain the values [0, 1]. The other variables (`t`, `s`, `n`, and `poss`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is greater than the previous count; `m` is now [0, 1]; `s` is a non-empty user input; `i` is 1; `n` and `poss` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than the previous count; `m` is now [0, 1]; `s` is a non-empty user input; `i` is 1; `n` and `poss` remain unchanged**
