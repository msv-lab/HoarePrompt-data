Output State: **If len(t) is less than 2, the loop does not execute, `poss` remains true, `arr` is a list of zeros, and `t` and `m` are unchanged. If len(t) is at least 2, `poss` reflects the cumulative result of comparisons between each element in `arr` and the first elements of `t`, `arr` contains the first `len(t) // 2` elements of `m`, `t` has `len(t) - len(t) // 2` elements remaining, and `m` has `len(m) - len(t) // 2` elements remaining. The loop will always execute if len(t) is at least 2, and it will update `poss` based on the comparisons made during each iteration.**
