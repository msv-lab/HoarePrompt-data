Postcondition: ***`t` is a list containing the indices of 'T' characters in the string `s`, `m` is a list containing the indices of characters in `s` that are not 'T', and `n` remains unchanged. If `len(t) * 2 == len(m)`, then `arr` is a list of zeros if the length of `t` is less than 2; if the length of `t` is at least 2, `m` is reduced by `len(t) // 2`, and `poss` is updated based on the comparisons made between elements of `arr` and the elements popped from `t`. After the execution, `poss` reflects the result of these comparisons, and `t` has at least `len(t) // 2` elements remaining.***
