According to the code, the loop will execute again as long as there are more elements in `arr`. The variable `i` will take the next value from `arr` during the next iteration. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the current element in `arr`, and the loop continues until all elements in `arr` have been processed. Since `arr` remains unchanged and we do not have the specific number of elements in `arr`, we assume it has at least one more element for the loop to execute again. 

To adjust the state for the next iteration, we need to ensure that `i` moves to the next element in `arr`. Therefore, we need to adjust `i` to be the next element in the list.

State: **`arr` remains unchanged, `m` is reduced by `len(t) // 2`, `n` remains unchanged, `poss` is updated based on the comparison `i < t.popleft()`, and `i` is the next element in `arr`**
