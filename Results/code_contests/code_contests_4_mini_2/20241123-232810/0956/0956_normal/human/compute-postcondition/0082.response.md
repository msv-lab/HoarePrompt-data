The expression `poss &= i < t.popleft()` updates the variable `poss` based on a comparison. The operation `t.popleft()` removes and returns the first element from the deque `t`. The comparison `i < t.popleft()` evaluates to either `True` or `False`, which is then combined with the current value of `poss` using the bitwise AND operator `&=`.

- The value of `i` is compared to the first element of `t`, which is removed from `t`.
- The previous state of `poss` is updated based on this comparison result, but we do not know its previous value.

Thus, `arr`, `m`, and `n` remain unchanged, and only `poss` is affected.

Output State: **`t` has at least 1 element after popleft, `arr` remains unchanged, `m` is reduced by `len(t) // 2`, `n` remains unchanged, and `poss` is updated based on the comparison `i < t.popleft()`.**
