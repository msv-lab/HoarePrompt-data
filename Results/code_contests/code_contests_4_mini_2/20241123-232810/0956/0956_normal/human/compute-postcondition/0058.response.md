The list `t` has the value `i` appended to it. Since `i` is currently 1, the new value of `t` will include this 1 as its last element. The states of `m`, `s`, `n`, and `poss` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated list `t` and the unchanged variables.

Output State: **`t` has 1 appended to it, `m` has the value of 0, `s` is a non-empty user input, `i` is 1, `n` and `poss` remain unchanged**
