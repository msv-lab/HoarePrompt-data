The value of `i` is appended to the deque `m`. Since `i` is currently 0, after execution, `m` will contain one element, which is 0. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a deque initialized as empty, `m` is now a deque containing 0, `n` remains unchanged, `poss` reflects previous comparisons, `s` is a non-empty string, and `i` is 0.

Output State: **`t` is a deque initialized as empty, `m` is now a deque containing 0, `n` remains unchanged, `poss` reflects previous comparisons, `s` is a non-empty string, and `i` is 0**
