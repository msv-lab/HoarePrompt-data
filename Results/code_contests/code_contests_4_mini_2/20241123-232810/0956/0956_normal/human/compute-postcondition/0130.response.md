According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `arr`. The loop will execute as long as there are more elements in `arr` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the current element from `arr`, and since we know `len(t) >= 1 after popleft` and that `poss` is updated based on comparing the first element of `t` to `i`, we need to determine the next values for `i` and ensure that `arr` still has elements left to iterate.

Since `arr` remains unchanged and we are iterating over it, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be updated to the next element in `arr`. Therefore, if `arr` has at least 2 elements, `i` will take the next element in the next iteration. 

State: **`len(t) >= 1 after popleft; poss is updated based on comparing the first element of t to i; arr` remains unchanged, `i` is the next element in arr**
