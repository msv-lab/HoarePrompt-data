Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= `n` < 10^5 and `n` is divisible by 3, `args` is a list with at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element of `args`, and `at_start` is True. If `at_start` is False, then `sep` is written to a file. If `at_start` is True, nothing is written to the file.***
