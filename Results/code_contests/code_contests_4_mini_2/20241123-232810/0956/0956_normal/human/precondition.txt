t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) representing the number of test cases, n is an integer (3 ≤ n < 10^5) for each test case, representing the length of the string, which is guaranteed to be divisible by 3, and s is a string of length n consisting only of the characters 'T' and 'M'. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
