The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, an integer `n` that indicates the length of a string `s`, and a string `s` composed of characters 'T' and 'M'. It checks if there is a valid pairing between 'T' and 'M' such that each 'T' can be matched with two 'M's in sequence. The function returns 'YES' if such pairings exist for each test case or 'NO' if they do not. If the number of 'T's is not exactly twice the number of 'M's, the function immediately concludes 'NO'. Additionally, if both 'T' and 'M' are absent in the string, it also results in 'NO'.
