Precondition: **t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) representing the number of test cases; for each test case, n is an integer (3 ≤ n < 10^5) that is divisible by 3, and s is a string of length n consisting only of the characters 'T' and 'M'. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 10^5.**
