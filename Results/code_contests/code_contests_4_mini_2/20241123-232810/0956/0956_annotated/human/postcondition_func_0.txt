The function accepts no parameters but reads input values: an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads an integer `n` (which must be divisible by 3 and between 3 and 99,999) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of the characters 'T' and 'M'. The function checks if the number of 'M's is half the number of 'T's and that 'T's appear in the correct order relative to 'M's. If these conditions are met, it returns 'YES'; otherwise, it returns 'NO'. However, it does not handle cases where `n` is not divisible by 3, and it does not explicitly handle invalid input formats or values outside the specified range.
