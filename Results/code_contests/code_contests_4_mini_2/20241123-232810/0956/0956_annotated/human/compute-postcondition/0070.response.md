According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `len(t) // 2`. For the loop to execute, `len(t)` must be at least 2, which means the deque `t` should contain at least 2 indices of 'T' characters. 

At the start of the loop, `i` is initialized to -1, but it will be incremented at the beginning of the first iteration, so it will become 0. Thus, before the loop starts, `i` should be set to -1, and we need to ensure that the length of deque `t` is at least 2. 

Therefore, for the loop to be executed, the conditions are that `t` contains at least 2 indices, and `i` is -1. 

State: **`t` is a deque containing at least 2 indices of 'T' characters in `s`, `m` is a deque containing indices of non-'T' characters in `s`, `arr` is a list of zeros with length len(t) // 2, `poss` is true, `n` is 0, `i` is -1**
