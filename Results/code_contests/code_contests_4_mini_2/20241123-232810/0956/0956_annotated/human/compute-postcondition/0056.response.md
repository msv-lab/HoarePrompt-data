Postcondition: ***`t` and `m` are deques. If the first character of `s` (`si`) is 'T', then `t` contains the value of `i` (which is 0), and `m` remains empty. If `si` is not 'T', then `m` contains the value of `i` (which is 0), and `t` remains empty. In both cases, `arr` is a list of zeros, `poss` is true, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, and `s` is an input string with at least 1 character.**
