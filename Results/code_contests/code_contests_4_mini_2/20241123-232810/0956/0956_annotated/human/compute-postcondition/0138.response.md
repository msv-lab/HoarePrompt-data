The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `s`. The parameter `t` is an integer that must be between 1 and 5000. The parameter `n` is an integer that must be between 3 and less than 100,000 (10^5) and must be divisible by 3. The parameter `s` is a string of length `n` that consists solely of the characters 'T' and 'M'. 

The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the conditions described. However, the specific return value based on the input parameters is not provided in the output description.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters t (an integer between 1 and 5000), n (an integer between 3 and less than 100,000 that is divisible by 3), and s (a string of length n consisting solely of 'T' and 'M'). The specific return value based on these parameters is not described.**
