The value of `m` is a deque containing the indices of all characters in `s` that are not 'T'. The `popleft()` method removes and returns the first element from `m`. This value is then assigned to `arr[i]`, where `i` is currently 0. The value at `arr` will be updated to reflect this change, while the state of `m` will be altered since its first element is removed. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`t` is a deque with at least 1 element remaining, `m` is a deque with the first element removed, `arr` has its first element set to the original first element of `m`, `i` is 0**
