Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000), `n` is an integer (3 ≤ `n` < 10^5) divisible by 3, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'T' and 'M', `sep` is ' ', `file` is sys.stdout, `at_start` is False, and `args` has at least one more element remaining. If `at_start` is False, then a space has been written to the output; if `at_start` is True, no output is written.***
