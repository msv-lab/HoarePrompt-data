The value at index `i` of `arr` is assigned the value popped from the left of `m`. Since `i` is -1, this refers to the last element of `arr` (due to Python's negative indexing). The state of `arr` changes as it gets updated with the value from `m`. The values of `t`, `m`, and `poss` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated `arr`, with the last element now holding the value that was popped from `m`.

Output State: **`t` has one less element, `m` is unchanged, `arr` has an updated last element from `m`, `poss` is updated based on the comparison, `n` is 0, `i` is -1**
