According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in `arr`. The loop will continue as long as there are elements in `arr` to iterate over.

At the end of the last iteration, we know:
- `t` is a deque with at least 1 element left, indicating that it hasn't been fully consumed.
- `m` remains unchanged, so it still holds its original value.
- `arr` contains at least 2 elements from `m`, meaning there are at least 2 elements available for the loop to iterate over.
- `poss` has been updated based on `i` (which is currently the next element in `arr`) and the value of the popped element from `t`.

To execute the loop one more time, we need to ensure that `arr` has at least one more element remaining. Since `i` is the next element in `arr`, it means that after the current iteration, `i` will point to the next element in `arr`, which will need to be adjusted accordingly.

Therefore, the adjustments needed are:
- `arr` must now contain at least 3 elements from `m` (since it initially contained at least 2, we need at least one more for the loop to execute again).
- `i` should be set to the next element in `arr`, which will be the element after the current one.

State: **`t` is a deque with at least 1 element left, `m` remains unchanged, `arr` contains at least 3 elements from `m`, `poss` is updated based on the comparison of `i` and the value of the popped element from `t`, and `i` is the next element in `arr` after the current one**
