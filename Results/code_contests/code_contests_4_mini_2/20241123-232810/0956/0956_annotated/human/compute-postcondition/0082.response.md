Output State: **`t` is unchanged or has `len(t) - len(t) // 2` elements, `m` is unchanged or has decreased by `len(t) // 2`, `arr` has the last `len(t) // 2` elements from `m`, `poss` is updated based on comparisons, `n` is 0, `i` is `len(t) // 2 - 1` or `-1`; `poss` is updated with the result of the comparison `i < t.popleft()`**
