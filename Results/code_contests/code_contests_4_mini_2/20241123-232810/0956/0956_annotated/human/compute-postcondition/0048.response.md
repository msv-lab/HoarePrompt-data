The variable `s` is assigned the value of `input()`, which accepts user input as a string. The values of the other variables (`t`, `m`, `arr`, `poss`, `i`, and `n`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables along with the new input string `s`.

Output State: **`t` is a deque containing at least one index of 'T', `m` is a deque containing the indices of all characters in `s` that are not 'T', `arr` is a list of zeros, `poss` is true, `i` is -1, `n` is an input integer, and `s` is an input string.**
