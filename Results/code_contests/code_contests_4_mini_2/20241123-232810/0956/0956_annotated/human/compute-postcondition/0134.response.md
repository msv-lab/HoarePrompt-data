Postcondition: ***`t` contains indices of 'T' characters in `s`, `m` contains indices of non-'T' characters in `s`, `arr` is a list that is either empty or contains the first `len(t) // 2` elements from `m`, depending on the length of `t`. If `len(t)` is at least 2, `poss` reflects whether all elements in `arr` are less than the corresponding elements popped from `t`, and `t` will have at least `len(t) // 2` elements removed. If `len(t)` is less than 2, `t` and `m` remain unchanged, `arr` is an empty list, and `poss` is True.***
