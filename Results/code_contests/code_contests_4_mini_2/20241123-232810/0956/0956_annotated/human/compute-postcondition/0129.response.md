The statement `poss &= i < t.popleft()` updates the value of `poss` based on the comparison of `i` and the first element of `t` after it has been removed (popped). 

1. The first element of `t` is popped, reducing its size by one.
2. The value of `i` is compared to the popped value from `t`.
3. `poss` is updated with a logical AND operation between its current value and the result of the comparison `i < popped_value`.

The previous values are:
- `t` originally had at least 2 elements, and after popping, it will have at least 1 element left.
- `arr` contains the first `(len(t) // 2 + 1)` elements from `m`, and `i` is the second element in `arr`.
- The exact values of `poss`, `i`, and the popped element are not specified, so they remain as variables.

Therefore, the output state after executing the code is: `t` has at least 1 element left, `m` has at least `len(m) - (len(t) // 2) + 1` elements left, `arr` contains the first `(len(t) // 2 + 1)` elements from `m`, `i` is the second element in `arr`, and `poss` is updated based on the comparison of `i` and the popped element from `t`.

Output State: **`t` has at least 1 element left, `m` has at least `len(m) - (len(t) // 2) + 1` elements left, `arr` contains the first `(len(t) // 2 + 1)` elements from `m`, `i` is the second element in `arr`, and `poss` is updated based on the comparison of `i` and the popped element from `t`.**
