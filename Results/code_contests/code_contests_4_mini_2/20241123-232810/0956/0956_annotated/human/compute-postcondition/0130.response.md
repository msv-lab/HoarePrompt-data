To determine the adjusted states for the loop to execute one more time, we analyze the current state and the loop structure.

1. The loop iterates over `arr`, which contains the first `(len(t) // 2 + 1)` elements from `m`.
2. In the last iteration, `i` is assigned the second element in `arr`. This implies that `arr` has at least two elements for the loop to have executed at least once.
3. For the loop to execute one more time, `arr` must contain at least three elements. Given that `arr` originally had `(len(t) // 2 + 1)` elements, we need to ensure that `len(t) // 2 + 1` is at least 3.
4. Since `t` has at least 1 element left, we can describe its state in relation to `len(t)`.

The conditions for the next iteration to occur require:
- `t` must have enough elements (at least 5) to ensure `len(t) // 2 + 1` results in at least 3 elements in `arr`.
- `i` must be adjusted to point to the next element in `arr`, which will be the third element.

Consequently, we conclude:
- `t` must have at least 5 elements.
- `arr` will have at least 3 elements, with `i` being the third element in `arr`.

State: **`t` has at least 5 elements left, `m` has at least `len(m) - (len(t) // 2) + 1` elements left, `arr` contains the first `(len(t) // 2 + 1)` elements from `m`, `i` is the third element in `arr`, and `poss` is updated based on the comparison of `i` and the popped element from `t`.**
