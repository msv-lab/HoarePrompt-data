Postcondition: ***`t` is a deque that contains 1 if `s` starts with 'T', and if `si` (the third character of `s`) is also 'T', then `i` (which is 2) is appended to `t`. If `s` does not start with 'T', then `m` is a deque that contains 1 and now also contains 2, while `arr` remains a list of zeros, `poss` is true, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer, and `si` is the third character of the string `s`.***
