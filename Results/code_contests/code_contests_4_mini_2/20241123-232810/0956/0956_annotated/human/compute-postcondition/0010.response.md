The code `file.write(sep)` writes the value of `sep` to the output file, which is `sys.stdout`. The variable `sep` is a space (' '), and this action does not change the values of any other variables. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000), `n` is an integer (3 ≤ `n` < 10^5) divisible by 3, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'T' and 'M', `sep` is ' ', `file` is sys.stdout, `at_start` is False, `args` has at least one more element remaining, and a space has been written to the output.**
