The code checks whether the double length of the list `m` (which contains indices of non-'T' characters) is equal to the length of the list `t` (which contains indices of 'T' characters). The values of `t` and `m` are not provided explicitly, but we know that if `s` is empty, both `t` and `m` are empty deques, leading to:

- `len(t)` would be 0
- `len(m)` would be 0

Thus, the expression `len(m) * 2 == len(t)` evaluates to `0 * 2 == 0`, which is `True`.

Since this code does not affect the state of `t`, `m`, `arr`, `n`, or `i`, the output state remains unchanged apart from the evaluation of the expression.

Output State: **`t` contains indices of 'T' characters in `s`, `m` contains indices of non-'T' characters in `s`, `arr` remains a list of zeros, `n` is an input integer, `i` is the last index processed, and `poss` is True**
