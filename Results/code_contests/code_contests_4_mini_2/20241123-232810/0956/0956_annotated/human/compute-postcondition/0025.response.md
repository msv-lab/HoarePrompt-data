The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `t` and a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a string `s`. Parameter `t` is a positive integer that represents the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000). For each test case, `n` is an integer that is divisible by 3 and falls within the range of 3 to less than 100,000 (3 ≤ n < 10^5). The string `s` has a length of `n` and consists only of the characters 'T' and 'M'. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 100,000.

The function processes these test cases and returns results based on the values of `n` and `s` for each test case. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts an integer `n` and a string `s`. It processes the input and returns results based on the specified conditions for each test case.**
