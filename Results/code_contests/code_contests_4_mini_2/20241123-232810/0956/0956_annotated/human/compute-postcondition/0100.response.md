The code `m.append(i)` adds the current value of `i` to the deque `m`. Given that `i` is 0, the value appended to `m` will be 0. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is an empty deque, `m` now contains 0, `arr` is a list of zeros, `n` is an input integer, `i` is 0, `s` is an input string with at least 1 character, and `si` is the first character of `s` which is not equal to 'T'.

Output State: **`t` is an empty deque, `m` contains 0, `arr` is a list of zeros, `n` is an input integer, `i` is 0, `s` is an input string with at least 1 character, and `si` is the first character of `s` which is not equal to 'T'**.
