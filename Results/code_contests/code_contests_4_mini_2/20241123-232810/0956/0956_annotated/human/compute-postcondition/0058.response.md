The code `t.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 1) to the deque `t`. The other variables (`m`, `arr`, `poss`, `n`, `s`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated state of `t` with the new value appended.

Output State: **`t` has 1 added to it, `m` is a deque, `arr` is a list of zeros, `poss` is true, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, and `s` is an input string with at least 2 characters**.
