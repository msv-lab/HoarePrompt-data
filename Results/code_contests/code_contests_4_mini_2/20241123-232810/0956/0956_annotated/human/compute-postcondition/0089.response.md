Postcondition: ***`t` and `m` are deques containing indices of 'T' and non-'T' characters in `s`, respectively. If `poss` is true and `len(t) < 2`, then `arr` remains a list of zeros, `n` is 0, and `i` is -1. If `poss` is true and `len(t) >= 2`, then `arr` contains the last `len(t) // 2` elements from `m`, `poss` is updated based on whether the popped elements from `t` are less than the first element of `m` and if the elements in `arr` are less than the elements popped from `t`, `n` is still 0, and `i` is `len(t) // 2 - 1`. Overall, if `poss` is true, it remains true throughout the execution of the program fragment.***
