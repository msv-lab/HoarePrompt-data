Output State: **`t` is a deque containing indices of 'T' characters in the string `s`, `m` is a deque containing indices of non-'T' characters in `s`, `arr` remains a list of zeros, `poss` is true, `n` is the length of string `s`, and `i` is the index of the current character in `s`. If `s` is an empty string, the loop does not execute, leaving `t` and `m` as empty deques, `arr` as a list of zeros, `poss` as true, `i` as -1, and `n` as 0.**
