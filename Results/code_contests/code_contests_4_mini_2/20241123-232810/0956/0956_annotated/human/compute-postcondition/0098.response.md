The code `t.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` to the deque `t`. The initial state indicates that `t` is an empty deque and `i` is 0. After executing the code, `t` will contain the value 0. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`t` is a deque containing 0, `m` is an empty deque, `arr` is a list of zeros, `n` is an input integer, `i` is 0, `s` is an input string with at least 1 character, `si` is the first character of `s`, and `si` is equal to 'T'**.
