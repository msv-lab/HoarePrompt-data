According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`, which is a deque containing the indices of 'T' in the string `s`. The loop will execute as long as there are elements in `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is -1, but this does not affect the loop's ability to execute again because we are not using `i` to control the loop. The condition for the loop to execute one more time is that `t` must still contain at least one index of 'T'.

Since `t` is a deque containing the indices of 'T', for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must have at least one element. Therefore, its state needs to be adjusted to indicate that it contains at least one index.

State: **`t` is a deque containing at least one index of 'T', `m` is a deque containing the indices of all characters in `s` that are not 'T', `arr` is a list of zeros, `poss` is true, and `i` is -1**
