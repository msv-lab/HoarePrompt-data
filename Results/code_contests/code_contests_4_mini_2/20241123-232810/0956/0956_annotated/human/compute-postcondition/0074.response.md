The expression `poss &= t.popleft() < m[0]` updates the value of `poss`. The method `t.popleft()` removes and returns the leftmost element of the deque `t`. The comparison checks if this element is less than the first element of the list `m`. The result of this comparison (True or False) is then combined with the previous value of `poss` using the `&=` operator, which performs a bitwise AND operation.

As `t` has at least 2 elements, `t.popleft()` will successfully remove and return the first element. The values of `m`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` has at least 1 element left, `m` is unchanged, `arr` has an updated last element from `m`, `poss` is updated based on the comparison, `n` is 0, `i` is 0**
