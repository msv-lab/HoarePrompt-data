The code snippet assigns values to `sep` and `file` from the `kwargs` dictionary. The `sep` variable is assigned from `kwargs`, defaulting to a space `' '` if not provided. The `file` variable is assigned from `kwargs`, defaulting to `sys.stdout` if not provided. The values of the other variables `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000); for each test case, `n` is an integer (3 ≤ `n` < 10^5) that is divisible by 3, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'T' and 'M'; `sep` is assigned from kwargs or defaults to ' ', `file` is assigned from kwargs or defaults to sys.stdout.**
