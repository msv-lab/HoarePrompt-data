The operation `t.append(i)` adds the current value of `i` to the deque `t`. The initial state indicates that `i` is 0, so the value appended to `t` will be 0. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is a deque containing the value 0, `m` is an empty deque, `arr` is a list of zeros, `poss` is true, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string with at least 1 character, `si` is the first character of `s`, and `si` is equal to 'T'.

Output State: **`t` is a deque containing 0, `m` is an empty deque, `arr` is a list of zeros, `poss` is true, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string with at least 1 character, `si` is the first character of `s`, and `si` is equal to 'T'**.
