Output State: **`t` is a deque with at least `len(t) - 2` elements remaining, `m` is a deque with its first `len(t) // 2` elements removed, `arr` contains the first `len(t) // 2` elements of `m`, `poss` is a boolean value updated based on the comparisons made during the loop, and `i` is `len(t) // 2 - 1` after the loop concludes. If `len(t)` is less than 2, the loop does not execute, `t` remains unchanged, `m` is unchanged, `arr` remains a list of zeros, `poss` remains true, and `i` is -1.**
