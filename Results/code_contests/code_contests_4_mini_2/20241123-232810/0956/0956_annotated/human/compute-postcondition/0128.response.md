According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `arr` variable. The loop will iterate over each element in `arr`, and for it to execute one more time, `arr` must have at least one more element. 

At the end of the last iteration, `arr` contains the first `len(t) // 2` elements from `m`, and `i` is the first element in `arr`. For the loop to execute an additional time, `arr` must have at least one more element than it did at the end of the previous iteration.

If `arr` currently has `len(t) // 2` elements, then for the loop to run again, `arr` should have at least `len(t) // 2 + 1` elements. This means that `m` must contain at least one more element than it did previously, allowing the loop to incorporate the next element from `m` into `arr`.

Thus, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `arr` should have at least `len(t) // 2 + 1` elements, and `i` should be updated to be the next element in `arr`. 

Given that `i` was previously the first element in `arr`, it should now be the next element which would be the second element in `arr` if we assume it was indexed from zero.

State: **`t` has at least 2 elements, `m` has at least len(m) - (len(t) // 2) + 1 elements left, `arr` contains the first (len(t) // 2 + 1) elements from `m`, `i` is the second element in `arr`, and `poss` is updated based on the comparison of `i` and the first element of `t` after it is popped.**
