The code `arr[i] = m.popleft()` assigns the value of the first element popped from the deque `m` to `arr` at index `i`. 

1. `m` has elements, so `m.popleft()` will successfully remove and return the first element of `m`.
2. The returned value will be assigned to `arr[i]`, where `i` is currently 1.
3. The state of `arr` will change at index `i`, while the other variables remain unaffected.

Given that `n` is 0 and `i` is 1, `arr[1]` will now hold the value of the first element popped from `m`. 

The output state reflects the new value at `arr[1]` based on the element popped from `m`.

Output State: **`t` has at least 1 element left; `m` is unchanged except for the element popped; `arr` has an updated last element from `m`; `poss` is updated based on the comparison; `n` is 0; `i` is 1; `arr[1]` is the first element popped from `m`.**
