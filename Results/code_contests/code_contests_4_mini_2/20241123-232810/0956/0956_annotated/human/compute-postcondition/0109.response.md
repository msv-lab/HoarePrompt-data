Postcondition: ***`t` is a deque that contains 2 if the first character of `s` is 'T' and `si` is 'T'; if the first character of `s` is 'T' but `si` is not 'T', `t` remains unchanged and contains 1. If the first character of `s` is not 'T', `m` now contains `i` appended to it, which is 2, while `t` remains empty. In all cases, `arr` remains a list of zeros, `n` is an input integer, and `i` is 2.***
