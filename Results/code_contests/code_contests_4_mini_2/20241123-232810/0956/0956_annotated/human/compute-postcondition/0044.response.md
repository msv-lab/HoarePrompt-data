Postcondition: ***`t` is a deque containing the indices of 'T' in the string `s`, `m` is a deque containing the indices of all characters in `s` that are not 'T', and `poss` is a boolean value indicating if twice the number of non-'T' characters equals the number of 'T' indices. If `poss` is true and `len(t)` is at least 2, `arr` contains the first half of the indices from `m`, `poss` reflects the result of the comparisons between the indices in `arr` and the popped indices from `t`, and `t` has at least `len(t) - len(arr)` elements left. If `len(t)` is less than 2, the loop does not execute, `t` and `m` remain unchanged, `arr` is a list of zeros, `poss` remains true, and `i` is -1. In all cases, the final state of `t`, `m`, `arr`, and `poss` reflects the outcomes of the comparisons and the initial conditions of the program.***
