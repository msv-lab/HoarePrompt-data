Postcondition: ***`t` is a deque that contains 0 if the first character of `s` is 'T'; otherwise, `m` contains 0 and `t` remains empty. The list `arr` remains a list of zeros, `n` is an input integer, and `i` is 0. Additionally, `s` is an input string with at least 1 character, and `si` is the first character of `s`.***
