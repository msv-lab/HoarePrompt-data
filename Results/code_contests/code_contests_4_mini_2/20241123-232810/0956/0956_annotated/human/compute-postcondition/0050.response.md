The variable `m` is assigned a new empty deque, which means it is now an empty collection. The previous state of `m` is disregarded since it gets reinitialized. The states of the other variables (`t`, `arr`, `poss`, `i`, `n`, and `s`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an empty deque, `m` is an empty deque, `arr` is a list of zeros, `poss` is true, `i` is -1, `n` is an input integer, and `s` is an input string.

Output State: **`t` is an empty deque, `m` is an empty deque, `arr` is a list of zeros, `poss` is true, `i` is -1, `n` is an input integer, and `s` is an input string**
