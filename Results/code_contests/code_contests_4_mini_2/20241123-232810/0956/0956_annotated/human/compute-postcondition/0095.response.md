The variable `m` is assigned a new empty deque, which means it is reset and its previous values are lost. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an empty deque, `m` is an empty deque, `arr` remains a list of zeros, `n` is an input integer, `i` is -1, and `s` is an input string.

Output State: **`t` is an empty deque, `m` is an empty deque, `arr` remains a list of zeros, `n` is an input integer, `i` is -1, and `s` is an input string**
