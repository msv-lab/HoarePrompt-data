According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `t`. The loop iterates `len(t) // 2` times. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is 0, `i` is 1, and `t` has at least 1 element left. Since `i` is 1, the loop has executed once, and for it to execute again, `len(t) // 2` must be at least 2. 

This means that `len(t)` must be at least 4 to satisfy `len(t) // 2 >= 2`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `len(t)` must be at least 4. The variable `i` will be incremented to 2 for the next iteration.

State: **`t` has at least 4 elements left; `m` is unchanged except for the element popped; `arr` has an updated last element from `m`; `poss` is updated based on the comparison; `n` is 0; `i` is 2; `arr[1]` is the first element popped from `m`.**
