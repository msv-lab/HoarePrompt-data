According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `t`. The loop condition is based on `len(t) // 2`, which determines the number of iterations. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is -1, and `n` is 0. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `len(t)` must be at least 2, since `len(t) // 2` must be greater than 0 for the loop to run. Since `t` has one less element now, it needs to be adjusted to ensure that `len(t)` is at least 2. 

Thus, the following adjustments need to be made:
- `len(t)` must be at least 2, which means `t` should have at least 2 elements.
- `i` should be adjusted to 0, as the loop index starts from 0.

State: **`t` has at least 2 elements, `m` is unchanged, `arr` has an updated last element from `m`, `poss` is updated based on the comparison, `n` is 0, `i` is 0**
