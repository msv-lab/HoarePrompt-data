According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are elements in the `arr`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `arr` contains at least 1 element from `m`. For the loop to execute one more time, `arr` needs to have at least 2 elements, since `i` will take the value of the next element in `arr`. 

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `arr` must contain at least 2 elements.
- `i` will be updated to the next element in `arr`, which means `i` will be the value of the next element.

State: **`t` is a deque with at least 1 element left after popping the first element, `m` remains unchanged, `arr` contains at least 2 elements from `m`, `poss` is updated based on the comparison of `i` (which is 0) and the value of the popped element from `t`, and `i` is the next element in `arr`**
