The variable `t` is assigned a new empty deque. The previous values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `t` is now an empty deque, while the states of `m`, `arr`, `n`, `i`, and `s` remain as they were before. 

Output State: **`t` is an empty deque, `m` remains a deque containing indices of non-'T' characters in `s`, `arr` remains a list of zeros, `n` is an input integer, `i` is -1, and `s` is an input string**
