`m` is a deque that is currently empty, and `i` is 0. The `append` method adds the value of `i` (which is 0) to the end of the deque `m`. Therefore, after execution, `m` will contain one element, which is 0. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an empty deque, `m` is a deque containing 0, `arr` is a list of zeros, `poss` is true, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string with at least 1 character, `si` is the first character of `s`, and the first character of `s` is not 'T'.**
