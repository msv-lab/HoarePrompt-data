According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `args` list. Since `args` has at least one more element remaining at the end of the last iteration, we need to adjust the state to reflect that there is now one less element remaining in `args`.

If `args` originally had more than one element, and at the end of the last iteration one element was processed, we can simply state that there is one less element in `args`. The other states do not need to be adjusted as they are not affected by the iteration of the loop. 

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000), `n` is an integer (3 ≤ `n` < 10^5) divisible by 3, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 'T' and 'M', `sep` is ' ', `file` is sys.stdout, `at_start` is False, `args` has at least one element remaining**
