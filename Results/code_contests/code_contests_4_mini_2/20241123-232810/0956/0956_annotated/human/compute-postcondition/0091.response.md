According to the code, the loop runs for a number of iterations specified by `t`. The loop will execute again if `t` is greater than the current iteration count (which is represented by the underscore `_`). At the end of the last iteration, `i` is -1. Since the loop does not utilize `i` directly for controlling the number of iterations, we focus on `t`. 

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `t` must be at least 1. Since no explicit information is given regarding the value of `t`, we have to infer that for the loop to execute again, `t` must be adjusted to at least 1. 

No other states need to be adjusted as `m`, `arr`, `n`, and the return values are not directly relevant for the loop's execution condition.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `m` remains a deque containing indices of non-'T' characters in `s`, `arr` remains a list of zeros, `n` is 0, `i` is -1, and the function returns 'YES' if `poss` is true, or 'NO' if `poss` is false.**
