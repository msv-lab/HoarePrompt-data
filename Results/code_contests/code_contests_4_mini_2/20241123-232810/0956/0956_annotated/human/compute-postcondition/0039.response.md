The value of `poss` is updated based on the comparison between `i` (which is 0) and the value of the popped element from `t`. Since `t` has at least one element left after popping the first element, it will remove the front of the deque and compare it with `i`. As a result, `poss` is updated to reflect the outcome of this comparison. The other variables (`m`, `arr`) remain unchanged, and `i` is now the next element in `arr`. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a deque with at least 1 element left, `m` remains unchanged, `arr` contains at least 2 elements from `m`, `poss` is updated based on the comparison of `i` (0) and the value of the popped element from `t`, and `i` is the next element in `arr`.

Output State: **`t` is a deque with at least 1 element left, `m` remains unchanged, `arr` contains at least 2 elements from `m`, `poss` is updated based on the comparison of `i` (0) and the value of the popped element from `t`, and `i` is the next element in `arr`.**
