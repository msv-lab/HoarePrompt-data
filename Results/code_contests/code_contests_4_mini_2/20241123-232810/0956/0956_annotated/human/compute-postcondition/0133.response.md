Output State: **If len(t) is at least 2, then `poss` reflects whether all elements in `arr` are less than the corresponding elements popped from `t`, `arr` contains the first `len(t) // 2` elements from `m`, and `t` will have at least `len(t) // 2` elements removed after the loop. If len(t) is less than 2, the loop does not execute, `t` remains unchanged, `m` remains unchanged, `arr` is an empty list, and `poss` is True.**
