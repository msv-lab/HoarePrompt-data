According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. The loop is set to iterate `len(t) // 2` times. For the loop to execute at least once, the length of `t` must be at least 2 (since `len(t) // 2` must be at least 1). 

Additionally, since `i` is being used as the loop counter that starts from 0, it will take values from 0 up to `len(t) // 2 - 1` during the iterations.

Currently, `i` is specified as the last index processed, which should ideally be set to 0 before the loop starts to indicate the first iteration.

Thus, for the loop to be executed, we need to ensure that the following states are true:
1. The list `t` must contain at least 2 indices, ensuring `len(t)` is at least 2 and `len(t) // 2` is at least 1.
2. `i` should be adjusted to 0, indicating the start of the loop.

State: **`t` contains at least 2 indices of 'T' characters in `s`, `m` contains indices of non-'T' characters in `s`, `arr` is a list of zeros with length len(t) // 2, `n` is an input integer, `i` is 0, `poss` is True**
