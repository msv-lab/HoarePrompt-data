To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the current state and the loop condition. 

1. The loop iterates based on `i` and the length of `t`. The loop's condition is `i < len(t) // 2`.
2. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `t` has at least 4 elements. This means the length of `t` is at least 4, allowing `len(t) // 2` to be at least 2.
3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Thus, `i` will become 2.
4. After the current iteration, the size of `t` must be checked. Since `t` has at least 4 elements, `len(t)` will still be at least 3 after removing one element (because we are assuming the loop executes one more time, meaning `t` still has elements left).
5. Therefore, for the next iteration, `t` must still have at least 3 elements to satisfy the condition for the loop to continue. 

Thus, the adjustments that need to be made are:
- `i` is now 2 (incrementing from 1).
- `t` needs to have at least 3 elements remaining to ensure that the loop can continue executing.

State: **`t` has at least 3 elements, `m` is updated by removing its first element, `arr[i]` holds the value of the removed element from `m`, `i` is 2, `poss` is updated by the comparison result of `t.popleft()` and `m[0]`**
