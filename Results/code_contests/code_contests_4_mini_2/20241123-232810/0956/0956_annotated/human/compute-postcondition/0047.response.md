The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The other variables `t`, `m`, `arr`, `poss`, and `i` are not affected by this line of code, so their previous states remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is a deque containing at least one index of 'T', `m` is a deque containing the indices of all characters in `s` that are not 'T', `arr` is a list of zeros, `poss` is true, `i` is -1, and `n` is an input integer.

Output State: **`t` is a deque containing at least one index of 'T', `m` is a deque containing the indices of all characters in `s` that are not 'T', `arr` is a list of zeros, `poss` is true, `i` is -1, `n` is an input integer**
