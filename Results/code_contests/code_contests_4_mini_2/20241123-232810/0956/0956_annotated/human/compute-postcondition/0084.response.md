The expression `poss &= i < t.popleft()` performs a comparison and an update on the variable `poss`. The value of `i` is `len(t) // 2`, and `t.popleft()` removes and returns the first element of `t`. The result of `i < t.popleft()` will be a boolean value that is combined with the current value of `poss` using the bitwise AND operator (`&=`).

Since `t` has `len(t) - len(t) // 2` elements initially, it's guaranteed to have at least one element to pop. The value of `t.popleft()` is unknown since `t` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it will affect the result of the comparison.

After executing the code, `poss` will be updated based on whether `i` is less than the value returned by `t.popleft()`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated status of `poss` based on the comparison.

Output State: **`t` is unchanged or has `len(t) - len(t) // 2` elements; `m` has at least `len(t) // 2 + 1` elements; `arr` has the last `len(t) // 2 + 1` elements from `m`; `n` is 0; `i` is `len(t) // 2`; `poss` is updated based on the comparison `i < t.popleft()`**.
