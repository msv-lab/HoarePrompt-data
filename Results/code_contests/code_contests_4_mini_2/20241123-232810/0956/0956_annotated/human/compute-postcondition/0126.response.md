According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the state of `arr`. For the loop to execute, `arr` must contain at least 1 element. 

1. If `len(t)` is less than 2, then `arr` is an empty list, which means the loop cannot execute. 
2. If `len(t)` is at least 2, then `arr` contains the first `len(t) // 2` elements from `m`. In this case, `len(arr)` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, we need to ensure that `len(t)` is at least 2, so that `arr` has elements to iterate over.

State: **`t` has at least 2 elements, `m` has at least len(m) - (len(t) // 2) elements left, `arr` contains the first len(t) // 2 elements from `m`, `i` is the first element in `arr`**
