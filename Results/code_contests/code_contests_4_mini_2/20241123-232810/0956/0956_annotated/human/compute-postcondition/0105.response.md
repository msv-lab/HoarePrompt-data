Postcondition: ***`t` is a deque that contains 0 if the first character of `s` is 'T', and if `si` is 'T', then `t` now contains 1 appended to it. If the first character of `s` is not 'T', then `m` contains 1 appended to it while `t` remains empty. In both cases, `arr` remains a list of zeros, `n` is an input integer, and `i` is 1.***
