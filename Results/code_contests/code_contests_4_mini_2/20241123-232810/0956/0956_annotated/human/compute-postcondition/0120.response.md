The code `arr[i] = m.popleft()` takes the first element from the deque `m` (which is assumed to be a deque based on the use of `popleft()`) and assigns it to `arr[i]`. The operation modifies the state of `m` by removing its first element. The initial state indicates that `m` remains unchanged before this operation, but after the operation, it will have one less element. Meanwhile, `arr[i]` will now hold the value of the element that was removed from `m`.

Since `t` has at least 3 elements left and the first element of `t` has been removed, it does not directly affect the operation of this line of code.

Output State: **`t` has at least 3 elements left, `m` is updated by removing its first element, `arr[i]` holds the value of the removed element from `m`.**
