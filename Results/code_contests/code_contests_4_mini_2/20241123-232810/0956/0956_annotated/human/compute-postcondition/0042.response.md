According to the code, the for loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements in the `arr` list. The loop variable `i` takes each element from `arr` in order. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the next element in `arr` after the current one, which means that `i` represents the next element in the sequence. Since `arr` contains at least 3 elements from `m`, we need to determine how many elements have been processed so far to assess if there are more elements left in `arr`.

To allow the loop to execute one more time, `arr` must contain at least one more element than has been processed so far. If we assume that during this iteration, the loop has processed `k` elements of `arr`, then for the loop to execute again, `arr` must contain at least `k + 1` elements.

Since we know that `arr` contains at least 3 elements from `m`, and `i` is the next element after the current one, we can infer that there are still elements left in `arr` to process.

Therefore, we can conclude that `i` should move to the next element in the `arr`, and we need to state that `arr` still has elements left. 

State: **`t` is a deque with at least 0 elements left, `m` remains unchanged, `arr` contains at least 3 elements from `m`, `poss` is updated based on the comparison of `i` and the value of the popped element from `t`, `i` is the next element in `arr after the current one` and `arr` contains at least 4 elements.**
