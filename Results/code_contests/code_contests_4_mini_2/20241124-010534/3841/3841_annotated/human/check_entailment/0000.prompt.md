You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
We have added some annotations within the code to help you understand the code and its logic. The annotations are in the form of comments and are inserted automatically so double check whether the annotations are correct or not and describe the code correctly.
If the annotations are correct use them along with the code to determine the correctness of the code. If the annotations are incorrect then you can ignore them and just use the code to determine the correctness.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Since Sonya is interested in robotics too, she decided to construct robots that will read and recognize numbers.

Sonya has drawn n numbers in a row, a_i is located in the i-th position. She also has put a robot at each end of the row (to the left of the first number and to the right of the last number). Sonya will give a number to each robot (they can be either same or different) and run them. When a robot is running, it is moving toward to another robot, reading numbers in the row. When a robot is reading a number that is equal to the number that was given to that robot, it will turn off and stay in the same position.

Sonya does not want robots to break, so she will give such numbers that robots will stop before they meet. That is, the girl wants them to stop at different positions so that the first robot is to the left of the second one.

For example, if the numbers [1, 5, 4, 1, 3] are written, and Sonya gives the number 1 to the first robot and the number 4 to the second one, the first robot will stop in the 1-st position while the second one in the 3-rd position. In that case, robots will not meet each other. As a result, robots will not be broken. But if Sonya gives the number 4 to the first robot and the number 5 to the second one, they will meet since the first robot will stop in the 3-rd position while the second one is in the 2-nd position.

Sonya understands that it does not make sense to give a number that is not written in the row because a robot will not find this number and will meet the other robot.

Sonya is now interested in finding the number of different pairs that she can give to robots so that they will not meet. In other words, she wants to know the number of pairs (p, q), where she will give p to the first robot and q to the second one. Pairs (p_i, q_i) and (p_j, q_j) are different if p_i≠ p_j or q_i≠ q_j.

Unfortunately, Sonya is busy fixing robots that broke after a failed launch. That is why she is asking you to find the number of pairs that she can give to robots so that they will not meet.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1≤ n≤ 10^5) — the number of numbers in a row.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1≤ a_i≤ 10^5) — the numbers in a row.

Output

Print one number — the number of possible pairs that Sonya can give to robots so that they will not meet.

Examples

Input

5
1 5 4 1 3


Output

9


Input

7
1 2 1 1 1 3 2


Output

7

Note

In the first example, Sonya can give pairs (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (4, 1), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 3), and (5, 4).

In the second example, Sonya can give pairs (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), and (3, 2).
Annotated Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    arr = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))
    freq = dict()
    vis = dict()
    for i in arr:
        freq[i] = freq.get(i, 0)
        
        if not freq[i]:
            vis[i] = 0
        
        freq[i] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `freq` is a dictionary mapping each unique integer in `arr` to its frequency count; `vis` is a dictionary that will contain keys for unique integers in `arr` that have been seen for the first time, initialized to 0; `arr` is a list of integers; if `arr` is empty, then the loop does not execute, and both `freq` and `vis` remain empty dictionaries.
    rem = len(set(arr))
    ans = 0
    for i in arr:
        freq[i] -= 1
        
        if not freq[i]:
            rem -= 1
        
        if not vis[i]:
            ans += rem
            vis[i] = 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `ans` is the total number of unique integers seen so far multiplied by the count of unique integers remaining in `arr` each time a new unique integer is encountered. `freq` is a dictionary reflecting the decremented frequency of each integer in `arr`. `vis` marks integers that have been seen, with a value of 1 for those integers. `rem` is the count of unique integers remaining, which decreases as their frequencies reach zero. If `arr` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `ans`, `freq`, `vis`, and `rem` remain at their initialized values (0 for `ans` and `rem`, empty for `freq` and `vis`).
    print(ans)

```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
