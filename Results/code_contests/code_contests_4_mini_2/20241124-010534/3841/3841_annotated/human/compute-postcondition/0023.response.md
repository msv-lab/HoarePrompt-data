The code initializes `ans` to 0. This does not affect any of the other variables (`freq`, `vis`, `arr`, `rem`), which retain their previous states. Therefore, the Output State is: `freq` is a dictionary mapping each unique integer in `arr` to its frequency count; `vis` is a dictionary that contains keys for unique integers in `arr` that have been seen for the first time, initialized to 0; `arr` is a list of integers; `rem` is the number of unique integers in `arr`, which is 0 if `arr` is empty or the count of unique integers otherwise; `ans` is 0.
