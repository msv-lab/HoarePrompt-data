The value of `freq[i]` is incremented by 1. Since `freq` initially has `i` mapped to 0, after this operation, `freq[i]` will be 1. The value of `vis` is not affected since `freq[i]` is now greater than 0, and thus the condition for updating `vis` is not met. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000; `arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element; `i` is the first element in `arr`; `freq[i]` is 1; `vis` remains unchanged.
