The line of code assigns the value of `freq.get(i, 0)` to `freq[i]`. This means that `freq[i]` will be set to the current value of `freq[i]` if `i` is already a key in the `freq` dictionary; otherwise, it will be set to `0`. The values of `n`, `arr`, `vis`, and other keys in `freq` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000; `arr` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements; `i` is the third element in `arr`; `freq[i]` is now either its existing value or 0 if `i` was not a key in `freq`; `vis` remains unchanged for all indices.
