Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000; `arr` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements; `i` is the second element in `arr`; if `freq[i]` is 1, then `vis[i]` remains unchanged; otherwise, `vis[i]` is set to 0, and `vis` remains unchanged for all other indices.***
