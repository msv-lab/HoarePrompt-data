The code increments the variable `ans` by the current value of `rem`. The value of `rem` has been previously decremented based on the state of `freq[i]`, but since the value of `rem` is not explicitly stated, we will keep it as it is. The states of the other variables (`vis`, `arr`, `i`) remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the output state is: `freq[i]` has been decremented by 1, `rem` is unchanged, `vis`, `arr`, and `ans` remain unchanged, and `i` remains the first element in `arr`.

Output State: **`freq[i]` has been decremented by 1, `rem` is unchanged, `vis`, `arr`, and `ans` remain unchanged, and `i` remains the first element in `arr`. `ans` is increased by `rem`.**
