The code prints the value of `ans`, and since `ans` is initialized to `0` due to the absence of any unique integers processed (as `arr` is empty), the output state reflects that `ans` is `0`. Other variables (`freq`, `vis`, and `rem`) remain unchanged from their initialized values. 

Output State: **`ans` is 0, `freq` is empty, `vis` is empty, `rem` is 0**
