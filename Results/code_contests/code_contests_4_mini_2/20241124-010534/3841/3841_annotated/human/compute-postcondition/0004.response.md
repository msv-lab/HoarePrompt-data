According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `arr`. The loop will execute for each element in the `arr`, so it is necessary for `arr` to contain at least one element for the loop to start. Since `n` is a positive integer indicating the number of elements in `arr`, it must also be at least 1. At the end of the last iteration, `i` will be the last element in `arr`. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `arr` must have at least 1 element, `i` will be equal to the first element of `arr` during the first iteration, and `freq` and `vis` remain empty dictionaries.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000, `arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in `arr`, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `vis` is an empty dictionary**
