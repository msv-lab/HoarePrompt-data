Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000; `arr` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements; `i` is the third element in `arr`; if `freq[i]` is 0 (meaning `i` was not a key in `freq`), then `vis[i]` is set to 0; if `freq[i]` is a positive value, `vis` remains unchanged for index `i`.***
