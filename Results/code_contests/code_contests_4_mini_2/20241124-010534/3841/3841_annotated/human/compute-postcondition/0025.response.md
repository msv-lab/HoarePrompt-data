The value of `freq[i]` is decremented by 1. The impact of this is that the frequency count for the integer `i` in the `freq` dictionary is reduced by 1. The previous values of the affected variables are not specified, but we know that `i` is the first element in `arr`, and `freq` is a dictionary mapping unique integers in `arr` to their frequency count. Other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `freq[i]` is decremented by 1, `vis` remains unchanged, `arr` remains unchanged, `rem` remains greater than 0, `ans` remains 0, and `i` remains the first element in `arr`.

Output State: **`freq[i]` is decremented by 1, `vis` remains unchanged, `arr` remains unchanged, `rem` remains greater than 0, `ans` remains 0, and `i` remains the first element in `arr`**.
