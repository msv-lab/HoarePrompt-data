The code initializes `freq` as an empty dictionary. The previous values of `n` and `arr` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged state of `n` and `arr`, along with the new state of `freq`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000; `arr` is a list of integers derived from user input; `freq` is an empty dictionary**.
