Functionality: ** The function accepts input from the user, which includes an integer followed by a list of integers. It calculates the total number of unique integers encountered in the list and sums up the counts of remaining unique integers each time a new unique integer is seen. It then outputs this calculated sum. If the input list is empty, the function does not perform any computations, and the output will simply be 0. **
