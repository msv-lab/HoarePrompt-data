The code assigns the value `0` to `vis[i]`, where `i` is the second element in `arr`. The value of `freq[i]` remains `1`, and `vis` is modified only at index `i`. The previous values of `n`, `arr`, and `freq` are unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `vis`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000; `arr` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements; `i` is the second element in `arr`; `freq[i]` is 1; `vis[i]` is 0; `vis` remains unchanged for other indices.**
