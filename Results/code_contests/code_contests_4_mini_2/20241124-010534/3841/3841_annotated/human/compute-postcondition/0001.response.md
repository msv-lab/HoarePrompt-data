The variable `arr` is assigned the value of `list(map(int, raw_input().split()))`, which takes input from the user (a space-separated string of integers), splits it into individual string components, converts each string to an integer, and then creates a list from those integers. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is only used to define the size of `arr`. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `arr` as a list of integers derived from the user input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ `n` â‰¤ 100000; `arr` is a list of integers derived from user input.**
