According to the code, the loop iterates over each element in the `arr`. For the loop to execute one more time, `arr` should have at least one more element that hasn't been processed yet or the current state of `i` needs to reflect the next element in the `arr`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the third element in `arr`, which means it has already processed the first three elements. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to refer to the fourth element in `arr`.

Since `arr` has at least 3 elements and is stated to be a list of integers with at least 3 elements, we do not need to adjust the condition on `arr`. We just need to make sure `i` points to the next element in the list. 

Hence, the next element in `arr` needs to be taken into account, which means `i` should be the fourth element in `arr`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000; `arr` is a list of integers with at least 4 elements; `i` is the fourth element in `arr`; `freq[i]` has been incremented by 1; `vis[i]` is either unchanged if `freq[i]` was positive or remains 0 if `freq[i]` was initially 0.**
