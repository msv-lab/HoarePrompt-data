The code initializes `vis` as an empty dictionary. The previous states of the variables are unchanged, and the only change is the addition of the `vis` variable. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000, `arr` is a list of integers derived from user input, `freq` is an empty dictionary, and `vis` is an empty dictionary.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000, `arr` is a list of integers derived from user input, `freq` is an empty dictionary, and `vis` is an empty dictionary.**
