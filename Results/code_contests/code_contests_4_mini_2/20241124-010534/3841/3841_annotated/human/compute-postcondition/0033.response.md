According to the code, the loop iterates over the elements in `arr`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the variable `i` needs to represent the next element in `arr`. 

Since `i` represents elements from `arr`, we need to ensure that `i` can take on another value from `arr` during the next iteration. However, the provided state does not specify what the current value of `i` is or how many elements are in `arr`. 

Assuming `i` was the last element of `arr` before the loop ends, we need to adjust the state so that `i` can take on the next value. This would mean that if `arr` has `n` elements, `i` should be set to the first element of `arr` and the loop will need to account for the fact that the loop has iterated through at least one element.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to set `i` to the next index in `arr`, which would be `i` + 1, or if `i` was the last element, it would reset to the first element of `arr`. Additionally, if `rem` was decremented as a result of handling `freq[i]`, we need to ensure that the state reflects the current `rem` value.

State: **`freq[i]` has been decremented by 1, `rem` is decremented if `freq[i]` was originally 0, `vis[i]` is 1, `ans` is increased by `rem`, `arr` remains unchanged, `i` is the next element in arr**
