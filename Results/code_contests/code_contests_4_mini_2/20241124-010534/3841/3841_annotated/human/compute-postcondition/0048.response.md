Output State: **`ans` is the total number of unique integers seen so far multiplied by the count of unique integers remaining in `arr` each time a new unique integer is encountered. `freq` is a dictionary reflecting the decremented frequency of each integer in `arr`. `vis` marks integers that have been seen, with a value of 1 for those integers. `rem` is the count of unique integers remaining, which decreases as their frequencies reach zero. If `arr` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `ans`, `freq`, `vis`, and `rem` remain at their initialized values (0 for `ans` and `rem`, empty for `freq` and `vis`).**
