Output State: **`freq` is a dictionary mapping each unique integer in `arr` to its frequency count; `vis` is a dictionary that will contain keys for unique integers in `arr` that have been seen for the first time, initialized to 0; `arr` is a list of integers; if `arr` is empty, then the loop does not execute, and both `freq` and `vis` remain empty dictionaries.**
