According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the array `arr`. If `arr` is not empty, the loop will iterate over its elements. Since `rem` represents the number of unique integers in `arr`, it should be greater than 0 for the loop to execute. If `arr` is empty, `rem` should be 0, which would mean the loop does not execute. To ensure that the loop executes, `arr` must contain at least one integer, and consequently, `rem` should be greater than 0. 

Additionally, the loop variable `i` will take on the value of the first element in `arr` during the first iteration.

State: **`freq` is a dictionary mapping unique integers in `arr` to their frequency count, `vis` is a dictionary with keys for unique integers in `arr` that have been seen for the first time initialized to 0, `arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `rem` is greater than 0, `ans` is 0, `i` is the first element in `arr`**
