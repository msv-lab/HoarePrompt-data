The variable `vis[i]` is assigned the value `1`. This indicates that the index `i` in the `vis` array is now marked as visited. The other variables (`freq[i]`, `rem`, `ans`, and `arr`) are not directly affected by this assignment. Hence, the output state reflects the changes to the `vis` array while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`vis[i]` is set to 1; `freq[i]` is decremented by 1; if `freq[i]` was originally 0, then `rem` is decremented by 1; `ans` is increased by the current value of `rem`; the array `arr` remains unchanged; `i` points to the next element in `arr`; `ans` is increased by `rem`.**
