`freq[i]` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` is the second element in `arr`, and `freq[i]` is updated accordingly. The specific previous value of `freq[i]` is not provided, but it will be increased by 1. The `vis` variable's state is not changed by this operation since it only affects `freq`. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `freq[i]` while indicating that `vis` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000; `arr` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements; `i` is the second element in `arr`; `freq[i]` is increased by 1; `vis` remains unchanged for all indices.**
