The value of `vis[i]` is set to 0. The initial state indicates that `i` is the third element in `arr`, and `vis` remains unchanged for all indices except for the index `i`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000; `arr` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements; `i` is the third element in `arr`; `freq[i]` is either its existing value or 0 if `i` was not a key in `freq`; and `vis[i]` is now 0.
