The code `freq[i] = freq.get(i, 0)` checks if the key `i` exists in the dictionary `freq`. If it does, it assigns its current value to `freq[i]`; if not, it assigns the value `0`. Since `freq[i]` is initially `1`, it remains unchanged after this operation. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000; `arr` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements; `i` is the second element in `arr`; `freq[i]` is 1; `vis` remains unchanged.
