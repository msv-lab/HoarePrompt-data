The value of `rem` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `rem` is not specified, but it is affected directly. The other variables (`freq[i]`, `vis[i]`, `ans`, and `arr`) are not changed by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `rem`.

Output State: **`freq[i]` is decremented by 1; `rem` is decremented by 1; `vis[i]` is 1; `ans` is increased by `rem`; `arr` remains unchanged; `i` is the next element in `arr**
