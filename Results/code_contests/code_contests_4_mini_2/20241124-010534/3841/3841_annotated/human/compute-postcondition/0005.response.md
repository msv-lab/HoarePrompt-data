The code assigns a value to `freq[i]` using the `get` method. The value of `freq.get(i, 0)` retrieves the current frequency of `i` in the `freq` dictionary, returning `0` if `i` is not already a key in the dictionary. Since `freq` is initially empty, `freq.get(i, 0)` will return `0`, and thus `freq[i]` will be assigned the value `0`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000, `arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in `arr`, `freq` is {i: 0}, `vis` is an empty dictionary**
