The variable `vis[i]` is assigned the value `1`, indicating that the index `i` in the `vis` array is now marked as visited. The other variables `freq[i]`, `rem`, `arr`, and `ans` remain unchanged, except for `ans`, which has already been increased by `rem`. Therefore, the state of `vis` is now altered, while the other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`freq[i]` has been decremented by 1, `rem` is unchanged, `vis[i]` is 1, `arr` is unchanged, and `ans` has been increased by `rem**.
