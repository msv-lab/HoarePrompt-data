Postcondition: ***`freq[i]` has been decremented by 1. If `freq[i]` was originally 0, then `rem` has also been decremented by 1. If `vis[i]` was not previously set, it is now set to 1, and `ans` is updated by adding `rem`. The variable `i` is now at the next valid index in `arr`. If `vis[i]` was already set before this block, no changes occur to `ans` or `vis[i]`, and `i` remains at the next valid index in `arr`.***
