Vis is assigned the value 0 for the key `i`. The initial state indicates that `i` is the first element in `arr` and is mapped to 0 in `freq`. Since `vis` is an empty dictionary before this operation, it will now contain the entry `i: 0`. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000, `arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in `arr`, `freq` is a dictionary with `i` mapped to 0, `vis` is a dictionary with `i` mapped to 0, and the frequency of `i` in `freq` is still 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000, `arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in `arr`, `freq` is a dictionary with `i` mapped to 0, `vis` is a dictionary with `i` mapped to 0, and the frequency of `i` in `freq` is still 0.**
