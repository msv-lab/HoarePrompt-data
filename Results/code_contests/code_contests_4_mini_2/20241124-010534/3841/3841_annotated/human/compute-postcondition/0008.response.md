Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000, `arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in `arr`, `freq` is a dictionary with `i` mapped to 0, and `vis` is a dictionary. If the frequency of `i` in `freq` is 0, then `vis` is updated to include `i` mapped to 0. Otherwise, `vis` remains unchanged.***
