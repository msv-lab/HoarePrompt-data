The value of `freq[i]` is decremented by 1. If `freq[i]` was originally 0, then `rem` is decremented as well. The variable `vis[i]` remains 1, and `ans` is increased by the current value of `rem`. The array `arr` remains unchanged, and `i` is updated to the next element in `arr`. 

Since the specific values of `freq[i]`, `rem`, `ans`, and the next value of `i` are not provided, we can summarize the impact:

Output State: **`freq[i]` is decremented by 1; `rem` is decremented if `freq[i]` was originally 0; `vis[i]` is 1; `ans` is increased by `rem`; `arr` remains unchanged; `i` is the next element in `arr**.
