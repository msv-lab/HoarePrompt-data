The value of `rem` is decremented by 1, but its previous value is greater than 0, so after execution, `rem` will be 1 less than its previous value. The states of the other variables (`freq[i]`, `vis`, `arr`, `ans`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `freq[i]` is 0, `vis` remains unchanged, `arr` remains unchanged, `rem` is now less than its previous value, `ans` remains 0, and `i` remains the first element in `arr`.

Output State: **`freq[i]` is 0, `vis` remains unchanged, `arr` remains unchanged, `rem` is now less than its previous value, `ans` remains 0, and `i` remains the first element in `arr**
