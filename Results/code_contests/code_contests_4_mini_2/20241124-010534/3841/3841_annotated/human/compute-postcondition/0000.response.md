The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input as a string and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous constraints on `n` indicate it is a positive integer within the range 1 to 100,000. The variable `arr` is not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment made to `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100000, and `n` is assigned an input integer.**
