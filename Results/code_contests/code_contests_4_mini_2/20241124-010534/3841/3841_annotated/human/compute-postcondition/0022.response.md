The code assigns `rem` the value of the number of unique integers in `arr` by taking the length of the set of `arr`. If `arr` is empty, the set will also be empty, and thus `len(set(arr))` evaluates to 0. If `arr` contains integers, `rem` will be the count of unique integers in `arr`. The state of `freq` and `vis` remains unchanged since the code does not affect them. 

Output State: **`freq` is a dictionary mapping each unique integer in `arr` to its frequency count; `vis` is a dictionary that contains keys for unique integers in `arr` that have been seen for the first time, initialized to 0; `arr` is a list of integers; `rem` is the number of unique integers in `arr`, which is 0 if `arr` is empty or the count of unique integers otherwise.**
