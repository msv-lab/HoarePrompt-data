Postcondition: ***`freq[i]` is decremented by 1, and if it was originally 0, then `rem` is decremented by 1. If `vis[i]` was not previously set to 1, it is set to 1 and `ans` is increased by the current value of `rem`. The array `arr` remains unchanged, and `i` points to the next element in `arr`. If `vis[i]` was already set to 1, then `ans` remains unchanged, `freq[i]` and `rem` are not altered, and `vis[i]` still equals 1.***
