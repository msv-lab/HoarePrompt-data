The value of `freq[i]` is incremented by 1. If `freq[i]` was initially 0, it would change to 1; if it was initially greater than 0, it would increase accordingly. The variable `vis[i]` remains unchanged if `freq[i]` was positive before the operation, and it remains 0 if `freq[i]` was initially 0. Therefore, the output state will depend on the previous value of `freq[i]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000; `arr` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements; `i` is the third element in `arr`; `freq[i]` has been incremented by 1; `vis[i]` is either unchanged if `freq[i]` was positive or remains 0 if `freq[i]` was initially 0.**
