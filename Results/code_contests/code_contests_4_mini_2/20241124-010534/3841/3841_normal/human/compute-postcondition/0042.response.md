The value of `rem` is decremented by 1, but its previous value is not specified. The other variables (`freq`, `vis`, and `i`) remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `rem`. 

Output State: **`freq` is updated by decrementing the value at key `i` by 1; `vis` contains the unique integers as keys; `rem` is decreased by 1; `i` is the next unique integer in `arr`.**
