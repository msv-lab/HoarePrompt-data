According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the array `arr`. If `arr` is not empty, the loop will execute for each element in `arr`. The variable `i` will take each value in `arr` during the iterations. If `arr` is empty, the loop will not execute at all. 

Since `freq` is a dictionary with keys as the unique integers from `arr`, if `rem` is 0, it indicates that `arr` is empty, and thus the loop cannot execute. For the loop to be executed, `rem` must be greater than 0, meaning `arr` has at least one unique integer. 

Before the loop starts, `ans` is 0, and `vis` contains those unique integers as keys with all values set to 0, which is appropriate, but we must ensure `arr` is not empty.

State: **`freq` is a dictionary with keys as the unique integers from `arr`, `vis` contains those unique integers as keys with values set to 0, `rem` is greater than 0, `ans` is 0, `i` is the first element in `arr`**
