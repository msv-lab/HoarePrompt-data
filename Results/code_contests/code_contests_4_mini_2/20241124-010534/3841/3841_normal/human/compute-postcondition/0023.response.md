The value of `ans` is initialized to 0, and this does not change any other variables. The states of `freq`, `vis`, and `rem` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `freq` is a dictionary with keys as the unique integers from `arr` and values as their respective counts; `vis` contains those unique integers as keys with all values set to 0; `rem` is the count of unique integers in `arr` or 0 if `arr` is empty; `ans` is 0.

Output State: **`freq` is a dictionary with keys as the unique integers from `arr` and values as their respective counts; `vis` contains those unique integers as keys with all values set to 0; `rem` is the count of unique integers in `arr` or 0 if `arr` is empty; `ans` is 0**.
