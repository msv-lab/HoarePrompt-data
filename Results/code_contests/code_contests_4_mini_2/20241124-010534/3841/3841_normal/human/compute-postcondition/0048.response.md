Output State: **`freq` is a dictionary with keys as the unique integers from `arr`, `vis` contains those unique integers as keys with values indicating whether they have been encountered (1 for seen, 0 for not). `rem` is the count of unique integers that have not been completely decremented, and it is greater than or equal to 0 throughout the execution. If `arr` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `freq` remains unchanged, `vis` remains unchanged with all values set to 0, `rem` is 0, and `ans` remains 0. If `arr` is not empty, `ans` is updated by the value of `rem` when a unique integer is encountered for the first time, and `rem` is decremented when the count of that integer reaches zero. The final value of `ans` represents the total number of unique integers encountered multiplied by the remaining unique integers at the time of their first encounter.**
