The variable `freq[i]` is incremented by 1. Since the initial value of `freq[i]` was 2, after the increment, `freq[i]` will be 3. The variable `vis[i]` remains unchanged as it is stated that `vis[i]` remains the same regardless of the value of `freq[i]`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of integers with at least `n` elements, `i` is the third element of `arr`, `freq[i]` is 3, and `vis` remains unchanged as `{i: 0}`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of integers with at least `n` elements, `i` is the third element of `arr`, `freq[i]` is 3, and `vis` remains unchanged as `{i: 0}`**.
