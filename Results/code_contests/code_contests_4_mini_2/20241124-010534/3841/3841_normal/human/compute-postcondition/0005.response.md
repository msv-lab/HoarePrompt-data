The code `freq[i] = freq.get(i, 0)` assigns a value to the key `i` in the dictionary `freq`. The method `get(i, 0)` checks if the key `i` exists in `freq`. If it does, it retrieves the current value; if it does not, it returns 0. Since `freq` is initially an empty dictionary, for the first execution, `freq[i]` will be set to 0 (as `i` is not yet in `freq`). The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000), `arr` is a list of integers with at least `n` elements, `i` is the first element of `arr`, `freq` is {i: 0}, `vis` is an empty dictionary**
