According to the code, the loop iterates over the elements in the `arr` list. Since `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000), it implies that `arr` must contain at least `n` elements (since we typically assume `arr` has `n` elements, based on common usage). The loop variable `i` will take on each value from the `arr` list during the iterations. 

For the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `arr` is not empty and contains `n` elements. At the start, the values of `freq` and `vis` are irrelevant for the loop execution, but `i` will be initialized to the first element of `arr` during the first iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000), `arr` is a list of integers with at least `n` elements, `i` is the first element of `arr`, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `vis` is an empty dictionary**
