According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `arr` iterable. The loop will iterate over each element in `arr`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has taken on the last value of `arr`, and we need to ensure that `arr` has additional elements for the loop to execute one more time. 

Since `i` was the last element in the previous iteration, for the loop to be executed again, `arr` must have at least one more element after `i`. Thus, we need to adjust the state to indicate that `arr` contains more elements.

State: **`freq` is updated by decrementing the value at key `i` by 1; `vis[i]` is set to 1; `ans` is unchanged; `rem` is either unchanged or decreased by 1; `arr` has at least one more element after `i`.**
