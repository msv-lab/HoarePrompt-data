Postcondition: ***`freq` is a dictionary with keys as the unique integers from `arr`, `vis` contains those unique integers as keys, and if `vis[i]` was initially 0, then `ans` is increased by the value of `rem` and `vis[i]` is set to 1. If `freq[i]` was initially greater than 0, `rem` remains unchanged, otherwise, `rem` is decremented by 1. In all cases, `rem` is always greater than or equal to 0 at the start of the execution.***
