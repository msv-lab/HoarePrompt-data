The assignment `vis[i] = 1` updates the `vis` dictionary by setting the key `i` to the value `1`. This means that the unique integer `i` is now marked as visited. The other variables `freq`, `rem`, and `ans` remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `vis`.

Output State: **`freq` is a dictionary with keys as the unique integers from `arr`, `vis[i]` is 1, `rem` is greater than or equal to 0, and `ans` is increased by `rem`**.
