The variable `freq[i]` is incremented by 1. Since `freq[i]` was initially 1, after the increment, `freq[i]` becomes 2. The other variables, `n`, `arr`, and `vis`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000), `arr` is a list of integers with at least `n` elements, `i` is the second element of `arr`, `freq[i]` is 2, and `vis` remains unchanged as `{i: 0}`.
