Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000), `arr` is a list of integers with at least `n` elements, `i` is the first element of `arr`, `freq` is a dictionary with `i` as a key and its value is 0, `vis` is updated to include `{i: 0}` if the frequency of `i` in `freq` is not greater than 0. If `i` is not present in `freq` or its frequency is greater than 0, `vis` remains unchanged.***
