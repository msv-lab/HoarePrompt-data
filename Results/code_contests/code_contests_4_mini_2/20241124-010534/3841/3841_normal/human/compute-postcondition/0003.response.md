The variable `vis` is assigned an empty dictionary using `dict()`. This operation initializes `vis` but does not affect the values of `n`, `arr`, or `freq`. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged for those variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000), `arr` is a list of integers based on the input, `freq` is an empty dictionary, and `vis` is an empty dictionary**
