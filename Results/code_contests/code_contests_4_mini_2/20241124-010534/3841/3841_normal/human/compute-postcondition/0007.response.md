The code assigns the value `0` to the key `i` in the dictionary `vis`. The previous value of `vis` is an empty dictionary, so after execution, `vis` will contain the key `i` with the value `0`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000), `arr` is a list of integers with at least `n` elements, `i` is the first element of `arr`, `freq` is a dictionary with `i` as a key and its value is 0, `vis` is now `{i: 0}`, and the frequency of `i` in `freq` is not greater than 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000), `arr` is a list of integers with at least `n` elements, `i` is the first element of `arr`, `freq` is a dictionary with `i` as a key and its value is 0, `vis` is now `{i: 0}`, and the frequency of `i` in `freq` is not greater than 0.**
