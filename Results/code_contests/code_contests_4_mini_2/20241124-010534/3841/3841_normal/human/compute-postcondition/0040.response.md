According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the contents of `arr`. The loop iterates over each unique integer in `arr`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the last unique integer from `arr`, and the next integer in `arr` needs to be determined for the loop to execute again.

Since `vis[i]` can only be updated if `i` is a new unique integer from `arr`, we need to ensure that `i` is set to the next unique integer in the list for the loop to continue. If there are no more unique integers left in `arr`, the loop will not execute again.

To adjust the states, we need to ensure that `i` moves to the next unique integer in `arr`, and `rem` remains as is since it does not change regardless of the loop's state.

State: **`freq` is a dictionary with keys as the unique integers from `arr`, `vis` contains the unique integers as keys, `rem` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is the next unique integer in `arr`**
