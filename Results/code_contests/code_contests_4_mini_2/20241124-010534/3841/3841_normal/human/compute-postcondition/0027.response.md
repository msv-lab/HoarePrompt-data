The value of `rem` is decremented by 1, but the previous value of `rem` is unknown, other than it being greater than 0. The states of the other variables (`freq`, `vis`, and `ans`) are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `freq` is a dictionary with keys as the unique integers from `arr`, with `freq[i]` equal to 0; `vis` contains those unique integers as keys with values set to 0; `rem` is greater than 0 (now decreased by 1); `ans` is 0.
