The value of `arr` is assigned the result of `list(map(int, raw_input().split()))`, which takes a space-separated input string, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and then creates a list from those integers. The input directly affects the state of `arr` but does not change the value of `n`, which remains a positive integer. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000), `arr` is a list of integers based on the input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000), `arr` is a list of integers based on the input**
