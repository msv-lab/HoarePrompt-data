Postcondition: ***`freq` is a dictionary with keys as the unique integers from `arr`, `vis` contains the unique integers as keys, and `rem` is greater than or equal to 0. If `vis[i]` was 0, then `ans` is increased by `rem`, and `vis[i]` is set to 1. If `vis[i]` was already 1, then `ans` remains unchanged, and `vis[i]` stays the same. The value of `rem` remains unchanged regardless of whether `vis[i]` was updated or not.***
