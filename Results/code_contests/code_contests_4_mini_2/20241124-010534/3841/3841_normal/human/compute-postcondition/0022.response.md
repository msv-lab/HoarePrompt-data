The variable `rem` is assigned the value of `len(set(arr))`. The function `set(arr)` converts `arr` into a set of unique integers, and `len()` counts how many unique integers there are. If `arr` has at least one element, `rem` will be equal to the number of unique integers in `arr`. If `arr` is empty, `set(arr)` would result in an empty set, and thus `len(set(arr))` would be 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`freq` is a dictionary with keys as the unique integers from `arr` and values as their respective counts; `vis` contains those unique integers as keys with all values set to 0; `rem` is the count of unique integers in `arr` or 0 if `arr` is empty.**
