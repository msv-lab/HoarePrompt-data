Postcondition: ***`freq` is a dictionary with keys as the unique integers from `arr`, `vis` contains the unique integers as keys, and `rem` is greater than or equal to 0. If `freq[i]` is decremented to 0, then `rem` is reduced by 1. If `freq[i]` was already 0 before this operation, `rem` remains unchanged.***
