The code initializes `freq` as an empty dictionary. The initial state of `n` and `arr` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged for `n` and `arr`, and we have `freq` as an empty dictionary.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000), `arr` is a list of integers based on the input, and `freq` is an empty dictionary**
