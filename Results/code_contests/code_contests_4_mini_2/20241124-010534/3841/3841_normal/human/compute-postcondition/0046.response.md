Postcondition: ***`freq` is updated by decrementing the value at key `i` by 1; `vis[i]` is set to 1. If `vis[i]` was previously 0, `ans` is increased by the current value of `rem`, which is either unchanged or decreased by 1, ensuring that `rem` remains greater than or equal to 0. If `vis[i]` was already 1 before the update, `ans` remains unchanged.***
