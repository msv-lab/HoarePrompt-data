The code assigns a value of `1` to `vis[i]`, indicating that the integer `i` has now been marked as visited. The previous state of `vis[i]` is `false`, and the other variables (`freq`, `rem`, `ans`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `vis[i]`.

Output State: **`freq` is a dictionary with keys as the unique integers from `arr`, `vis` contains those unique integers as keys with `vis[i]` set to 1, `rem` is greater than or equal to 0, and `ans` is now equal to `rem`**
