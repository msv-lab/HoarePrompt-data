The statement `vis[i] = 0` assigns the value `0` to the key `i` in the dictionary `vis`. The initial state indicates that `vis` already contains the key `i` with a value of `0`, so there is no change in the value associated with `i`. Other variables such as `n`, `arr`, and `freq` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the only note that the value for `i` in `vis` is still `0`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000), `arr` is a list of integers with at least `n` elements, `i` is the third element of `arr`, `freq[i]` is 2, and `vis` remains unchanged as `{i: 0}`.**
