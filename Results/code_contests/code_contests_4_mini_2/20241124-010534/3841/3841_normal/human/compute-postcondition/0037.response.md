The code snippet `ans += rem` increments the value of `ans` by the current value of `rem`. The state of `rem` is given as being greater than or equal to 0, and `ans` is assumed to be previously defined. The values of `freq` and `vis` are not directly affected by this operation, and since we are only adding to `ans`, we do not need to modify `rem` or check its previous state for this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the increment of `ans`.

Output State: **`freq` is a dictionary with keys as the unique integers from `arr`, `vis` contains the unique integers as keys, `rem` is greater than or equal to 0, and `ans` is increased by `rem`.**
