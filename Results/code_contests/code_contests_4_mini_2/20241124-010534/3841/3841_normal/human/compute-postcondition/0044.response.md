The value of `ans` is incremented by `rem`. The previous state indicates that `rem` is either unchanged or decreased by 1, but its exact value is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects that `ans` is increased by the current value of `rem`. 

Output State: **`freq` is updated by decrementing the value at key `i` by 1; `vis` contains the unique integers as keys; `rem` is either unchanged or decreased by 1, and `ans` is increased by `rem`.**
