Postcondition: ***`freq` is updated by decrementing the value at key `i` by 1; `vis` contains the unique integers as keys; if `freq[i]` was previously greater than 0, `rem` remains unchanged; if `freq[i]` was 0 before the update, `rem` is decreased by 1. Thus, `rem` is either unchanged or decreased by 1, and it is guaranteed to be greater than or equal to 0.***
