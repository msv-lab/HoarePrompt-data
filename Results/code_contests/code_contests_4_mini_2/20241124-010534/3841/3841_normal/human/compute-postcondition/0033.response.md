According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `arr`. The loop iterates over each element in `arr`. At the end of the last iteration, `freq` is a dictionary with keys as the unique integers from `arr`, `vis` contains those unique integers as keys, and the states regarding `ans`, `rem`, and `vis` depend on the processing of elements in `arr`.

If the loop has just finished processing the last element of `arr`, for the loop to execute one more time, `arr` must still contain elements not yet processed. This implies that the loop should have processed elements up to the last unique integer in `arr`.

Therefore, if the last processed element was the last unique integer in `arr`, the state regarding `arr` should reflect that there must be another element for the loop to execute again. If `i` is currently at the last unique integer in `arr`, the next state needs to reflect that there are still more unique integers to be processed or that the loop is prepared to process the next element.

State: **`freq` is a dictionary with keys as the unique integers from `arr`, `vis` contains the unique integers as keys, `rem` is greater than or equal to 0, and `i` is the next unique integer in `arr` to be processed**.
