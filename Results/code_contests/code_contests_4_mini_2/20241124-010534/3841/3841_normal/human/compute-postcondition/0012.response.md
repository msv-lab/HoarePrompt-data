The statement `vis[i] = 0` assigns the value `0` to the key `i` in the dictionary `vis`. However, it is mentioned that `vis` remains unchanged as `{i: 0}`, which means that `vis[i]` is already `0`. Therefore, this assignment does not change the value associated with `i` in `vis`.

The other variables, `n`, `arr`, `i`, and `freq[i]`, are not affected by this assignment. 

Thus, the output state reflects that `vis[i]` remains `0` and that the other variables retain their previous values. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000), `arr` is a list of integers with at least `n` elements, `i` is the second element of `arr`, `freq[i]` is 1, and `vis[i]` remains 0.**
