The code assigns `freq[i]` the value of `freq.get(i, 0)`. Since `freq[i]` is already given as 2, the `get` method will return this value. Therefore, `freq[i]` remains 2 after execution. The other variables are unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000), `arr` is a list of integers with at least `n` elements, `i` is the third element of `arr`, `freq[i]` is 2, and `vis` remains unchanged as `{i: 0}`.**
