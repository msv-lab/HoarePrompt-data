The value of `freq[i]` is decremented by 1. The specific value of `freq[i]` prior to the operation is not provided, but since `i` is an element in `arr`, `freq[i]` exists and is greater than or equal to 0. The states of `vis`, `rem`, and `ans` remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `freq` is a dictionary with keys as the unique integers from `arr`, `vis` contains those unique integers as keys with values set to 0, `rem` is greater than 0, `ans` is 0, and `freq[i]` is decremented by 1.

Output State: **`freq` is a dictionary with keys as the unique integers from `arr`, `vis` contains those unique integers as keys with values set to 0, `rem` is greater than 0, `ans` is 0, and `freq[i]` is decremented by 1**
