The code `freq[i] = freq.get(i, 0)` checks the dictionary `freq` for the key `i`. If `i` exists as a key in `freq`, it retrieves its current value; if it does not exist, it returns `0`. The result is then assigned back to `freq[i]`. 

Given that `i` is the second element of `arr`, and `freq` is initialized with the second element of `arr` as a key with a value of `1`, `freq[i]` will be updated to `1` since `i` is already a key in `freq`.

The output state reflects the unchanged values of `n`, `arr`, and `vis`, while `freq[i]` remains `1`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000), `arr` is a list of integers with at least `n` elements, `i` is the second element of `arr`, `freq[i]` is 1, and `vis` remains unchanged as `{i: 0}`.**
