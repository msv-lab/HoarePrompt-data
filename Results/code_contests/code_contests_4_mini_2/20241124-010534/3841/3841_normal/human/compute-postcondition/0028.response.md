Postcondition: ***`freq` is a dictionary with keys as the unique integers from `arr`, `vis` contains those unique integers as keys with values set to 0, `rem` is greater than or equal to 0 and is decremented by 1 if `freq[i]` is 0; `ans` remains 0. If `freq[i]` was initially greater than 0, `rem` remains unchanged.***
