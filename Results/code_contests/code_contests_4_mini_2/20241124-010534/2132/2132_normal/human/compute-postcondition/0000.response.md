The variable `a` is assigned a list of integers. The initial state of `n` is not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 40, and `a` is a list of integers as defined.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 40, and `a` is a list of integers [0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 19, 31, 61, 89, 107, 127, 521, 607, 1279, 2203, 2281, 3217, 4253, 4423, 9689, 9941, 11213, 19937, 21701, 23209, 44497, 86243, 110503, 132049, 216091, 756839, 859433, 1257787, 1398269, 2976221, 3021377, 6972593, 13466917, 20996011, 24036583]**
