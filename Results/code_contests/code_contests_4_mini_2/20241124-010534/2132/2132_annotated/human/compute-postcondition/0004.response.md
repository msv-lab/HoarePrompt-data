Functionality: ** The function does not accept any parameters and outputs a computed value based on user input. It retrieves an integer input `n`, uses it to index into a predefined list of integers, and calculates `(2^a[n] / 2 - 1) % (10^9 + 7)`, where `a` is the list. However, this function does not handle cases where the input `n` is outside the range of valid indices for the list `a`, which would lead to an `IndexError`. Additionally, the division by 2 is performed before the modulo operation, which may not be intended behavior when considering the modulus properties. **
