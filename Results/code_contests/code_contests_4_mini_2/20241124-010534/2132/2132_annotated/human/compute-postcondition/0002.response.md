To determine the output state, we first need to evaluate the provided code snippet with the initial state:

1. `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 40.
2. `a` is a list of integers with 40 elements.

The code provided is:
```
print(pow(2, a[n], 2 * (10 ** 9 + 7)) / 2 - 1) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
```

Now, let's break down the code step by step:

- The code calls `pow(2, a[n], 2 * (10 ** 9 + 7))`. This computes \(2^{a[n]} \mod (2 \times (10^9 + 7))\).
- The value of `a[n]` needs to be determined based on the input integer `n`.
- After calculating `pow(2, a[n], 2 * (10 ** 9 + 7))`, we divide the result by 2 and then subtract 1.
- Finally, we take the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Assuming `n` is given and falls within the range, we can denote `a[n]` as the integer from the list `a` at index `n`. Let's denote the value of `a[n]` as `value_a_n`.

After performing the calculations based on the provided input integer `n`, we would have a specific numerical result. 

Since the actual value of `n` is not given, but it will be within the defined limits, we can summarize the output state in a general form, indicating that a numerical result derived from the calculations is returned.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 40; `a[n]` is the corresponding integer from list `a`; the function returns the calculated value based on the formula provided.**
