To verify the correctness of the given Python program based on the provided problem description, we need to analyze the program and ensure it satisfies the requirements for all potential inputs.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem asks us to find a specific integer \( z_n \) such that the given equation is unsolvable in positive integers \( x \) and \( y \). The examples indicate:
- For \( n = 1 \), the output is \( 1 \).
- For \( n = 2 \), the output is \( 3 \).
- For \( n = 3 \), the output is \( 15 \).

### Code Analysis:
The provided program is:
```python
a = [0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 19, 31, 61, 89, 107, 127, 521, 607, 1279, 2203, 2281, 3217, 4253, 4423, 9689, 9941, 11213, 19937, 21701, 23209, 44497, 86243, 110503, 132049, 216091, 756839, 859433, 1257787, 1398269, 2976221, 3021377, 6972593, 13466917, 20996011, 24036583]
n = input()
print(pow(2, a[n], 2 * (10 ** 9 + 7)) / 2 - 1) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
```

### Potential Issues:
1. **Input Handling**: The program takes input using `input()`, which gives the value of \( n \) as a string. It needs to be converted to an integer before using it to index the list `a`.
2. **Indexing**: The list `a` is indexed using \( n \), which can potentially lead to an `IndexError` if \( n \) is not within the bounds of the list, although the problem guarantees \( 1 \leq n \leq 40 \).
3. **Integer Division**: The expression `pow(2, a[n], 2 * (10 ** 9 + 7)) / 2 - 1` performs division, which yields a floating-point result. This is not correct as the expected output should be an integer. The division should be integer division (`//`) to maintain integer results.
4. **Final Output Modulo**: The expression should be carefully structured to ensure the final result respects the modulo operation.

### Example Case:
If we consider the input `1`, the program:
- Should compute `pow(2, a[1], 2 * (10 ** 9 + 7)) // 2 - 1`.
- `a[1]` is `2`, so `pow(2, 2, 2000000014)` which is `4`.
- Then `4 // 2 - 1` results in `1`, which matches the expected output.

However, if we provide \( n = 0 \) or \( n = 41 \), which are out of the specified range, the program will throw an `IndexError`.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle the full range of potential inputs correctly, particularly for edge cases such as invalid values of \( n \) that may lead to an `IndexError`. Additionally, it doesn't strictly follow integer division, which can lead to incorrect results.

Given this analysis, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
