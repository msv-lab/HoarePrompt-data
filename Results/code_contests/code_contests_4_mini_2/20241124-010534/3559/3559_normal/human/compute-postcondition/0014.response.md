Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `x` and returns a list based on the value of `x`: [1] if `x` is 1, [3, 4] if `x` is 2, a list starting with (x / 2 + 1) and 2 followed by (x - 2) occurrences of 1 if `x` is an odd integer greater than 2, or a list starting with (x / 2 - 1) followed by (x - 1) occurrences of 1 if `x` is an even integer greater than 2. The function does not handle cases where `x` is less than 1 or greater than 100, which could result in unexpected behavior.**
