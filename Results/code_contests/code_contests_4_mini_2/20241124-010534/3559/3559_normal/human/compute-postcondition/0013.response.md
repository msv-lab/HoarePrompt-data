The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `x`. The parameter `x` is an integer. The function checks the value of `x` and returns different lists based on its value:

- If `x` is equal to 1, the function returns the list `[1]`.
- If `x` equals 2, the function returns the list `[3, 4]`.
- If `x` is an odd integer greater than 2, the function returns a list where the first element is `(x / 2 + 1)`, the second element is `2`, followed by `(x - 2)` occurrences of `1`.
- If `x` is an even integer greater than 2, the function returns a list where the first element is `(x / 2 - 1)` followed by `(x - 1)` occurrences of `1`.

The constraints for parameters `n` and `m` are maintained throughout the function's execution. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter x and returns a list based on the value of x: [1] if x is 1, [3, 4] if x is 2, a list starting with (x / 2 + 1) and 2 followed by (x - 2) occurrences of 1 if x is an odd integer greater than 2, or a list starting with (x / 2 - 1) followed by (x - 1) occurrences of 1 if x is an even integer greater than 2.**
