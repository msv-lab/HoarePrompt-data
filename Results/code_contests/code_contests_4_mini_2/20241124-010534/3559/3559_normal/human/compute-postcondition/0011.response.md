Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100, and `x` is not equal to 1. If `x` equals 2, the function returns the list [3, 4]. If `x` is an odd integer greater than 2, the function returns a list where the first element is `(x / 2 + 1)`, the second element is `2`, followed by `(x - 2)` occurrences of `1`. If `x` is an even integer greater than 2, the function returns a list where the first element is `(x / 2 - 1)` followed by `(x - 1)` occurrences of `1`. All cases ensure the values comply with the initial constraints.***
