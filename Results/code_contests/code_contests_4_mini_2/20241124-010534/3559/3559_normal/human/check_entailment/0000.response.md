Let's analyze the given Python program based on the problem description and the output hints.

### Problem Description:
The task is to create a rectangular table of size `n × m` consisting of positive integers such that the sum of the squares of numbers for each row and each column is also a square.

### Program Analysis:
The program defines a function `func_1(x)` that generates a list of integers based on the value of `x`:
1. If `x == 1`, it returns `[1]`.
2. If `x == 2`, it returns `[3, 4]`.
3. If `x` is odd and greater than 2, it returns a list starting with `(x / 2 + 1)` and `2`, followed by `(x - 2)` occurrences of `1`.
4. If `x` is even and greater than 2, it returns a list starting with `(x / 2 - 1)` followed by `(x - 1)` occurrences of `1`.

The program multiplies the results of `func_1(n)` and `func_1(m)` to generate the table.

### Output Hints:
The output hints explain what `func_1` does for various values of `x` but do not indicate whether the generated table satisfies the condition of having the sum of squares for each row and column being a perfect square.

### Initial Assessment:
1. For `n = 1` and `m = 1`, the output is `[1]`, which satisfies the condition.
2. For `n = 1` and `m = 2`, the output is `[3, 4]`, which also satisfies the condition (3² + 4² = 9 + 16 = 25, which is a square).
3. The function seems to handle other cases for `n` and `m`, but we must check if the generated lists ensure the sum of squares of each row and column is a perfect square.

### Edge Cases:
- For odd values of `n` and `m`, the function generates lists with a pattern that might not guarantee that the sum of squares is perfect.
- For even values, the function might produce lists that result in sums that are not perfect squares.

### Verification Against Output Hints:
The output hints mention that the function does not handle cases where `x` is less than 1 or greater than 100. However, since the problem constraints ensure that `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100`, this point is somewhat mitigated.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to ensure that the sum of squares of numbers in each row and each column is a square for all cases, particularly for larger values of `n` and `m`, which could lead to sums that are not perfect squares due to the way `func_1` is defined.

Thus, I conclude:

Correctness: **False**. 

A potential case where the program does not work correctly is when `n` and `m` are odd and the generated table does not result in each row and column having a sum of squares that is a perfect square.
