You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
We have added some annotations within the code to help you understand the code and its logic. The annotations are in the form of comments and are inserted automatically so double check whether the annotations are correct or not and describe the code correctly.
If the annotations are correct use them along with the code to determine the correctness of the code. If the annotations are incorrect then you can ignore them and just use the code to determine the correctness.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: While resting on the ship after the "Russian Code Cup" a boy named Misha invented an interesting game. He promised to give his quadrocopter to whoever will be the first one to make a rectangular table of size n × m, consisting of positive integers such that the sum of the squares of numbers for each row and each column was also a square.

Since checking the correctness of the table manually is difficult, Misha asks you to make each number in the table to not exceed 108.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the size of the table. 

Output

Print the table that meets the condition: n lines containing m integers, separated by spaces. If there are multiple possible answers, you are allowed to print anyone. It is guaranteed that there exists at least one correct answer.

Annotated Program:
```
def func_1(x):
    if (x == 1) :
        return [1]
        #The program returns the list [1]
    else :
        if (x == 2) :
            return [3, 4]
            #The program returns the list [3, 4]
        else :
            if (x % 2 == 1) :
                return [x / 2 + 1, 2] + [1] * (x - 2)
                #The program returns a list with the first element as (x / 2 + 1), the second element as 2, followed by (x - 2) occurrences of 1
            else :
                return [x / 2 - 1] + [1] * (x - 1)
                #The program returns a list with the first element as -0.5 (if x is 1) or 0 (if x is 2), followed by (x - 1) number of 1's. Therefore, if x is 1, the output is [-0.5]; if x is 2, the output is [0, 1].
            #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 100, and `x` is an integer not equal to 1 or 2. If `x` is odd, the function returns a list with the first element as (`x / 2 + 1`), the second element as 2, followed by (`x - 2`) occurrences of 1. If `x` is even, the function returns a list with the first element as (`x / 2 - 1`), followed by (`x - 1`) occurrences of 1. Edge cases include that the function does not handle `x` equal to 1 or 2 since these cases are excluded by the precondition.
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 100 and `x` is an integer not equal to 1. If `x` equals 2, the function returns the list [3, 4]. If `x` is an odd integer greater than 2, the function returns a list where the first element is (`x / 2 + 1`), the second element is 2, followed by (`x - 2`) occurrences of 1. If `x` is an even integer greater than 2, the function returns a list where the first element is (`x / 2 - 1`), followed by (`x - 1`) occurrences of 1. The function does not handle cases where `x` equals 1 or 2, as these are excluded by the precondition.

The function handles all specified cases based on the value of `x`, ensuring the returned lists consist of positive integers that do not exceed `10^8`.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
