To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the function `func_1` and how it satisfies the requirements of generating a rectangular table of size `n × m`, with the conditions laid out in the problem.

The function is structured as follows:

1. It checks if `x` is equal to 1. If so, it returns the list `[1]`. This satisfies the requirement for a 1x1 table, as the sum of squares would simply be 1, which is a perfect square.

2. If `x` is equal to 2, it returns the list `[3, 4]`. The sum of squares in this case would be \(3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25\), which is also a perfect square. This satisfies the requirement for a 1x2 table.

3. For odd integers greater than 2, it returns a list composed of the first element as \((x / 2 + 1)\), the second element as 2, followed by \((x - 2)\) occurrences of 1. The sum of squares for this case will depend on the specific value of `x`, but we need to ensure that the sum of the squares still results in a perfect square.

4. For even integers greater than 2, it returns a list with the first element as \((x / 2 - 1)\), followed by \((x - 1)\) occurrences of 1. Similar to the previous case, we need to check if this will yield a perfect square in all cases.

The annotations in the code imply that the function handles all specified cases, but they also mention edge cases. Notably, the function does not seem to be directly implementing the logic to generate a full table of size `n × m`. Instead, it seems to generate a single row of numbers based on the input `x`, which does not align with the requirement to print `n` lines containing `m` integers.

This leads to a critical flaw in the implementation:

### Example of Failure
If we input `n = 2` and `m = 2`, we expect a 2x2 table. However, `func_1` only generates a single row based on the value of `x`. For instance, calling `func_1(2)` yields `[3, 4]`, but there is no logic to generate another row or to ensure the sums of squares for both rows and both columns are perfect squares.

### Correctness Evaluation
Since the program does not generate a complete table as required (it only generates one row), it fails to meet the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
