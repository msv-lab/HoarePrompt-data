The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `x`. `x` is an integer such that `1 ≤ x ≤ 100`. After executing the function body, if `x` is equal to 1, the function returns the list [1]. If `x` is equal to 2, the function returns the list [3, 4]. If `x` is an odd integer greater than 2, the function returns a list where the first element is `x / 2 + 1`, the second element is 2, followed by `x - 2` occurrences of 1. If `x` is an even integer greater than 2, the function returns a list where the first element is `x / 2 - 1`, followed by `x - 1` occurrences of 1. The function ensures that all returned lists consist of positive integers that do not exceed `10^8`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter x and returns different lists based on the value of x: [1] if x is 1, [3, 4] if x is 2, a list starting with (x / 2 + 1) and followed by 2 and (x - 2) occurrences of 1 if x is an odd integer greater than 2, and a list starting with (x / 2 - 1) followed by (x - 1) occurrences of 1 if x is an even integer greater than 2.**
