Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer such that `1 ≤ x ≤ 100`. If `x` is equal to 1, the function returns the list [1]. If `x` is equal to 2, the function returns the list [3, 4]. If `x` is an odd integer greater than 2, the function returns a list where the first element is `x / 2 + 1`, the second element is 2, followed by `x - 2` occurrences of 1. If `x` is an even integer greater than 2, the function returns a list where the first element is `x / 2 - 1`, followed by `x - 1` occurrences of 1. The function handles all specified cases based on the value of `x`, ensuring the returned lists consist of positive integers that do not exceed `10^8`.***
