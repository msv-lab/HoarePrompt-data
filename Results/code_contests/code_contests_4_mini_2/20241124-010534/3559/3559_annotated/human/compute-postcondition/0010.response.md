Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 100, and `x` is an integer not equal to 1 or 2. If `x` is odd, the function returns a list with the first element as (`x / 2 + 1`), the second element as 2, followed by (`x - 2`) occurrences of 1. If `x` is even, the function returns a list with the first element as (`x / 2 - 1`), followed by (`x - 1`) occurrences of 1. Edge cases include that the function does not handle `x` equal to 1 or 2 since these cases are excluded by the precondition.***
