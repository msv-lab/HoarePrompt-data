The function accepts an integer `x`, and returns different lists based on the value of `x`: it returns [1] if `x` is 1, [3, 4] if `x` is 2, a list starting with `(x / 2 + 1)`, followed by 2 and `(x - 2)` occurrences of 1 if `x` is an odd integer greater than 2, and a list starting with `(x / 2 - 1)` followed by `(x - 1)` occurrences of 1 if `x` is an even integer greater than 2. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where `x` is less than 1 or greater than 100, and it does not specify behavior for values of `x` outside the defined conditions, which could lead to potential errors or unintended outputs.
