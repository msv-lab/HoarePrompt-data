Correctness: **False**.

The program attempts to generate a table of size `n Ã— m` with specific conditions on the sum of squares of the numbers in each row and column. However, there are several issues in the logic of the `func_1` function, particularly in how it constructs the output list based on the size of the table.

1. The function `func_1(n)` uses formulas that do not guarantee that the sum of the squares of numbers in each row will be a perfect square. For example:
   - If `n = 3`, the function returns `[2, 2, 1]`, which gives a row sum of squares as `2^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 4 + 4 + 1 = 9`, which is a perfect square. However, for larger values of `n`, the chosen numbers may not lead to a sum of squares that is a perfect square for every combination of rows and columns.
   - If `n = 4`, the function returns `[1, 1, 1, 1]`, leading to a sum of squares of `1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 = 4`, which is a perfect square, but this does not generalize to all cases.

2. The use of `x / 2` in the function can lead to floating-point results, which may cause problems when these values are used in arithmetic operations together with integers.

3. The program does not handle all edge cases. For example, if `n` or `m` is 1, the function does provide a valid output, but it does not ensure that these outputs are consistent with the requirement that sums of squares should also be squares.

Given these points, the program does not meet the problem description's requirements for all potential inputs. Therefore, the correctness of the program is determined to be false.
