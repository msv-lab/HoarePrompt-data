The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `v`. `v` is an integer within the range determined by the value of `n`, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3. Each of the preceding `n` lines contains three integers `x`, `y`, and `r`, with constraints -10 ≤ x, y ≤ 10 and 1 ≤ r ≤ 10. The function returns the value of `par[v]`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept an integer `v` and return the value of `par[v]`, which is derived from the input parameters defined in the context of `n`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer v and returns the value of par[v].**
