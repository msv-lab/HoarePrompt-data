The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `v` and `u`. The parameter `v` is an integer representing the number of circles, constrained such that 1 ≤ v ≤ 3. For each circle defined by `v`, there are two coordinates `x` and `y`, which are integers in the range [-10, 10]. Additionally, there is a radius `r`, which is an integer constrained to the range [1, 10]. The function processes these parameters to produce a specific output based on the conditions set for the circles. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_3` is to accept an integer `v` (indicating the number of circles) and the respective parameters for each circle (coordinates `x`, `y`, and radius `r`), and then return an appropriate output based on the defined relationships and constraints of these parameters. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter v (integer, 1 ≤ v ≤ 3) and for each circle, x (integer, -10 ≤ x ≤ 10), y (integer, -10 ≤ y ≤ 10), and r (integer, 1 ≤ r ≤ 10) while returning a result based on the specified conditions of these circles.**
