The code snippet assigns the result of `func_2(u)` to `par[func_2(v)]`. However, we do not have the specific values of `u` and `v`, nor do we know the implementation details of the function `func_2`. As a result, we cannot determine the exact values that `par` will hold or how it changes. 

Given that the initial state indicates `n`, `x`, `y`, and `r` but does not specify their values or how they interact with `u` and `v`, we can only infer the operation without specific outcomes.

Thus, the output state reflects the action taken without detailing specific resultant values:

Output State: **The assignment occurs; `par[func_2(v)]` is assigned the value of `func_2(u)`; values of `u` and `v` are unknown.**
