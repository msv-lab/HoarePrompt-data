Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `v` (where 1 ≤ v ≤ 3) and a list `u` of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (x, y, r) with -10 ≤ x, y ≤ 10 and 1 ≤ r ≤ 10. However, the function does not return any value or perform any visible operation as it only assigns a value to `par` without a defined context or return statement. Therefore, the functionality is incomplete and lacks output or error handling for invalid inputs. **
