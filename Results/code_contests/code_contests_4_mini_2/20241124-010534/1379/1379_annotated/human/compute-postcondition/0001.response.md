The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `v` and `u`. The parameter `v` is an integer representing the number of circles, constrained such that 1 ≤ v ≤ 3. The parameters `u` is a list containing tuples, where each tuple consists of three integers: `x`, `y`, and `r`. The values `x` and `y` are constrained to be in the range -10 to 10, and `r` is constrained such that 1 ≤ r ≤ 10. 

The function's output is not explicitly provided, but it can be inferred that based on the values of `v` and the contents of `u`, the function will perform operations related to the specified circles. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `v` (1 ≤ v ≤ 3) and a list `u` of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (x, y, r) with -10 ≤ x, y ≤ 10 and 1 ≤ r ≤ 10.**
