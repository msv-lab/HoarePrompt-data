To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we first need to analyze the code and the comments.

### Analysis of the Code

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: 
    - This function appears to operate on two parameters, `A` and `B`, performing some kind of rotation and returning a result from a `line` function. However, without additional context (e.g., the definitions of `rot`, `line`, and the types of `A` and `B`), it's difficult to ascertain its relevance to counting regions formed by circles.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
    - This function seems to implement a union-find (disjoint-set) mechanism where `par` is presumably an array that holds the parent of each element. The logic checks if `par[v]` is not equal to `v` and recursively updates it. However, it doesn't seem to directly relate to the problem of counting regions formed by circles.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
    - This function modifies the `par` array based on the results of `func_2`, suggesting a union operation. Again, this logic does not explicitly contribute to the problem of counting regions formed by the circles.

### Examination of the Problem Description

The problem involves counting the number of regions formed in a 2D plane by a set of circles. Given the constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 3), the problem can be solved by considering overlapping and non-overlapping scenarios of circles.

- **Non-overlapping circles**: Each circle contributes one new region. For `n` circles, if they do not overlap, the total regions would be `n + 1` (one for the infinite outer region).
- **Overlapping circles**: The regions formed can vary based on how many circles overlap and how they intersect.

### Example Cases

1. **Case with no overlapping** (e.g., circles at `(0,0,1)`, `(2,0,1)`, `(4,0,1)`):
   - Expected regions: 4 (3 circles + 1 infinite region).

2. **Case with touching circles** (e.g., circles at `(0,0,2)`, `(3,0,2)`, `(6,0,2)`):
   - Expected regions: 6.

3. **Case with overlapping circles** (e.g., `(0,0,2)`, `(2,0,2)`, `(1,1,2)`):
   - Expected regions: 8.

### Conclusion

The provided code does not seem to implement the logic required to count the regions formed by circles based on their overlaps. The union-find structure might be relevant if we were to track connected components of overlaps, but without the actual logic to handle circle geometry, the provided functions do not address the problem correctly.

Since the implementation does not handle the problem as described for all potential cases, we conclude that:

Correctness: **False**

### Reasoning for Incorrectness
The program lacks the necessary geometric logic to count regions formed by up to 3 circles, and it does not handle cases of overlaps, which are crucial to solving the problem as described.
