Functionality: ** The function accepts input from the user, which is expected to be a string of space-separated integers. It converts these inputs into a sorted list of integers and checks if the sum of the smallest and largest integers equals the sum of the two middle integers, or if the sum of the three smallest integers equals the largest integer. Based on these conditions, it prints 'YES' if either condition is satisfied and 'NO' otherwise. The function does not return any values. Edge cases include situations where fewer than four integers are provided, which would raise an error when trying to access indices in the `data` list. **
