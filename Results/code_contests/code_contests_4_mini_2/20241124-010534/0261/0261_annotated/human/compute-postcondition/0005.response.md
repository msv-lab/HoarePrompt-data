The code executes a print statement, which outputs 'YES'. The conditions regarding the sums of the elements in `data` have already been stated as true based on the initial state. Since the print statement does not change the values of the variables, the output state reflects that the print operation has been executed. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, and `a_4` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100 for i = 1, 2, 3, 4; `data` is a sorted list of integers converted from the original substrings in `data`; the function prints 'YES'.**
