The code takes the input string `alphabet` and splits it into a list of substrings based on whitespace. The variable `data` will hold this list. The values of the integers `a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, and `a_4` remain unchanged, and the output state reflects the new variable `data` created from `alphabet`.

Output State: **`a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, and `a_4` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100 for i = 1, 2, 3, 4; `data` is a list of substrings from `alphabet`**
