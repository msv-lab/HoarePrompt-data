Output State: **`a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, and `a_4` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100 for i = 1, 2, 3, 4; `data` is a sorted list of integers converted from the original substrings in `data`. The sum of the first and fourth elements of `data` is not equal to the sum of the second and third elements, and the sum of the first, second, and third elements of `data` is not equal to the fourth element; the output is 'NO'.**
