To determine the correctness of the given Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the logic of the code.

The problem requires us to check if it is possible to distribute four bags of candies such that two friends receive the same total number of candies. The key cases to consider are if we can split the bags in a way that satisfies this condition.

### Annotated Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    alphabet = raw_input()  # Reads a line of input
    data = alphabet.split()  # Splits the input into a list of strings
    data = [int(i) for i in data]  # Converts the strings to integers
    data.sort()  # Sorts the list of integers
    if (data[0] + data[3] == data[1] + data[2] or data[0] + data[1] + data[2] == data[3]):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
    # State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: 
    # *`a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, and `a_4` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100 for i = 1, 2, 3, 4; 
    # `data` is a sorted list of integers. 
    # If the sum of the first and fourth elements of `data` equals the sum of the second and third elements, 
    # or if the sum of the first, second, and third elements equals the fourth element, 
    # the function prints 'YES'. 
    # Otherwise, if neither of these conditions is met, the function prints 'NO'.
```

### Key Logic Examination:
The program sorts the input list `data` containing the number of candies in the four bags. It then checks two specific conditions:
1. If the sum of the smallest and largest bag equals the sum of the two middle bags.
2. If the sum of the three smallest bags equals the largest bag.

### Potential Cases:
To validate the correctness of the program, we need to consider if all possible distributions of bags are covered by the two conditions checked in the program:

1. For the input `1 7 11 5`:
   - Sorted: `1, 5, 7, 11`
   - The program checks if `1 + 11 == 5 + 7` (True), or `1 + 5 + 7 == 11` (True).
   - Output is 'YES'.

2. For the input `7 3 2 5`:
   - Sorted: `2, 3, 5, 7`
   - The program checks if `2 + 7 == 3 + 5` (False), or `2 + 3 + 5 == 7` (True).
   - Output is 'YES', which is incorrect because the distribution is impossible.

3. For the input `1 1 2 2`:
   - Sorted: `1, 1, 2, 2`
   - The program checks if `1 + 2 == 1 + 2` (True), or `1 + 1 + 2 == 2` (False).
   - Output is 'YES', which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program fails for the input `7 3 2 5` because it incorrectly outputs 'YES' while the correct answer should be 'NO'. This demonstrates a case where the program does not satisfy the problem requirements.

Correctness: **False** 

### Explanation:
The program does not correctly account for all distributions of the bags, leading to incorrect outputs in certain scenarios. Specifically, it fails to properly validate cases where the total number of candies cannot be evenly distributed between the two friends, as evidenced in example 2.
