To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the logic of the program and compare it against the requirements.

The problem states that Dawid has four bags of candies, and he wants to distribute these bags to two friends such that both friends receive the same total amount of candies. The program must output "YES" if such a distribution is possible, and "NO" if it is not.

The key logic in the program is as follows:
1. It reads the input, which consists of four integers representing the number of candies in each bag.
2. It sorts the list of candies.
3. It checks two conditions:
   - If the sum of the largest bag and the smallest bag equals the sum of the two middle bags.
   - If the sum of the three smallest bags equals the largest bag.

Let's consider some potential cases to evaluate if the program handles all scenarios correctly.

### Case 1:
Input: `1 2 3 4`
- The total candies = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10.
- Half of the total = 5.
- Possible distribution: Friend 1 gets bags with 1 and 4 (5 candies), and Friend 2 gets bags with 2 and 3 (5 candies).
- Expected output: "YES".

### Case 2:
Input: `1 1 1 1`
- The total candies = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4.
- Half of the total = 2.
- Possible distribution: Any two bags can be given to one friend.
- Expected output: "YES".

### Case 3:
Input: `4 4 4 4`
- The total candies = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16.
- Half of the total = 8.
- Possible distribution: Any two bags can be given to one friend.
- Expected output: "YES".

### Case 4:
Input: `1 2 3 5`
- The total candies = 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 = 11.
- Half of the total = 5.5 (not possible).
- Expected output: "NO".

### Case 5:
Input: `1 7 11 5`
- The total candies = 1 + 7 + 11 + 5 = 24.
- Half of the total = 12.
- Possible distribution: Friend 1 gets bags with 1 and 11 (12 candies), and Friend 2 gets bags with 7 and 5 (12 candies).
- Expected output: "YES".

### Edge Case:
Input: `1 2 3 4` (already checked, but it helps to see the edge).
- The program should correctly identify that it's possible to split the candies evenly.

### Potential Missing Case:
The program does not account for combinations of bags beyond the two explicit checks it performs. For instance, it does not check if any two bags can sum to the same total of the other two bags in a direct comparison, which is essential for ensuring all distributions are checked.

In summary, while the program handles certain cases correctly, it does not account for all possible combinations. For example, the input `1 2 3 4` would yield "YES" based on the conditions in the program, whereas it should also check combinations like `(2, 3)` against `(1, 4)` directly.

Due to this limitation and the presence of cases where the program may fail to produce the correct output, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**.
