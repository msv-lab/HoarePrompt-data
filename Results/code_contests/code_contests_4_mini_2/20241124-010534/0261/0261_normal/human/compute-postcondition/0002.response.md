The code snippet assigns a new value to the variable `data` by converting each element in the existing list `data` to an integer using a list comprehension. The initial state specifies that `data` is a list of substrings derived from an input string `alphabet`. The original values of the integers `a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, and `a_4` are not directly affected by this operation.

Since `data` was a list of substrings, the transformation will depend on the content of `data` before the operation. The integers `a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, and `a_4` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, and `a_4` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100 for i = 1, 2, 3, 4; `data` is a list of integers converted from the previous list of substrings.**
