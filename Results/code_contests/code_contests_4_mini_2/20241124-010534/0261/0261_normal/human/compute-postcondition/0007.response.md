The code prints 'NO', and it does not change the state of any variables. Therefore, the output state indicates the values of the variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, and `a_4` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100 for i = 1, 2, 3, 4; `data` is a sorted list of these integers, and the output is 'NO'.**
