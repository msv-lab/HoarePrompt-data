Postcondition: ***`a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, and `a_4` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100 for i = 1, 2, 3, 4; `data` is a sorted list of these integers. If the sum of the smallest and largest elements equals the sum of the two middle elements, or if the sum of the three smallest elements equals the largest element, the function prints 'YES'. Otherwise, the function prints 'NO'.***
