Postcondition: ***`a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, and `a_4` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100 for i = 1, 2, 3, 4; `data` is a sorted list of these integers. The sum of the smallest and largest elements in `data` is not equal to the sum of the two middle elements, and the sum of the smallest three elements in `data` is not equal to the largest element.***
