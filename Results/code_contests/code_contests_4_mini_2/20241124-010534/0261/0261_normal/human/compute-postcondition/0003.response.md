The `data` list is sorted in ascending order. The initial values of `a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, and `a_4` are integers between 1 and 100, and `data` is derived from these integers. Since the exact values of `a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, and `a_4` are not specified, we can only determine that `data` will be a list containing these integers. After sorting, the order of the integers in `data` will reflect their ascending sequence.

Therefore, the output state is: `a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, and `a_4` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100 for i = 1, 2, 3, 4; `data` is a sorted list of these integers.

Output State: **`a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, and `a_4` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100 for i = 1, 2, 3, 4; `data` is a sorted list of these integers.**
