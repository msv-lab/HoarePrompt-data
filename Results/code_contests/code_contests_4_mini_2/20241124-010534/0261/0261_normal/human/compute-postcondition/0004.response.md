Postcondition: ***`a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, and `a_4` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100 for i = 1, 2, 3, 4; `data` is a sorted list of these integers. The sum of the smallest and largest elements of `data` equals the sum of the two middle elements of `data`, or the sum of the first three elements of `data` equals the largest element of `data`.***
