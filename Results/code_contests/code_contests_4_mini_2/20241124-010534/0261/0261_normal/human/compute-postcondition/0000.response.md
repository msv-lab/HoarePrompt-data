The variable `alphabet` is assigned the value obtained from `raw_input()`, which accepts a string input from the user. The values of `a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, and `a_4` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged integer variables and indicates that `alphabet` has been set to the user input string.

Output State: **`a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, and `a_4` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100 for i = 1, 2, 3, 4; `alphabet` is a user input string**
