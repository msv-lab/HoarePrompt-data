The code prints 'YES'. The initial state mentions specific constraints about the integers `a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, and `a_4`, and the conditions on the sorted list `data`. However, since the code directly prints 'YES' without modifying any variables, the output state reflects only the printed result. 

Output State: **The function prints 'YES'**
