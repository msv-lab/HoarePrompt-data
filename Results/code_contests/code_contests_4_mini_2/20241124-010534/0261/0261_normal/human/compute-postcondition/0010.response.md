Functionality: ** The function accepts input from the user, which is expected to be a space-separated string of four integers between 1 and 100. It then checks if the sum of the smallest and largest integers equals the sum of the two middle integers, or if the sum of the three smallest integers equals the largest integer. Based on this check, it prints 'YES' if either condition is met and 'NO' otherwise. The function does not have a return value. **
