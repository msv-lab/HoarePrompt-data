The variable `data` is assigned the value of `alphabet.split()`, which splits the input string `alphabet` into a list of substrings based on whitespace. The variables `a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, and `a_4` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged integer variables and the newly created list variable `data`.

Output State: **`a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, and `a_4` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100 for i = 1, 2, 3, 4; `data` is a list of substrings from the input string `alphabet`**
