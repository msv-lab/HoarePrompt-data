Postcondition: ***`first`, `second`, and `third` are updated to the respective tuples (max(a, b), min(a, b)), (max(a, c), min(a, c)), and (max(b, c), min(b, c)). The variable `i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains unchanged, and `challengers` contains an additional tuple (a, b, c). If `second` is present in `one`, then `two[second]` is updated to `one[second][0] + b`, and `ans` is appended with the tuple (one[second][0] + b, second[0], second[1], one[second][1], i). If `second` is not in `one`, no changes occur to `two` or `ans`. Thus, if `second` is in `one`, the state of `two` and `ans` reflects the update with the addition of `b`, while maintaining the other variable states as described.***
