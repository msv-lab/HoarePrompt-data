The variable `two[second]` is assigned the value of `one[second][0] + b`. This operation uses the value from the `one` dictionary at the key `second`, specifically the first element of the tuple at that key, and adds it to `b`. The previous values of `one[second][0]`, `b`, and `two` are not provided, but the assignment operation will result in `two[second]` being updated accordingly. Therefore, the output state is that `two[second]` now holds the new calculated value.

Output State: **`two[second]` is updated to `one[second][0] + b`**
