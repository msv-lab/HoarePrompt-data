Postcondition: ***If the minimum value among `a`, `b`, and `c` is greater than `cnt`, then `label` is set to 1, `cnt` is updated to that minimum value, and `first` is set to 2; otherwise, `label` remains 0, `cnt` stays unchanged, `first` remains empty, and `second` is still empty, while `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, and `ans` contains at least 1 element.***
