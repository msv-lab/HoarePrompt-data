The code assigns `second` with two values: `max(a, c)` and `min(a, c)`. The previous state of `first` is a tuple containing the maximum and minimum of `a` and `b`, but it does not affect the new assignment of `second`. The values of `a` and `c` are not specified, so we cannot determine the exact values of `second`. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `second` is now assigned the maximum and minimum of `a` and `c`, while `first` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`first` is assigned a tuple (max(a, b), min(a, b)); `second` is assigned (max(a, c), min(a, c))**
