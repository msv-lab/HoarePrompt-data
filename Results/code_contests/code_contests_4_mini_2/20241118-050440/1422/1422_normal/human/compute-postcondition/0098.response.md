Postcondition: ***`first` is a tuple containing the maximum of `a` and `b` and the minimum of `a` and `b`; `second` is (max(a, c), min(a, c)); `third` is (max(b, c), min(b, c)); `i` has been incremented by 1; `n` is greater than `i`; and `challengers` now contains an additional tuple (a, b, c). If `first` is in `two` and `two[first]` is less than `one[first][0] + c`, then `ans` is updated to include the tuple (one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i), and `two[first]` is assigned the value of `one[first][0] + c`. If `first` is in `two` but `two[first]` is not less than `one[first][0] + c`, then `two[first]` remains unchanged. If `first` is in `one`, then `two[first]` is updated to `one[first][0] + c`, and `ans` is appended with the entry (one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i). If `first` is not in `two` or `one`, then no changes are made to `two` or `ans`.***
