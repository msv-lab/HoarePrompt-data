The variable `challengers` is assigned an empty list, and this assignment does not affect the values of `n`, `one`, `two`, or `ans`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `one` is an empty dictionary; `two` is an empty dictionary; `ans` is an empty list; `challengers` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `one` is an empty dictionary; `two` is an empty dictionary; `ans` is an empty list; `challengers` is an empty list**
