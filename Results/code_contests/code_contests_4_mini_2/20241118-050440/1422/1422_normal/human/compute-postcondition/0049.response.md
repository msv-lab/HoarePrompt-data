Postcondition: ***`first`, `second`, and `third` are tuples representing the max and min values among `a`, `b`, and `c`. If `second` is not present in `one` or if the first element of `one[second]` is less than `b`, then `one[second]` is updated to the tuple `(b, i)`. Otherwise, `one[second]` remains unchanged. The relationships among `first`, `second`, and `third` with respect to the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are preserved throughout the execution.***
