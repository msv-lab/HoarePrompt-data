Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, and `one`, `two`, `ans` contain at least one element. If the minimum value among `a`, `b`, and `c` is greater than `cnt`, then `label` is set to 2, `cnt` is updated to the minimum of `a`, `b`, and `c`, `first` is assigned the value of `ind1`, and `second` is assigned the value of `ind2`. If the minimum value among `a`, `b`, and `c` is less than or equal to `cnt`, the values of `label`, `cnt`, `first`, and `second` remain unchanged.***
