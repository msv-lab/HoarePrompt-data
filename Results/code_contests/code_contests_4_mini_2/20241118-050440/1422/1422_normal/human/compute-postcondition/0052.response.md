Postcondition: ***`first`, `second`, and `third` are tuples representing the max and min values among `a`, `b`, and `c`. If `third` is not present in `one` or the first element of `one[third]` is less than `a`, then `one[third]` is updated to `(a, i)`. Otherwise, `one[third]` remains unchanged, preserving the relationships among `first`, `second`, and `third` with respect to the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.***
