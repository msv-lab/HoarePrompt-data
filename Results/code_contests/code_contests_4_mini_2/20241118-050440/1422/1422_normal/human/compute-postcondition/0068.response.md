Postcondition: ***`first`, `second`, and `third` are updated to their respective tuples based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains unchanged, and `challengers` contains an additional tuple (a, b, c). If `two[second]` is less than `one[second][0] + b`, then `ans` is appended with the tuple (one[second][0] + b, second[0], second[1], one[second][1], i) and `two[second]` is updated to `one[second][0] + b`. There are no further conditions or changes if `two[second]` is not less than `one[second][0] + b`.***
