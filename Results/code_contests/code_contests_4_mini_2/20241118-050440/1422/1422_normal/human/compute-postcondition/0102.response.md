Output State: **`first` is a tuple containing the maximum of `a` and `b` and the minimum of `a` and `b`; `second` is (max(a, c), min(a, c)); `third` is (max(b, c), min(b, c)); `i` has been incremented by 1; `n` is greater than `i`; `challengers` now contains an additional tuple (a, b, c); `two[second]` is assigned the value of `one[second][0] + b`.**
