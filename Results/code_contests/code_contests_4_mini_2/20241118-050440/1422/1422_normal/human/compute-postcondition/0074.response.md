Output State: **`first`, `second`, and `third` are updated to the respective tuples (max(a, b), min(a, b)), (max(a, c), min(a, c)), and (max(b, c), min(b, c)); `i` is incremented by 1; `n` remains unchanged; `challengers` contains an additional tuple (a, b, c); `ans` is appended with the tuple (one[third][0] + a, third[0], third[1], one[third][1], i); `two[third]` is assigned the value of `one[third][0] + a`.**
