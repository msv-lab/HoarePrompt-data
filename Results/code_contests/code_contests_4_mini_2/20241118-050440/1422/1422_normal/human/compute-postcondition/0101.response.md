Postcondition: ***Given that `first` is a tuple containing the maximum of `a` and `b` and the minimum of `a` and `b`, `second` represents (max(a, c), min(a, c)), and `third` is (max(b, c), min(b, c)), with `i` incremented by 1 and `n` greater than `i`, if `second` is in `two` and `two[second]` is less than `one[second][0] + c`, then `ans` is updated to include the tuple (one[second][0] + b, second[0], second[1], one[second][1], i), and `two[second]` is assigned the value of `one[second][0] + b`. If `two[second]` is not less than `one[second][0] + c`, then `two[second]` remains unchanged. If `second` is not in `two`, then no changes are made to `two` or `ans`. In all cases, `challengers` contains an additional tuple (a, b, c).***
