The variable `one` is assigned an empty dictionary. The value of `n` remains unchanged and is still an input integer within the specified range. The state of the other variables is not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `one` is an empty dictionary.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `one` is an empty dictionary**
