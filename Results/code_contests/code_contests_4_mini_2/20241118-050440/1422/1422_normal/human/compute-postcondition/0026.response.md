Postcondition: ***`first`, `second`, and `third` are tuples representing the max and min values among `a`, `b`, and `c`. If `two[second]` is less than `one[second][0] + c`, then `ans` is updated to include a tuple consisting of `one[second][0] + b`, `second[0]`, `second[1]`, and `one[second][1]`, while `two[second]` is updated to `one[second][0] + b`. If `two[second]` is not less than `one[second][0] + c`, the values of `ans` and `two` remain unchanged. The state of `two` is unchanged if `two[second]` is not modified.***
