The variable `third` is assigned the values `max(b, c)` and `min(b, c)`. The previous values of `b` and `c` are not specified, so we can only express the results in terms of them. The other variables (`first`, `second`, `i`, and `n`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated values of `third` based on the maximum and minimum of `b` and `c`.

Output State: **`first` is updated to (max(a, b), min(a, b)), `second` is updated to (max(a, c), min(a, c)), `third` is updated to (max(b, c), min(b, c)), `i` is adjusted to `i + 1`, `n` remains unchanged, and `challengers` now contains an additional tuple (a, b, c)**.
