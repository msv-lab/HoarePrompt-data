Postcondition: ***`label` is 1 if the minimum value among `a`, `b`, and `c` is greater than `cnt`, in which case `cnt` is updated to that minimum value and `first` is set to `i`. If the minimum value among `a`, `b`, and `c` is less than or equal to `cnt`, `label` remains 0, `cnt` stays unchanged, and `first` remains empty. Additionally, `second` is still empty, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and `ans` contains at least 1 element, while `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the values from `challengers[i]`.***
