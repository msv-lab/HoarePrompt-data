Postcondition: ***`first`, `second`, and `third` are updated to the respective tuples (max(a, b), min(a, b)), (max(a, c), min(a, c)), and (max(b, c), min(b, c)). The variable `i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains unchanged, and `challengers` contains an additional tuple (a, b, c). If `second` is in `two` and `two[second]` is less than `one[second][0] + b`, then `ans` includes the tuple (one[second][0] + b, second[0], second[1], one[second][1], i) and `two[second]` is set to `one[second][0] + b`. If `second` is in `one`, `two[second]` is updated to `one[second][0] + b` and `ans` is appended with the tuple (one[second][0] + b, second[0], second[1], one[second][1], i). If `second` is neither in `two` nor in `one`, no changes occur to `two` or `ans`, leaving their states unchanged. Thus, the overall state reflects the updates based on the presence of `second` in `two` or `one`, ensuring all possible scenarios are accounted for.***
