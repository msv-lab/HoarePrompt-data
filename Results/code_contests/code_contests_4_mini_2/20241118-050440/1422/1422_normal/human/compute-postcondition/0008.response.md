To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we analyze the effect of the code on the initial state.

The line of code:
```
first = max(a, b), min(a, b)
```
assigns a tuple to `first`, where the first element is the maximum of `a` and `b`, and the second element is the minimum of `a` and `b`. 

However, we do not have the specific values of `a`, `b`, and `c` as they were not defined in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact values for `first`.

The output state will indicate that `first` is assigned a tuple of the maximum and minimum of `a` and `b`, but we lack the values of `a` and `b` to provide specific numerical results.

Thus, the output state is:
Output State: **`first` is assigned a tuple (max(a, b), min(a, b))**
