Output State: **`label` is 1 if the minimum value among `a`, `b`, and `c` is greater than `cnt`, in which case `cnt` is updated to that minimum value and `first` is set to `i`; otherwise, `label` remains 0, `cnt` stays unchanged, and `first` remains empty; `second` is still empty; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 2; `ans` contains at least 1 element; `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the values from `challengers[i]`.**
