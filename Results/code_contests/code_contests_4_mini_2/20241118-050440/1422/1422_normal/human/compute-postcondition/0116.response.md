Postcondition: ***`first`, `second`, `third` are tuples containing the maximum and minimum of `a`, `b`, and `c`; `i` has been incremented by 1; `n` is greater than `i`; and `challengers` includes an additional tuple (a, b, c). If `second` is not in `one` or the first element of `one[second]` is less than `b`, then `one[second]` is updated to (b, i). If `second` is in `one` and the first element of `one[second]` is greater than or equal to `b`, then `one[second]` remains unchanged. No modifications are made to `two` or `ans`, and all relationships and values in the precondition are preserved after execution.***
