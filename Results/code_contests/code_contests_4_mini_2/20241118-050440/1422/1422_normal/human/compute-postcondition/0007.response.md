The `challengers` list is modified by appending a tuple containing the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`. The initial state indicates that `challengers` is an empty list, so after the operation, it will contain one tuple with the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `i` is 0, `one` is an empty dictionary, `two` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is an empty list, `challengers` is a list containing one tuple (a, b, c)**.
