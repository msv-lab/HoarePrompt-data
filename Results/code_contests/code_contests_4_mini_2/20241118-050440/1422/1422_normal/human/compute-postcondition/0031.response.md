Postcondition: ***`first` is (max(a, b), min(a, b)); `second` is (max(a, c), min(a, c)); `third` is (max(b, c), min(b, c)); if `second` is in `one`, then `two[second]` is updated to the sum of `one[second][0]` and `b`, and `ans` is updated to include the tuple (one[second][0] + b, second[0], second[1], one[second][1], i). If `second` is not in `one`, then `two` remains unchanged and `ans` stays the same. The relationship between `first`, `second`, and `third` remains consistent with their definitions.***
