Postcondition: ***If `ans` contains at least one element, and `label` is 1, `stdout` writes '1' followed by `first + 1`, where `first` holds the index of the last challenger whose minimum value among `a`, `b`, and `c` was greater than `cnt`. If `label` is 0, `stdout` writes '2' followed by `first + 1` and `second + 1`, where `first` remains unchanged and `second` is also unchanged, indicating that no minimum value was greater than `cnt`. If `ans` is empty, `stdout` will not execute any write operation, and all variables (`label`, `cnt`, `first`, `second`) will remain unchanged (0 for `label`, `cnt`, and empty for `first`, `second`).***
