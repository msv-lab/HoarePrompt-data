Postcondition: ***`first`, `second`, and `third` are tuples representing the max and min values among `a`, `b`, and `c`. Either `first` is not in `one` or the first element of `one[first]` is less than `c`. The relationships among `first`, `second`, and `third` remain consistent with their definitions based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`. Depending on the presence of `third` in `two` or `one`, `two[third]` may have been updated to `one[third][0] + a`, and `ans` may have been appended with the tuple `(one[third][0] + a, third[0], third[1], one[third][1], i)` if applicable. If `third` is neither in `two` nor in `one`, both `two` and `ans` remain unchanged.***
