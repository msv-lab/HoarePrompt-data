Postcondition: ***`first` is a tuple containing the maximum of `a` and `b` and the minimum of `a` and `b`; `second` is (max(a, c), min(a, c)); `third` is (max(b, c), min(b, c)); `i` has been incremented by 1; `n` is greater than `i`; `challengers` contains an additional tuple (a, b, c); if `first` is in `one`, then `two[first]` is updated to the sum of `one[first][0]` and `c`, and `ans` has a new entry consisting of `(one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i)`. If `first` is not in `one`, then no changes are made to `two` or `ans`.***
