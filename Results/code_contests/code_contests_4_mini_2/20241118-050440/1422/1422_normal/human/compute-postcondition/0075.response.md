Postcondition: ***`first`, `second`, and `third` are tuples representing (max(a, b), min(a, b)), (max(a, c), min(a, c)), and (max(b, c), min(b, c)) respectively. The variable `i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains unchanged, and `challengers` contains an additional tuple (a, b, c). If `two[third]` is less than `one[third][0] + c`, then `ans` includes the tuple (one[third][0] + a, third[0], third[1], one[third][1], i) and `two[third]` is updated to the value of `one[third][0] + a`. If `two[third]` is greater than or equal to `one[third][0] + c`, there are no changes made to `ans` or `two`. All scenarios are accounted for, ensuring the integrity of the program's state.***
