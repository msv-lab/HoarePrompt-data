Output State: **`first` is (max(a, b), min(a, b)); `second` is (max(a, c), min(a, c)); `third` is (max(b, c), min(b, c)); `first` is an element of `two`; the value of `two[first]` is less than the sum of `one[first][0]` and `c`; and `ans` is appended with the tuple (one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i)**
