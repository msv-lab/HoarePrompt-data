Postcondition: ***`first`, `second`, and `third` are tuples representing the max and min values among `a`, `b`, and `c`, with `third` not in `two`. If `third` is in `one`, `two[third]` is updated to `one[third][0] + a`, and `ans` includes the tuple `(one[third][0] + a, third[0], third[1], one[third][1], i)`. If `third` is not in `one`, both `two` and `ans` remain unchanged. The relationships among `first`, `second`, and `third` remain consistent with their definitions based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`. All edge cases regarding the presence of `third` in `one` and the updates to `two` and `ans` are covered.***
