Postcondition: ***`first`, `second`, and `third` are updated to the respective tuples (max(a, b), min(a, b)), (max(a, c), min(a, c)), and (max(b, c), min(b, c)). The variable `i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains unchanged, and `challengers` now contains an additional tuple (a, b, c). If `first` is in `two` and `two[first]` is less than `one[first][0] + c`, then `ans` is updated to include the tuple (one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i), and `two[first]` is set to `one[first][0] + c`. If `first` is in `one`, then `two[first]` is updated to `one[first][0] + c`, and `ans` is appended with the tuple (one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i).***
