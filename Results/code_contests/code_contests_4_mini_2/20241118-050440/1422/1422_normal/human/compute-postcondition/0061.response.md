Postcondition: ***`first`, `second`, and `third` are updated to the respective tuples (max(a, b), min(a, b)), (max(a, c), min(a, c)), and (max(b, c), min(b, c)). The variable `i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains unchanged, and `challengers` now includes the tuple (a, b, c). If `two[first]` is less than `one[first][0] + c`, `ans` is updated to include the tuple (one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i), and `two[first]` is set to the value of `one[first][0] + c`.***
