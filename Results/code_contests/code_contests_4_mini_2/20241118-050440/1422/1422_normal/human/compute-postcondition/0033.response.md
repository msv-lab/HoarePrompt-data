Postcondition: ***`first`, `second`, and `third` are tuples representing the max and min values among `a`, `b`, and `c`. `third` is in `two`, and the relationships among `first`, `second`, and `third` are consistent with their definitions based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`. The state of `two` and `ans` may have been updated based on the conditions specified in the precondition, depending on the values of `second` and `two[second]`.***
