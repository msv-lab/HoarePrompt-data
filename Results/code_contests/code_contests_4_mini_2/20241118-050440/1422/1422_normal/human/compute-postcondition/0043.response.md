Postcondition: ***`first`, `second`, and `third` are tuples representing the max and min values among `a`, `b`, and `c`. If `third` is in `two` and `two[third]` is less than `one[third][0] + c`, then `two[third]` is updated to `one[third][0] + a` and `ans` is appended with the tuple `(one[third][0] + a, third[0], third[1], one[third][1], i)`. If `two[third]` is greater than or equal to `one[third][0] + c`, no changes are made to `ans` or `two[third]`. If `third` is in `one` but not in `two`, then `two[third]` is updated to `one[third][0] + a` and `ans` is appended with the tuple `(one[third][0] + a, third[0], third[1], one[third][1], i)`. If `third` is neither in `two` nor in `one`, both `two` and `ans` remain unchanged. The relationships among `first`, `second`, and `third` remain consistent with their definitions based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, and all edge cases regarding the presence of `third` in `two` or `one` and the respective updates to `two` and `ans` are handled.***
