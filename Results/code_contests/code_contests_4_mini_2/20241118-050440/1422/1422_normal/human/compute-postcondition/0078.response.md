Postcondition: ***`first`, `second`, and `third` are tuples of (max(a, b), min(a, b)), (max(a, c), min(a, c)), and (max(b, c), min(b, c)). The variable `i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains unchanged, and `challengers` contains an additional tuple (a, b, c). If `third` is in `one`, then `two[third]` is updated to `one[third][0] + a`, and `ans` includes the tuple (one[third][0] + a, third[0], third[1], one[third][1], i). If `third` is not in `one`, then no changes occur to `two` or `ans`, leaving their states unchanged. Thus, the state reflects the updates based on the presence of `third` in `one`, ensuring all possible scenarios are accounted for.***
