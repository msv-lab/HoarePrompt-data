Postcondition: ***`first`, `second`, `third` are tuples containing the maximum and minimum of `a`, `b`, and `c`; `i` has been incremented by 1; `n` is greater than `i`; and `challengers` includes an additional tuple (a, b, c). If `third` is not in `one` or the first element of `one[third]` is less than `a`, then `one[third]` is updated to (a, i). Otherwise, `one[third]` remains unchanged. The relationships and values in the precondition are preserved after execution.***
