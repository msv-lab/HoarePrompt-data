Postcondition: ***`first`, `second`, and `third` are tuples representing (max(a, b), min(a, b)), (max(a, c), min(a, c)), and (max(b, c), min(b, c)), respectively; `i` is incremented by 1; `n` remains unchanged; and `challengers` contains an additional tuple (a, b, c). If `third` is not found in `one`, or if `one[third][0]` is less than `a`, then `one` is updated with `one[third] = (a, i)`. If `third` is already in `one` and `one[third][0]` is greater than or equal to `a`, then `one` remains unchanged, and the states of `first`, `second`, `third`, `i`, `n`, `challengers`, and any other variables remain unaffected.***
