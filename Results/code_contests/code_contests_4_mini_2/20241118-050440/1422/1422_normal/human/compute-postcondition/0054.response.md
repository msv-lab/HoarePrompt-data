The line of code `a, b, c = map(int, stdin.readline().split())` assigns values to `a`, `b`, and `c` by reading a line from standard input, splitting it into components, and converting those components to integers. The tuples `first`, `second`, and `third` which represent the max and min values among `a`, `b`, and `c`, will be affected by the new values assigned. However, since the actual values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not provided, we can't specify them. The other variables, `i` and `n`, remain unchanged.

The output state will reflect the changes to `a`, `b`, and `c` without specifying their exact values but indicating they have been updated.

Output State: **`first`, `second`, `third` are updated tuples representing the new max and min values among `a`, `b`, and `c`; `i` is adjusted to `i + 1`, `n` remains unchanged.**
