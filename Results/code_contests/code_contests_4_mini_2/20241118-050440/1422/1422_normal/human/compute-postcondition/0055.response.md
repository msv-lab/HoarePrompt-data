The code appends a tuple `(a, b, c)` to the list `challengers`. The values of `first`, `second`, and `third` remain unchanged as they represent the max and min values among `a`, `b`, and `c`. The variable `i` is also not affected by this operation, and `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `first`, `second`, and `third` are updated tuples representing the new max and min values among `a`, `b`, and `c`; `i` is adjusted to `i + 1`; `n` remains unchanged; `challengers` now contains an additional tuple `(a, b, c)`.

Output State: **`first`, `second`, `third` are updated tuples representing the new max and min values among `a`, `b`, and `c`; `i` is adjusted to `i + 1`; `n` remains unchanged; `challengers` now contains an additional tuple `(a, b, c)`**
