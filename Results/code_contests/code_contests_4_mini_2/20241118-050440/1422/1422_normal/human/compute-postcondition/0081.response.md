Postcondition: ***`first`, `second`, and `third` are tuples representing (max(a, b), min(a, b)), (max(a, c), min(a, c)), and (max(b, c), min(b, c)), respectively; `i` is incremented by 1; `n` remains unchanged; `challengers` contains an additional tuple (a, b, c). If `first` is not found in `one` or if `one[first][0]` is less than `c`, then `one[first]` is updated to (c, i). If `first` is already in `one` and `one[first][0]` is greater than or equal to `c`, no changes are made to `one` or `i`. The states of `two`, `ans`, and `challengers` remain unaffected by this operation.***
