Postcondition: ***`first`, `second`, and `third` are tuples representing (max(a, b), min(a, b)), (max(a, c), min(a, c)), and (max(b, c), min(b, c)), respectively. The variable `i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains unchanged, and `challengers` contains an additional tuple (a, b, c). If `third` is found in `two` and `two[third]` is less than `one[third][0] + c`, then `ans` is updated with the tuple (one[third][0] + a, third[0], third[1], one[third][1], i) and `two[third]` is set to `one[third][0] + a`. If `third` is in `two` but `two[third]` is greater than or equal to `one[third][0] + c`, no changes are made to `ans` or `two`. If `third` is in `one`, `two[third]` is updated to `one[third][0] + a`, and `ans` is appended with the tuple (one[third][0] + a, third[0], third[1], one[third][1], i). If `third` is not found in either `two` or `one`, no changes occur to `two` or `ans`, maintaining their states. This comprehensive structure ensures all scenarios related to the presence of `third` in `two` and `one` are accounted for.***
