Postcondition: ***`first`, `second`, `third` are tuples containing the maximum and minimum of `a`, `b`, and `c`; `i` has been incremented by 1; `n` is greater than `i`; and `challengers` includes an additional tuple (a, b, c). If `third` is in `one`, then `two[third]` is updated to `one[third][0] + a`, and `ans` is appended with the tuple (one[third][0] + a, third[0], third[1], one[third][1], i). If `third` is not in `one`, no changes are made to `two` or `ans`. This ensures that the relationships and values in the precondition are maintained after execution.***
