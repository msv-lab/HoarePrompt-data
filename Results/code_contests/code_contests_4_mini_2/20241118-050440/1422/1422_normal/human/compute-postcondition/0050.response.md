Postcondition: ***`first`, `second`, and `third` are tuples representing the max and min values among `a`, `b`, and `c`. The variable `third` is either not present in `one` or the first element of `one[third]` is less than `a`. The relationships among `first`, `second`, and `third` with respect to the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are preserved throughout the execution.***
