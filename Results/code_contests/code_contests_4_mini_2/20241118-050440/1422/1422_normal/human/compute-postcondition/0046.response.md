Postcondition: ***`first`, `second`, and `third` are tuples representing the max and min values among `a`, `b`, and `c`. If `first` is not in `one` or if `one[first][0]` is less than `c`, then `one[first]` is updated to the tuple `(c, i)`. If neither condition is met, `one[first]` remains unchanged. The relationships among `first`, `second`, and `third` remain consistent with their definitions, and all edge cases regarding the presence of `first` in `one` and the respective updates to `one` are handled.**
