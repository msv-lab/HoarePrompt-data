Postcondition: ***`first`, `second`, and `third` are tuples representing the max and min values among `a`, `b`, and `c`. Either `second` is not present in `one` or the first element of `one[second]` is less than `b`, which may lead to an update of `one[second]` to the tuple `(b, i)`. The relationships among `first`, `second`, and `third` remain consistent with their definitions, and the integrity of `one` is maintained according to the described conditions.***
