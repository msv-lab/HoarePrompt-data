Postcondition: ***`first` is a tuple containing the maximum of `a` and `b` and the minimum of `a` and `b`; `second` is (max(a, c), min(a, c)); `third` is (max(b, c), min(b, c)); `i` is incremented by 1; `n` is greater than `i`; `challengers` now contains an additional tuple (a, b, c). If `two[first]` is less than `one[first][0] + c`, then `ans` is updated to include the tuple (one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i), and `two[first]` is assigned the value of `one[first][0] + c`. Otherwise, `two[first]` remains unchanged.***
