Postcondition: ***`first`, `second`, and `third` are tuples representing the max and min values among `a`, `b`, and `c`. `third` is not in `two`. The relationships among `first`, `second`, and `third` are consistent with their definitions based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`. If `second` is in `two`, then `two[second]` remains unchanged. If `second` is in `one`, then `two[second]` could be updated to `one[second][0] + b`, and `ans` may include the tuple `(one[second][0] + b, second[0], second[1], one[second][1], i)`. If `second` is neither in `two` nor in `one`, then both `two` and `ans` remain unchanged. All edge cases regarding the presence of `second` in either `two` or `one` and the conditions of `two[second]` are covered.***
