Postcondition: ***`first`, `second`, and `third` are tuples representing the max and min values among `a`, `b`, and `c`. `third` is not in `two`. The relationships among `first`, `second`, and `third` are consistent with their definitions based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`. Additionally, `third` is in `one`, and the state of `two` and `ans` may be affected based on the conditions set forth in the precondition regarding the presence of `second` in `one` or `two`.***
