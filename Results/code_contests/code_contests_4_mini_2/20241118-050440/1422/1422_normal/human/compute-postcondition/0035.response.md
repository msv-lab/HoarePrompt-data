Output State: **`first`, `second`, and `third` are tuples representing the max and min values among `a`, `b`, and `c`; `third` is in `two`; the relationships among `first`, `second`, and `third` are consistent with their definitions based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`; `two[third]` is less than `one[third][0] + c`; `ans` is updated to include ((one[third][0] + a), third[0], third[1], one[third][1], i).**
