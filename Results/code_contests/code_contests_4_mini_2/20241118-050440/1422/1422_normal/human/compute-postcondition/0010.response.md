To determine the output state after executing the provided code, let's analyze the initial state and the impact of the code snippet.

Initial State: 
- `first` is a tuple assigned as `(max(a, b), min(a, b))`
- `second` is a tuple assigned as `(max(a, c), min(a, c))`

In the code snippet:
```
third = max(b, c), min(b, c)
```

Here, `third` is assigned a tuple consisting of two values: the maximum of `b` and `c`, and the minimum of `b` and `c`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not specified, but the calculations will be based on whatever values they hold. 

Since no actual values for `a`, `b`, or `c` are provided, we simply state that `third` is a tuple containing the maximum and minimum of `b` and `c`.

Output State: **`first` is (max(a, b), min(a, b)); `second` is (max(a, c), min(a, c)); `third` is (max(b, c), min(b, c))**
