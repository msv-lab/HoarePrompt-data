Postcondition: ***`first`, `second`, and `third` are tuples representing the max and min values among `a`, `b`, and `c`. If `two[third]` is less than `one[third][0] + c`, then `ans` is updated to include a tuple containing `one[third][0] + a`, the first element of `third`, the second element of `third`, `one[third][1]`, and `i`. Additionally, `two[third]` is updated to `one[third][0] + a`. If `two[third]` is greater than or equal to `one[third][0] + c`, no changes are made to `ans` or `two[third]`. The relationships among `first`, `second`, and `third` remain consistent with their definitions based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.***
