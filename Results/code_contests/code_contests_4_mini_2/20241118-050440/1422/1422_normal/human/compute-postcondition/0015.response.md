Postcondition: ***`first` is (max(a, b), min(a, b)); `second` is (max(a, c), min(a, c)); `third` is (max(b, c), min(b, c)); `two[first]` is updated to `one[first][0] + c` if `two[first]` is less than `one[first][0] + c`, and `ans` is appended with the tuple `(one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i)`. If `two[first]` is not less than `one[first][0] + c`, then `two[first]` remains unchanged.***
