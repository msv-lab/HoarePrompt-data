Postcondition: ***`first` is (max(a, b), min(a, b)) and is not an element of `two`. If `first` is an element of `one`, then `two[first]` is updated to `one[first][0] + c`, and `ans` is appended with the tuple `(one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i)`. If `first` is not an element of `one`, no changes occur to `two` or `ans`.***
