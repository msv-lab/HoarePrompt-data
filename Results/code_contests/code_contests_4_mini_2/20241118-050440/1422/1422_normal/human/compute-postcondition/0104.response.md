Postcondition: ***`first`, `second`, `third` are tuples containing maximum and minimum values of `a`, `b`, and `c`; `i` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `n` is greater than `i`; `challengers` contains an additional tuple (a, b, c). If `second` is found in `one`, then `two[second]` is updated to `one[second][0] + b`, and `ans` includes a tuple of the form (one[second][0] + b, second[0], second[1], one[second][1], i). If `second` is not in `one`, then `two` and `ans` remain unchanged. Additionally, if `first` and `second` are in `two`, the values in `two` may be updated based on the previously described logic, ensuring that the conditions established in the precondition remain satisfied.***
