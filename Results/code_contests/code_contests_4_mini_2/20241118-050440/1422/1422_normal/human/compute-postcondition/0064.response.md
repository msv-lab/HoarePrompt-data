Postcondition: ***`first` is updated to (max(a, b), min(a, b)), `second` is updated to (max(a, c), min(a, c)), `third` is updated to (max(b, c), min(b, c)), `i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains unchanged, `challengers` contains an additional tuple (a, b, c), and if `first` is in `one`, then `two[first]` is updated to `one[first][0] + c`, and `ans` is appended with the tuple (one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i).***
