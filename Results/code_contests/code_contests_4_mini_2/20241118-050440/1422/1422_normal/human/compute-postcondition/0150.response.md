Postcondition: ***`label` is 1 if the minimum value among `a`, `b`, and `c` is greater than `cnt`, in which case `cnt` is updated to that minimum value and `first` is set to `i` (which is 0). If the minimum value is not greater than `cnt`, `label` remains 0, `cnt` stays unchanged, `first` remains empty, `second` is still empty, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `ans` contains at least 1 element.***
