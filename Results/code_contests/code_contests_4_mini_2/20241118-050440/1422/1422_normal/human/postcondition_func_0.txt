The function reads an integer `n` indicating the number of challengers, followed by `n` triplets of integers `(a, b, c)`. It processes these triplets to track maximum values and their indices in two dictionaries, while generating a list of results based on specific conditions. After processing, it checks for the minimum value among the triplet elements and outputs either '1' with the index of the last triplet that had the minimum greater than a certain count or '2' with two indices if no such triplet exists. The function does not handle cases where `n` is 0, which would lead to no output.
