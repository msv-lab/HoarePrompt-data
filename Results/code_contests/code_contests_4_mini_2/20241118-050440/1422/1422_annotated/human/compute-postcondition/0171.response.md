Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `n` representing the number of challengers and processes input tuples of three integers (a, b, c) for each challenger. It stores the maximum values and their indices for unique pairs of challengers in a dictionary. The function then evaluates conditions based on these pairs to determine which of the challengers has the smallest minimum value among `(a, b, c)` and outputs either '1' followed by the index of the challenger with the smallest value or '2' followed by the indices of two challengers if they meet certain criteria. If no challengers are present (i.e., `n` is 0), the function does not produce any output. The specific output logic may not reflect all scenarios correctly based on the input data and the conditions described in the code. **
