The variable `challengers` is assigned an empty list. The values of the other variables, `n`, `one`, `two`, and `ans`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `one` is an empty dictionary; `two` is an empty dictionary; `ans` is an empty list; `challengers` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `one` is an empty dictionary; `two` is an empty dictionary; `ans` is an empty list; `challengers` is an empty list**
