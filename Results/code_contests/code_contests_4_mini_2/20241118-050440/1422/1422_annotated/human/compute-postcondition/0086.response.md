According to the code, the loop execution depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 2. Since `n` is not specified to change, it remains the same. 

Thus, the necessary adjustments are:
1. Update `i` from 1 to 2.

Since no other states need to be adjusted, the final state will be as follows:

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000, `i` is 2, `first`, `second`, and `third` are tuples**.
