The variable `second` is assigned the value of a tuple containing `max(a, c)` and `min(a, c)`. The variables `first` and `second` are tuples that will contain the maximum and minimum values based on the comparisons of `a`, `b`, and `c`. The values of `first` are already defined as `(max(a, b), min(a, b))`, while the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not explicitly given in the initial state.

Therefore, no specific calculations can be made without knowing the values of `a` and `c`. However, the structure of `second` will be similar to `first` in that it will hold the maximum and minimum values based on the variables provided.

Since the output state requires the mention of the new variable `second` and its relationship to `a`, the output will include that information.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 1; `first` is a tuple (max(a, b), min(a, b)); `second` is a tuple (max(a, c), min(a, c))**
