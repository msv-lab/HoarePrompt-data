Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 2; `first` is a tuple (max(a, b), min(a, b)); `second` is a tuple (max(a, c), min(a, c)); `third` is (max(b, c), min(b, c)); `challengers` is updated by appending the tuple (a, b, c). If `second` is in `one`, then `two[second]` is updated to `one[second][0] + b`, and `ans` is appended with the tuple (one[second][0] + b, second[0], second[1], one[second][1], 2). If `second` is not in `one`, no changes are made to `two` or `ans`. Additionally, if `second` is not found, it implies that the state of `two` and `ans` remains unchanged, ensuring that no erroneous modifications occur.***
