To analyze the provided code snippet, we need to break down the components involved.

1. `one[third][0]` references an unknown tuple or list called `one` at the index specified by `third`. The value of `one[third][0]` determines the first element of the tuple being appended to `ans`.
2. `a` is a positive integer, but its specific value is not defined in the initial state.
3. `third` is a tuple defined as `(max(b, c), min(b, c))`, which consists of the maximum and minimum of the variables `b` and `c`.
4. `i` is initialized to 1 and remains unchanged in the process since it is being passed as-is into the tuple being appended.

Now, the operation being performed is appending a tuple to `ans`. The tuple consists of:
- `one[third][0] + a` (the first element)
- `third[0]` (the maximum of `b` and `c`)
- `third[1]` (the minimum of `b` and `c`)
- `one[third][1]` (the second element of `one` at index `third`)
- `i` (which is 1)

Since we do not have specific values for `a`, `b`, `c`, `one`, or `ans`, we can only describe the changes conceptually.

Thus, the output state will reflect that:
- `ans` has a new tuple appended to it consisting of the calculated elements based on the above logic.

Output State: **`ans` has a new tuple appended: (one[third][0] + a, third[0], third[1], one[third][1], 1)**
