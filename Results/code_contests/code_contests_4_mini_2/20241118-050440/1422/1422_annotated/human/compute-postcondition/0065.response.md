Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 1; `first` is a tuple (max(a, b), min(a, b)); `second` is a tuple (max(a, c), min(a, c)); `third` is (max(b, c), min(b, c)). If `first` is in `two` and `two[first]` is less than `one[first][0] + c`, then `ans` is appended with the tuple (one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i) and `two[first]` is updated to (one[first][0] + c). If `first` is in `two` but `two[first]` is not less than `one[first][0] + c`, then `two[first]` remains unchanged. If `first` is not in `two` but is in `one`, then `two[first]` is set to (one[first][0] + c) and the tuple (one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i) is appended to `ans`. If `first` is not in either `two` or `one`, no changes occur to `two` or `ans`.***
