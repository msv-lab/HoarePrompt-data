Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 0; `one` is a dictionary containing the key `first`; `two` is a dictionary that may include the key `second` with the value `one[second][0] + b` if `second` was present in `one`; if `second` is present in `one`, `ans` is updated to include the tuple ((one[second][0] + b, second[0], second[1], one[second][1], i)). If `second` is not in `one`, `two` remains unchanged and `ans` is unchanged.***
