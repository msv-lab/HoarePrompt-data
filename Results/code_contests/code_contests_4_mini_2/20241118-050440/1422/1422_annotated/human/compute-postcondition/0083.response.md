Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 1; `first`, `second`, and `third` are tuples representing the maximum and minimum of the respective pairs. If `second` is not in `one` or if `one[second][0]` is less than `b`, then `one[second]` is updated to `(b, i)`; otherwise, `one[second]` remains unchanged. The integrity of `two` and `ans` is maintained based on the previous conditions regarding `third`, ensuring that updates to `two` and additions to `ans` are only performed under the specified circumstances. All scenarios concerning the presence of `second` in `one` and the comparison with `b` are accounted for in this postcondition.***
