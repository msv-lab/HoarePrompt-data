The variable `third` is assigned a tuple consisting of the maximum and minimum values of `b` and `c`. The initial state indicates that `first` and `second` are tuples based on previous values of `a`, `b`, and `c`. However, the specific values of `b` and `c` are not provided, so we can only express `third` in terms of those variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 1; `first` is a tuple (max(a, b), min(a, b)); `second` is a tuple (max(a, c), min(a, c)); `third` is (max(b, c), min(b, c))**
