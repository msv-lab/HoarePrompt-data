Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 2; `first` is (max(a, b), min(a, b)); `second` is (max(a, c), min(a, c)); `third` is (max(b, c), min(b, c)); `challengers` is updated by appending (a, b, c); `ans` is updated by appending (one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], 2); `two[first]` is assigned the value of `one[first][0] + c.`**
