Postcondition: ***`one` and `two` remain unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned values from the tuple `challengers[i]`. If the minimum value among `a`, `b`, and `c` is greater than `cnt`, then `label` is set to 1, `cnt` is updated to the minimum value among `a`, `b`, and `c`, and `first` is assigned the value of `i`. If the minimum value among `a`, `b`, and `c` is less than or equal to `cnt`, the values of `label`, `cnt`, `first`, and `second` remain unchanged.***
