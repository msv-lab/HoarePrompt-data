Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 1; `first` is a tuple (max(a, b), min(a, b)); `second` is a tuple (max(a, c), min(a, c)); `third` is (max(b, c), min(b, c)); if `two[first]` is less than `one[first][0] + c`, then `ans` is appended with the tuple ((one[first][0] + c), first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i) and `two[first]` is updated to the value of (one[first][0] + c). Otherwise, `two[first]` remains unchanged.***
