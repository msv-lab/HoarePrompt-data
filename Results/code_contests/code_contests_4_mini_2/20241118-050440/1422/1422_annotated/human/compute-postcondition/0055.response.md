The code appends a tuple `(a, b, c)` to the list `challengers`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned from input, but their specific values are not defined in the initial state. The variable `n` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the addition to the `challengers` list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 1; `challengers` now contains an additional tuple `(a, b, c)` where `a`, `b`, and `c` are from input.**
