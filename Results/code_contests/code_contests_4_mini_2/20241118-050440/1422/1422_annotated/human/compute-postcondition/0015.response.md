Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 0; `one` is an empty dictionary; `two` is an empty dictionary; `ans` is an empty list; `first` is (max(a, b), min(a, b)); `two[first]` is updated to `one[first][0] + c` if `two[first]` is less than `one[first][0] + c`, and `ans` is appended with a tuple containing `(one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i)`. If the condition is not met, `two[first]` remains unchanged and `ans` is not updated. In all cases, the value of `two[first]` is either updated to `one[first][0] + c` or remains as it was before the execution.***
