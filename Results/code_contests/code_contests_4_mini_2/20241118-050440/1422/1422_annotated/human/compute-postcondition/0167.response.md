Postcondition: ***`one` and `two` remain unchanged; `ans` is either an empty list or a list containing tuples; `label` is not equal to 1; `cnt` is unchanged or is less than or equal to the minimum of `a`, `b`, and `c`; `first` and `second` remain unchanged; if `ans` is not empty, the minimum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is less than or equal to `cnt`. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute.***
