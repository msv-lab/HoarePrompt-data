Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 0; `one` is a dictionary containing the key `first`; `two` is a dictionary containing the key `third`; the value of `two[third]` is less than the sum of `one[third][0]` and `c`, and the relationships between the elements of `first`, `one`, and `two` are preserved throughout the process.***
