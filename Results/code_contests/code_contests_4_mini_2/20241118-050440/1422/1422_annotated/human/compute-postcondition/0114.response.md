Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 2; `first` is a tuple (max(a, b), min(a, b)); `second` is a tuple (max(a, c), min(a, c)); `third` is (max(b, c), min(b, c)); `challengers` is updated by appending the tuple (a, b, c). If `first` is not found in `one` or if `one[first][0]` is less than `c`, then `one[first]` is updated to (c, i). If `first` is found in `one` and `one[first][0]` is greater than or equal to `c`, then `one[first]` remains unchanged. All relevant edge cases regarding the presence of `first` in `one` are accounted for in the updates to `one[first]`.***
