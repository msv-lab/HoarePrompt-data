Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 1; `first`, `second`, and `third` are tuples representing the maximum and minimum of the respective pairs. If `third` is in `two` and `two[third]` is less than `one[third][0] + c`, then `ans` is appended with the tuple `(one[third][0] + a, third[0], third[1], one[third][1], i)` and `two[third]` is updated to `one[third][0] + a`. If `third` is in `two` but `two[third]` is not less than `one[third][0] + c`, `two[third]` remains unchanged. If `third` is not in `two` but is in `one`, then `two[third]` is updated to `one[third][0] + a`, and `ans` is appended with `(one[third][0] + a, third[0], third[1], one[third][1], i)`. If `third` is not present in either `two` or `one`, no changes occur to `two` or `ans`. All cases regarding the presence of `third` in `two` or `one`, as well as the comparison of `two[third]` with `one[third][0] + c`, are accounted for, ensuring the integrity of `two` and `ans` is maintained based on these conditions.***
