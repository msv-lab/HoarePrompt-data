To determine the output state, we analyze the provided snippet and initial state:

1. The line of code `two[third] = one[third][0] + a` indicates that the `third` index is being used to access values in the lists or arrays `one` and `two`.
2. The new value for `two[third]` is calculated by taking the first element of `one[third]` (denoted as `one[third][0]`) and adding `a` to it.
3. The initial state mentions that `ans` has been updated by appending a tuple involving values from `one` and `third`, but it does not directly influence the current operation.

Since we have no specific values for `one[third][0]`, `a`, or what `two` was before the operation, we can't specify the exact numeric outcome but can describe the operation.

Thus, the output state reflects the update to `two[third]` without specific values:

Output State: **`two[third]` is updated to the sum of `one[third][0]` and `a`**
