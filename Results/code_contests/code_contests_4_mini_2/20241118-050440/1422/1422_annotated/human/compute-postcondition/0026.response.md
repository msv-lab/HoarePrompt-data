Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 0; `one` is a dictionary containing the key `first`; `two` is a dictionary containing the key `second`; if `two[second]` is less than `one[second][0] + c`, the tuple `(one[second][0] + b, second[0], second[1], one[second][1], i)` is appended to `ans`, and `two[second]` is updated to `one[second][0] + b`; otherwise, the values of `ans` and `two[second]` remain unchanged. The relationship between the elements of `first`, `one`, and `two` is preserved throughout this process.***
