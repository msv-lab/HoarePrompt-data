Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 0; `one` is a dictionary containing the key `first`; `two` is a dictionary containing the key `third`. If `two[third]` is less than `one[third][0] + c`, the tuple `(one[third][0] + a, third[0], third[1], one[third][1], i)` is appended to `ans`, and `two[third]` is updated to `one[third][0] + a`. If `two[third]` is greater than or equal to `one[third][0] + c`, `two[third]` remains unchanged and no elements are added to `ans`.***
