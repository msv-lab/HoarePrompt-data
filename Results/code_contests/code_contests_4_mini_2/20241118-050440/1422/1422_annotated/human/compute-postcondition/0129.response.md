Postcondition: ***`one`, `two`, `ans` remain unchanged; if the minimum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is greater than `cnt`, then `label` is set to 2, `cnt` is updated to the minimum of `a`, `b`, and `c`, `first` is assigned the value of `ind1`, and `second` is assigned the value of `ind2`. Otherwise, `label`, `cnt`, `first`, and `second` remain unchanged, with `cnt` still being less than or equal to the minimum of `a`, `b`, and `c`.`***
