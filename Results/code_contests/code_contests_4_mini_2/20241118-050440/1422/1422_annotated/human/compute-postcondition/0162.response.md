Postcondition: ***`one` and `two` remain unchanged, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `i` is `n - 1`, and `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned values from `challengers[n - 1]`. If the minimum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is greater than `cnt`, then `label` is set to 1, `cnt` is updated to the minimum of `a`, `b`, and `c`, and `first` is assigned the value of `i`. If the minimum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is less than or equal to `cnt`, no changes are made to `label`, `cnt`, or `first`.***
