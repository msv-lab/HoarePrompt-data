The variable `one` is assigned an empty dictionary. The previous value of `n` remains unchanged and is still a positive integer within the specified range. Other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `one` is an empty dictionary.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `one` is an empty dictionary**
