Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 2; `first` is a tuple (max(a, b), min(a, b)); `second` is a tuple (max(a, c), min(a, c)); `third` is (max(b, c), min(b, c)); `challengers` is updated by appending the tuple (a, b, c); `two[third]` is updated to `one[third][0] + a; ans` is updated to append the tuple (one[third][0] + a, third[0], third[1], one[third][1], i).**
