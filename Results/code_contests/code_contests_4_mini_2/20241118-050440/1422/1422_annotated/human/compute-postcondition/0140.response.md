The variable `second` is assigned the value of `ind2`. The previous values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `one` remains unchanged, `two` remains unchanged, `label` is 2, `cnt` is assigned the minimum of `a`, `b`, and `c`, `first` is now `ind1`, `second` is now `ind2`, and `ans` contains at least one more tuple with next values for `a`, `b`, and `c`.

Output State: **`one` remains unchanged, `two` remains unchanged, `label` is 2, `cnt` is assigned the minimum of `a`, `b`, and `c`, `first` is now `ind1`, `second` is now `ind2`, and `ans` contains at least one more tuple with next values for `a`, `b`, and `c.**
