Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 0; `one` is a dictionary containing the key `first`; `two` may or may not contain the key `third`. If `third` is in `two` and `two[third]` is less than `one[third][0] + c`, the tuple `(one[third][0] + a, third[0], third[1], one[third][1], i)` is appended to `ans`, and `two[third]` is updated to `one[third][0] + a`. If `two[third]` is greater than or equal to `one[third][0] + c`, `ans` and `two[third]` remain unchanged. If `third` is not in `two` but is in `one`, then `two[third]` is set to `one[third][0] + a`, and the tuple is appended to `ans`. If `third` is not in `one`, no changes occur to `n`, `i`, `one`, `two`, or `ans`, and an exception is raised due to the missing key. This summary covers all scenarios including edge cases involving the presence of keys in the dictionaries and the comparison of values.***
