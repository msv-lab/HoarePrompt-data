Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 0; `one` is a dictionary containing the key `first`; `two` is a dictionary that includes a new entry with key `first` and value equal to `one[first][0] + c`; `ans` is a list that contains a tuple with the values (one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i). If `first` is not in `one`, then `two` remains unchanged and `ans` is unaffected. Additionally, the relationship between the elements of `first`, `one`, and `two` is preserved, as `first` is derived from the maximum and minimum of the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.***
