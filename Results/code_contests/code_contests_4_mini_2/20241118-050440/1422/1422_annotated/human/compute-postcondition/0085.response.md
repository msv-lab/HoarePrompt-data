Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 1; `first`, `second`, and `third` are tuples. If `third` is not present in `one` or if the first element of `one[third]` is less than `a`, then `one[third]` is updated to `(a, i)`. Otherwise, `one[third]` remains unchanged, ensuring that the integrity of `two` and `ans` is maintained based on the previous conditions regarding `second` and `third`. All scenarios regarding the presence of `third` in `one` and the comparison with `a` are considered.***
