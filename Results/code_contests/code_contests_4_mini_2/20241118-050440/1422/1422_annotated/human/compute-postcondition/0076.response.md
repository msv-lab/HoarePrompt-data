Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 1; `first` is a tuple (max(a, b), min(a, b)); `second` is a tuple (max(a, c), min(a, c)); `third` is (max(b, c), min(b, c)); `two[third]` is assigned the value of `one[third][0] + a`, and the state of `ans` remains unchanged.**
