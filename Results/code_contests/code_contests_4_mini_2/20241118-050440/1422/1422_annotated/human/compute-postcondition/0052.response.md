Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 0. If `third` is not a key in `one` or if the first element of `one[third]` is less than `a`, then `one[third]` is updated to the tuple `(a, i)`. Otherwise, the value of `one[third]` remains unchanged. This ensures that `one[third]` will only be set to `(a, 0)` if it was previously absent or if it had a first element less than `a`.***
