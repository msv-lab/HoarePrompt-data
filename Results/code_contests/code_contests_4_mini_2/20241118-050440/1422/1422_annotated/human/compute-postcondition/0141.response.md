Postcondition: ***`one`, `two`, `label`, `cnt`, `first`, `second`, and `ans` are unchanged except for `label` which is set to 2, `cnt` which is updated to the minimum of `a`, `b`, and `c` if it is greater than `cnt`, and `first` and `second` which are set to `ind1` and `ind2` respectively. Additionally, `ans` contains at least one more tuple with the next values for `a`, `b`, and `c`. If the minimum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is less than or equal to `cnt`, then `label`, `cnt`, `first`, `second`, and `ans` remain unchanged.***
