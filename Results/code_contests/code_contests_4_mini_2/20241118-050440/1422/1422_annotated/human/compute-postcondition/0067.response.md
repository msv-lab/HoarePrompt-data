Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 1; `first` is (max(a, b), min(a, b)); `second` is (max(a, c), min(a, c)); `third` is (max(b, c), min(b, c)); `ans` is appended with the tuple (one[second][0] + b, second[0], second[1], one[second][1], i); `two[second]` is assigned the value `one[second][0] + b`.**
