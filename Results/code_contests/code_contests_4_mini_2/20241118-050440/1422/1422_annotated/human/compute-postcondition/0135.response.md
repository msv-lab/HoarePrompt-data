Postcondition: ***`one`, `two`, and `label` remain unchanged. If the minimum value of `a`, `b`, and `c` is greater than `cnt`, then `label` is set to 2, `cnt` is updated to the minimum value of `a`, `b`, and `c`, `first` is assigned the value of `ind1`, and `second` is assigned the value of `ind2`. If the minimum value of `a`, `b`, and `c` is less than or equal to `cnt`, then `label`, `cnt`, `first`, and `second` remain unchanged. In either case, `ans` contains at least one more tuple.***
