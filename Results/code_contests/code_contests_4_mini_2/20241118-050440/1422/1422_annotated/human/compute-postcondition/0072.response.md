Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 1; `first` is a tuple (max(a, b), min(a, b)); `second` is a tuple (max(a, c), min(a, c)); `third` is (max(b, c), min(b, c)). If `second` is in `two`, and `two[second]` is less than `one[second][0] + b`, then `ans` is appended with the tuple (one[second][0] + b, second[0], second[1], one[second][1], i), and `two[second]` is updated to `one[second][0] + b`. If `two[second]` is not less than `one[second][0] + b`, then `two[second]` remains unchanged. If `second` is not in `two` but is in `one`, then `two[second]` is set to `one[second][0] + b` and the tuple (one[second][0] + b, second[0], second[1], one[second][1], i) is appended to `ans`. If `second` is not in either `two` or `one`, no changes occur to `two` or `ans`. All cases where `two[second]` is less than, equal to, or greater than `one[second][0] + b` are accounted for, ensuring the integrity of `two` and `ans` is maintained based on the presence of `second` in the respective tuples.***
