Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 0; `one` is a dictionary containing the key `first`; `two` is a dictionary that does not contain the key `third`; `ans` remains unchanged. If `third` is a key in `one`, the value of `two[third]` is updated to the sum of `one[third][0]` and `a`, and a tuple containing `(one[third][0] + a, third[0], third[1], one[third][1], i)` is appended to `ans`. If `third` is not in `one`, no changes occur to `n`, `i`, `one`, `two`, or `ans`, and an exception is raised due to the missing key.***
