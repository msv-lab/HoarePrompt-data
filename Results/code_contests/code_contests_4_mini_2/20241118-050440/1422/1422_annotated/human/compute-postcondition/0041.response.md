The code attempts to append a tuple to the `ans` list, using several values from the dictionaries `one` and `two`, as well as the variable `i`. 

However, since `one` contains the key `first` and does not contain the key `third`, accessing `one[third]` will raise a KeyError. This means `one[third]` cannot be evaluated, and consequently, the entire expression within the `append` method will fail.

Given that `two` does not contain the key `third`, attempting to assign a value to `two[third]` will also fail, but the immediate issue arises from the attempt to access `one[third]`.

Therefore, no changes occur to the state of the variables, and an exception is raised due to the absence of the key `third` in `one`.

Output State: **No changes to `n`, `i`, `one`, `two`, and an exception is raised due to the missing key `third` in `one`.**
