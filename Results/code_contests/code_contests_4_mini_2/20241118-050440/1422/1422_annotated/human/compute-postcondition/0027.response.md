Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 0; `one` is a dictionary containing the key `first`; `two` is a dictionary that does not contain the key `second`; `ans` remains unchanged. The relationships between the elements of `first`, `one`, and `two` are preserved, as `first` is derived from the maximum and minimum of the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.***
