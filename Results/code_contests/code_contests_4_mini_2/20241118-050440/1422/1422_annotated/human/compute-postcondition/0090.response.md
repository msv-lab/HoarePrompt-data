The code assigns `second` a tuple containing the maximum and minimum values between `a` and `c`. Since the values of `a` and `c` are not explicitly defined in the initial state, we can only state that `second` will be a tuple of the form `(max(a, c), min(a, c))`. Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 2; `first` is a tuple (max(a, b), min(a, b)); `second` is a tuple (max(a, c), min(a, c)); `third` is a tuple; `challengers` is updated by appending the tuple (a, b, c)**
