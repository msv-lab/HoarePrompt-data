Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 1; `first` is a tuple (max(a, b), min(a, b)); `second` is a tuple (max(a, c), min(a, c)); `third` is (max(b, c), min(b, c)). If `second` is in `one`, then `two[second]` is updated to `one[second][0] + b`, and the tuple (one[second][0] + b, second[0], second[1], one[second][1], i) is appended to `ans`. If `second` is not in `one`, then no changes occur to `two` or `ans`. This logic ensures that if `second` exists in `one`, the necessary updates are made to both `two` and `ans`, while preserving their states when `second` is absent from `one`.***
