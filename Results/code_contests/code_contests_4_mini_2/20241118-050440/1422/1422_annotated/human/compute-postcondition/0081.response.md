Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 1; `first`, `second`, and `third` are tuples representing the maximum and minimum of the respective pairs. If `first` is not in `one` or if `one[first][0]` is less than `c`, then `one[first]` is updated to `(c, i)`. If `first` is already in `one` and `one[first][0]` is greater than or equal to `c`, `one[first]` remains unchanged. The integrity of `two` and `ans` is maintained based on the previous conditions regarding `third`, ensuring that updates to `two` and additions to `ans` are only performed under the specified circumstances. All edge cases concerning the presence of `first` in `one` and the comparison with `c` are accounted for.***
