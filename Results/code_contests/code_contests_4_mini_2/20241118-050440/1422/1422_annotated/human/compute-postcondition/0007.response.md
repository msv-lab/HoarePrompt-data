The code appends a tuple `(a, b, c)` to the `challengers` list. The initial state indicates that `challengers` is empty, so after execution, it will contain one element, the tuple formed by the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`. The states of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000, `i` is 0, `one` is an empty dictionary, `two` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is an empty list, `challengers` contains one tuple `(a, b, c)`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000, `i` is 0, `one` is an empty dictionary, `two` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is an empty list, `challengers` contains one tuple `(a, b, c)`**
