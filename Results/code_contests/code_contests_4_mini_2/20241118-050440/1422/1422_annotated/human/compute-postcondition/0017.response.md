Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 0; `one` is a dictionary that contains the key `first`; `two` is an empty dictionary; `ans` is an empty list; `first` is (max(a, b), min(a, b)); `second` is (max(a, c), min(a, c)); `third` is (max(b, c), min(b, c)); `first` is not a key in the dictionary `two`.***
