The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned values from the input read through `stdin.readline()`, which accepts a line of input and splits it into three integer values. The previous values of the affected variables are unknown as they are being assigned from the input. The values of `one`, `two`, `ans`, and `challengers` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000, `i` is 0, `one` is an empty dictionary, `two` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is an empty list, `challengers` is an empty list, and `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned values from input.**
