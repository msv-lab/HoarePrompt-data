The variable `third` is assigned the value of a tuple containing `max(b, c)` and `min(b, c)`. The values of `b` and `c` are not specified in the initial state, but `third` will hold the maximum and minimum values of `b` and `c` respectively. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state will reflect the assignment of `third`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 2; `first` is a tuple (max(a, b), min(a, b)); `second` is a tuple (max(a, c), min(a, c)); `third` is (max(b, c), min(b, c)); `challengers` is updated by appending the tuple (a, b, c)**
