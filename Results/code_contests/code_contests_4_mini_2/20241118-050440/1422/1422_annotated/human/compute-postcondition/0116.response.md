Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 2; `first` is a tuple (max(a, b), min(a, b)); `second` is a tuple (max(a, c), min(a, c)); `third` is a tuple (max(b, c), min(b, c)); `challengers` is updated by appending the tuple (a, b, c). If `second` is not found in `one`, or if `one[second][0]` is less than `b`, then `one[second]` is updated to (b, i). If `second` is found in `one` and `one[second][0]` is greater than or equal to `b`, then `one[second]` remains unchanged. All relevant edge cases regarding the presence of `second` in `one` are accounted for in the updates to `one[second]`.***
