The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it operates under the constraints that `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100,000, and for each stone, the values `ai`, `bi`, and `ci` are positive integers within the range of 1 to 1,000,000,000. The output of the function is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to operate based on internal conditions related to these constraints without accepting any parameters directly.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and operates under the constraints that n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000) and for each stone, ai, bi, and ci are positive integers (1 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 1,000,000,000). The specific output of the function is not provided.**
