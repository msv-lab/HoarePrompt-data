The statement `two[third] = one[third][0] + a` assigns a new value to the index `third` of the list or dictionary `two`. The new value is calculated by adding `one[third][0]` to `a`. The variable `ans` is not directly affected by this assignment, and its previous state remains unchanged.

The previous values of the affected variables:
- `a` is used in the calculation.
- `one[third][0]` must be known to perform the addition.
- The variable `third` is used as an index for both `one` and `two`.

Since we do not have the specific values of `a`, `one[third][0]`, or `two[third]`, we cannot compute a specific numerical output, but we note that `two[third]` will be updated to the value of `one[third][0] + a`.

The output state summarizes the relevant information:
- `ans` remains appended with the tuple `(x + a, third[0], third[1], y, 1)`.
- `two[third]` is assigned the value of `one[third][0] + a`.

Output State: **`ans` is appended with the tuple `(x + a, third[0], third[1], y, 1)`; `two[third]` is assigned the value of `one[third][0] + a`**
