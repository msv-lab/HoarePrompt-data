Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 2; `first` is a tuple (max(a, b), min(a, b)); `second` is a tuple (max(a, c), min(a, c)); `third` is (max(b, c), min(b, c)); if `first` is found in `one`, then `two[first]` is updated to `one[first][0] + c`, and `ans` is appended with a tuple containing `(one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i)`. If `first` is not in `one`, no changes are made to `two` or `ans`.***
