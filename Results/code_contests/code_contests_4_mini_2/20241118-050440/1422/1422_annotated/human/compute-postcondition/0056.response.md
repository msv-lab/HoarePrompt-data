`first` is assigned the values of `max(a, b)` and `min(a, b)`. The values of `a` and `b` are taken from the additional tuple `(a, b, c)` in `challengers`. The initial state does not specify the values of `a` and `b`, but they are part of a tuple, so their values will be determined by input. Therefore, `first` will contain the maximum of `a` and `b` as the first element and the minimum as the second element. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation, and `i` also remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 1; `first` is a tuple (max(a, b), min(a, b)) from input**
