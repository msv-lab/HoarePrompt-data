Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 0; `one` is a dictionary containing the key `first`; `two` is a dictionary containing the key `second`; `ans` may contain tuples that include values derived from `one[first][0] + c`, `first[0]`, `first[1]`, `one[first][1]`, and `i`; the value of `two[second]` is less than `one[second][0] + c`.***
