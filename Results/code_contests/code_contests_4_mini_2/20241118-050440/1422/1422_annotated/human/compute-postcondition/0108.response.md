Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 2; `first` is a tuple (max(a, b), min(a, b)); `second` is a tuple (max(a, c), min(a, c)); `third` is (max(b, c), min(b, c)); `challengers` is updated by appending the tuple (a, b, c). If `two[third]` is less than `one[third][0] + c`, then `ans` is updated by appending the tuple (one[third][0] + a, third[0], third[1], one[third][1], 2) and `two[third]` is updated to `one[third][0] + a`. If `two[third]` is greater than or equal to `one[third][0] + c`, then `two[third]` remains unchanged. In either case, if `third` is not found in `two` or `one`, no changes are made to `two` or `ans`, and the original values of `two[third]` and `ans` remain intact.***
