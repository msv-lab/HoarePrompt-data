Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 0; `one` is a dictionary containing the key `first`; `two` is a dictionary that either retains its previous state or includes a new entry with key `first` and value equal to `one[first][0] + c`. If `first` is in `two` and `two[first]` is less than `one[first][0] + c`, then `ans` is appended with the tuple (one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], i) and `two[first]` is updated to `one[first][0] + c`. If `first` is in `one` but not in `two`, `two[first]` is set to `one[first][0] + c` and `ans` is updated with the tuple. If `first` is not in `one`, then `two` and `ans` remain unchanged. In all cases, the relationship between the elements of `first`, `one`, and `two` is preserved, as `first` is derived from the maximum and minimum of the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.***
