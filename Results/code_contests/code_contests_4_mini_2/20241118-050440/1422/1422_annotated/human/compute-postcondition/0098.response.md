Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 2; `first` is a tuple (max(a, b), min(a, b)); `second` is a tuple (max(a, c), min(a, c)); `third` is (max(b, c), min(b, c)); `challengers` is updated by appending the tuple (a, b, c). If `first` is in `two`, and `two[first]` is less than `one[first][0] + c`, then `ans` is appended with the tuple (one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], 2), and `two[first]` is assigned the value of `one[first][0] + c`. If `two[first]` is not less than `one[first][0] + c`, then `two[first]` remains unchanged. If `first` is not in `two` but is in `one`, then `two[first]` is updated to `one[first][0] + c`, and `ans` is appended with a tuple containing (one[first][0] + c, first[0], first[1], one[first][1], 2). If `first` is not found in either `one` or `two`, no changes are made to `two` or `ans`.***
