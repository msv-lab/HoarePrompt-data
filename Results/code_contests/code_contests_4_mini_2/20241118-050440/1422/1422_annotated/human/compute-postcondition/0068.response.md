Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 1; `first` is a tuple (max(a, b), min(a, b)); `second` is a tuple (max(a, c), min(a, c)); `third` is (max(b, c), min(b, c)). If `two[second]` is less than `one[second][0] + b`, then `ans` is appended with the tuple (one[second][0] + b, second[0], second[1], one[second][1], i) and `two[second]` is updated to the value `one[second][0] + b`. If `two[second]` is not less than `one[second][0] + b`, then `two[second]` remains unchanged. If `second` is not in `two`, no changes occur to `two` or `ans`. All cases where `two[second]` is either less than, equal to, or greater than `one[second][0] + b` are covered.***
