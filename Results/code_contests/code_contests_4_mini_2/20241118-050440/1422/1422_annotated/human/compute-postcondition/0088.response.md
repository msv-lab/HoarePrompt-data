The code appends a tuple `(a, b, c)` to the list `challengers`. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned values from input after being mapped to integers. The initial values of `n`, `i`, `first`, `second`, and `third` are not directly affected by this operation. The state of `challengers` will change by adding a new tuple.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 2; `first`, `second`, and `third` are tuples; `a`, `b`, `c` are integers from input, and `challengers` is updated by appending the tuple (a, b, c).**
