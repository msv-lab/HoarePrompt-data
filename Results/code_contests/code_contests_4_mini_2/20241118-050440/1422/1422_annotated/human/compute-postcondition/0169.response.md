Postcondition: ***`one` and `two` remain unchanged. If `ans` contains tuples and `label` is equal to 1, the output is '1' followed by the value of `first + 1`, while `cnt` remains less than or equal to the minimum of `a`, `b`, and `c`. If `label` is not equal to 1, the output is '2' followed by a newline and the values of `first + 1` and `second + 1`. If `ans` is an empty list or `n` is 0, `label`, `cnt`, `first`, and `second` remain unchanged, and the loop does not execute.***
