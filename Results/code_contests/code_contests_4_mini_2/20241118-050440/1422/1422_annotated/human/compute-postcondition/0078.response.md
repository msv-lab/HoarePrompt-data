Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000; `i` is 1; `first` is a tuple (max(a, b), min(a, b)); `second` is a tuple (max(a, c), min(a, c)); `third` is (max(b, c), min(b, c)). If `third` is in `one`, then `two[third]` is updated to `one[third][0] + a`, and a new tuple (one[third][0] + a, third[0], third[1], one[third][1], i) is appended to `ans`. If `third` is not in `one`, then `two` and `ans` remain unchanged. All cases where `third` is present in `one` or not are accounted for, ensuring the integrity of `two` and `ans` is maintained.***
