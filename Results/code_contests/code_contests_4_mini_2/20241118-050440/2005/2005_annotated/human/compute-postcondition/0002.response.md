The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it operates on the assumptions that `n` is a positive integer representing the number of glasses, `s` and `t` are integers such that 1 <= s, t <= n, and `p1, p2, ..., pn` is a list of distinct integers where each `pi` satisfies 1 <= pi <= n. 

The output of the function is determined by the relationships and constraints of these inputs. Since the specific output conditions are not provided, we can only generalize based on the information given. 

Functionality: **The function operates based on a positive integer `n` representing the number of glasses, two integers `s` and `t` within the range of `n`, and a list of distinct integers `p` that also fall within the same range, returning a result based on these inputs.**
