Functionality: ** The function reads two sequences of integers from the input, calculates the difference between the sum of the first sequence and the sum of the second sequence, and prints the negative of that difference. It does not accept any parameters and does not return a value. The function could potentially raise an error if the input format is incorrect or if the input is not provided. **
