Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem as described. 

### Issues with the Program:
1. The function `func` does not take any parameters, nor does it process the inputs correctly according to the problem statement. It attempts to read input using `raw_input()` and computes `- (sum(IN()) - sum(IN()))`, which does not reflect any logic related to the shuffling of glasses or the marble's movement from position `s` to position `t`.

2. The logic required involves simulating the movement of the marble through the specified shuffles, counting the number of operations it takes to move from `s` to `t`, or determining if it is impossible to reach `t` from `s`. The program does none of these.

### Example of Failure:
For the input:
```
4 2 1
2 3 4 1
```
The correct output should be `3`, indicating that it takes three shuffles to move the marble from position `2` to position `1`. However, the program will not produce this output and instead will run into an error or provide an incorrect result due to its flawed logic.

### Conclusion:
The program does not meet the problem requirements and fails to compute the necessary movements of the marble accurately. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
