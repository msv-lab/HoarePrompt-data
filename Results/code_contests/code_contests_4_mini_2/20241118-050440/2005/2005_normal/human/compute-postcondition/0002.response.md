The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly since it is defined without any parameters. However, it operates with the following constraints and relationships: `n` is a positive integer, `s` and `t` are integers such that 1 <= s, t <= n, and the function processes a list of `n` distinct integers representing the shuffling operation parameters. 

The output behavior is not specified in the provided information, so we cannot describe the return value of the function. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is as follows:

Functionality: **The function operates with a positive integer n, integers s and t within the range 1 to n, and a list of n distinct integers for shuffling, but the return value is not specified.**
