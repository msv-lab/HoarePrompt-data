The code consists of a print statement that calculates the difference between the sum of two inputs generated by the `IN()` function. The `IN()` function returns a map of integers, but since we have two calls to `IN()`, it generates two different sets of integers.

1. The first call to `IN()` retrieves `n` distinct integers and calculates their sum.
2. The second call to `IN()` retrieves another `n` distinct integers and calculates their sum.
3. The final operation is the subtraction of the second sum from the first sum.

Since both sums are derived from two separate calls to `IN()`, we cannot determine the exact numerical values of these sums without knowing the specific integers inputted. However, we can conclude that the result of `print` will always be `0` as the two sums will cancel each other out due to the nature of the operation indicated.

Therefore, the output state reflects that the distinct integers provided in the two `IN()` calls will yield equal sums.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `s` and `t` are integers such that 1 <= `s`, `t` <= `n`; print outputs 0**
