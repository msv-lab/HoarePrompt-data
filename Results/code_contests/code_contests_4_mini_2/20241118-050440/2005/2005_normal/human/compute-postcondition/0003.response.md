The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It reads two lists of integers from input, each expected to be provided as space-separated values. The first list is read and summed, followed by a second list which is also read and summed. The function then calculates the negative difference between the two sums and prints the result. 

However, it does not handle any potential edge cases such as:
- If there is a mismatch in the number of integers provided for the two inputs, leading to a potential error in interpretation.
- The function does not enforce any constraints on the input (e.g., whether the integers are positive or distinct).
- The function does not provide any output or return value other than printing the result.

Functionality: ** The function reads two lists of integers from input, calculates the negative difference between the sums of the two lists, and prints the result. It does not accept parameters or handle any input validation. **
