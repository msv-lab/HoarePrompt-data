Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not implement the logic described in the problem statement. The problem requires determining the minimum number of shuffling operations needed to move a marble from position `s` to position `t`, or to determine if it's impossible. However, the program simply calculates the difference between the sums of two inputs, which has no relevance to the marble's movement or the shuffling operations.

For instance, consider the input:

```
4 2 1
2 3 4 1
```

The expected output is `3`, indicating that it takes three shuffles to move the marble from position 2 to position 1. However, the provided program will not compute this; instead, it will produce an incorrect result that does not correspond to any meaningful interpretation of the problem.

Thus, the program fails to address the requirements of the problem description in all potential cases.
