To evaluate the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the program and see if it correctly calculates the depth of the snow cover given the heights of two adjacent towers.

### Problem Breakdown
1. The heights of the towers are determined by the formula for the sum of the first `n` natural numbers. The height of the `n`-th tower is `1 + 2 + ... + n = n * (n + 1) / 2`.
2. We have two adjacent towers with heights based on their position `n` and `n+1`.
3. The non-covered parts of the towers are given as `a` (for the west tower) and `b` (for the east tower).
4. The snow cover `x` is the same for both towers, and it can be calculated using the heights of the towers and the lengths `a` and `b`.

### Program Analysis
The program reads the values of `a` and `b`, and calculates:
```python
(b - a) * (b - a - 1) / 2 - a
```
This formula seems to be trying to derive the depth of the snow cover, but let's see if it works correctly.

### Identifying Issues
1. **The Calculation Logic**: 
   - The heights of the two adjacent towers should be derived first: 
     - If `a` corresponds to the height of tower `n`, then `height_n = n * (n + 1) / 2`.
     - If `b` corresponds to the height of tower `n+1`, then `height_n1 = (n + 1) * (n + 2) / 2`.
   - The snow depth `x` would be calculated as:
     - `x = height_n - a`
     - `x = height_n1 - b`
   - Both expressions must yield the same result for a valid calculation.

2. **Example Case**:
   - Let's consider the example where `a = 8` and `b = 13`.
   - The heights of adjacent towers corresponding to `n` and `n+1` need to be correctly derived to find `x`.
   - We can calculate:
     - For `n = 4`, `height_n = 10`, and `height_n1 = 15`.
     - Thus, `x = height_n - a = 10 - 8 = 2` and `x = height_n1 - b = 15 - 13 = 2`.
   - This works well, but the program's logic does not directly compute the heights and thus lacks clarity.

3. **Potential Edge Cases**:
   - If `a` and `b` are such that the calculated heights lead to mismatched snow depth calculations (for instance, when `a` and `b` are misaligned with the expected heights), the program could yield incorrect results.

### Conclusion
The program does not accurately compute the snow cover depth based on the problem requirements because it skips the necessary calculation of the tower heights, which are crucial for deriving `x`. 

Thus, for the reasons outlined, particularly around the incorrect logic for calculating the snow depth, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**.
