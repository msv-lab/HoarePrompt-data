The function accepts two integers `a` and `b`, representing the heights of two adjacent towers, and calculates a mathematical expression based on these heights. It computes the expression `(b - a) * (b - a - 1) / 2 - a` but does not return any value or handle input errors. The function assumes that the input satisfies the conditions `1 <= a < b < 499500`. If these conditions are not met, the function may produce unexpected results or errors.
