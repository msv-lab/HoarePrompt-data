The variables `a` and `b` are assigned values from the input provided by the user through `raw_input()`. The `map(int, ...)` function converts the input values into integers. The previous values of `a` and `b` are unknown but must satisfy the condition `1 <= a < b < 499500`. After executing this line of code, `a` and `b` will hold the values of the two heights of the towers, which are now integers.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer such that 1 <= `a` < `b` < 499500; `b` is an input integer such that 1 <= `a` < `b` < 499500**
