The function `func` does not have parameters explicitly defined in the provided code snippet. However, based on the parameter constraints described, we can infer that the function operates with two integers, `a` and `b`, which represent the heights of two adjacent towers in meters. The constraints specify that `1 <= a < b < 499500`.

Since the output is not provided, we cannot ascertain the exact return value based on the functionality of the function. However, we understand that it will likely involve some operations or comparisons based on the heights of the towers.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept two integers `a` and `b`, where `a` is the height of the first tower, and `b` is the height of the second tower, ensuring the constraints are respected. The function will use these parameters to determine a result based on the relationship between the two tower heights.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both integers representing the heights of two adjacent towers, ensuring `1 <= a < b < 499500`.**
