The expression calculates the value of `(b - a) * (b - a - 1) / 2 - a`. Given that `a` and `b` are input integers with the constraints provided, we can define the following:

- `difference = b - a`
- The first part of the expression is `difference * (difference - 1) / 2`, which calculates the number of ways to choose 2 items from `difference` items.
- Finally, we subtract `a` from this result.

Since `a` and `b` are input integers satisfying the constraints, we denote the output based on the calculation without specific values for `a` and `b`.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer such that 1 <= `a` < `b` < 499500; `b` is an input integer such that 1 <= `a` < `b` < 499500; the result of the expression is calculated as (b - a) * (b - a - 1) / 2 - a.**
