To analyze the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's break down the logic step-by-step.

### Problem Understanding
We need to calculate the snow cover depth `x` based on the heights of two adjacent towers (west tower with height `a` and east tower with height `b`). The heights of the towers are given as:
- West tower height: `height_west = 1 + 2 + ... + n = n*(n+1)/2`
- East tower height: `height_east = 1 + 2 + ... + (n+1) = (n+1)*(n+2)/2`

Given the heights above, the snow cover depth can be derived from the relationship:
- `height_west - x = a`
- `height_east - x = b`

From these equations, we can express `x` as:
- `x = height_west - a`
- `x = height_east - b`

This leads to the equation `x = (b - a) * (b - a - 1) / 2 - a`, which is what the program attempts to compute.

### Code Analysis
Here's the provided code:
```python
def func():
    a, b = map(int, raw_input().split())
    print(b - a) * (b - a - 1) / 2 - a
```

#### Issues in the Code
1. **Parentheses in Print**: The expression in the `print` statement lacks parentheses around the entire calculation, leading to incorrect order of operations. The correct calculation should be:
   ```python
   print((b - a) * (b - a - 1) / 2 - a)
   ```
   Without parentheses, the `print` function will only display the result of `b - a` and not the entire expression, which will lead to incorrect output.

2. **Integer Division**: The division in Python 2 (`/`) can lead to integer division which may not yield a floating-point result. Given that `x` is expected to be an integer, this may not directly cause a problem but could lead to unexpected results in other contexts if not handled properly.

### Example Case Testing
Let's consider the input `8 13`:
- The expected snow depth is `2`, calculated as `13 - 8 = 5`, and the total height difference (derived from the equation) should yield `2`.

Using the flawed code, this will not produce the correct output due to the missing parentheses.

### Conclusion
Since the program has a logic error due to the lack of proper parentheses in the print statement, it will not produce the correct output for valid inputs. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
