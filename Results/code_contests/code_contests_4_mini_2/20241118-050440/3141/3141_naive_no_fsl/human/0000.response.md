To verify the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the logic implemented in the code.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. There are 999 towers with heights following the sum of the first n natural numbers.
2. Given two heights `a` and `b` for two adjacent towers (where `a < b`), we need to find the depth of snow cover `x`.
3. The depth of snow cover is defined such that the actual height of the towers minus the depth of snow should equal the measured heights.

### Understanding the Formula:
The program's formula is:
```python
print(b - a) * (b - a - 1) / 2 - a
```
We need to verify if this correctly calculates the snow depth `x`.

### Deriving the Correct Formula:
From the problem description:
- Let the height of the west tower be `H1` and height of the east tower be `H2`.
- The snow cover `x` can be represented as:
  - For west tower: \( H1 - x = a \) => \( H1 = a + x \)
  - For east tower: \( H2 - x = b \) => \( H2 = b + x \)

Since `H1` and `H2` are for adjacent towers, we know:
- The difference in heights is given by the heights of the towers:
  - \( H2 - H1 = (1 + 2 + ... + n) - (1 + 2 + ... + (n-1)) = n \)
  
Thus, we can express:
- \( (b + x) - (a + x) = n \)
- Which simplifies to \( b - a = n \)

### Analyzing the Program:
The program calculates:
- It computes \( (b - a) \) which represents the difference in heights of the two towers.
- The expression `(b - a) * (b - a - 1) / 2` does not correlate to any known formula related to the heights of the towers or snow depth.

### Identifying Incorrect Logic:
To find a specific example where the program fails:
- Let's use the example from the problem statement:
  - For `a = 8` and `b = 13`:
    - Expected snow cover is `2`. 
    - However, the program computes:
      ```python
      (b - a) * (b - a - 1) / 2 - a
      = (13 - 8) * (13 - 8 - 1) / 2 - 8
      = 5 * 4 / 2 - 8
      = 10 - 8
      = 2 (correct in this case)
      ```
- Let's take another case where `a = 1` and `b = 3`:
  - Here, the correct calculation should yield:
    - \( H1 = 1 + x \)
    - \( H2 = 3 + x \)
    - \( H2 - H1 = 3 + x - (1 + x) = 2 \), thus \( x = 1 \)
- The program computes:
  ```python
  (3 - 1) * (3 - 1 - 1) / 2 - 1
  = 2 * 1 / 2 - 1
  = 1 - 1 = 0 (which is incorrect since x should be at least 1)
  ```

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle all edge cases correctly, particularly when the difference between `a` and `b` does not yield a valid snow depth that adheres to the constraints (minimum of 1 meter).

Correctness: **False**
