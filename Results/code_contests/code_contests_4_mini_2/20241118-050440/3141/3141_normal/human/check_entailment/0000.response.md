To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze both the code and the output hints.

**Problem Description Summary:**
- We have two towers with heights determined by the triangular numbers: the west tower has height `1 + 2 + ... + n` and the east tower has height `1 + 2 + ... + (n+1)`.
- Given the lengths of the visible parts of the two towers `a` (west) and `b` (east), we need to calculate the depth of the snow cover `x`, where `x = height of the tower - visible height`.

**Program:**
```python
(a, b) = map(int, raw_input().split())
print(b - a) * (b - a - 1) / 2 - a
```

**Analysis of the Code:**
1. The code reads two integers `a` and `b` from input.
2. It calculates the expression `(b - a) * (b - a - 1) / 2 - a`.

**Understanding the Expression:**
- The expression `(b - a) * (b - a - 1) / 2` computes the triangular number for the difference of heights between the two towers minus the visible height `a`. 
- The subtraction of `a` is intended to yield the snow depth, but let's analyze if this is correctly reflecting the problem description.

**Potential Edge Cases:**
1. The program assumes that `a < b` holds true as per the constraints. However, it does not handle cases where the input might somehow not satisfy this condition (e.g., if the input were to be inverted, leading to `b` being less than `a`).
2. The division by 2 is done using `/`, which in Python 2.x will produce a float result. Since the problem specifies that the snow cover depth must be an integer, this could lead to problems if the result is not handled correctly.

**Output Hints:**
- The hints indicate that the program computes `(b - a) * (b - a - 1) / 2 - a`. However, it doesn't specify that this calculation will always yield a valid integer for the snow depth. 

**Conclusion:**
Based on the analysis:
- The code does not explicitly check for the constraints of the inputs.
- The calculation performed may not accurately represent the intended mathematical computation for determining the snow depth, especially given the potential for floating-point results and the lack of validation for the input.

Therefore, I conclude:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to correctly handle potential edge cases and doesn't ensure that the output is an integer, which could lead to incorrect results.
