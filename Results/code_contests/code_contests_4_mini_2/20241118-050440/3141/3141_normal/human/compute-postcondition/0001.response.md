To determine the output state, we first understand the expression provided in the code snippet. 

1. The code calculates `b - a`, which is the difference between `b` and `a`. 
2. It then multiplies this difference by `(b - a - 1)`, which is one less than the difference.
3. The result of that multiplication is divided by `2`.
4. Finally, `a` is subtracted from the result of the division.

Let's denote the difference as `d = b - a`. The expression can be rewritten as:

\[
\text{result} = \frac{d \times (d - 1)}{2} - a
\]

Given the initial state specifies that `a` and `b` are integers such that \( 1 \leq a < b < 499500 \), we can't determine specific values for `a` and `b`, but we can describe the output state based on the operations performed.

Thus, the output state after performing the operations and given the constraints on `a` and `b` is:

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers such that 1 â‰¤ `a` < `b` < 499500; result is (b - a) * (b - a - 1) / 2 - a**
