The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates on two integers, `a` and `b`, which must satisfy the constraints 1 ≤ a < b < 499500. The function's output is not explicitly defined in the provided details. Therefore, without specific output information, we cannot determine the exact return value. However, we can summarize the constraints on the integers involved.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It operates on integers a and b, which must satisfy the constraints 1 ≤ a < b < 499500.**
