Functionality: ** The function reads two integers `a` and `b` from input, calculates the expression `(b - a) * (b - a - 1) / 2 - a`, and prints the result. It does not accept any parameters and requires the input integers to satisfy the constraints `1 â‰¤ a < b < 499500`. However, the function does not handle cases where the input does not meet these constraints, which could lead to unexpected results or errors. **
