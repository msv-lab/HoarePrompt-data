The function accepts two input strings `layout1` and `layout2` (each expected to be 26 distinct lowercase letters), and a string `s` (which can contain lowercase and uppercase letters as well as digits). It transforms the characters in `s` based on the mappings defined by `layout1` and `layout2`, converting lowercase letters according to their corresponding values in `layout2`, uppercase letters to their uppercase equivalents in `layout2`, and retaining digits unchanged. If `layout1` does not contain 26 distinct lowercase letters, or if the characters in `s` include any letters not present in `layout1`, the function may raise a KeyError. The function is expected to print the transformed string `Mods`, which may be empty if `s` contains only digits or is empty.
