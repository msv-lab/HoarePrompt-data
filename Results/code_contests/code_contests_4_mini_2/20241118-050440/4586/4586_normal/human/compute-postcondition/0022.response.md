Postcondition: ***`dic` is an empty dictionary, `s` has a length of 26, and `layout1` contains 26 distinct lowercase letters. If `s[0]` is a digit, then `Mods` contains that digit. If `s[0]` is an uppercase letter, a KeyError occurs when attempting to access `dic` with its lowercase equivalent. If `s[0]` is a lowercase letter, a KeyError occurs when trying to access `dic` with `s[0]`, as `dic` is empty. Thus, in both non-digit cases, the program encounters a KeyError due to the empty dictionary.***
