Postcondition: ***`dic` is an empty dictionary, `s` has a length of 26, `layout1` contains 26 distinct lowercase letters, and `i` is 25. If `s[25]` is uppercase, an attempt to access `dic` with the key `s[25].lower()` leads to a KeyError due to `dic` being empty. If `s[25]` is lowercase, an attempt to access `dic` with the key `s[25]` also results in a KeyError since `dic` is empty. In both cases, a KeyError occurs because `dic` does not contain any keys.***
