Postcondition: ***`dic` is an empty dictionary, `s` has a length of 26, `layout1` contains 26 distinct lowercase letters, and `i` is equal to 26. If `s[i]` is uppercase, a KeyError occurs due to attempting to access a key in an empty dictionary. If `s[i]` is lowercase, accessing `dic[s[i]]` raises a KeyError, as `dic` remains empty, indicating that both branches of the if-else statement will result in an error.***
