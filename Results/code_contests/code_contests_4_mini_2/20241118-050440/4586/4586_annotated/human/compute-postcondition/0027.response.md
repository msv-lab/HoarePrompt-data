Postcondition: ***`dic` is a valid dictionary mapping characters in `layout1` to their indices, `layout1` is a string of length 26 consisting of distinct lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, and `i` is 1. If `s[i]` is an uppercase character, `Mods` is modified to include the uppercase character from `layout2` at the index provided by `dic[s[i].lower()]`. If `s[i]` is a lowercase character, `Mods` is updated to include the character from `layout2` at the index given by `dic[s[i]]`. In both cases, `Mods` is updated based on the mapping defined in `dic` and the contents of `layout2`.***
