Postcondition: ***`dic` is a valid dictionary mapping characters in `layout1` to their indices, `layout1` is a string of length 26 consisting of distinct lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, and `i` is 1. If `s[i]` is a digit, `Mods` is updated to include the character `s[i]`. If `s[i]` is an uppercase character, `Mods` is modified to include the corresponding uppercase character from `layout2` at the index given by `dic[s[i].lower()]`. If `s[i]` is a lowercase character, `Mods` is updated to include the character from `layout2` at the index specified by `dic[s[i]]`. In all cases, `Mods` is updated according to the mappings defined in `dic`, ensuring that the input conditions are strictly followed.***
