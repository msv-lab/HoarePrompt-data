Postcondition: ***`dic` is a valid dictionary mapping characters in `layout1` to their indices, `layout1` is a string of length 26 consisting of distinct lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string of length greater than 2, and `i` is 2. If the character at index 2 of `s` is a digit, `Mods` is updated to include that digit. If the character is uppercase, `Mods` is updated by concatenating the uppercase character from `layout2` at the index specified by `dic[s[2].lower()]`. If the character is lowercase, `Mods` is updated by concatenating the character from `layout2` at the index specified by `dic[s[2]]`. In all cases, `Mods` is modified based on the character at index 2 of `s`, ensuring that both digit and letter cases are handled properly.***
