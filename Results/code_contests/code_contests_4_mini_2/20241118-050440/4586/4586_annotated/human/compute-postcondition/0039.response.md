Functionality: ** The function accepts two strings, `layout1` and `layout2`, each expected to be 26 characters long and composed of distinct lowercase letters, and a string `s` which can be up to 1000 characters long. It transforms `s` based on the character mappings defined by `layout1` to the corresponding indices in `layout2`. Uppercase letters in `s` are converted to their corresponding lowercase mappings in `layout2` and then converted back to uppercase. If `layout1` is not valid (not 26 characters or contains duplicates), or if `s` contains characters not in `layout1`, the function may lead to runtime errors or undefined behavior. If `s` is empty, no transformation occurs, and an empty string is printed. The function does not return an error message but prints the transformed string or potentially raises an error for invalid inputs.**
