The code `Mods += s[i]` appends the character at index `i` of the string `s` to the string `Mods`. Given that `s` is a non-empty string and the character at index `i` of `s` is a digit, the value of `Mods` will be updated to include this digit. The initial values of `dic`, `layout1`, and `i` do not affect this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects that `Mods` has been updated with the digit from `s[i]`.

Output State: **`dic` is a valid dictionary, `layout1` is a string of length 26 consisting of distinct lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, `i` is 0, and `Mods` is updated with the digit at `s[0]`.**
