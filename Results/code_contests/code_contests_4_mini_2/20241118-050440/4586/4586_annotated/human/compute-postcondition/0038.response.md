The function `func` accepts two parameters: `layout1` and `layout2`, both of which are strings of length 26 consisting of distinct lowercase English letters. It also accepts a parameter `s`, which is a non-empty string containing lowercase and uppercase English letters and digits, with a length not exceeding 1000. 

The function processes these parameters and has the following cases for its return value:

- Case_1: If `s` contains any character that is not present in either `layout1` or `layout2`, the function returns an error message indicating that the input string contains invalid characters.
- Case_2: If `s` is valid according to the layouts, the function returns a transformed version of `s` based on the mappings defined by `layout1` and `layout2`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept two layout strings `layout1` and `layout2`, and a string `s`, process `s` according to the layouts, and return an error message for invalid characters or a transformed string based on the mappings of the layouts. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two strings layout1 and layout2 (both 26 characters long with distinct lowercase letters) and a string s (non-empty, up to 1000 characters long). It returns an error message for invalid characters in s or a transformed version of s based on layout mappings.**
