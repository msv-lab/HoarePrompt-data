Postcondition: ***`dic` is a valid dictionary mapping characters in `layout1` to their indices, `layout1` is a string of length 26 consisting of distinct lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, and `i` is 0. If the character at `s[0]` is a digit, `Mods` is updated to include that digit. If `s[0]` is an uppercase letter, `Mods` is updated to include the uppercase value of the character from `layout2` corresponding to the lowercase version of `s[0]`. If `s[0]` is a lowercase letter, `Mods` is updated to include the value from `layout2` corresponding to `s[0]`. In all cases, `Mods` is modified based on the mappings provided by `dic` and `layout2` for the character in `s[0]`.***
