Postcondition: ***`dic` is a valid dictionary mapping characters in `layout1` to their indices, `layout1` is a string of length 26 with distinct lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string of length greater than 2, and `i` is 2. If `s[2]` is uppercase, `Mods` is updated by concatenating the uppercase character from `layout2` at the index specified by `dic[s[2].lower()]`. If `s[2]` is lowercase, `Mods` is incremented by the character from `layout2` at the index specified by `dic[s[2]]`. In both cases, `Mods` is updated based on the character at index 2 of `s`, ensuring it handles both uppercase and lowercase scenarios appropriately.***
