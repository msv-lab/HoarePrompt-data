Postcondition: ***`dic` is a valid dictionary mapping characters in `layout1` to their indices, `layout1` is a string of length 26 consisting of distinct lowercase letters, and `s` is a non-empty string where the character at index `i` is not a digit. If the character at `s[i]` is uppercase, `Mods` is updated to include the uppercase value of `layout2[dic[s[i].lower()]]`. If `s[i]` is lowercase, `Mods` is updated to include `layout2[dic[s[i]]]`. In both cases, `Mods` is modified based on the mapping from `dic` and `layout2` corresponding to the character in `s[i]`.***
