The code appends the value of `c` to the list `a`. The variable `c` is defined as the second-to-last element of the list `P`, and since `P` contains 2N distinct integers, `c` will have a specific value depending on the contents of `P`. The list `a` will now include this new element, while other variables remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the output state is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000; `P` is a list of 2N distinct integers; `c` is the second-to-last element of `P`; `b` remains a list containing at least the element 100000; and `a` now includes the element `c`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000; `P` is a list of 2N distinct integers; `c` is the second-to-last element of `P`; `b` remains a list containing at least the element 100000; and `a` includes the element `c`.**
