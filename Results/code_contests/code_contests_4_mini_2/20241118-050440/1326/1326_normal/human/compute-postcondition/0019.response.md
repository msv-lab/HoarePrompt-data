The statement `continue` is used to skip the rest of the current loop iteration and move to the next iteration. Since the values of the variables do not change, the output state remains the same. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000, `P` is a list of 2N distinct integers, `a` is a list containing the elements 100000 and possibly `c`, `b` is [100000, `c`], and `c` is greater than 100000, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
