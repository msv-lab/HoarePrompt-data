Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000; `P` is a list of 2N distinct integers; `c` is the second-to-last element of `P`; `b` is a list containing at least the element 100000, and after execution, `b` is updated to include `c`. The state of `a`, `c`, and `fail` remains unchanged.**
