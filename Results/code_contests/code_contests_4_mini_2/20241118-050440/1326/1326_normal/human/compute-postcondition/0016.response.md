Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000, `P` is a list of 2N distinct integers, `a` is a list containing the elements 100000 and possibly `c`, `b` is [100000], and `c` is the last element of `P`. If `c` is greater than the last element of `a`, and if the length of `a` is 1, then `c` is appended to `a`, resulting in `a` containing two elements: 100000 and `c`. If `a` already has 2 elements, it remains unchanged. In either case, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `c` is not greater than the last element of `a`, then no changes are made to `a` and the loop continues.***
