Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000; `P` is a list of 2N distinct integers; `c` is the second-to-last element of `P`; `b` remains a list containing at least the element 100000; `fail` is set to True if `c` is greater than both the last element of `a` and the last element of `b`; if `a` has exactly one element, `c` is appended to `a`; otherwise, `a` remains unchanged; after execution, if `a` has exactly one element, `a` is updated to include `c`, otherwise `a` remains unchanged.**
