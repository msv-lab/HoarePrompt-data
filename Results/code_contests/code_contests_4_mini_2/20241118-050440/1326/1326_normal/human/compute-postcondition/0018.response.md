The value of `c` is appended to the list `b`, which previously contained the single element 100000. After executing the code, the list `b` will now contain two elements: 100000 and `c`. The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000, `P` is a list of 2N distinct integers, `a` is a list containing the elements 100000 and possibly `c`, `b` is [100000, `c`], and `c` is greater than 100000.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000, `P` is a list of 2N distinct integers, `a` is a list containing the elements 100000 and possibly `c`, `b` is [100000, `c`], and `c` is greater than 100000.**
