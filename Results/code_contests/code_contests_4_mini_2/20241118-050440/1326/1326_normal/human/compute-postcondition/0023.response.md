Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000, `P` is a list of 2N distinct integers, `a` is a list that may contain 100000 and potentially other elements including `c`, and `b` is a list containing at least the element 100000. The length of `b` is greater than or equal to the length of `a`, and the last element of `b` is greater than or equal to the last element of `a`. The list `b` remains unchanged if `c` is not greater than the last element of `b`, which is 100000. The program continues to the next iteration of the loop.***
