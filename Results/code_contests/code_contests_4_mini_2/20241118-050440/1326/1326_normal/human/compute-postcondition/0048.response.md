Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000; `P` is a list of 2N distinct integers; `c` is the last element of `P`; `b` is a list containing at least the element 100000. If `c` is greater than both the last element of `a` and the last element of `b`, then the variable `fail` is set to True, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop. If the conditions for the if statement are not met, there are no changes made to `fail` or any other variables.***
