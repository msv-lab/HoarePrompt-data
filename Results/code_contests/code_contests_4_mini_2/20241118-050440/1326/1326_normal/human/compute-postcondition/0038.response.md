Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000; `P` is a list of 2N distinct integers; `c` is the second-to-last element of `P`; `b` is a list containing at least the element 100000; if `c` is greater than the last element of `b`, `c` is appended to `b`. The variables `a`, `c`, and `fail` remain unchanged, and `fail` is set to True if `c` is greater than both the last element of `a` and the last element of `b`. If `c` is not greater than `b[-1]`, then `b` remains unchanged, and `fail` may also remain unchanged based on the other conditions.***
