Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000; `P` is a list of 2N distinct integers; if the length of `b` is less than the length of `a` and the last element of `b` is less than the last element of `a`, then `c` is appended to `b`, resulting in `b` now containing `c` as the last element. Otherwise, `c` is appended to `a`, resulting in `a` containing one additional element `c`. In either case, `b` remains a list containing at least the element 100000.***
