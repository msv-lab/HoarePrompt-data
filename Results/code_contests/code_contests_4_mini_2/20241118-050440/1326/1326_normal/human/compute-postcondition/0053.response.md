The `continue` statement does not modify any variables or values. Instead, it simply skips the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop. Since no loop context or changes to the state of the variables are provided, the output state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000; `P` is a list of 2N distinct integers; `c` is the last element of `P`; `b` is a list containing at least the element 100000; `c` is appended to `b`, and we skip the current iteration of the loop.**
