The code `a.append(c)` adds the value of `c` to the list `a`. Given that `a` may contain up to 100000 elements and `c` is being appended, the length of `a` will increase by 1. The other variables, including `N`, `P`, and `b`, remain unchanged as this operation does not affect them. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000; `P` is a list of 2N distinct integers; `a` now contains one additional element `c`; `b` is a list containing at least the element 100000**.
