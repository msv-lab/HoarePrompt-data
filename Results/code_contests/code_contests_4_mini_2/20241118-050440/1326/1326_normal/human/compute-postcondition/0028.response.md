The code `continue` does not change the values of any variables, but it causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop it is in and proceed to the next iteration. The values of `N`, `P`, `c`, `b`, and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000; `P` is a list of 2N distinct integers; `c` is the second-to-last element of `P`; `b` remains a list containing at least the element 100000; and `a` includes the element `c`.
