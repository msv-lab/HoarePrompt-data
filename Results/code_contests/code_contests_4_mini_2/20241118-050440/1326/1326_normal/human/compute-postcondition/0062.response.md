Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000; `P` is a list of 2N distinct integers; `a` contains at least the initial element 100000; `b` is a list containing at least the element 100000; if the length of `a` is not equal to N + 1, then `fail` is set to True; otherwise, `fail` remains False. Additionally, if `P` is empty, `a` remains [100000] and `b` remains [100000], and `fail` is still False. The overall state of `fail` indicates whether the expected number of elements in `a` was maintained, and the values of `a` and `b` are unchanged unless the loop executes and alters them based on the conditions involving `c`.***
