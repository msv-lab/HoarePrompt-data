Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000, `P` is a list of 2N distinct integers, `a` is a list containing the element 100000, `b` is [100000], `fail` is False, and `c` is the last element of `P`. If the length of `a` is 1, then `c` is appended to `a`, resulting in `a` containing two elements: 100000 and `c`. If the length of `a` is already 2, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop without modifying `a`.***
