Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000; `P` is a list of 2N distinct integers; `c` is the last element of `P`; `b` is a list containing at least the element 100000. If `c` is greater than the last element of `b`, then `c` is appended to `b`. If `c` is less than or equal to the last element of `b`, `b` remains unchanged, and the variable `fail` retains its previous value.***
