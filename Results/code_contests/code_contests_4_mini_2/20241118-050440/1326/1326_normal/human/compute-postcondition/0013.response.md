Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000, `P` is a list of 2N distinct integers, `a` is a list containing the elements 100000 and possibly `c`, `b` is [100000], `c` is the last element of `P`, and `c` is greater than the last element of `a`. If the length of `a` is 1, then `a` contains two elements: 100000 and `c`. If `a` already has 2 elements, it remains unchanged.***
