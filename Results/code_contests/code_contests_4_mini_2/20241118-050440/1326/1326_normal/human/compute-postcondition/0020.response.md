Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000, `P` is a list of 2N distinct integers, `a` is a list that may contain 100000 and potentially other elements including `c`, and `b` is a list containing at least the element 100000. If `c` is greater than the last element of `b`, which is 100000, then `c` is appended to `b`, resulting in `b` being [100000, `c`] or potentially longer if the loop iterates again. If `c` is not greater than the last element of `b`, which is 100000, then `b` remains unchanged. In any case, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.***
