Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000; `P` is a list of 2N distinct integers; `a` contains at least the initial element 100000; `b` is a list containing at least the element 100000. If `fail` is True, then the function prints 'NO', indicating that the expected number of elements in `a` was not maintained. If `fail` is False, meaning the length of `a` is equal to N + 1, the function prints 'YES', confirming the integrity of the elements in `a` and `b` remains intact. In both cases, the values of `a` and `b` are unchanged unless altered by previous logic.***
