The variable `c` holds the last element of the list `P`. The list `a` initially contains a single element, which is `100000`. The operation `a.append(c)` adds the value of `c` to the end of the list `a`. Therefore, after execution, the list `a` will contain two elements: the original element `100000` and the new element `c`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000, `P` is a list of 2N distinct integers, `a` is a list containing elements 100000 and `c`, `b` is [100000], `fail` is False, `c` is the last element of `P`, and the length of `a` is 2.**
