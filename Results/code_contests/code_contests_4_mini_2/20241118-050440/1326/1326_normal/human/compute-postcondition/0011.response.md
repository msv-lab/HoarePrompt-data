The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000, `P` is a list of 2N distinct integers, `a` is a list containing the elements 100000 and `c`, `b` is [100000], `fail` is True, `c` is the last element of `P`, and `c` is greater than both the last element of `a` and the last element of `b`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
