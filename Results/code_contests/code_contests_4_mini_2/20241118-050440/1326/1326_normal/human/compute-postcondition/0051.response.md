Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000; `P` is a list of 2N distinct integers; `c` is the last element of `P`; `b` is a list containing at least the element 100000. If `c` is greater than the last element of `a`, then `c` is appended to the end of `a`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `c` is not greater than the last element of `a`, the variable `fail` remains unchanged and there are no modifications to `a`.***
