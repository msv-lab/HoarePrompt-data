Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000; `P` is a list of 2N distinct integers; `a` contains at least the initial element 100000; `b` is a list containing at least the element 100000; `fail` is False if no element `c` exceeds both the last elements of `a` and `b`; the length of `a` is not equal to N + 1.***
