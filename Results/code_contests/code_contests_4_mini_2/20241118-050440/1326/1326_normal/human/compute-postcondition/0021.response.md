Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000, `P` is a list of 2N distinct integers, `a` is a list that may contain 100000 and potentially other elements including `c`, `b` is a list containing at least the element 100000, and the length of `b` is less than the length of `a`, with the last element of `b` being less than the last element of `a`.***
