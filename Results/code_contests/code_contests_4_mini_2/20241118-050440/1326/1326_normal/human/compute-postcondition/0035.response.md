Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000; `P` is a list of 2N distinct integers; `c` is the second-to-last element of `P`; `b` remains a list containing at least the element 100000; `fail` is set to True if `c` is greater than both the last element of `a` and the last element of `b`; if `c` is greater than the last element of `a`, and if `a` has exactly one element, `c` is appended to `a`. If `a` has more than one element, `a` remains unchanged. The state of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `fail` reflects these conditions after execution. In particular, if `c` is not greater than `a[-1]`, `a` remains unchanged, and if `c` is greater than both `a[-1]` and `b[-1]`, then `fail` is set to True, indicating an error condition.***
