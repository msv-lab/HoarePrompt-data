The code assigns the list `b` with a single element `10 ** 5`, which evaluates to `100000`. The previous state of the variable `b` is not specified, but it is clear that `b` is now initialized as a new list. The values of `N`, `P`, and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new assignment to `b`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000; `P` is assigned the value returned by `func_3()`, which is a list of 2N distinct integers; `a` is a list containing a single element 100000; `b` is [100000]**
