The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000; `P` is a list of 2N distinct integers; `c` is the last element of `P`; `b` is a list containing at least the element 100000; the value of `fail` is set to True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
