The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but skips the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop. Therefore, the output state reflects that no changes were made to the values of the variables as a result of this statement.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000, `P` is a list of 2N distinct integers, `a` is a list containing the elements 100000 and possibly `c`, `b` is [100000], `c` is the last element of `P`, and `c` is greater than the last element of `a`; if the length of `a` is 1, then `a` contains 100000 and `c`; if `a` already has 2 elements, it remains unchanged, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
