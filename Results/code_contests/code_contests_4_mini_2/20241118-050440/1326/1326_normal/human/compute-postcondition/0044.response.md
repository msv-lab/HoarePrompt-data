The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables, but it causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables without indicating any specific loop context. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000; `P` is a list of 2N distinct integers; `c` is the last element of `P`; `b` is a list containing at least the element 100000; `a` now contains `c` appended to it, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
