Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000; `P` is a list of 2N distinct integers; `c` is the last element of `P`; `b` is a list containing at least the element 100000. If the length of `b` is less than the length of `a` and the last element of `b` is less than the last element of `a`, then `c` is appended to `b`. Otherwise, `a` is updated to include `c` at the end, while `b` remains unchanged and the variable `fail` retains its previous value. Additionally, if `b` is empty or does not contain elements greater than `c`, those scenarios are also considered, ensuring the integrity of the lists remains intact.***
