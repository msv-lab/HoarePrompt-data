Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `N` (where 1 <= N <= 2000) and processes a list `P` containing 2N distinct integers. It attempts to build two lists `a` and `b`, initially containing [100000]. During processing, if any integer in `P` exceeds the last elements of both lists, a failure condition is triggered. After processing, if the length of list `a` is not equal to N + 1, it indicates a failure, and the function prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function does not return any values and primarily outputs the result to the console. Potential edge cases include scenarios where `P` is empty or contains fewer than 2N elements, which may lead to the lists `a` and `b` remaining unchanged and the function still executing without meaningful alteration.**
