Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000; `P` is a list of 2N distinct integers; `c` is the second-to-last element of `P`; `b` remains a list containing at least the element 100000; if `a` has exactly one element, then `c` is appended to `a`. If `a` contains more than one element, no changes are made to `a`.***
