Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000; `P` is a list of 2N distinct integers; `c` is the second-to-last element of `P`; `b` is a list containing at least the element 100000. If the length of `b` is less than the length of `a` and the last element of `b` is less than the last element of `a`, then `c` is appended to `b`; otherwise, `c` is appended to `a`. The variables `a`, `c`, and `fail` remain unchanged except that `fail` is set to True if `c` is greater than both the last element of `a` and the last element of `b`; otherwise, `fail` may remain unchanged. Consequently, if `c` is appended to `b`, it may influence the value of `fail`, depending on its relationship with the last elements of `a` and `b`. If `c` is appended to `a`, it has no effect on `b`, and `fail` may also remain unchanged.***
