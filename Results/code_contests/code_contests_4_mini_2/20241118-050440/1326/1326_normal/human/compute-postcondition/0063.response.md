Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000; `P` is a list of 2N distinct integers; `a` contains at least the initial element 100000; `b` is a list containing at least the element 100000; `fail` is True, indicating that the expected number of elements in `a` was not maintained; the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged unless altered by subsequent operations.***
