The function `func_4` accepts a parameter `N`. `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 2000. The function does not directly accept a second parameter, but it is implied that `P` is a list of 2N distinct integers that represent a permutation of numbers from 1 to 2N. The output of the function is not explicitly described, but it is expected to process the permutation based on the input size `N`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_4` is to accept a positive integer `N` within the specified range and presumably operate on a permutation of integers related to `N`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer N (1 <= N <= 2000) and processes a list P of 2N distinct integers representing a permutation of numbers from 1 to 2N.**
