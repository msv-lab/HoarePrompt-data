t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000) representing the length of arrays a and b for each test case, and p is a list of 2n distinct integers (1 ≤ p[i] ≤ 2n) which is a permutation of integers from 1 to 2n. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2000.
