Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000, `P` is a list of 2N distinct integers, `c` is the last element of `P`, and `b` is a list of integers. If the length of `b` is less than the length of `a` and the last element of `b` is smaller than the last element of `a`, `c` is appended to `b`. Otherwise, `c` is appended to `a`. If `b` is empty, the condition cannot be evaluated, and `fail` remains unchanged. The state of `b` is modified only if the condition holds true. If the length of `a` is 1, the appending of `c` does not affect the condition checked but updates `a` accordingly. All cases ensure that the relationship between `a`, `b`, and `c` is maintained as described.***
