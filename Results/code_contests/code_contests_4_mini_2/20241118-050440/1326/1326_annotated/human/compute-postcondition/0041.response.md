Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000; `P` is a list of 2N distinct integers; `c` is the second last element of `P`; `b` is a list of integers. If the length of `b` is less than that of `a` and the last element of `b` is less than the last element of `a`, then `c` is appended to `b`. Otherwise, `c` is appended to `a`. If `b` has only one element and its last element is not less than `c`, `b` remains unchanged. The variable `fail` remains unchanged unless both conditions are met where `c` is greater than the last element of `b` and the last element of `b` is `c`, in which case `fail` is set to True and the loop is exited.***
