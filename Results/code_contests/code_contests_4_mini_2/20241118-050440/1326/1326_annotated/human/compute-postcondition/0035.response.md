Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000; `P` is a list of 2N distinct integers; `c` is the second last element of `P`; `b` is a list of integers; if `c` is greater than the last element of `a`, then `c` is appended to the list `a` and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `c` is not greater than the last element of `a`, the state of `a` remains unchanged unless its length is 1, in which case the loop continues with no modifications. The variable `fail` remains unchanged unless both `c` is greater than the last element of `a` and the last element of `b`, in which case `fail` is set to True and the loop is exited.***
