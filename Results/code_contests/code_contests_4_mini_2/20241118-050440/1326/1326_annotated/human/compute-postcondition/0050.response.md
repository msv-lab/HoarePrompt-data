The `continue` statement does not change the values of the variables in the current execution context. It simply skips the remaining statements in the current iteration of the loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged regarding the values of `N`, `P`, `c`, and `a`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000; `P` is a list of 2N distinct integers; `c` is the last element of `P`; if the length of `a` is 1, `c` is appended to `a`; if the length of `a` is greater than 1, `a` remains unchanged, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
