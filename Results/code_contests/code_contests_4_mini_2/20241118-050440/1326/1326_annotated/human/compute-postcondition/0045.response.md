Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000; `P` is a list of 2N distinct integers; `c` is the last element of `P`. If the length of list `a` is 1, then `c` is appended to `a`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If the length of `a` is not 1, the program does not execute the if statement, thus the state of `a` remains unchanged.***
