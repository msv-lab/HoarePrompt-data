The function `func_4` accepts a parameter `N`. `N` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 2000\). The function also takes an additional parameter `P`, which is a list of \(2N\) distinct integers where each integer is in the range from 1 to \(2N\). The functionality of the function `func_4` is to process these inputs based on the specified constraints. However, the exact output based on the input parameters `N` and `P` has not been provided in the prompt.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer N (1 <= N <= 2000) and a list P of 2N distinct integers (each in the range 1 to 2N).**
