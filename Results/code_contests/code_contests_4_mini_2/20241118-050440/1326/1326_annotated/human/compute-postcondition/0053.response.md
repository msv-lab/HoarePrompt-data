The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but skips the remaining code in the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000; `P` is a list of 2N distinct integers; `c` is the last element of `P`; `b` is `b` with `c` appended, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
