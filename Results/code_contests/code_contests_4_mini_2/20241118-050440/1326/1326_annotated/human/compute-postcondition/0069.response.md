Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `N` and processes a list `P` of distinct integers. It attempts to populate two lists, `a` and `b`, based on the values in `P`. If the length of `a` at the end of the processing is not equal to `N + 1`, it sets a failure flag and prints 'NO'. If the processing is successful and the required length of `a` is achieved, it prints 'YES'. Edge cases include situations where `P` is empty, which results in 'YES' being printed by default, and the case where `P` contains elements that fail the conditions for adding to `a` or `b`, potentially setting the failure flag. **
