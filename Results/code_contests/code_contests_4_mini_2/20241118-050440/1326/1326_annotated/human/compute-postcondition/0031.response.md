The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or the most internal structure we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000; `P` is a list of 2N distinct integers; `c` is the second last element of `P`; `b` is a list of integers; and `fail` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
