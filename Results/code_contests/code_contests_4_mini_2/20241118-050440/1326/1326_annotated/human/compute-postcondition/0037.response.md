The code `continue` does not change the values of any variables. Instead, it affects the control flow by skipping the current iteration of a loop and proceeding to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state retains the values of all variables as they were before the execution of the `continue` statement.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000; `P` is a list of 2N distinct integers; `c` is the second last element of `P`; `b` is a list of integers, and `b` remains unchanged with the current values.**
