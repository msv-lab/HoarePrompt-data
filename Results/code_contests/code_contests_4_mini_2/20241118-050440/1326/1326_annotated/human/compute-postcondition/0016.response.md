Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000, `P` is a list of 2N distinct integers, `c` is the last element of `P`, and `a` is a list of integers. If `a` is not empty and `c` is greater than the last element of `a`, then `c` is appended to `a`. If `c` is also greater than the last element of `b`, then `fail` may be set to True and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a` is empty, `fail` remains unchanged and the condition regarding `c` and the last elements of `a` and `b` cannot be evaluated. If the length of `a` is 1, appending `c` does not affect the condition checked, hence `a` is updated accordingly but does not change the state of the condition.***
