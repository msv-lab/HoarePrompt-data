The code `a.append(c)` adds the value of `c` to the list `a`. The variable `c` is defined as the last element of the list `P`. Given that `P` is a list of 2N distinct integers, `c` will hold a specific integer value from that list. The state of the variable `a` will change as it will now include the value of `c`. Therefore, the output state reflects the addition of `c` to `a`, while the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000; `P` is a list of 2N distinct integers; `c` is the last element of `P`; `a` now includes c.**
