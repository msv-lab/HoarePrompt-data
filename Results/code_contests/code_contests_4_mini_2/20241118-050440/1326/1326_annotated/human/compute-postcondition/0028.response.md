The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables, but it causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration in a loop and proceed to the next iteration. Since no variable values are affected by this statement, the output state remains the same as before.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000; `P` is a list of 2N distinct integers; `c` is the second last element of `P`; `b` is a list of integers; `a` now includes `c` appended to it, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
