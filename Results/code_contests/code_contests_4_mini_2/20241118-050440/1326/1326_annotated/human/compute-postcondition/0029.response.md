Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000; `P` is a list of 2N distinct integers; `c` is the second last element of `P`; `b` is a list of integers. If the length of `a` is 1, then `c` is appended to `a`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If the length of `a` is not 1, the state of `a` remains unchanged, and the loop proceeds without modification to `a`.***
