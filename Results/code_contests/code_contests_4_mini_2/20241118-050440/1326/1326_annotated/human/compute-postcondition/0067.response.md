Postcondition: ***If `P` is a non-empty list and `fail` is True, the program prints 'NO'; otherwise, if `P` is empty, `a` remains [100000], `b` remains [100000], and `fail` remains False, resulting in the program printing 'YES'. If `P` is a non-empty list and `fail` is False, it indicates that the length of `a` is equal to `N + 1`, thus the program prints 'YES' with `a` retaining its original values and `b` remaining [100000].***
