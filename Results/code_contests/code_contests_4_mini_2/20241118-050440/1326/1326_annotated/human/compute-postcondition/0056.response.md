Given the initial state: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000; `P` is a list of 2N distinct integers; `c` is the last element of `P`. The effects of the code need to be evaluated based on the conditions provided.

1. The code `a.append(c)` appends the value of `c` to the list `a`.
2. The conditions regarding the length of `a` and the comparison of `c` with the last elements of `a` and `b` dictate whether `c` is appended to `a` or if certain flags are set.
3. If `a` currently has a length of 1, then `c` is appended to `a`.
4. If `a` has a length greater than 1, the state of `a` remains unchanged.

Since the code simply appends `c` to `a` regardless of the prior conditions, we must assume that `c` is appended since it is the action specified in the provided code snippet.

The output state will reflect that `c` has been appended to `a`, and we do not have specific previous values for `a`, but we can denote that it now includes the new value `c`.

Output State: **`a` now includes `c`**
