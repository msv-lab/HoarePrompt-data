Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000; `P` is a list of 2N distinct integers; `c` is the last element of `P`. If the length of `b` is less than the length of `a` and the last element of `b` is less than the last element of `a`, then `c` is appended to `b`, leaving `a` unchanged and `fail` unaffected. If the length of `b` is not less than the length of `a` or the last element of `b` is not less than the last element of `a`, then `c` is appended to `a`, and the contents of `b` and `fail` remain unchanged. Additionally, if `c` is greater than both the last element of `a` and the last element of `b`, then `fail` is set to True, and the program exits the most internal loop.***
