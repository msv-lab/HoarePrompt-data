The variable `a` is a list with a length of 1, and `c` is the last element of the list `P`, which consists of 2N distinct integers. The code `a.append(c)` adds the value of `c` to the end of the list `a`. Since `a` initially has a length of 1, after executing the code, the length of `a` will increase to 2, and it will now contain its original element plus the element `c`. Therefore, the output state is that `N` remains a positive integer, `P` is a list of 2N distinct integers, `c` is the last element of `P`, and the length of `a` is now 2.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000, `P` is a list of 2N distinct integers, `c` is the last element of `P`, and the length of `a` is 2**
