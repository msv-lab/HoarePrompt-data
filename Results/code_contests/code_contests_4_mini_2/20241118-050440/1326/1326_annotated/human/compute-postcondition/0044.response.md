The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop and proceed to the next iteration. Since `N`, `P`, `c`, and `a` are not modified by this statement, the output state reflects that there are no changes to these variables. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000; `P` is a list of 2N distinct integers; `c` is the last element of `P`; `a` now includes `c`, and we continue with the next iteration of the loop.
