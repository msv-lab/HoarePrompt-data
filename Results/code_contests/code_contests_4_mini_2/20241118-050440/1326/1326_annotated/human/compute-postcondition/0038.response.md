Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000; `P` is a list of 2N distinct integers; `c` is the second last element of `P`; `b` is a list of integers. If `c` is greater than the last element of `b`, `c` is appended to `b`. If `c` is not greater than the last element of `b`, the list `b` remains unchanged unless it has only one element, in which case the loop continues without modifications. The variable `fail` remains unchanged unless both conditions are met where `c` is greater than the last element of `b` and the last element of `b`, in which case `fail` is set to True and the loop is exited.***
