The variable `b` is assigned the value `[10 ** 5]`, which evaluates to `[100000]`. The previous values of the affected variables are `N` (a positive integer between 1 and 2000), `P` (a list of 2N distinct integers), and `a` (which is `[100000]`). The state of `N`, `P`, and `a` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000; `P` is assigned a list of 2N distinct integers; `a` is [100000]; `b` is [100000].

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000; `P` is assigned a list of 2N distinct integers; `a` is [100000]; `b` is [100000]**
