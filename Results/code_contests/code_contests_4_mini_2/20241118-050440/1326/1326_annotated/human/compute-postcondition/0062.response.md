Postcondition: ***If `P` is a non-empty list, then if the length of `a` is not equal to `N + 1`, the variable `fail` is set to True. If `P` is empty, then `a` remains [100000], `b` remains [100000], and `fail` remains False. Thus, the state of `fail` depends on the length of `a` in relation to `N + 1`, while `a`, `b`, and `fail` retain their specified values when `P` is empty.***
