Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000; `P` is a list of 2N distinct integers; `c` is the last element of `P`. If `c` is greater than the last element of `b`, then `c` is appended to `b` and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If the length of `a` is 1, then `c` is appended to `a`. If the length of `a` is greater than 1, then `a` remains unchanged. Additionally, if `c` is greater than both the last element of `a` and the last element of `b`, then `fail` is set to True, and the program exits the most internal loop.***
