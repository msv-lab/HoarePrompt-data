Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000, `P` is a list of 2N distinct integers, and `c` is the last element of `P`. If the length of `a` is 1, `c` is appended to `a`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If the length of `a` is not 1, the state of `a` remains unchanged.***
