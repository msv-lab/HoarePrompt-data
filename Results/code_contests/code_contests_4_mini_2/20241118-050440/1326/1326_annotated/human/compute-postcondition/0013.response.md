Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000, `P` is a list of 2N distinct integers, `c` is the last element of `P`, `a` is a list of integers. The condition `c` is greater than the last element of `a` (if `a` is not empty) is true. If `a` has only one element, `c` has been appended to `a`. The state of `fail` may be True if `c` is also greater than the last element of `b`.***
