Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000, `P` is a list of 2N distinct integers, `c` is the last element of `P`, and `b` is a list of integers. If `c` is greater than the last element of `b`, then `c` is appended to `b`, and the execution continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `b` is empty, the condition cannot be evaluated, and `fail` remains unchanged. If the length of `a` is 1, appending `c` does not affect the condition checked, but `a` is updated accordingly. In all cases, the state of `b` is modified only if the condition `c > b[-1]` holds true, while the state of `a` and `fail` are dependent on the conditions regarding `c` and the last elements of `a` and `b`.***
