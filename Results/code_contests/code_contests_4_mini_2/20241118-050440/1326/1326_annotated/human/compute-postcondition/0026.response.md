According to the code, the loop iterates over the elements of the list `P` in reverse order. For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that we're processing the next element in the reverse order of `P`.

At the end of the last iteration, `c` is the last element of `P`, which means that `c` is the first element when iterating over `P[::-1]` in the next iteration. For the loop to continue, we need to adjust `c` to be the next element in the reverse order of `P`, which would be the second last element of `P`.

Since `P` has `2N` distinct integers, we know that the previous value of `c` can be replaced by the value that comes before it in `P[::-1]`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `c` accordingly.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000, `P` is a list of 2N distinct integers, `c` is the second last element of `P`, and `b` is a list of integers.**
