The list `a` is assigned the value of `[10 ** 5]`, which calculates to `[100000]`. The initial state provides no information about the previous value of `a`, but it is now explicitly set to this new value. Other variables, `N` and `P`, remain unaffected by this assignment.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000; `P` is assigned the value returned by `func_3()` which provides a list of 2N distinct integers in the range 1 to 2N; `a` is [100000]**
