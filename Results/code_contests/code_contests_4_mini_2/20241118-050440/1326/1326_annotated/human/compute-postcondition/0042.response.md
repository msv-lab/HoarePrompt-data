To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the provided information step by step.

1. We know that `P` is a list of `2N` distinct integers, and `c` is the second last element of `P`. Therefore, `c` has a specific value based on the current state of `P`.

2. The loop iterates over `P` in reverse (`P[::-1]`), which means it starts from the last element of `P` and goes backward. At the end of the last iteration, `c` would be the second last element, implying that in the next iteration, `c` will take on the value of the last element of `P`.

3. The loop's control flow depends on the conditions involving lists `a` and `b`, specifically their lengths and the values of their last elements in comparison to `c`. 

4. The key conditions that affect whether `c` is appended to `b` or `a` are:
   - If the length of `b` is less than that of `a` and the last element of `b` is less than the last element of `a`, then `c` is appended to `b`.
   - Otherwise, `c` is appended to `a`.
   - If `b` has only one element and its last element is not less than `c`, then `b` remains unchanged.

5. Also, the variable `fail` will remain unchanged unless both conditions are met where `c` is greater than the last element of `b` and the last element of `b` is `c`, which causes `fail` to be set to `True` and exits the loop.

Given that `c` is the second last element of `P` at the end of the previous iteration, to execute the loop one more time, we need to consider the last element of `P`, which will be the new `c`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect the following:

- `c` will be the last element of `P` (which was previously the last element before the last iteration).
- The length of `b` and its values compared to `a` need to be set so that the conditions for appending `c` are accurately reflected.

Since we do not have specific values for `a` or `b`, we can state that `b` needs to be adjusted to ensure that one of the conditions for appending `c` is satisfied and that `fail` remains unchanged unless the specific conditions you've set are met.

So, summarizing these points, we can state:

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000; `P` is a list of 2N distinct integers; `c` is the last element of `P`; `b` is a list of integers (the conditions of which must be satisfied to allow the loop to execute again).**
