According to the code, the loop iterates over the list `P` in reverse order. The loop can execute as long as `P` is not empty. Given that `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000, `P` is assigned a list of 2N distinct integers, which means `P` contains 2N elements.

At the start of the loop, `c` will take values from the elements of `P` in reverse order, starting from the last element. Since `P` has been defined as a list of distinct integers, it will have at least 2 elements (since `N` is at least 1).

Thus, before the loop starts, we need to ensure that `P` contains 2N distinct integers, and we also need to indicate that `c` will be assigned the last element of `P` during the first iteration.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000, `P` is a list of 2N distinct integers, `c` is the last element of `P`**
