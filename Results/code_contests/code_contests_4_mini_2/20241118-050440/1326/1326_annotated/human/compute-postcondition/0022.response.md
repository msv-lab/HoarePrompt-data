The code appends the last element of list `P`, which is `c`, to the list `b`. The value of `c` is known as it is the last element of `P`. The other variables' states remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated state of `b` after appending `c`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000, `P` is a list of 2N distinct integers, `c` is the last element of `P`, `b` is a list of integers with `c` appended to it.**
