Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000; `P` is a list of 2N distinct integers; `c` is the second last element of `P`; `b` is a list of integers. If `c` is greater than both the last element of `a` and the last element of `b`, then `fail` is set to True, and the loop is exited. If either condition is not met, `fail` remains unchanged, and the state of `a` remains unchanged if its length is not 1. The loop continues without modification to `a` in this case.***
