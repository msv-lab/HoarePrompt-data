Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000, `P` is a list of 2N distinct integers, `c` is the last element of `P`, and `b` is a list of integers. The length of `b` is greater than or equal to the length of `a`, or the last element of `b` is greater than or equal to the last element of `a`. `b` remains unchanged, and `fail` is not modified. The state of `a` is preserved according to its previous conditions.***
