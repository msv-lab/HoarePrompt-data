Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000, `P` is a list of 2N distinct integers, `c` is the last element of `P`, and `a` is a list of integers. If `c` is greater than both the last element of `a` and the last element of `b`, `fail` is set to True and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the length of `a` is 1, `c` is appended to `a`, but this does not affect the condition checked; hence if the condition is false, the state of `a` remains unchanged. The program can also handle the edge case when `a` is empty, in which case the condition regarding `c` and the last elements of `a` and `b` cannot be evaluated, and `fail` remains unchanged.***
