Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000, `P` is a list of 2N distinct integers, `c` is the last element of `P`, `a` is a list of integers, `c` is greater than the last element of `b`, and `b` now contains the element `c` appended to it; we continue to the next iteration of the loop or statement.**
