The `continue` statement does not change the state of any variables but instead skips the remaining code in the current iteration of a loop, proceeding to the next iteration if applicable. Therefore, the output state reflects that the loop continues without any modifications to the variables.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2000, `P` is a list of 2N distinct integers, `c` is the last element of `P`, and the length of `a` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
