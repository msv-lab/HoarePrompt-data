The variable `gl` is assigned the value `0`. This assignment does not affect other variables. Therefore, the output state is: `j` is 1, `gaps` has the value of `gl` appended to it, `gl` is 0, `special` is set to True or False (depending on `ax`), `m` remains unchanged, `sa` is the set of unique elements in list `a`, `sb` is the set of unique elements in list `b`, `mx` is the maximum value of the difference `sa - sb`, `i` is 1, and if `special` is True, then `specialgap` is assigned the value of `gl`.
