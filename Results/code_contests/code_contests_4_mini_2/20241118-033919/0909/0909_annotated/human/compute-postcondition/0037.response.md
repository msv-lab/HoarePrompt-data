Postcondition: ***`j` is 1, `m` is unchanged, `sa` is the set of unique elements in list `a`, `sb` is the set of unique elements in list `b`, `mx` is the maximum value of the difference `sa - sb`, `gaps` is an empty list, `gl` is 0, `special` is a boolean value, `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `ax` is the first element of list `a`, and `ax` is equal to `b[j]`. If `special` is True, then `specialgap` is assigned the value of `gl`, which is 0; otherwise, `specialgap` remains unchanged.***
