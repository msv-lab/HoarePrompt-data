Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `x`, and `k` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `a` is a list with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, and `ax` is the third element of `a`. If `j` is less than `m` and `ax` equals `b[j]`, then `j` is increased by 1. If either condition is not met (i.e., `j` is not less than `m` or `ax` does not equal `b[j]`), the value of `j` remains unchanged.***
