Postcondition: ***After executing the if statement, if `special` is True, then `specialgap` is assigned the value of `gl`, where `j` is at most the length of list `b`, `gaps` contains the recorded values of `gl` before any increment due to matches, `gl` is reset to 0 for each match, `m` remains unchanged, `sa` is the set of unique elements in list `a`, `sb` is the set of unique elements in list `b`, and `mx` is the maximum value of the difference `sa - sb`. If the loop does not execute, `j` remains 0, `gaps` is still an empty list, `gl` is 0, and `special` is False.***
