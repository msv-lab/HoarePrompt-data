Postcondition: ***`j` is 0, `m` is unchanged, `sa` is the set of unique elements in list `a`, `sb` is the set of unique elements in list `b`, `mx` is the maximum value of the difference `sa - sb`, `gaps` is an empty list, `gl` is 0, `special` is True if `ax` equals `mx`, indicating that the first element of list `a` is the maximum value of the difference. Otherwise, `special` remains False, while the other variables retain their initial values and conditions. Additionally, either `j` is not less than `m` or `ax` is not equal to `b[j]` holds true.***
