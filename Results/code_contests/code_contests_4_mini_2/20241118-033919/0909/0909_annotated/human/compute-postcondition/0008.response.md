Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `x`, and `k` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `j` is an integer, `i` is 0, and `ax` is the first element of `a`. If `j` is less than `m` and `ax` is equal to the element at index `j` in list `b`, then `j` is incremented by 1. If `j` is not less than `m` or `ax` is not equal to `b[j]`, then `j` remains unchanged. Additionally, `ax` retains its value as the first element of `a`.***
