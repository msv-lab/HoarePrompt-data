The variable `ans` is assigned the value `0`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` remains 0, `gaps` is [0], `gl` is 0, `special` is False, the function debug_print outputs [0], and `ans` is 0.

Output State: **`j` remains 0, `gaps` is [0], `gl` is 0, `special` is False, the function debug_print outputs [0], and `ans` is 0**
