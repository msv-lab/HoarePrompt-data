The variable `specialgap` is assigned the value of `gl`, which was previously incremented by 1. Therefore, `specialgap` takes on the value of `gl`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Hence, the output state is: `j` is 1, `gaps` is 0, `gl` is incremented by 1, `special` is set to True or False (depending on `ax`), `m` remains unchanged, `sa` is the set of unique elements in list `a`, `sb` is the set of unique elements in list `b`, `mx` is the maximum value of the difference `sa - sb`, `i` is 1, `ax` is the second element of list `a`, and `specialgap` is assigned the value of `gl`.
