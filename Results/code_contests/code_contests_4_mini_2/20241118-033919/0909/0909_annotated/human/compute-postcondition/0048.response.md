The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is 0. The other variables `gaps`, `gl`, `special`, `m`, `sa`, `sb`, `mx`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `j` is 1, `gaps` is 0, `gl` is incremented by 1, `special` is set to True or False (depending on `ax`), `m` remains unchanged, `sa` is the set of unique elements in list `a`, `sb` is the set of unique elements in list `b`, `mx` is the maximum value of the difference `sa - sb`, and `i` is 1, `ax` is the second element of list `a`.

Output State: **`j` is 1, `gaps` is 0, `gl` is incremented by 1, `special` is set to True or False (depending on `ax`), `m` remains unchanged, `sa` is the set of unique elements in list `a`, `sb` is the set of unique elements in list `b`, `mx` is the maximum value of the difference `sa - sb`, `i` is 1, `ax` is the second element of list `a`**
