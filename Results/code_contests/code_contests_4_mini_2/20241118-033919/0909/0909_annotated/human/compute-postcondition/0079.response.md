Postcondition: ***`j` remains 0, `gaps` is [0], `gl` is 0, `special` is False, and the function debug_print outputs [0]. If `specialgap` is less than `k`, the function prints -1 and returns None. If `specialgap` is greater than or equal to `k`, there is no output and the function implicitly returns None.***
