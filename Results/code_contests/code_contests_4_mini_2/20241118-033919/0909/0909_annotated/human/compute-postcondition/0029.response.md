The variable `j` is assigned the value `0`, which means it is initialized to zero. The other variables, such as `m`, `sa`, `sb`, `mx`, and `gaps`, remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, the output state reflects the initialization of `j` while all other variables retain their values.

Output State: **`j` is 0, `m` is unchanged, `sa` is the set of unique elements in list `a`, `sb` is the set of unique elements in list `b`, `mx` is the maximum value of the difference `sa - sb`, `gaps` is an empty list**.
