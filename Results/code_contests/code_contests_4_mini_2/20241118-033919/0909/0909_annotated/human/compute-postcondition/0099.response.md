Postcondition: ***`j` remains 0, `gl` is 0, `special` is False, and `ans` is calculated based on the value of `x` relative to `y * k`. If `x` is less than `y * k`, then `ans` is the sum of `x * (g // k) + y * (g % k)` for each `g` in `gaps`, which results in `ans` being 0 if `gaps` is empty, or if it contains only zeros. If `x` is greater than or equal to `y * k`, then `ans` equals the sum of `y * g` for each `g` in `gaps`, which also results in `ans` being 0 if `gaps` is empty or contains only zeros. Overall, `ans` will be 0 if `gaps` is empty or contains only zeros, regardless of the values of `x`, `y`, or `k`.***
