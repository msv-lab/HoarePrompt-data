Postcondition: ***`j` is either 2 or remains 1, `gaps` contains the value of `gl` appended to it, which is now 0 if `j` was incremented, otherwise it is `gl` incremented by 1. `gl` is reset to 0 if `j` is incremented and `special` is set to False. If `ax` is equal to `mx`, then `special` is set to True. `m` remains unchanged, and the conditions of sets `sa` and `sb` along with the maximum value `mx` of the difference `sa - sb` continue to hold. The state of `specialgap` remains undefined unless `special` is True, in which case it is equal to the previous value of `gl` before it was reset.***
