The value of `j` is incremented by 1, and since `j` initially has a value of 1, after execution, `j` becomes 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is 2, `gaps` has the value of `gl` appended to it, `gl` is reset to 0, `special` is set to False, `m` remains unchanged, `sa` is the set of unique elements in list `a`, `sb` is the set of unique elements in list `b`, `mx` is the maximum value of the difference `sa - sb`, `i` is 2, `ax` is the second element in list `a`, and `a` has at least 3 elements.

Output State: **`j` is 2, `gaps` has the value of `gl` appended to it, `gl` is reset to 0, `special` is set to False, `m` remains unchanged, `sa` is the set of unique elements in list `a`, `sb` is the set of unique elements in list `b`, `mx` is the maximum value of the difference `sa - sb`, `i` is 2, `ax` is the second element in list `a`, and `a` has at least 3 elements.**
