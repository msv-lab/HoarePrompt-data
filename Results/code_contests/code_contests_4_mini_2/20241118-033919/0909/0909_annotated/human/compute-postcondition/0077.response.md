The code executes a print statement, which outputs `-1`. The previous values of the variables are not affected by this print statement. Therefore, the output state is `j` remains 0, `gaps` is now [0], `gl` is 0, `special` is False, and the function debug_print outputs [0]. The value `-1` is printed.

Output State: **`j` remains 0, `gaps` is now [0], `gl` is 0, `special` is False, and the function debug_print outputs [0]; -1 is printed**
