According to the code, the loop iterates over the `gaps` list. At the end of the last iteration, `gaps` contains one element (0), and `g` is currently 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `gaps` needs to contain at least 2 elements, and `g` should be 1 (the next index).

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are `gaps` to have at least 2 elements and `g` to be 1.

State: **`j` remains 0, `gaps` is [0, 1], `gl` is 0, `special` is False, the function `debug_print` outputs [0], `ans` is 0, `x` is greater than or equal to `y * k`, `g` is 1**
