The variable `j` is assigned the value 0. The previous values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y`, `a`, and `b` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `j` while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is assigned a value from `func_2()`, `m` is assigned a value from `func_2()`, `x` is assigned a value from `func_2()`, `k` is assigned a value from `func_2()`, `y` is assigned a value from `func_2()`, `a` is assigned a value from `func_2()`, `b` is assigned a value from `func_2()`, `j` is 0**
