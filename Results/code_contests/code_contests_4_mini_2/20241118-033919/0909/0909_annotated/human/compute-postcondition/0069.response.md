To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we must analyze the current states and the loop structure.

1. The loop iterates over `a` using `enumerate`, which means it takes an index `i` and an element `ax` from the list `a`. The loop will continue as long as there are elements in `a`.

2. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` can either be 2 or remain 1. This indicates that if `j` is incremented to 2, the loop should still be able to execute again if there are more elements in `a`. 

3. If `j` remains 1, the next value of `gl` will be `gl + 1`, and `gaps` will contain this new value. If `j` was incremented, `gl` is reset to 0. The state of `special` will only be relevant if `ax` equals `mx`, which could also affect whether the loop can continue or not.

4. We need to ensure that the loop can execute again by checking the length of `a`. If `i` is currently at its maximum index (i.e., the loop has iterated over all elements in `a`), then the loop cannot execute again.

5. The value of `i` should be incremented by 1 to reflect the next iteration index, and `ax` should be set to the next element in `a`.

To summarize, for the loop to execute one more time:
- We must ensure that `i` is incremented to the next index.
- We should check that there is an element in `a` at the new index.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments to the states are:

State: **`j` is either 2 or remains 1, `gaps` contains the value of `gl` appended to it, which is now 0 if `j` was incremented, otherwise it is `gl` incremented by 1, `gl` is reset to 0 if `j` is incremented and `special` is set to False, if `ax` is equal to `mx`, then `special` is set to True, `m` remains unchanged, the conditions of sets `sa` and `sb` along with the maximum value `mx` of the difference `sa - sb` continue to hold, `specialgap` is equal to the previous value of `gl` before it was reset if `special` is True, `i` is the next index in `a`, `ax` is the next element in `a`**
