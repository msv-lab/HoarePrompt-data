The value of `gl` is incremented by 1, while the other variables remain unchanged. Since the initial value of `gl` is 0, after execution, `gl` becomes 1. Therefore, the output state is: `j` is 0, `m` is unchanged, `sa` is the set of unique elements in list `a`, `sb` is the set of unique elements in list `b`, `mx` is the maximum value of the difference `sa - sb`, `gaps` is an empty list, `gl` is 1, `special` is True if `ax` equals `mx` and False otherwise, and either `j` is not less than `m` or `ax` is not equal to `b[j]` holds true.
