Postcondition: ***`j` is 0, `gaps` is 0, `gl` is incremented by 1, `m` remains unchanged, `sa` is the set of unique elements in list `a`, `sb` is the set of unique elements in list `b`, `mx` is the maximum value of the difference `sa - sb`, `i` is 1, and if `ax` (the second element of list `a`) is equal to `mx`, then `special` is set to True. If `ax` is not equal to `mx`, `special` remains unchanged (either True or False based on previous conditions).***
