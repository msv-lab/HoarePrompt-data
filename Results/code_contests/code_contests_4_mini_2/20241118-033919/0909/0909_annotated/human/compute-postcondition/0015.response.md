According to the code, the loop executes as long as there are more elements in the list `a` to iterate through. The loop uses `enumerate(a)`, which means it will iterate through the indices and elements of `a`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, which means that the loop has processed the first three elements of `a` (indices 0, 1, and 2). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased to 3, and `ax` must be assigned the fourth element of `a`.

Since `a` is a list with at least 3 elements, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, `a` must contain at least 4 elements. Therefore, `i` should be 3 and `ax` should be the fourth element of `a`.

State: **`n`, `m`, `x`, and `k` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `a` is a list with at least 4 elements, `i` is 3, and `ax` is the fourth element of `a`**
