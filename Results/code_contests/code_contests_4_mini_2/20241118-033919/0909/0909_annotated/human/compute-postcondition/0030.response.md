The variable `gl` is initialized to 0. This assignment does not affect any of the other variables (`j`, `m`, `sa`, `sb`, `mx`, `gaps`), which remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `j` is 0, `m` is unchanged, `sa` is the set of unique elements in list `a`, `sb` is the set of unique elements in list `b`, `mx` is the maximum value of the difference `sa - sb`, `gaps` is an empty list, and `gl` is 0.
