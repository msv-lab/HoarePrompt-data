You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for describing the functionality of a Python function. You will be provided with the constraints and relationships between the input parameters, as well as the resulting output of the function based on these inputs. Your task is to organize this information and describe the functionality of the function. Please avoid describing how the function operates or details such as how local variables are initialized—only describe what parameters the function accepts and what it returns. If there are multiple return points in the function we will split them in Cases with an arithmetic counter and remember if one case is fullfilled none of the others are. You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: **functionality**.


Example1:
Parameter constraints and relationships: `number` is an integer.
```
def func(number):
```
Output: `number` is an integer. If `number` is even, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer1:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `number`. `number` is an integer. After executing the function body, if number is even, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `number`, and if `number` is even, it returns True. If `number` is not even, it returns False.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter number, returns `True` if `number` is even. If `number` is not even, it returns `False`.**


Parameter constraints and relationships: `age` is an integer.
```
def func(age):
```
Output: Case_1:`number` is an integer. If `number` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative; 
        Case_2: `number` is an integer. If `number` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult".
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `age`. `age` is an integer. If `age` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative. If `age` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult". Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `age`  and return if the person is a minor or an adult based on the age while handling wrong negative input values.


Your Task:
Parameter constraints: n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 * 10^5; x, k, and y are integers such that 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n; a is a list of n distinct integers where each integer is between 1 and n; b is a list of m distinct integers where each integer is between 1 and n.
```
def func_1():
```
Output: Case_1: *`j` is the count of elements in list `b` that have been found in list `a` up to the current index `i`. If `j` is less than `m`, the function prints -1 and terminates without returning a value. If `j` is greater than or equal to `m`, the function does not execute the print statement and continues without any further action. If the loop did not execute due to `a` being empty or `m` being 0, `j` remains 0.

Case_2: *`j` is the count of elements in list `b` that have been found in list `a` up to the current index `i`; `m` is unchanged; `sa` is the set of unique elements in list `a`; `sb` is the set of unique elements in list `b`. If `sa` is equal to `sb`, the function prints 0 and returns None, indicating that all unique elements in `b` are also present in `a`. If `sa` is not equal to `sb`, no action is taken, and the program continues with no changes to `j`, `m`, `sa`, or `sb`.

Case_3: *`j` remains 0, `gaps` is [0], `gl` is 0, `special` is False, and the function debug_print outputs [0]. If `specialgap` is less than `k`, the function prints -1 and returns None. If `specialgap` is greater than or equal to `k`, there is no output and the function implicitly returns None.

Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?
