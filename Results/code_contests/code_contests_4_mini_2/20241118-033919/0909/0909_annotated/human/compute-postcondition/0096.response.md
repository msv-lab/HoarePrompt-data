To evaluate the code snippet, we have:

- `ans` is initially `y`.
- `g` is 2.
- The operation `ans += y * g` means we will add `y * g` to `ans`.

We need to express `ans` after the operation. Since `ans` starts as `y`, the new value of `ans` will be `y + (y * g)`, which simplifies to `ans = y * (1 + g)`.

Now, since `g` is 2, we can further simplify:

- `ans` becomes `y * (1 + 2) = y * 3`.

The other variables (`j`, `gaps`, `gl`, `special`, `debug_print`, `x`) remain unaffected as they are not involved in this operation.

Thus, the output state reflects the new value of `ans` in relation to `y`.

Output State: **`j` remains 0, `gaps` is [0, 1, 2], `gl` is 0, `special` is False, `debug_print` outputs [0], `ans` is `y * 3`, `x` is greater than or equal to `y * k`, `g` is 2**.
