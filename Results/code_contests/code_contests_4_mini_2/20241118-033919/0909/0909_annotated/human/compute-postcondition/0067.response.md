The value of `gl` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `gl` is unknown. Other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `j` is 1, `gaps` has the value of `gl` appended to it, `gl` is incremented by 1, `m` remains unchanged, `sa` is the set of unique elements in list `a`, `sb` is the set of unique elements in list `b`, `mx` is the maximum value of the difference `sa - sb`, `i` is 2, and `ax` is the second element in list `a`.
