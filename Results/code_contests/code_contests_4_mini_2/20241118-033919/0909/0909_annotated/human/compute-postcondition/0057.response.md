Postcondition: ***`j` is updated to 1 if `ax` equals `b[j]`, `gaps` has the value of `gl` appended to it, `gl` is reset to 0, and `special` is set to False. If `ax` does not equal `b[j]` and equals `mx`, `special` is set to True while `gl` is incremented by 1. In either case, `m` remains unchanged, `sa` is the set of unique elements in list `a`, `sb` is the set of unique elements in list `b`, and `mx` is the maximum value of the difference `sa - sb`, with `i` remaining 1. The potential edge cases include when `j` is equal to `m`, in which case the first part of the if statement will not execute, and when `ax` equals `mx` while `j` is still 0.***
