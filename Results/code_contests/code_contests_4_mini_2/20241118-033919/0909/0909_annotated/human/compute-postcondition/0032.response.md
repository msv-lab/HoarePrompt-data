According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list `a` has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and does not influence the iteration through list `a`. Additionally, `i` will start at 0 for the first iteration, and `ax` will be the first element of the list `a`. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, the state of `a` must have at least 1 element.

State: **`j` is 0, `m` is unchanged, `sa` is the set of unique elements in list `a`, `sb` is the set of unique elements in list `b`, `mx` is the maximum value of the difference `sa - sb`, `gaps` is an empty list, `gl` is 0, `special` is False, `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `ax` is the first element of list `a`**
