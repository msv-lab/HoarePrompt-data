Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `x`, and `k` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `a` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, and `ax` is the second element of `a`. If `j` is less than `m` and `ax` is equal to `b[j]`, then `j` is increased by 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `m` or if `ax` is not equal to `b[j]`, then `j` remains unchanged.***
