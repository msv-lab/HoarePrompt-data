Postcondition: ***`j` is 1, `gaps` has the value of `gl` appended to it, `gl` is reset to 0, `m` remains unchanged, `sa` is the set of unique elements in list `a`, `sb` is the set of unique elements in list `b`, `mx` is the maximum value of the difference `sa - sb`, `i` is 2, and `ax` is the second element in list `a`, which has at least 3 elements. If `ax` equals `mx`, then `special` is set to True; otherwise, `special` remains False.***
