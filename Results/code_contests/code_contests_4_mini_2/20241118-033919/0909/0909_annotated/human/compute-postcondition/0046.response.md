Postcondition: ***`j` is either incremented by 1 if `ax` equals `b[j]`, resulting in `gaps` containing the value 0, `gl` set to 0, and `special` set to False, or remains unchanged with `gl` incremented by 1, while `special` is set to True if `ax` equals `mx`, otherwise it is False. In either case, `m` remains unchanged, `sa` is the set of unique elements in list `a`, `sb` is the set of unique elements in list `b`, and `mx` is the maximum value of the difference `sa - sb`. If `j` was initially 0 and `ax` was not equal to `b[j]`, the conditions of the else part hold true.***
