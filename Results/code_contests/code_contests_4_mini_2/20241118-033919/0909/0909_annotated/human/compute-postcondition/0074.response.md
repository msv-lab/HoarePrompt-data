The code appends the current value of `gl` to the list `gaps`. The value of `gl` is 0 as per the initial state, and since the loop does not execute, `gaps` remains an empty list before this execution. After the append operation, `gaps` will contain one element, which is the value of `gl`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` remains 0, `gaps` is now [0], `gl` is 0, `special` is False**
