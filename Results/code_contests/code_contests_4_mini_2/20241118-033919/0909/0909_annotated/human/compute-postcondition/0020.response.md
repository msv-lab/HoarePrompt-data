Postcondition: ***`j` is the count of elements in list `b` that have been found in list `a` up to the current index `i`. If `j` is less than `m`, the function prints -1 and terminates without returning a value. If `j` is greater than or equal to `m`, the function does not execute the print statement and continues without any further action. If the loop did not execute due to `a` being empty or `m` being 0, `j` remains 0.***
