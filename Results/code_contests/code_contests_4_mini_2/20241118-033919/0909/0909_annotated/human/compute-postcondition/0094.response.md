The statement `ans += y * g` increments the value of `ans` by the product of `y` and `g`. The initial value of `ans` is 0, and `g` is 1. However, the value of `y` is not specified in the initial state. Therefore, we can represent the potential new value of `ans` as follows:

If `y` is a specific value, then `ans` will be updated to `ans + (y * 1)`, which simplifies to `y`. 

Since `ans` is initially 0, the new value of `ans` will be equal to `y`. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `ans` is now equal to `y` and the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` remains 0, `gaps` is [0, 1], `gl` is 0, `special` is False, `debug_print` outputs [0], `ans` is `y`, `x` is greater than or equal to `y * k`, `g` is 1**
