`gl` is incremented by 1, changing its value, while the other variables remain unchanged. The previous value of `gl` is not explicitly stated, so the output state reflects only the change to `gl`. 

Output State: **`j` is 0, `gaps` is 0, `gl` is incremented by 1, `m` remains unchanged, `sa` is the set of unique elements in list `a`, `sb` is the set of unique elements in list `b`, `mx` is the maximum value of the difference `sa - sb`, `i` is 1, and `special` is unchanged.**
