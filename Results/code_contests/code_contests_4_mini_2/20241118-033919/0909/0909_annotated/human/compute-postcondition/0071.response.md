Postcondition: ***`j` is at most the length of list `b`, `gaps` contains the values of `gl` recorded before any increment due to matches, `gl` is reset to 0 for each match, `special` is True, indicating that `ax` equals `mx` at some point when no match was found, `m` remains unchanged, `sa` is the set of unique elements in list `a`, `sb` is the set of unique elements in list `b`, and `mx` is the maximum value of the difference `sa - sb`. If the loop did not execute, then `j` is 0, `gaps` is an empty list, `gl` is 0, and `special` is False.***
