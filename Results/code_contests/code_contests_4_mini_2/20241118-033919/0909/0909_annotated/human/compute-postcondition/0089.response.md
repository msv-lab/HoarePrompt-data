Output State: **`ans` is the sum of `x * (g // k) + y * (g % k)` for each element `g` in `gaps`. If `gaps` is an empty list, then `ans` remains 0. If `gaps` contains at least one element, `g` will take each value from the `gaps` list sequentially. `j` remains 0, `gl` is 0, `special` is False, and `x` is still less than `y` multiplied by `k`.**
