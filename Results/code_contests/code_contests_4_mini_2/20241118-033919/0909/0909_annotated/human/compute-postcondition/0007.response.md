The value of `j` is incremented by 1, and since it was previously less than `m`, it will now be `1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `x`, and `k` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `j` is 1, `i` is 0, `ax` is the first element of `a`, and the first element of `a` (ax) is equal to the element at index `j` in list `b`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `x`, and `k` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `j` is 1, `i` is 0, `ax` is the first element of `a`, and the first element of `a` (ax) is equal to the element at index `j` in list `b`**
