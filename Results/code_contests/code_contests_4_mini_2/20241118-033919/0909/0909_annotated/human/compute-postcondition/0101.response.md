The function `func_1` accepts several parameters, though they are not explicitly listed in the function signature. The parameters are:

1. `n`: an integer representing the number of distinct integers in list `a`.
2. `m`: an integer representing the number of distinct integers in list `b`.
3. `x`, `k`, and `y`: integers where `1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9` and `1 ≤ k ≤ n`.
4. `a`: a list of `n` distinct integers, where each integer is in the range from 1 to n.
5. `b`: a list of `m` distinct integers, where each integer is in the range from 1 to n.

The function has multiple cases for output:

**Case 1:** If `j`, the count of elements in list `b` found in list `a` up to the current index `i`, is less than `m`, the function prints -1 and terminates without returning a value. If `j` is greater than or equal to `m`, no output occurs, and the function continues without any further action.

**Case 2:** If the sets of unique elements in lists `a` and `b` (`sa` and `sb`, respectively) are equal, the function prints 0 and returns None, indicating all unique elements in `b` are present in `a`. If they are not equal, no action is taken, and the program continues.

**Case 3:** If `gaps` is [0], `gl` is 0, and `special` is False, and if `specialgap` is less than `k`, the function prints -1 and returns None. If `specialgap` is greater than or equal to `k`, there is no output, and the function implicitly returns None.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to process two lists `a` and `b` of distinct integers, evaluate the presence of elements from `b` in `a`, and provide specific outputs based on the evaluations involving counts and set comparisons, while handling edge cases related to the counts of elements. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two lists of distinct integers `a` and `b`, and integers `n`, `m`, `x`, `k`, and `y`. It evaluates the presence of elements from `b` in `a`, and based on specific conditions, it may print -1 or 0, or implicitly return None.**
