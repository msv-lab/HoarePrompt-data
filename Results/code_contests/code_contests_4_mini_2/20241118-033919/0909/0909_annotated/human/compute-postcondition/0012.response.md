According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements left in the list `a`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, meaning that the loop has processed the first element of `a`, and `ax` is currently the second element of `a`. To execute one more time, the value of `i` must be incremented to 2, and `ax` must now be set to the third element of `a`.

Since `a` is stated to have at least 2 elements, we need to ensure that `a` has at least 3 elements for the loop to continue executing. Therefore, the state adjustments needed are:

- `i` needs to be adjusted to 2.
- `ax` needs to be adjusted to the third element of `a`.
- We must ensure that `a` contains at least 3 elements.

State: **`n`, `m`, `x`, and `k` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `a` is a list with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, and `ax` is the third element of `a`**.
