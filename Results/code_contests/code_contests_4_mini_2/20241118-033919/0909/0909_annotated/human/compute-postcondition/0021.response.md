The statement `sa = set(a)` converts the list `a` into a set `sa`, which contains unique elements of `a`. The previous values of the variables `j`, `m`, and the contents of list `a` do not change. The value of `j` is determined by the count of elements in list `b` found in list `a`, but this operation does not affect `j` or `m` in any way. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values and the new state of `sa`.

Output State: **`j` is the count of elements in list `b` that have been found in list `a` up to the current index `i`; `m` is unchanged; `sa` is the set of unique elements in list `a`.**
