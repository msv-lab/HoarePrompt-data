To compute the output state, we first analyze the provided code line:

```
ans += x * (g // k) + y * (g % k)
```

1. The variable `ans` is updated by adding the result of the expression on the right to its current value. The initial value of `ans` is 0.
2. The variables involved are `x`, `y`, `g`, and `k`. The value of `g` is 1, and `k` is a positive integer (since `g` is 1 and `g // k` and `g % k` need valid integer results).
3. The expression `(g // k)` calculates how many full `k` fit into `g` (which is 1). The result will be 0 if `k` is greater than 1.
4. The expression `(g % k)` calculates the remainder of `g` divided by `k`, which will be 1 if `k` is greater than 1.
5. Therefore, the total contribution to `ans` from the expression will depend on the values of `x`, `y`, and `k`.

Now, let's summarize the output state:

- `j` is 0
- `gaps` is a list with at least 2 elements (not affecting the computation here)
- `gl` is 0
- `special` is False
- `ans` will now be updated based on `x`, `y`, `g`, and `k`
- `g` is 1
- `x` is less than `y` multiplied by `k`

Since we do not have specific values for `x`, `y`, and `k`, we cannot compute a definitive numerical result for `ans`, but we can indicate that it has been updated.

The output state will reflect this update without specific values for `x`, `y`, and `k`:

Output State: **`j` is 0, `gaps` is a list with at least 2 elements, `gl` is 0, `special` is False, `ans` is updated based on the expression, `x` is less than `y` multiplied by `k`, `g` is 1**
