Postcondition: ***`j` is 2, `gaps` has the value of `gl` appended to it, `gl` is 0, `special` is False, `m` remains unchanged, `sa` is the set of unique elements in list `a`, `sb` is the set of unique elements in list `b`, `mx` is the maximum value of the difference `sa - sb`, `i` is 2, `ax` is the second element in list `a`, and `a` has at least 3 elements. Since `special` is False, `specialgap` is not set and remains undefined.***
