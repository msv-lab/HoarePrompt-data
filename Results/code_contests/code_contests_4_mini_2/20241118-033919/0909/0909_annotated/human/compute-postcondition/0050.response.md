Postcondition: ***`j` is 1, `gaps` is 0, `gl` is incremented by 1, `special` is set to True or False (depending on `ax`), `m` remains unchanged, `sa` is the set of unique elements in list `a`, `sb` is the set of unique elements in list `b`, `mx` is the maximum value of the difference `sa - sb`, `i` is 1, and if `special` is True, then `specialgap` is assigned the value of `gl`. If `special` is False, `specialgap` remains unchanged or is not assigned.***
