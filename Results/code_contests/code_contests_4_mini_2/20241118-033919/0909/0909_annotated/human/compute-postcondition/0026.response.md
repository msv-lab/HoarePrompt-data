Postcondition: ***`j` is the count of elements in list `b` that have been found in list `a` up to the current index `i`; `m` is unchanged; `sa` is the set of unique elements in list `a`; `sb` is the set of unique elements in list `b`. If `sa` is equal to `sb`, the function prints 0 and returns None, indicating that all unique elements in `b` are also present in `a`. If `sa` is not equal to `sb`, no action is taken, and the program continues with no changes to `j`, `m`, `sa`, or `sb`.***
