Functionality: ** The function accepts two lists of distinct integers `a` and `b`, and integers `n`, `m`, `x`, `k`, and `y`. It checks if the number of elements from list `b` found in list `a` is less than `m`, printing -1 if true. It compares the unique elements of `a` and `b`, printing 0 if they are equal. It calculates gaps between matches of list `b` elements in `a`, and if a special condition is met, it evaluates the size of these gaps to determine a final output based on the values of `x`, `y`, and `k`. If no matches are found or if the calculated gaps result in a specific condition (`specialgap < k`), it may print -1. If the gaps are empty or contain only zeros, the final printed answer will be 0. The function does not return any value explicitly.**
