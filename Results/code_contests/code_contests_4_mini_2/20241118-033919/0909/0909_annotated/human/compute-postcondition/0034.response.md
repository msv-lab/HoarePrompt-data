The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is 0. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is `j` is 1, `m` is unchanged, `sa` is the set of unique elements in list `a`, `sb` is the set of unique elements in list `b`, `mx` is the maximum value of the difference `sa - sb`, `gaps` is an empty list, `gl` is 0, `special` is False, `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, and `ax` is the first element of list `a`, and `j` is now 1 while `ax` is equal to `b[j]` (previously `b[0]`).

Output State: **`j` is 1, `m` is unchanged, `sa` is the set of unique elements in list `a`, `sb` is the set of unique elements in list `b`, `mx` is the maximum value of the difference `sa - sb`, `gaps` is an empty list, `gl` is 0, `special` is False, `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `ax` is the first element of list `a`, and `j` is now 1 while `ax` is equal to `b[j]`.**
