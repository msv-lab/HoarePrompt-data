The code `gaps.append(gl)` appends the value of `gl` (which is 0) to the list `gaps`. The variable `j`, the value of `gaps`, the value of `gl`, the boolean `special`, and the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated state of `gaps`.

Output State: **`j` is 2, `gaps` has the value of `gl` appended to it (now includes 0), `gl` is 0, `special` is False, `m` remains unchanged, `sa` is the set of unique elements in list `a`, `sb` is the set of unique elements in list `b`, `mx` is the maximum value of the difference `sa - sb`, `i` is 2, `ax` is the second element in list `a`, and `specialgap` remains undefined.**
