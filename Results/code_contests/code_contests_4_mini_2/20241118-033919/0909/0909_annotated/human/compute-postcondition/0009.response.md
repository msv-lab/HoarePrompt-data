According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. The loop iterates over `a`, and since `i` is currently 0, the loop will execute again as long as `i` is less than the length of `a`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, which allows the loop to execute. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it 1, and `ax` should be updated to the second element of `a` (assuming `a` has at least 2 elements).

Additionally, since `a` has at least 1 element, it retains its property of having at least 2 elements if the loop is to execute again.

State: **`n`, `m`, `x`, and `k` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `a` is a list with at least 2 elements, `j` is an integer, `i` is 1, and `ax` is the second element of `a`.**
