The `gaps` list is updated by appending the current value of `gl`, which is 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, after executing the code, the output state reflects that `gaps` now contains the value of `gl`.

Output State: **`j` is 1, `m` is unchanged, `sa` is the set of unique elements in list `a`, `sb` is the set of unique elements in list `b`, `mx` is the maximum value of the difference `sa - sb`, `gaps` is a list containing the value 0, `gl` is 0, `special` is a boolean value, `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `ax` is the first element of list `a`, and `ax` is equal to `b[j]`.**
