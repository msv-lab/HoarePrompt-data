The value of `gl` is assigned to 0, but it was already 0. Therefore, the state of the other variables remains unchanged. The output state is: `j` is 2, `gaps` has the value of `gl` appended to it (now includes 0), `gl` is 0, `special` is False, `m` remains unchanged, `sa` is the set of unique elements in list `a`, `sb` is the set of unique elements in list `b`, `mx` is the maximum value of the difference `sa - sb`, `i` is 2, `ax` is the second element in list `a`, and `specialgap` remains undefined.
