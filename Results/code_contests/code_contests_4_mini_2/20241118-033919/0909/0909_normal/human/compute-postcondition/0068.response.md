Postcondition: ***`gaps` is a list that includes `gl`, `sa`, `sb`, and `mx`. If `j` is less than `m` and `ax` is equal to `b[j]`, then `j` is incremented, `gaps` has `gl` appended to it, `gl` is reset to 0, and `special` remains False. If `special` is True, `specialgap` is set to `gl`. Otherwise, if `ax` is equal to `mx`, `special` is set to True, and `gl` is incremented by 1. In the case where `j` is not less than `m` or `ax` is not equal to `b[j]`, `gl` is incremented by 1 while `special` remains False.***
