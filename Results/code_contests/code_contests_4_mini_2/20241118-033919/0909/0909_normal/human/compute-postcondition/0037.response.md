Postcondition: ***`gaps` is an empty list, `sa` is unchanged, `sb` is unchanged, `mx` is unchanged, `j` is increased by 1, `gl` is 0, `special` is a Boolean value, `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, and `ax` is the first element of the list `a`, which is equal to `b[j]`. If `special` is True, then `specialgap` is set to 0. If `special` is False, `specialgap` remains unchanged.***
