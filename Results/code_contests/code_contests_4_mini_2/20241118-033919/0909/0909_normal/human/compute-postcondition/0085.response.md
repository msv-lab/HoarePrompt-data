The variable `ans` is updated by adding the value of `x * (g // k) + y * (g % k)` to it. The value of `g` is the second element in the `gaps` list. The current values of `x`, `y`, and `k` are such that `x` is less than `y` multiplied by `k`. 

Since no specific values are given for `g`, `x`, `y`, or `k`, we can state that `ans` is modified based on the calculation described. Therefore, the output state reflects that `ans` is updated but does not specify exact numerical values.

Output State: **`gaps` is a list containing at least 2 lengths of gaps, `j` is 0, `gl` is 0, `special` is False, and `ans` is updated by adding `x * (g // k) + y * (g % k)` to its previous value.**
