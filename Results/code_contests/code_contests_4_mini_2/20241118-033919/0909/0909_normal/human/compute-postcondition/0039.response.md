The variable `gl` is assigned the value `0`. The previous value of `gl` was already `0`, so it remains unchanged. Other variables, including `gaps`, `sa`, `sb`, `mx`, `j`, `special`, `a`, `i`, and `ax`, are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects that `gl` remains `0`.

Output State: **`gaps` is a list containing 0, `sa` is unchanged, `sb` is unchanged, `mx` is unchanged, `j` is increased by 1, `gl` is 0, `special` is a Boolean value, `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, and `ax` is the first element of the list `a`, which is equal to `b[j]`**
