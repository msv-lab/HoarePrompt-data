Postcondition: ***`gaps` is an empty list, `sa` is unchanged, `sb` is unchanged, `mx` is unchanged, `j` is 0, `gl` is 0, `special` is set to True if `ax` is equal to `mx`. `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `ax` is the first element of the list `a`, and either `j` is greater than or equal to `m` or `ax` is not equal to `b[j]`. If `ax` is not equal to `mx`, then `special` remains False.***
