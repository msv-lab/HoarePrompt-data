Postcondition: ***`gaps` is a list that includes `gl`, `sa`, `sb`, and `mx`. After the execution, if `special` is True, then `specialgap` is set to the value of `gl`, which is 0. If `special` is False, `specialgap` remains undefined. The variable `j` has been incremented, `gl` has been reset to 0 and appended to `gaps`, `i` is 2, and `ax` is the third element of the list `a`.***
