Postcondition: ***`gaps` is a list that contains the lengths of gaps between elements of `b` found in `a`. `j`, `gl`, and `special` are integers with `j` less than `m`, `gl` is a non-negative integer, and `special` is True. If `ax` equals `mx`, then `special` is True, and `gl` remains unchanged. If `ax` is not equal to `mx`, then `gl` has been incremented by 1 before this condition was checked. If the loop did not execute due to `a` being empty or `m` being 0, `gaps` remains empty, while `j`, `gl`, and `special` are 0, 0, and False respectively.***
