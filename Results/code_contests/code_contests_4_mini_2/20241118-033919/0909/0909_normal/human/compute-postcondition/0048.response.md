The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is either 0 or updated based on conditions, so we cannot determine its exact value after this operation. The values of `gaps`, `i`, and `ax` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `gaps` includes `gl`, `sa`, `sb`, and `mx` remain unchanged, `j` is increased by 1, `i` is 1, and `ax` is the second element of the list `a`.

Output State: **`gaps` includes `gl`, `sa`, `sb`, and `mx` remain unchanged, `j` is increased by 1, `i` is 1, and `ax` is the second element of the list `a`**
