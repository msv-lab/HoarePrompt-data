Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y`, `b` are assigned values; `j` is either incremented by 1 if it was less than `m` and `ax` equals `b[j]`, or remains unchanged (potentially 0); `i` is 1; `a` is an iterable with at least 2 elements; `ax` is the second element of `a`. If `j` was originally less than `m` and `ax` matched `b[j]`, then `j` is incremented to 1 or 2; otherwise, `j` stays as it was.***
