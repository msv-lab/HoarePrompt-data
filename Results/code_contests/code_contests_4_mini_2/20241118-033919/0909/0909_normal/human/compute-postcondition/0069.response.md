According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. The loop will continue executing as long as there are more elements in the list `a` to iterate over. 

At the end of the last iteration, the index `i` was at a certain value, which we need to adjust to allow the loop to execute one more time. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `ax` must be set to the next element in the list `a`. 

Assuming that `a` has `n` elements, after the last iteration, if `i` was `n-1`, the loop cannot execute again. Therefore, we need to ensure that `i` is less than `n` and adjust accordingly.

Since `gaps` includes `gl`, `sa`, `sb`, and `mx`, and we don't have information to adjust those states directly, we don't need to modify them for the loop to execute again.

Thus, the necessary adjustments are:
- Increment `i` by 1
- Set `ax` to the next element in the list `a`, which is `a[i + 1]` assuming there is one more element.

State: **`gaps` is a list that includes `gl`, `sa`, `sb`, and `mx`, `i` is incremented by 1, `ax` is the next element in the list `a`.**
