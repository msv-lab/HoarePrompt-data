Postcondition: ***If `j` is less than `m`, the program prints -1 and the final value of `j` remains unchanged. If `j` is greater than or equal to `m`, the program does not execute the print statement, and the final value of `j` will be less than or equal to `m`, with `i` representing the index of the last element of `a` processed if the loop executed. If the loop does not execute due to `a` being empty or `m` being 0, `j` remains 0.***
