The code snippet `print(-1)` does not alter any of the existing variables `j`, `i`, or any other related state. It simply prints the value `-1`. The variables retain their previous states, but their values are unaffected by this print statement. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of the variables, along with the action performed.

Output State: **`j` is the count of elements in `a` that match the elements in `b` up to index `m`, where `j` is less than `m`; `i` is the index of the last element of `a` processed or undefined; and the value -1 is printed.**
