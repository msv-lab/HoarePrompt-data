The value of `gl` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `gl` is not specified, but it is reset to 0 before this increment, so after execution, `gl` becomes 1. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `gaps` is a list that includes `gl`, `sa`, `sb`, and `mx`; `j` is less than `m`; `gl` is 1; `i` is 2; `ax` is the third element of the list `a`; and `special` remains False.
