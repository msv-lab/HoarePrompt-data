The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is unknown, only that it is less than `m`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `gaps` is an empty list, `sa` is unchanged, `sb` is unchanged, `mx` is unchanged, `j` is increased by 1 (now `j` is greater than or equal to the previous value but still less than `m`), `gl` is 0, `special` is False, `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, and `ax` is the first element of the list `a`, which is equal to `b[j]`.

Output State: **`gaps` is an empty list, `sa` is unchanged, `sb` is unchanged, `mx` is unchanged, `j` is increased by 1, `gl` is 0, `special` is False, `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, and `ax` is the first element of the list `a`, which is equal to `b[j]`**
