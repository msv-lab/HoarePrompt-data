The value of `b` is assigned the value returned from `func_2()`, while `n`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y`, and `a` are unchanged as they are assigned from `func_2()` before this line. Therefore, the output state is: `n` and `m` are assigned values returned from `func_2()`, `x`, `k`, `y` are values returned from `func_2()`, `a` is the value returned from `func_2()`, and `b` is now the value returned from `func_2()`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are assigned values returned from `func_2()`, `x`, `k`, `y` are values returned from `func_2()`, `a` is the value returned from `func_2()`, and `b` is the value returned from `func_2()`**.
