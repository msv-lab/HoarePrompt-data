The code `gaps.append(gl)` appends the value of `gl` to the list `gaps`. Since `gaps` is initially an empty list and `gl` is 0, after execution, `gaps` will contain one element, which is 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `gaps` is a list containing 0, `sa` is unchanged, `sb` is unchanged, `mx` is unchanged, `j` is increased by 1, `gl` is 0, `special` is a Boolean value, `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, and `ax` is the first element of the list `a`, which is equal to `b[j]`.

Output State: **`gaps` is a list containing 0, `sa` is unchanged, `sb` is unchanged, `mx` is unchanged, `j` is increased by 1, `gl` is 0, `special` is a Boolean value, `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, and `ax` is the first element of the list `a`, which is equal to `b[j]`**
