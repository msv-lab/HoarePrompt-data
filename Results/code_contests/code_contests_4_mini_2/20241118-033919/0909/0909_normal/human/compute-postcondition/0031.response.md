The variable `special` is assigned the value `False`. This assignment does not affect the other variables (`gaps`, `sa`, `sb`, `mx`, `j`, and `gl`) since they remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `gaps` is an empty list, `sa` is unchanged, `sb` is unchanged, `mx` is unchanged, `j` is 0, `gl` is 0, and `special` is False.

Output State: **`gaps` is an empty list, `sa` is unchanged, `sb` is unchanged, `mx` is unchanged, `j` is 0, `gl` is 0, and `special` is False**.
