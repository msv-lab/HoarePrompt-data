The function `func_1` accepts the following parameters: `n` and `m`, which are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 200000; `x`, `k`, and `y`, which are integers such that 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n; `a`, which is a list of `n` distinct integers within the range 1 to n; and `b`, which is a list of `m` distinct integers within the range 1 to n. 

After executing the function body, the function handles multiple cases:

- **Case 1:** If `j` is less than `m`, the function prints -1 and the final value of `j` remains unchanged. If `j` is greater than or equal to `m`, the function does not execute the print statement, and the final value of `j` will be less than or equal to `m`, with `i` representing the index of the last element of `a` processed if the loop executed. If the loop does not execute due to `a` being empty or `m` being 0, `j` remains 0.

- **Case 2:** If the sets `sa` and `sb` are equal, the function prints 0 and returns None. If they are not equal, the function does not print or return anything, and the value of `j` remains unchanged. Furthermore, if `j` is less than `m`, the function prints -1 and the final value of `j` remains unchanged. If `j` is greater than or equal to `m`, the final value of `j` will be less than or equal to `m`, with `i` indicating the index of the last element of `a` processed, unless the loop does not execute due to `a` being empty or `m` being 0, in which case `j` remains 0.

- **Case 3:** If `gaps` is a list containing lengths of gaps, `j` is 0, `gl` is 0, and `special` is False. If `specialgap` is less than `k`, the function prints -1 and returns None. If `specialgap` is greater than or equal to `k`, the function does not execute any action and continues without returning any specific value.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept the specified parameters and handle multiple cases based on the values of `j`, the equality of sets `sa` and `sb`, and the value of `specialgap` in relation to `k`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, m, x, k, y, a, and b. It handles three cases involving printing values and managing the final value of j based on conditions related to the input parameters.**
