The variable `specialgap` is assigned the value of `gl`, which is currently 0 (as it was reset to 0). The other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `gaps` is a list that includes `gl`, `sa`, `sb`, and `mx`; `j` is now incremented; `gl` is 0; `special` is False; `gl` is appended to `gaps`; `i` is 2; `ax` is the third element of the list `a`; `specialgap` is 0.
