The value of `special` is assigned `False`, changing its previous value. The other variables (`gaps`, `sa`, `sb`, `mx`, `j`, `gl`, `a`, `i`, and `ax`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `gaps` is a list containing 0, `sa` is unchanged, `sb` is unchanged, `mx` is unchanged, `j` is increased by 1, `gl` is 0, `special` is False, `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, and `ax` is the first element of the list `a`, which is equal to `b[j]`.

Output State: **`gaps` is a list containing 0, `sa` is unchanged, `sb` is unchanged, `mx` is unchanged, `j` is increased by 1, `gl` is 0, `special` is False, `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, and `ax` is the first element of the list `a`, which is equal to `b[j]`**.
