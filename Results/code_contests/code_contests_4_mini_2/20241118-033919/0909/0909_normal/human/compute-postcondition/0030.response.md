The variable `gl` is initialized to 0. This does not affect any of the other variables, which remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `gl` while the other variables retain their initial state.

Output State: **`gaps` is an empty list, `sa` is unchanged, `sb` is unchanged, `mx` is unchanged, `j` is 0, and `gl` is 0**
