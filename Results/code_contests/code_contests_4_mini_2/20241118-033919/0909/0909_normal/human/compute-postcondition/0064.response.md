The variable `special` is assigned the value `False`. This assignment does not change the state of any previously defined variables: `gaps`, `gl`, `i`, or `ax`. Therefore, the output state is as follows:

Output State: **`gaps` is a list that includes `gl`, `sa`, `sb`, and `mx`; `gl` is reset to 0; `i` is 2; `ax` is the third element of the list `a`; `special` is False**.
