The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` is unknown, but it is stated that `j` is less than `m`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `gaps` is a list that includes `gl`, `sa`, `sb`, and `mx`; `j` is now incremented; `gl` is reset to 0; `special` is False; `gl` is appended to `gaps`; `i` is 2; `ax` is the third element of the list `a`.
