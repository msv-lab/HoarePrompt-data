The value of `gl` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `gl` is 0, so after execution, `gl` becomes 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `gaps` is an empty list, `sa` is unchanged, `sb` is unchanged, `mx` is unchanged, `j` is 0, `gl` is 1, `special` is set to True if `ax` is equal to `mx`, `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, and either `j` is greater than or equal to `m` or `ax` is not equal to `b[j]`. If `ax` is not equal to `mx`, then `special` remains False.

Output State: **`gaps` is an empty list, `sa` is unchanged, `sb` is unchanged, `mx` is unchanged, `j` is 0, `gl` is 1, `special` is set to True if `ax` is equal to `mx`, `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, and either `j` is greater than or equal to `m` or `ax` is not equal to `b[j]`. If `ax` is not equal to `mx`, then `special` remains False.**
