The value of `gl` is incremented by 1. The other variables `gaps`, `j`, `i`, `ax`, and `special` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `gaps` is a list that includes `gl`, `sa`, `sb`, and `mx`; `j` remains 0 or is updated based on conditions; `i` is 1; `ax` is the second element of the list `a`; `special` is set to True if `ax` is equal to `mx`, otherwise it remains unchanged; `gl` is increased by 1.
