The variable `ans` is assigned the value `0`. The previous values of the affected variables (`gaps`, `j`, `gl`, and `special`) remain unchanged, as this assignment does not impact them. Therefore, the output state is: `gaps` is a list containing lengths of gaps, `j` is 0, `gl` is 0, `special` is False, and `ans` is 0.

Output State: **`gaps` is a list containing lengths of gaps, `j` is 0, `gl` is 0, `special` is False, and `ans` is 0**
