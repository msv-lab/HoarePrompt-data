According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list `a` has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `gaps` is an empty list, and `j`, `gl`, and `special` are set to their initial values, which do not affect the execution of the loop. However, for the loop to execute, `i` must start at 0, and `ax` must be the first element of the list `a`. 

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `a` must contain at least 1 element, and the loop variables should be initialized as follows: `i` is 0, and `ax` is the first element of the list `a`.

State: **`gaps` is an empty list, `sa` is unchanged, `sb` is unchanged, `mx` is unchanged, `j` is 0, `gl` is 0, `special` is False, `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `ax` is the first element of the list `a`**
