The variable `specialgap` is assigned the value of `gl`, which is currently 0. The assignment does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the output state is: `gaps` is an empty list, `sa` is unchanged, `sb` is unchanged, `mx` is unchanged, `j` is increased by 1, `gl` is 0, `special` is True, `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, and `ax` is the first element of the list `a`, which is equal to `b[j]`, and `specialgap` is assigned the value 0.

Output State: **`gaps` is an empty list, `sa` is unchanged, `sb` is unchanged, `mx` is unchanged, `j` is increased by 1, `gl` is 0, `special` is True, `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `ax` is the first element of the list `a`, which is equal to `b[j]`, and `specialgap` is 0**.
