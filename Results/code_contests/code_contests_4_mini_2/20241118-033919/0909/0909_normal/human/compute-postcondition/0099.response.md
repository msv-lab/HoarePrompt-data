Postcondition: ***`gaps` is a list containing lengths of gaps, `j` is 0, `gl` is 0, `special` is False, and `ans` is computed based on the conditions. If `x < y * k`, `ans` is equal to the sum of `x * (g // k) + y * (g % k)` for each `g` in `gaps`, and if `gaps` is empty, `ans` remains 0. Otherwise, if `x >= y * k`, `ans` is equal to the sum of `y * g` for each `g` in `gaps`, where `j` is the index of the current element in `gaps`, and if `gaps` is empty, `ans` remains 0, with `j` still at 0, `gl` at 0, and `special` still False. The values of `x`, `y`, and `k` remain unchanged.***
