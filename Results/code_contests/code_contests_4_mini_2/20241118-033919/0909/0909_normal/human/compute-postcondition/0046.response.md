Postcondition: ***`gaps` is a list that includes `gl` (which is reset to 0 if `ax` is equal to `b[j]` and `j` is incremented, otherwise `gl` is increased by 1), `sa`, `sb`, and `mx` remain unchanged, `j` is incremented by 1 if `j` is less than `m` and `ax` is equal to `b[j]`; otherwise, `j` remains 0. The variable `special` is set to True if `ax` equals `mx`, and `special` is reset to False if `j` is incremented. `gl` is increased by 1 if `ax` is not equal to `b[j]` or if `j` is greater than or equal to `m`. The list `a` contains at least 1 element, `i` remains 0, and `ax` is the first element of the list `a`.***
