According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `gaps` list. Since `gaps` contains at least 1 length of gaps, it will execute at least once. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, which means it is the first iteration of the loop. For the loop to execute one more time, `gaps` must contain at least 2 elements, and the next element (which will be assigned to `g`) will be the second element in the list.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `gaps` must have at least 2 elements.
- `g` must be the second element in the `gaps` list.

The values of `j`, `gl`, `special`, and `ans` do not need to be adjusted based on the information provided. 

State: **`gaps` is a list containing at least 2 lengths of gaps, `j` is 0, `gl` is 0, `special` is False, `ans` is `ans + x * (g // k) + y * (g % k)`, `x` is less than `y` multiplied by `k`, and `g` is the second element in the gaps list**
