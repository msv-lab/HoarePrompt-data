The value of `gl` is reset to 0, but it is not explicitly stated whether it was previously holding a different value. However, since it is being reset to 0, we can assume that its previous value does not impact the output. The other variables and the list `gaps` remain unchanged, as the operation only modifies `gl`. Therefore, the output state remains focused on the variable `gl`.

Output State: **`gaps` is a list that includes `gl`, `sa`, `sb`, and `mx`; `gl` is reset to 0; `i` is 2; `ax` is the third element of the list `a`.**
