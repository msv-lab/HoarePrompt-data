The code `debug_print(gaps)` is intended to print the current state of the variable `gaps`. The variable `gaps` contains the lengths of gaps between elements of `b`, and it has the value of `gl` appended to it. The variables `j`, `gl`, and `special` remain unchanged at 0, 0, and False respectively. The output state reflects the unchanged values of `j`, `gl`, and `special`, and the current state of `gaps`.

Output State: **`gaps` is a list containing the lengths of gaps between elements of `b` (with the value of `gl` appended), `j` is 0, `gl` is 0, `special` is False**
