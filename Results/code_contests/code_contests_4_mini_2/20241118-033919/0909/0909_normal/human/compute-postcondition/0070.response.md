Output State: **`gaps` is a list that contains the lengths of gaps between elements of `b` found in `a`. If `j` is less than `m` and `ax` is equal to `b[j]`, then `j` increments, `gl` is appended to `gaps`, `gl` is reset to 0, and `special` is set to False. If `ax` equals `mx`, `special` is set to True. Otherwise, `gl` is incremented by 1. If `a` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `gaps` remains empty, while `j`, `gl`, and `special` remain 0, 0, and False respectively. If `m` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `gaps` remains empty, while `j`, `gl`, and `special` remain 0, 0, and False respectively.**
