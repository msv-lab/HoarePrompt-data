You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for describing the functionality of a Python function. You will be provided with the constraints and relationships between the input parameters, as well as the resulting output of the function based on these inputs. Your task is to organize this information and describe the functionality of the function. Please avoid describing how the function operates or details such as how local variables are initialized—only describe what parameters the function accepts and what it returns. If there are multiple return points in the function we will split them in Cases with an arithmetic counter and remember if one case is fullfilled none of the others are. You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: **functionality**.


Example1:
Parameter constraints and relationships: `number` is an integer.
```
def func(number):
```
Output: `number` is an integer. If `number` is even, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer1:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `number`. `number` is an integer. After executing the function body, if number is even, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `number`, and if `number` is even, it returns True. If `number` is not even, it returns False.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter number, returns `True` if `number` is even. If `number` is not even, it returns `False`.**


Parameter constraints and relationships: `age` is an integer.
```
def func(age):
```
Output: Case_1:`number` is an integer. If `number` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative; 
        Case_2: `number` is an integer. If `number` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult".
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `age`. `age` is an integer. If `age` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative. If `age` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult". Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `age`  and return if the person is a minor or an adult based on the age while handling wrong negative input values.


Your Task:
Parameter constraints: n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 200000; x, k, and y are integers such that 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n; a is a list of n distinct integers where each integer is in the range 1 to n; b is a list of m distinct integers where each integer is in the range 1 to n.
```
def func_1():
```
Output: Case_1: *If `j` is less than `m`, the program prints -1 and the final value of `j` remains unchanged. If `j` is greater than or equal to `m`, the program does not execute the print statement, and the final value of `j` will be less than or equal to `m`, with `i` representing the index of the last element of `a` processed if the loop executed. If the loop does not execute due to `a` being empty or `m` being 0, `j` remains 0.

Case_2: *If the sets `sa` and `sb` are equal, the program prints 0 and returns None. If they are not equal, the program does not print or return anything, and the value of `j` remains unchanged. Furthermore, if `j` is less than `m`, the program prints -1 and the final value of `j` remains unchanged. If `j` is greater than or equal to `m`, the final value of `j` will be less than or equal to `m`, with `i` indicating the index of the last element of `a` processed, unless the loop does not execute due to `a` being empty or `m` being 0, in which case `j` remains 0.

Case_3: *`gaps` is a list containing lengths of gaps, `j` is 0, `gl` is 0, and `special` is False. If `specialgap` is less than `k`, the program prints -1 and returns None. If `specialgap` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program does not execute any action and continues without returning any specific value.

Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?
