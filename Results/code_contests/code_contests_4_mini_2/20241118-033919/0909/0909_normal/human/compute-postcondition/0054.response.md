The variable `special` is assigned the value `True`. The previous values of `gaps`, `j`, `i`, and `ax` remain unchanged and are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the other variables and the new assignment to `special`.

Output State: **`gaps` is a list that includes `gl`, `sa`, `sb`, and `mx` remain unchanged; `j` remains 0 or is updated based on conditions; `i` is 1; `ax` is the second element of the list `a`; `special` is True**
