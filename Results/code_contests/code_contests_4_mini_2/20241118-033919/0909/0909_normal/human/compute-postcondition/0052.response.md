The variable `gl` is assigned the value `0`, which directly replaces its previous value. The other variables (`gaps`, `mx`, `j`, `i`, `ax`) remain unaffected by this assignment. Thus, the output state reflects the updated value of `gl` while keeping the others unchanged.

Output State: **`gaps` includes `gl`, `sa`, `sb`; `gl` is 0; `mx` remains unchanged; `j` is increased by 1; `i` is 1; `ax` is the second element of the list `a`.**
