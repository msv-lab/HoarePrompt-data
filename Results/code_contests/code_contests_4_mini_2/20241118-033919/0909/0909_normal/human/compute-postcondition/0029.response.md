The value of `j` is assigned to 0. The previous value of `j` is unchanged, but now it is explicitly set to 0. The states of the other variables (`gaps`, `sa`, `sb`, and `mx`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `gaps` is an empty list, `sa`, `sb`, and `mx` remain unchanged, and `j` is now 0.

Output State: **`gaps` is an empty list, `sa` is unchanged, `sb` is unchanged, `mx` is unchanged, and `j` is 0**
