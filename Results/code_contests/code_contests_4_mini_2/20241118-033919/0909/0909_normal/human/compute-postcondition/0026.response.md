Postcondition: ***If the sets `sa` and `sb` are equal, the program prints 0 and returns None. If they are not equal, the program does not print or return anything, and the value of `j` remains unchanged. Furthermore, if `j` is less than `m`, the program prints -1 and the final value of `j` remains unchanged. If `j` is greater than or equal to `m`, the final value of `j` will be less than or equal to `m`, with `i` indicating the index of the last element of `a` processed, unless the loop does not execute due to `a` being empty or `m` being 0, in which case `j` remains 0.***
