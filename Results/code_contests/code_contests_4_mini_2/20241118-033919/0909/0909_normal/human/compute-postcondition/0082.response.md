According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `gaps` list. If the `gaps` list contains at least 1 element, the loop will execute. At the end of the last iteration, `g` will represent the current element from the `gaps` list. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, the `gaps` list must have at least 1 element, and `g` should initially be set to the first element in the `gaps` list.

State: **`gaps` is a list containing at least 1 length of gaps, `j` is 0, `gl` is 0, `special` is False, `ans` is 0, `x` is less than `y` multiplied by `k`, `g` is the first element in the gaps list**
