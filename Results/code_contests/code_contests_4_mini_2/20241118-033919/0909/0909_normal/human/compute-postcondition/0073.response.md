Postcondition: ***`gaps` is a list containing the lengths of gaps between elements of `b` found in `a`. If `special` is True, then `specialgap` is assigned the value of `gl`, which remains unchanged. If `a` is empty or if `m` is 0, the loop does not execute and `gaps` remains empty with `j`, `gl`, and `special` all remaining 0, 0, and False respectively.***
