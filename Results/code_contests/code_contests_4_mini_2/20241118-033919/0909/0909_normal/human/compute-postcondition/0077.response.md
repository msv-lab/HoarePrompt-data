The statement `print(-1)` outputs the value `-1` to the console. However, it does not change the values of any variables in the program. The values of `gaps`, `j`, `gl`, `special`, and `specialgap` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes all initial variable values along with the fact that `-1` has been printed.

Output State: **`gaps` is a list containing the lengths of gaps between elements of `b` (with the value of `gl` appended), `j` is 0, `gl` is 0, `special` is False, `specialgap` is less than `k`, and -1 has been printed.**
