Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `x`, `k`, `y`, `b` are assigned values; `j` is either still 0 or is incremented to 1 based on the condition. If `j` is less than `m` and `ax` (the first element of `a`) is equal to `b[j]`, then `j` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `j` remains unchanged. The value of `i` is 0; `a` is an iterable with at least 1 element; and `ax` is the first element of `a`.***
