Postcondition: ***`gaps` is a list that includes `gl`, `sa`, `sb`, and `mx`. If `j` is less than `m` and `ax` is equal to `b[j]`, then `j` is increased by 1, `gl` is reset to 0, `special` is set to False, and `gl` is appended to `gaps`. If `ax` is equal to `mx`, then `special` is set to True. Otherwise, if the first condition is not met, `gl` is increased by 1, while `j` remains unchanged or is updated based on the conditions, and `special` retains its previous state. The values of `i` and `ax` remain unchanged, with `i` being 1 and `ax` being the second element of the list `a`.***
