Postcondition: ***`gaps` is a list containing lengths of gaps, `j` is 0, `gl` is 0, and `special` is False. If `specialgap` is less than `k`, the program prints -1 and returns None. If `specialgap` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program does not execute any action and continues without returning any specific value.***
