The value of `gaps` is updated by appending `gl` to it. The other variables, including `mx`, `j`, `i`, and `ax`, remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the addition of `gl` to `gaps`.

Output State: **`gaps` includes `gl`, `sa`, `sb`, and `gl` is added to `gaps`; `mx` remain unchanged; `j` is increased by 1; `i` is 1; `ax` is the second element of the list `a`.**
