The variable `ans` is incremented by the product of `y` and `g`. The values of `y` and `g` are not specified, but it's clear that `ans` will now reflect this addition. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `gaps` is a non-empty list, `j` is 0, `gl` is 0, `special` is False, `ans` is updated by adding `y * g`, and `x` is greater than or equal to `y * k`. 

Output State: **`gaps` is a non-empty list, `j` is 0, `gl` is 0, `special` is False, `ans` is updated by adding `y * g`, `x` is greater than or equal to `y * k**
