The function accepts no parameters and reads a line of input from the user. It splits the input string by spaces and converts each split component into an integer, returning a list of these integers. Edge cases include scenarios where the input is empty (resulting in an empty list) or contains non-integer values (which would raise a ValueError during conversion).
