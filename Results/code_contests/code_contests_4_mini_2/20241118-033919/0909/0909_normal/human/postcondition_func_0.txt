The function accepts parameters obtained from `func_2()`, which are assumed to be `n`, `m`, `x`, `k`, and `y`, as well as lists `a` and `b`. It counts how many elements of `a` match with `b` up to the index `m`, printing -1 if there are fewer matches than `m`. It then checks if the unique elements in `a` and `b` are the same, printing 0 if they are equal. The function calculates gaps between the matched elements in the lists and evaluates a special gap condition against `k`, printing -1 if it fails. Finally, it computes a value `ans` based on the gaps, printing it at the end. If `a` is empty or `m` is 0, certain checks and calculations will skip, leaving `j`, `gaps`, and `ans` potentially at their initial states. The function has no explicit return values, relying solely on printed outputs for results.
