n and m are integers representing the lengths of the sequences a and b respectively, where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; x, k, and y are integers with 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n; a is a list of n distinct integers where each integer satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n; b is a list of m distinct integers where each integer satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ n.
