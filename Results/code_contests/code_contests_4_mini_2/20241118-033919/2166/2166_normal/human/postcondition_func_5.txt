The function `func_6` does not accept any parameters. It sets a high recursion limit and stack size for threads before starting a new thread that targets the `main` function. The actual behavior and outcome of the function depend on the implementation of `main`, which is not provided in the annotated code. Therefore, the function essentially prepares to run `main` in a new thread without returning any specific value or result itself.
