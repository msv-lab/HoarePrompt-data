The function accepts two non-negative integers `n` and `r`, and returns the number of combinations of `n` items taken `r` at a time, calculated using the formula `factorial(n) // (factorial(r) * factorial(n - r))`. However, it does not handle cases where `r` is greater than `n`, which would lead to incorrect results or potential errors, as the factorial function for negative numbers is not defined. Therefore, the function may not return a valid output for such cases.
