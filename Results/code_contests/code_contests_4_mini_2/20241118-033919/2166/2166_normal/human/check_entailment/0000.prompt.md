You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those output hints describes certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.


Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_divisible(number1, number2):
    if number1 % number2 == 0:
        return True
''' 

Output hints for function1:  The function accepts 2 numbers as input, if number 1 is divisible than number2 then the function returns True.
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if is_divisible(n,i):
            return True
    return False
''' 

Output hints for function 2:  The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation: The program initially seems to do what the description says. Lets see if the hints also agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the program is incorrect. The output hints seem to agree with the program code and from their contents they reenforce our reasoning that the code is correct.
The function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints for function number 1 : The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The function initially seems to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the code is incorrec. Indeed they agree with the code and they show that the code might not always follow the program description. The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.


# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to find the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string.

Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def get_list_size(list):
    return len(list)
''' 

Output hint for function1:  The function accepts a string and returns the size of that string
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def find_Rotations(str1):
    n = get_list_size(str1)
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if str1[i:] + str1[:i] == str1:
            return i
''' 

Output hint for function 2: If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value and the variable n remains unchanged, holding the length of the string str1. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer i such that 0 < i < n, where n is the length of the string str1, and i represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. If no such rotation exists, then the function does not return a value.

Example Answer 3:
Explanation: The code initially does not seem to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and reenforce our belief that the code is incorrect. The hints do seem to agree with the code and they also show that the code does not always follow the program description. If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value, and the variable `n` remains unchanged, holding the length of the string `str1`. This behavior is correct as the specification states that the rotation count must be greater than 0. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer `i` such that `0 < i < n`, where `n` is the length of the string `str1`. The value `i` represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. However, the code iterates from `1` to `n-1`, meaning it does not include `n`. This omission is problematic because it fails to check the complete rotation case, where `i` could be equal to `n`. Consequently, the function does not meet the specification as it should return the rotation count up to `n` times. Therefore, it does not meet the specification.

Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: This is the easy version of the problem. The difference between the versions is that in the easy version all prices a_i are different. You can make hacks if and only if you solved both versions of the problem.

Today is Sage's birthday, and she will go shopping to buy ice spheres. All n ice spheres are placed in a row and they are numbered from 1 to n from left to right. Each ice sphere has a positive integer price. In this version all prices are different.

An ice sphere is cheap if it costs strictly less than two neighboring ice spheres: the nearest to the left and the nearest to the right. The leftmost and the rightmost ice spheres are not cheap. Sage will choose all cheap ice spheres and then buy only them.

You can visit the shop before Sage and reorder the ice spheres as you wish. Find out the maximum number of ice spheres that Sage can buy, and show how the ice spheres should be reordered.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of ice spheres in the shop.

The second line contains n different integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) — the prices of ice spheres.

Output

In the first line print the maximum number of ice spheres that Sage can buy.

In the second line print the prices of ice spheres in the optimal order. If there are several correct answers, you can print any of them.

Example

Input


5
1 2 3 4 5


Output


2
3 1 4 2 5 

Note

In the example it's not possible to place ice spheres in any order so that Sage would buy 3 of them. If the ice spheres are placed like this (3, 1, 4, 2, 5), then Sage will buy two spheres: one for 1 and one for 2, because they are cheap.
Functions with output description for each function:
Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return int(input())
''' 

 Output decription for function1:  The function accepts no parameters and returns an integer input provided by the user. However, if the user inputs a non-integer value, it will raise a ValueError, as there is no error handling to manage invalid input types.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return input()
''' 

 Output decription for function2:  The function accepts no parameters and returns the input provided by the user as a string. It does not handle or restrict the type or format of input, meaning any input (including invalid or empty input) can be returned.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    return map(int, input().strip().split(' '))
''' 

 Output decription for function3:  The function accepts a line of input, splits it into space-separated strings, and returns a map object containing the integers parsed from those strings. It does not handle cases where the input may not be valid integers, which could lead to a ValueError during conversion.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4():
    return map(str, input().strip().split(' '))
''' 

 Output decription for function4:  The function does not accept any parameters and returns a map object that converts the input from the user into strings, splitting by spaces. The output is not a list but a map object that can be converted to a list if needed. This means that the function does not return a list directly, which is a discrepancy from the annotations.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5():
    return list(func_3())
''' 

 Output decription for function5:  The function accepts no parameters and returns the result of calling `func_3()` converted into a list. If `func_3()` does not return an iterable, the behavior may lead to an error when trying to create a list from its output.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6():
    sys.setrecursionlimit(1000000)
    threading.stack_size(1024000)
    thread = threading.Thread(target=main)
    thread.start()
''' 

 Output decription for function6:  The function `func_6` does not accept any parameters. It sets a high recursion limit and stack size for threads before starting a new thread that targets the `main` function. The actual behavior and outcome of the function depend on the implementation of `main`, which is not provided in the annotated code. Therefore, the function essentially prepares to run `main` in a new thread without returning any specific value or result itself.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7(item):
    return item[1]
''' 

 Output decription for function7:  The function accepts a list `item` and returns the second element of the list. If the list contains fewer than two elements, it may raise an `IndexError` due to trying to access an index that does not exist.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_8(l):
    return sorted(l, key=getKey, reverse=True)
''' 

 Output decription for function8:  The function accepts a list `l` of distinct integers and returns the list sorted in descending order based on a custom sorting criteria defined by the function `getKey`.
Function number 9 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_9(n, m, num):
    return [[num for x in range(m)] for y in range(n)]
''' 

 Output decription for function9:  The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `m`, and a parameter `num`. It returns a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains the value `num` repeated `m` times. The function does not check for the type or content of `num`, which means it could be any type, not limited to lists of integers as suggested by the annotations. The function does not provide error handling for invalid inputs.
Function number 10 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_10(x):
    return x and (not x & x - 1)
''' 

 Output decription for function10:  The function accepts an integer `x` and returns `True` if `x` is a positive power of two; otherwise, it returns `False`. It also returns `False` for any non-positive integers (including 0 and negative values), as these cannot be powers of two.
Function number 11 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_11(n):
    return bin(n).replace('0b', '')
''' 

 Output decription for function11:  The function accepts an integer `n` and returns its binary representation as a string without the '0b' prefix. It handles both positive and negative integers, as well as zero, by converting them to their respective binary formats.
Function number 12 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_12(n):
    return [int(i) for i in str(n)]
''' 

 Output decription for function12:  The function accepts an integer `n` and returns a list of its digits as integers. It works for both positive and negative integers, but if `n` is negative, the negative sign will not be included in the output list. For instance, for `n = -123`, the function will return `[1, 2, 3]`.
Function number 13 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_13(n, r):
    return factorial(n) // (factorial(r) * factorial(max(n - r, 1)))
''' 

 Output decription for function13:  The function accepts two non-negative integers `n` and `r`, and returns the number of combinations of `n` items taken `r` at a time, calculated using the formula `factorial(n) // (factorial(r) * factorial(n - r))`. However, it does not handle cases where `r` is greater than `n`, which would lead to incorrect results or potential errors, as the factorial function for negative numbers is not defined. Therefore, the function may not return a valid output for such cases.
Function number 14 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_14(x, y):
    if x % y == 0:
        return x // y
    else:
        return x // y + 1
''' 

 Output decription for function14:  The function accepts two positive integers `x` and `y`. It returns the result of the integer division `x // y` if `x` is divisible by `y`. If `x` is not divisible by `y`, it returns `x // y + 1`, effectively rounding up the result of the division. There is no handling for edge cases where `y` could be zero, which would lead to a division error. Therefore, the function assumes that `y` is always a positive integer to avoid such errors.
Function number 15 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_15(x, y, p):
    res = 1
    x %= p
    while y > 0:
        if y & 1:
            res = res * x % p
        y = y >> 1
        x = x * x % p
    return res
''' 

 Output decription for function15:  The function accepts two positive integers `x` and `y`, and a modulus `p`. It calculates the result of `(x^y) % p` using an efficient exponentiation method. If `y` is 0 or less, it returns 1 as per the mathematical property that any number raised to the power of 0 is 1.
Function number 16 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_16(x, y):
    while y:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x
''' 

 Output decription for function16:  The function accepts two parameters, `x` and `y`, and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two numbers. If `y` is initially 0, the function returns the original value of `x` as the GCD. The function handles both positive and negative integers for `x` and `y` as well as the case where `y` is 0.
Function number 17 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_17(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i = i + 6
    return True
''' 

 Output decription for function17:  Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns `False` if `n` is less than or equal to 1. It returns `True` if `n` is 2 or 3. For `n` greater than 3, it returns `False` if `n` is divisible by 2 or 3. If `n` is not divisible by 2 or 3 and is greater than 3, it checks for divisibility by numbers starting from 5 up to the square root of `n`, returning `False` if `n` is divisible by any of those. If none of these conditions are met, it ultimately returns `True`, indicating that `n` is a prime number. The function does not explicitly handle cases where `n` is less than 1 or greater than 10^5, but it implies `n` should be positive and within that range based on the annotations.
Function number 18 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_18():
    sys.stdin = open('input.txt', 'r')
    sys.stdout = open('output.txt', 'w')
''' 

 Output decription for function18:  The function does not accept any parameters and redirects standard input to read from 'input.txt' and standard output to write to 'output.txt'. It does not perform any processing or return any values.
Function number 19 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_19():
    n = func_1()
    a = func_5()
    ans = 0
    i = 0
    j = n - 1

            ans += 1
    func_20(ans)
    func_20(*b)
''' 

 Output decription for function19:  The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` distinct positive integers. It rearranges the elements of `a` into a new list `b` in an alternating fashion, starting from the last element of `a` and then the first, continuing this pattern. After constructing `b`, it counts how many elements (if any) in `b` are local minima (i.e., less than their immediate neighbors) and stores this count in `ans`. Finally, it calls `func_20` with `ans` and the unpacked elements of `b`. If `n` is less than 1, `b` remains empty, and `ans` stays unchanged, leading to potential index errors if `n` is less than 3 during the counting loop.

First I want you to try to see if the program (including all the functions) does what the description says. Look at only the code and the description and make an initial assesment.Try to think of any edge cases that the code might not be handling.

Then I want you to see if the output hints agree with the code. Sometimes the output hints hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the output hints says are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to make a more informed decision and detrmine if the code is correct or not.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code.
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
