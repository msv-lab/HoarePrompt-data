Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns `False` if `n` is less than or equal to 1. It returns `True` if `n` is 2 or 3. For `n` greater than 3, it returns `False` if `n` is divisible by 2 or 3. If `n` is not divisible by 2 or 3 and is greater than 3, it checks for divisibility by numbers starting from 5 up to the square root of `n`, returning `False` if `n` is divisible by any of those. If none of these conditions are met, it ultimately returns `True`, indicating that `n` is a prime number. The function does not explicitly handle cases where `n` is less than 1 or greater than 10^5, but it implies `n` should be positive and within that range based on the annotations.
