The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `m`, and a parameter `num`. It returns a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains the value `num` repeated `m` times. The function does not check for the type or content of `num`, which means it could be any type, not limited to lists of integers as suggested by the annotations. The function does not provide error handling for invalid inputs.
