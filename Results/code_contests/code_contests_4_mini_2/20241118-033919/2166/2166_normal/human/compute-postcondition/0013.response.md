The variable `at_start` is assigned the value `False`. The values of the other variables `n`, `a`, `sep`, `file`, `args`, and `x` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables along with the updated value of `at_start`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `sep` is either a value from kwargs or ' '; `file` is either a value from kwargs or `sys.stdout`; `at_start` is False; `args` is a list with at least 2 elements; `x` is the second element in the list; and `at_start` is False.**
