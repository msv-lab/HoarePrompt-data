The value of `f` is toggled by applying the XOR operation with 1. The previous value of `f` can either be 0 or 1. If `f` was 0, it becomes 1; if `f` was 1, it becomes 0. The states of the other variables (`n`, `a`, `ans`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `b`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `a` is the value returned by `func_5(); ans` is 0; `i` is either 1 or 2; `j` is either `n - 1` or `n - 2`; `f` is either 0 or 1; `k` is 2; and `b` now contains the value `a[i]`, and `f` is toggled.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `a` is the value returned by `func_5(); ans` is 0; `i` is either 1 or 2; `j` is either `n - 1` or `n - 2`; `f` is either 0 or 1; `k` is 2; and `b` now contains the value `a[i]`, and `f` is toggled.**
