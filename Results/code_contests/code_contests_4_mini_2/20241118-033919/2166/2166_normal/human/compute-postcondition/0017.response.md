The code writes the string representation of `x` to the `file`. Since `at_start` is False, the `sep` has already been handled before this line. The value of `x` is determined from the `args` list, specifically the third element. Other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `sep` is either a value from kwargs or ' '; `file` is either a value from kwargs or `sys.stdout`; `at_start` is False; `args` is a list with at least 3 elements; `x` is the third element in the list, and `file` now contains the string representation of `x`.**
