The provided code snippet is a docstring that describes the purpose of a function or block of code but does not perform any operations or affect any variables. Therefore, the values of `n` and `a` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9**
