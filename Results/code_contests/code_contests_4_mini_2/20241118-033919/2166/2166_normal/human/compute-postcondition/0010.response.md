The `file.write(sep)` statement writes the value of `sep` to the specified `file`. Since `sep` is either a value from `kwargs` or a space (' '), and no other variables are modified, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `sep` is either a value from kwargs or ' '; `file` is either a value from kwargs or `sys.stdout`; `at_start` is False; `args` is a list with at least 2 elements; `x` is the second element in the list; and `sep` has been written to `file`.**
