According to the code, the loop iterates over the `args` list. For the loop to execute one more time, the `x` variable needs to be updated to the next element in the `args` list. Since `args` has at least 3 elements and `x` is currently the third element, it means that there are no more elements left in the list for `x` to take on a new value on the next iteration. 

Therefore, the loop cannot execute again with the current state of `args` because it has already iterated through the elements available. We need to adjust `args` to ensure it has more than 3 elements, so that `x` can take a new value.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `sep` is either a value from kwargs or ' '; `file` is either a value from kwargs or `sys.stdout` and contains the string representation of `x`; `at_start` is False; `args` is a list with at least 4 elements; `x` is the fourth element in the list.**
