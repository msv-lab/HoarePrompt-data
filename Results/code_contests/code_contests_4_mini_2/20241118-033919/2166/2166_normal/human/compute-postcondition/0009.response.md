According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `args` list. If the list has more elements to iterate over, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `args` is a list with at least 1 element. 

For the loop to be executed one more time, the `args` list must have at least 2 elements, and `x` should be the second element in the list. Since we do not know the specific current value of `x`, we can represent it as the next element in the list.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `sep` is either a value from kwargs or ' '; `file` is either a value from kwargs or `sys.stdout`; `at_start` is False; `args` is a list with at least 2 elements; `x` is the second element in the list**
