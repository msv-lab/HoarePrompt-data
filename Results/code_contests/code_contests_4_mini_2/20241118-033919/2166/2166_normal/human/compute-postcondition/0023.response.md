The `file.flush()` method is called, which clears the internal buffer of the file associated with `file`. The values of `at_start`, `file`, and `kwargs` are not affected by this operation. The previous states remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `at_start` is either True or False, `file` is updated with the value of `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')`, and `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is True, and the `file` has been flushed.

Output State: **`at_start` is either True or False, `file` is updated with the value of `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')`, and `kwargs.pop('flush', False)` is True, and the `file` has been flushed.**
