The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` could be either 0 or 1. Therefore, after execution, `i` could be either 1 or 2. The values of the other variables remain unaffected. The output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `a` is the value returned by `func_5(); ans` is 0; `i` is either 1 or 2; `j` is either `n - 1` or `n - 2`; `f` is either 0 or 1; `k` is 2; and `b` now contains the value `a[i]`.
