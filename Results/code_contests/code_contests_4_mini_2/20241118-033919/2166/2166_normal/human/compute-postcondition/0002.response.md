The variable `at_start` is assigned the value `True`. None of the other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the other variables alongside the updated value of `at_start`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `sep` is either a value from kwargs or ' ', `file` is either a value from kwargs or `sys.stdout`, and `at_start` is True**
