The code writes the value of `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')` to `file`. The `pop` method removes the specified key ('end') from `kwargs` and returns its value. If 'end' is not present in `kwargs`, it defaults to '\n'. 

Since it is stated that `args` is either a non-empty list or an empty list but does not affect `kwargs`, we cannot determine the exact value of `kwargs['end']`. However, we can conclude that `file` will be written with either the value of `kwargs['end']` if it exists or a newline character if it doesn't.

The state of `at_start` is not affected by this code, and `file` changes based on the value retrieved from `kwargs`.

Output State: **`at_start` is either True or False, and `file` is updated with the value of `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')`**
