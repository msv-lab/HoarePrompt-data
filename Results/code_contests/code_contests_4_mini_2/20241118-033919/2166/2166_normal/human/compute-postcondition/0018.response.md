The variable `at_start` is assigned the value `False`. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `sep`, `file`, `args`, and `x`) remain unchanged in this step. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `sep` is either a value from kwargs or ' '; `file` is either a value from kwargs or `sys.stdout` and contains the string representation of `x`; `at_start` is False; `args` is a list with at least 3 elements; `x` is the third element in the list.
