Postcondition: ***`b` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `j` is `n - 1`, `f` is 0 or 1 depending on the parity of `n`, and if `b` has at least three elements (which it cannot since it is empty), then if `b[i]` is less than both `b[i - 1]` and `b[i + 1]`, `ans` is increased by 1; otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged. However, since `b` is empty, this condition cannot be satisfied, and the program will not modify `ans`.***
