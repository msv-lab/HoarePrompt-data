The variable `b` is appended with the value of `a[i]`. The previous value of `i` can be either 0 or 1, which means `b` will receive either the first or the second element of `a`. The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `a` is the value returned by `func_5(); ans` is 0; `i` is either 0 or 1; `j` is either `n - 1` or `n - 2`; `f` is either 0 or 1; `k` is 2; and `b` now contains the value `a[i]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `a` is the value returned by `func_5(); ans` is 0; `i` is either 0 or 1; `j` is either `n - 1` or `n - 2`; `f` is either 0 or 1; `k` is 2; and `b` now contains the value `a[i]`.**
