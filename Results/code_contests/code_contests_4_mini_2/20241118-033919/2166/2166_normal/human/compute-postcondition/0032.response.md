Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `a` is the value returned by `func_5();` `ans` is 0; if `f` is initially 0, then `b` has a new element appended from `a[j]`, where `j` is decremented by 1 and `f` is toggled to 1; if `f` is initially 1, then `b` has a new element appended from `a[i]`, where `i` is incremented by 1 and `f` is toggled back to 0; in both cases, `k` remains 2. The values of `i` and `j` are adjusted accordingly based on the current state of `f`, ensuring that `i` is either 0 or 1 and `j` is either `n - 1` or `n - 2`, maintaining valid indices within the array `a`.***
