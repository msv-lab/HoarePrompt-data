The function `func_19` accepts a parameter `n`, which is a positive integer constrained such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\). It also accepts a parameter `a`, which is a list of `n` distinct positive integers, where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\). The function's output details were not provided, so I cannot specify the return value. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to accept a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of distinct positive integers. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n and a list a of n distinct positive integers.**
