Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `sep` is either a value from kwargs or ' '; `file` is either a value from kwargs or `sys.stdout`; `at_start` is False; `args` is a list with at least 3 elements; `x` is the third element in the list; if `at_start` is False, then `sep` is written to the file, ensuring that the program properly handles the case where the output is not at the start.***
