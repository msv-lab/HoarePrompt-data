According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variable `k`, which is iterating from `0` to `n - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is `2`. To allow the loop to execute again, `k` needs to be incremented to `3`. 

Since `n` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5`, and we know that `k` should be less than `n`, we can determine that for the loop to execute again, `n` needs to be at least `4`. 

No other states need to be adjusted since the values of `i`, `j`, `f`, `a`, and `ans` are not directly affected by the loop counter `k` in this context.

State: **`n` is at least 4, `a` is the value returned by `func_5();`, `ans` is 0, `f` is 0 or 1, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is either `n - 1` or `n - 2`, and `k` is 3.**
