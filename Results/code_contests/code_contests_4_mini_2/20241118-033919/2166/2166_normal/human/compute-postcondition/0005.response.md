The code `file.write(sep)` will write the value of `sep` to the output defined by `file`. The variable `sep` could either be a value from `kwargs` or a space (' '). The state of the other variables (`n`, `a`, `at_start`, `args`) remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `sep` is either a value from kwargs or ' ', `file` is either a value from kwargs or `sys.stdout`, `at_start` is False, `args` is a list with at least 1 element, and `sep` is written to `file`.**
