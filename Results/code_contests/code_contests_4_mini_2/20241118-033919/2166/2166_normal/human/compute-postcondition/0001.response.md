The code assigns values to the variables `sep` and `file` by popping them from the `kwargs` dictionary. If `sep` is not found in `kwargs`, it defaults to a space (' '), and if `file` is not found, it defaults to `sys.stdout`. The values of `n` and `a` are not directly changed by this operation, but the output will reflect the new values of `sep` and `file` based on the contents of `kwargs`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `sep` is either a value from kwargs or ' ', `file` is either a value from kwargs or `sys.stdout`**
