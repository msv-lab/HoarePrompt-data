The value of `j` is decremented by 1. Since `j` can either be `n - 1` or `n - 2`, the new value of `j` will be either `n - 2` or `n - 3`, respectively. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `a` is the value returned by `func_5(); ans` is 0; `i` is either 0 or 1; `j` is either `n - 2` or `n - 3`; `b` has a new element appended from `a[j]` or `a[i]` depending on `f`; `k` is 2.
