Postcondition: ***`b` is an empty list, `i` is 2, `j` is `n - 1`, `f` is 0 or 1 depending on the parity of `n`, and if `b[i]` is less than both `b[i - 1]` and `b[i + 1]`, then `ans` is increased by 1. However, since `b` is an empty list, accessing `b[i]`, `b[i - 1]`, or `b[i + 1]` will result in an index error, indicating that the condition cannot be satisfied and `ans` will not be updated. Thus, the program will not successfully execute without handling this edge case.***
