The function accepts two parameters, `x` and `y`, and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two numbers. If `y` is initially 0, the function returns the original value of `x` as the GCD. The function handles both positive and negative integers for `x` and `y` as well as the case where `y` is 0.
