The function accepts two positive integers `x` and `y`. It returns the result of the integer division `x // y` if `x` is divisible by `y`. If `x` is not divisible by `y`, it returns `x // y + 1`, effectively rounding up the result of the division. There is no handling for edge cases where `y` could be zero, which would lead to a division error. Therefore, the function assumes that `y` is always a positive integer to avoid such errors.
