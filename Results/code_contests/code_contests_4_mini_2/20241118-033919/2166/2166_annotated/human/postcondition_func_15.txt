The function accepts two integer parameters `x` and `y`, and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`. If `y` is initially 0, it directly returns `x`, as the GCD of any number and 0 is the number itself. If `y` is positive, it continues to swap `x` and `y` until `y` becomes 0, at which point `x` is the GCD.
