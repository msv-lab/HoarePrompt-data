The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns `False` if `n` is less than or equal to 1. It returns `True` if `n` is less than or equal to 3. For values of `n` greater than 3, it returns `False` if `n` is divisible by 2 or 3. For values greater than 3 that are not divisible by 2 or 3, the function checks for primality by testing divisibility with potential factors starting from 5, incrementing by 6, up to the square root of `n`. The function returns `True` if `n` is prime and does not return any value (implicitly returning `None`) if `n` is composite and greater than 3.
