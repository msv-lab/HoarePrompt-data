The function accepts integers `x`, `y`, and `p`, and calculates the result of \(x^y \mod p\) using an efficient method known as exponentiation by squaring. If `y` is less than or equal to 0, the function returns 1. If `y` is greater than 0, it computes the value based on the updates of `res` and `x` until `y` becomes 0. Therefore, the function can return 1 when `y` is 0 or negative, or the computed modular exponentiation when `y` is positive.
