The function accepts two parameters, `n` (a positive integer) and `r` (a non-negative integer), and returns the value of combinations C(n, r) calculated as n! / (r! * (n - r)!). However, if `n` is less than `r`, the function will not handle this case properly and may result in an incorrect calculation due to the factorial of a negative number. Therefore, additional checks for valid input conditions should be added to ensure that `n` is greater than or equal to `r` before performing the calculation.
