The function accepts an integer `x` and returns `True` if `x` is a power of two (including 0, which is treated as False), and returns `False` for any non-power of two values. However, it does not handle negative integers explicitly, meaning that negative values will incorrectly return `False`, which may not be the intended behavior.
