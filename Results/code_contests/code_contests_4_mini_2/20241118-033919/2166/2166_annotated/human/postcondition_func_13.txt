The function accepts an integer `x` and a positive integer `y`, and returns the ceiling of the division of `x` by `y`. If `x` is divisible by `y`, it returns the result of the integer division `x // y`. Otherwise, it returns `x // y + 1`, effectively rounding up to the next integer. The function assumes `y` is always positive, but does not handle cases where `y` might be zero, which would lead to a division error.
