The function initializes a new thread to execute the `main` function, but it does not accept any parameters or return any values. It sets the recursion limit and thread stack size to high values, allowing for more extensive recursive operations and deeper thread stacks if `main` utilizes them. However, it does not handle any potential exceptions or errors that may arise from starting a new thread.
