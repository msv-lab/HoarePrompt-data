The function `func_20` does not accept any parameters. After executing the function body, it processes a list of integers and returns a specific output based on the input conditions. The function's output is not explicitly stated, but it can be inferred that it operates on a list of integers and likely returns a result based on some computation or transformation applied to that list.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and returns a result based on processing a list of different positive integers.**
