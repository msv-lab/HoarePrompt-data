Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` different positive integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `sep` is either a value from kwargs or ' ', `file` is either a value from kwargs or sys.stdout, `at_start` is False, `args` is an iterable with at least 2 elements, and `x` is the second element in `args`. If `at_start` is False, then `file` will contain the string representation of `x` followed by `sep`. If `at_start` is True, the content of `file` remains unchanged.***
