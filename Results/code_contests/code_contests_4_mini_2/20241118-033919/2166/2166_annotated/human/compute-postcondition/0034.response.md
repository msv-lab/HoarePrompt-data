Output State: **`b` will contain elements from `a` arranged in an alternating pattern, starting from the last element of `a` and the first element of `a`. After the loop executes `k` times, `i` will be `k//2` (integer division), and `j` will be `n - 1 - (k + 1)//2`. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `b` remains an empty list. If `n` is 1, the loop executes once, and `b` contains the single element `a[0]`. If `n` is greater than 1, the loop executes `n` times, and `b` will contain all elements from `a` in the specified alternating order.**
