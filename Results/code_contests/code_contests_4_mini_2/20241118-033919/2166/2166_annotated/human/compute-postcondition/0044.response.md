Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `j` is `n - 2`, and `b` is a list containing at least three elements. If the element at index `i` of list `b` is less than both its previous (`b[i - 1]`) and next (`b[i + 1]`) elements, then `ans` is increased by 1. If `b[i]` is not less than both neighbors, `ans` remains unchanged.***
