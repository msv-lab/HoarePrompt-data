According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1` because of the range defined in the for loop (`range(1, n - 1)`). At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `n` is greater than 3, which means `n` must be at least 5 for the loop to continue executing. 

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 4. Additionally, since `i` needs to remain less than `n - 1`, `n` must be adjusted to be greater than 4. 

The states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be 4 to reflect the next iteration.
- `n` should be at least 5 to ensure the loop can execute again.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`n` is greater than 4, `i` is 4, `j` is `n - 2`, and `b` is a list containing at least three elements.**
