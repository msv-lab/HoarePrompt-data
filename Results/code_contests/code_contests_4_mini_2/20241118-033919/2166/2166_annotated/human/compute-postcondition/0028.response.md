The value of `f` is toggled using the bitwise XOR operation with `1`. This means that if `f` was `0`, it will become `1`, and if `f` was `1`, it will become `0`. The previous value of `f` is not specified but it is toggled. The states of the other variables (`n`, `a`, `ans`, `k`, `j`, `b`) remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the output state reflects the change in the variable `f`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_5()`, `ans` is 0, `k` is 2, `j` is `n - 3`, `b` now includes the element `a[j]`, and `f` is toggled.**
