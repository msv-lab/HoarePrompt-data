Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` different positive integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `sep` is either a value from kwargs or ' ', `file` is either a value from kwargs or sys.stdout, `at_start` is False, `args` is a non-empty iterable, and `x` is the first element in `args`; `file` now contains the string representation of `x`, and `at_start` is set to False.`**
