Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 2, `j` is `n - 2`, and `b` is a list containing at least three elements. If the element at index `i` in list `b` is less than both its preceding element (at index `i - 1`) and its succeeding element (at index `i + 1`), then `ans` is increased by 1. If `b[i]` is equal to or greater than either `b[i - 1]` or `b[i + 1]`, `ans` remains unchanged.***
