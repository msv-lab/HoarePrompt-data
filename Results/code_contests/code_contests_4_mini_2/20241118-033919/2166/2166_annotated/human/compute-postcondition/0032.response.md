Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_5()`, `ans` is 0, `k` is 2, and `j` is decremented to `n - 2`. If `f` was 0 before, `b` now includes the element `a[j]`, `j` is decremented by 1, and `f` is toggled to 1. If `f` was 1 before, `b` has one additional element from `a[i]`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `f` is toggled to 0. In either case, `b` includes an element from `a` based on the state of `f` before the execution.***
