To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the provided conditions and the loop statement:

1. The loop is defined with `for i in range(1, n - 1)`. This means:
   - The loop starts at `i = 1`.
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n - 1`.

2. For the loop to execute at least once, the range must contain values. Thus, the condition `n - 1 > 1` must hold true, which simplifies to `n > 2`.

3. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `b` remains empty. If `n` is 1, the loop also does not execute because `range(1, 0)` is empty. If `n` is 2, the loop still does not execute because `range(1, 1)` is empty.

4. The loop executes when `n` is greater than 2, providing `i` values of 1, 2, ..., up to `n - 2`.

5. At the end of the last iteration (if the loop executes), `i` will be equal to `k // 2`, where `k` is the number of iterations, which is equal to `n - 2`. Therefore, `i` will be `(n - 2) // 2`.

6. The value of `j` is defined as `n - 1 - (k + 1) // 2`, where `k` is the number of iterations. This will need to be calculated based on the value of `n`.

Given this analysis, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 2. The variable states need to be adjusted accordingly.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 1, `j` is `n - 2`, `b` is an empty list (to be filled during loop execution)**
