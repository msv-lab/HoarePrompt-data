According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `args` iterable. The loop will execute again if there are more elements in `args` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `x` was the third element in `args`, and since there are at least 3 elements in `args`, it implies that the length of `args` is at least 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be updated to the fourth element in `args`, and the loop must determine that `at_start` remains False.

Since `at_start` is already False, it does not need to be modified. 

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `x` must be the fourth element in `args`, and 
- the length of `args` must be at least 4 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` different positive integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `sep` is either a value from kwargs or ' ', `file` is either a value from kwargs or sys.stdout, `at_start` is False, `args` is an iterable with at least 4 elements, and `x` is the fourth element in `args`**
