According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `args`. For the loop to execute, `args` must contain at least one element. Given that `n` is a positive integer ranging from 1 to 10^5 and `a` is a list of different positive integers, there are no direct conditions on `a` that affect the loop execution. The presence of `sep` and `file` does not influence the loop condition either. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are related to `args`.

To ensure the loop executes, `args` must be a non-empty iterable. Hence, we need to set `args` to contain at least one element. We also need to establish the state of `x` at the start of the loop, which will be the first element of `args`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` different positive integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `sep` is either a value from kwargs or ' ', `file` is either a value from kwargs or sys.stdout, `at_start` is True, `args` is a non-empty iterable, `x` is the first element in args**
