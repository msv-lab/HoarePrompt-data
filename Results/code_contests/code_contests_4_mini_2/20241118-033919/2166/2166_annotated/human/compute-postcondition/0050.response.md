Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters directly, but indirectly depends on the output of `func_1()`, which provides a positive integer `n`, and `func_5()`, which provides a list `a` of `n` distinct positive integers. It rearranges the elements of `a` into a new list `b` in an alternating pattern starting from the last element and the first element of `a`. Then, it counts how many elements in `b` (excluding the first and last elements) are less than both their immediate neighbors. Finally, it calls `func_20()` twice: first with the count of such elements and second with the unpacked list `b`. If `n` is 0 or 1, the function handles these cases gracefully by not performing certain operations, effectively leaving `b` empty or containing a single element, respectively. **
