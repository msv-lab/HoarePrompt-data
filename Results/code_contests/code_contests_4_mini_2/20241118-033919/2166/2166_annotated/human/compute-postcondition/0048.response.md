Output State: **If n is 0, `b` remains an empty list and `ans` is unchanged; if n is 1, `b` contains a single element `a[0]` and `ans` is unchanged; if n is 2, `b` contains two elements and `ans` is unchanged; if n is greater than 2, `i` is `k//2`, `j` is `n - 2`, and `ans` is the count of elements in `b` that are less than both their neighbors, then `func_20(ans)` is called.**
