The value of `j` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `j` is `n - 2`, so after execution, `j` becomes `n - 3`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 1, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_5()`, `ans` is 0, `k` is 2, `j` is `n - 3`, `f` is toggled, and `b` now includes the element `a[j]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `a` is assigned the value returned by `func_5()`, `ans` is 0, `k` is 2, `j` is `n - 3`, `f` is toggled, and `b` now includes the element `a[j]`**
