The variable `at_start` is assigned the value `True`. The previous values of the affected variables (`n`, `a`, `sep`, and `file`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` different positive integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `sep` is either a value from kwargs or ' '; `file` is either a value from kwargs or sys.stdout; `at_start` is True.
