According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `args` iterable. If `args` has more elements, the loop will execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is the first element in `args`, and since `at_start` is set to False, `x` has already been processed. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `args` must contain at least one more element after `x`. 

As such, we need to adjust the state of `args` to reflect that it has at least two elements, and `x` should be set to the next element in `args`, which would be the second element.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` different positive integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `sep` is either a value from kwargs or ' ', `file` is either a value from kwargs or sys.stdout, `at_start` is False, `args` is an iterable with at least 2 elements, and `x` is the second element in `args`; `file` now contains the string representation of `x`.**
