According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `args` iterable. If there are more elements in `args`, the loop will execute once more. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is the second element in `args`, and `at_start` is False. For the loop to execute one more time, `args` must contain at least 3 elements, and `x` should then be the third element in `args`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` different positive integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `sep` is either a value from kwargs or ' ', `file` is either a value from kwargs or sys.stdout, `at_start` is False, `args` is an iterable with at least 3 elements, and `x` is the third element in `args`**
