The function accepts no parameters and returns a list generated by the function `func_3()`. The specific contents and behavior of the returned list depend entirely on the implementation of `func_3()`, which is not defined in the provided code. Therefore, while it is guaranteed that a list is returned, the characteristics of that list cannot be determined without additional information about `func_3()`.
