The function accepts no parameters and reads three lines of input, where the first line contains two integers (a1 and a2) and the second and third lines contain sequences of integers representing block lengths for two messages. It computes how many times the total lengths of the blocks from both sequences can be made equal by incrementing pointers through the two sequences. If either a1 or a2 is zero, the function does not perform any calculations and will print `0`. The final result printed is the count of equal total lengths found during the process.
