Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 100,000. If `s1` is greater than `s2`, then `p2` is incremented by 1, `s2` is updated to `s2 + int(q3[p2])`, and `s1` remains unchanged. If `s1` is less than or equal to `s2`, then `s1`, `s2`, `p1`, and `f` remain unchanged. Additionally, if `s1` ever equals `s2`, both `s1` and `s2` are reset to 0, and `f`, `p1`, and `p2` are each incremented by 1. Thus, the overall state reflects the values of `s1`, `s2`, `p1`, `p2`, and `f` after the execution of the program fragment.***
