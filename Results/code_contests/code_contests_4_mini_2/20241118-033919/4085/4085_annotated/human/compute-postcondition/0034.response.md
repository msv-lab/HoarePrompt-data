Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 100,000. If `s1` is less than `s2`, then `p1` is incremented by 1, and `s1` is updated to `s1 + int(q2[p1])`. If `s1` is not less than `s2`, then `s1`, `s2`, `f`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged. Additionally, if `s1` equals `s2`, both `s1` and `s2` are reset to 0, and the values of `f`, `p1`, and `p2` are each incremented by 1, but this condition is not explicitly handled in the if statement. Therefore, the overall state of the program reflects the updates based on the relationship between `s1` and `s2`.***
