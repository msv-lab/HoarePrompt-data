Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 100,000; `x1, x2, ..., xn` are lengths of the blocks in the first message; `y1, y2, ..., ym` are lengths of the blocks in the second message; the total length of the blocks in both messages is equal. If `s1` is less than `s2`, then `p1` is incremented by 1, and `s1` is updated to `s1 + int(q2[p1])`, while `s2`, `f`, and `p2` remain unchanged. If `s1` is equal to or greater than `s2`, then `p1` and `s1` remain unchanged, and `f` and `p2` also remain unchanged. Additionally, if at any point `s1` equals `s2`, both `s1` and `s2` are set to 0, `f` is incremented by 1, and both `p1` and `p2` are incremented by 1, but this occurs outside the condition evaluated in the if statement.***
