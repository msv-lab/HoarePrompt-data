Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 100,000; `x1, x2, ..., xn` are lengths of the blocks in the first message; `y1, y2, ..., ym` are lengths of the blocks in the second message; the total length of the blocks in both messages is equal; `q1`, `q2`, and `q3` are lists of strings obtained from the input; `s1` and `s2` are both equal and assigned the value of `int(q2[0])` and `int(q3[0])`, respectively; `f` is 0; `p1` is 0; `p2` is 0; `a1` is assigned the value `int(q1[0])`; `a2` is assigned the value `int(q1[1])`.***
