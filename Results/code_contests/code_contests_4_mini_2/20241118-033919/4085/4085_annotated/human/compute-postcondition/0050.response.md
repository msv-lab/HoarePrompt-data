Postcondition: ***`p1` is less than `a1` and `p2` is less than `a2`. If `s1` is greater than `s2`, then `p2` is incremented by 1 and `s2` is updated to `s2 + int(q3[p2])`, while `s1`, `f`, and `p1` remain unchanged. If `s1` is less than or equal to `s2`, then `p1`, `p2`, `s1`, `s2`, and `f` remain unchanged, with `p1` still less than `a1` and `p2` still less than `a2`. Additionally, the case where `s1` equals `s2` is implicitly handled by ensuring `s1` and `s2` remain unchanged, but it is noted that they would be set to 0, `f` would be incremented, and both `p1` and `p2` would be incremented by 1 if that case were to be addressed.***
