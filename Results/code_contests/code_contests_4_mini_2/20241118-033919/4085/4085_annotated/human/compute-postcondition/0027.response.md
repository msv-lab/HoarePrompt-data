The variable `s2` is assigned the value `0`. The previous value of `s2` is also `0`, so it remains unchanged. The other variables `n`, `m`, `s1`, `p1`, `p2`, and `f` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 100,000; `s1` is 0; `s2` is 0; `p1`, `p2`, and `f` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 100,000; `s1` is 0; `s2` is 0; `p1`, `p2`, and `f` remain unchanged.**
