Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 100,000. If `s1` is greater than `s2`, then `p2` is incremented by 1 and `s2` is updated by adding the value of `int(q3[p2])`. If `s1` is less than `s2`, `p1`, `s1`, `s2`, `f`, and `p2` remain unchanged, and if `s1` equals `s2`, both `s1` and `s2` are reset to 0, and the values of `f`, `p1`, and `p2` are each incremented by 1. Thus, the overall state of the program reflects these updates based on the relationship between `s1` and `s2`.***
