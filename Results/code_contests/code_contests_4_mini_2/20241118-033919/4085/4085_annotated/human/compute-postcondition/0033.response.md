The value of `s1` is updated by adding the integer value of `q2[p1]` to it, where `p1` is incremented by 1. The previous values of `n`, `m`, and `p1` are not specified, but we know that `p1` is now one greater than its previous value. The specific value of `s1` changes based on the new value of `p1`, which is not defined in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is: `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 100,000; `p1` is incremented by 1; `s1` is updated to `s1 + int(q2[p1])`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 100,000; `p1` is incremented by 1; `s1` is updated to `s1 + int(q2[p1])**
