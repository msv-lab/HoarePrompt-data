Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 100,000; `x1, x2, ..., xn` are lengths of the blocks in the first message; `y1, y2, ..., ym` are lengths of the blocks in the second message; the total length of the blocks in both messages is equal; `q1`, `q2`, and `q3` are lists of strings obtained from the input; if `s1` is equal to `s2`, then `s1` and `s2` are both set to 0, `f` is incremented by 1, and both `p1` and `p2` are incremented by 1; otherwise, `s1` and `s2` remain unchanged, and `f`, `p1`, and `p2` also remain unchanged.***
