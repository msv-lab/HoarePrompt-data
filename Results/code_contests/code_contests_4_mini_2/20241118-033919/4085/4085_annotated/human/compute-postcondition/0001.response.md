The code takes input from the user and splits it into a list of strings called `q2`. The initial state provides no specific values for `n`, `m`, the lists of integers `x1, x2, ..., xn`, `y1, y2, ..., ym`, or `q1`. Since `q2` is assigned the value of `raw_input().split()`, it will contain the elements from the user's input. Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100,000; the lengths of the blocks in the first message are a list of integers `x1, x2, ..., xn` where each `xi` is in the range 1 ≤ `xi` ≤ 1,000,000; the lengths of the blocks in the second message are a list of integers `y1, y2, ..., ym` where each `yi` is in the range 1 ≤ `yi` ≤ 1,000,000; the total length of the blocks in both messages is equal; `q1` is a list of strings obtained from the input; `q2` is a list of strings obtained from user input.**
