In the provided code, `s2` is being updated by adding the integer value of `q3[p2]`. The variable `p2` is incremented by 1 before this line, meaning its previous value is now one less than its new value. The values of `n` and `m` are not directly affected by this operation. However, since `p2` is used to index into `q3`, the value of `q3[p2]` depends on the updated `p2`.

Since the specific values of `s2`, `p2`, and the contents of `q3` are not provided, we can only describe the state in general terms. The current value of `s2` is incremented by the integer value at the new `p2` index in `q3`. 

Therefore, the output state will reflect the change in `s2` and the increment in `p2`.

Output State: **`s2` is updated by adding int(q3[p2]), `p2` is incremented by 1.**
