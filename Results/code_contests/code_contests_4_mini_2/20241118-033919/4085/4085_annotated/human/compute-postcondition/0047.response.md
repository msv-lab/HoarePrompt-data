Postcondition: ***`p1` is less than `a1` and `p2` is less than `a2`. If `s1` is less than `s2`, `p1` is incremented by 1 and `s1` is updated to `s1 + int(q2[p1])`, while `s2`, `f`, and `p2` remain unchanged. If `s1` is not less than `s2`, then `p1`, `p2`, `s1`, `s2`, and `f` remain unchanged, with `p1` still less than `a1` and `p2` still less than `a2`. Additionally, if `s1` equals `s2`, then `s1` and `s2` would be set to 0, `f` would be incremented, and both `p1` and `p2` would be incremented by 1, but this specific case is not directly handled in the current `if` statement.***
