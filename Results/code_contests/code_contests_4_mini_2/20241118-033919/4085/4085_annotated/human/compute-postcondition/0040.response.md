The variable `s2` is assigned the value `0`. The previous values of the affected variables are `p1` is less than `a1`, `p2` is less than `a2`, and `s1` is `0`. The assignment of `s2` does not affect the other variables. Therefore, the output state is: `p1` is less than `a1`, `p2` is less than `a2`, `s1` is 0, and `s2` is 0.

Output State: **`p1` is less than `a1`, `p2` is less than `a2`, `s1` is 0, and `s2` is 0**
