The variable `s1` is assigned the value of `0`. The initial states of `p1`, `a1`, `p2`, and `a2` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `p1`, `a1`, `p2`, `a2`, along with the new value of `s1`.

Output State: **`p1` is less than `a1`, `p2` is less than `a2`, `s1` is 0**
