The value of `p1` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `p1` is not specified, but it has been stated that `p1` has increased by 1 already. Therefore, the state of other variables remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 â‰¤ `n`, `m` â‰¤ 100,000; `s1` is 0; `s2` is 0; `p1` has increased by 2; `p2` has increased by 1; `f` has increased by 1.**
