The value of `s1` is updated by adding the integer value of `q2[p1]` to it. The value of `p1` has been increased by 1, which means it points to the next string in the list `q2`. The values of `n`, `m`, `f`, `p2`, and `s2` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State will reflect the updated value of `s1` along with the unchanged values of other variables.

Output State: **`s1` is updated to `s1 + int(q2[p1])`, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 100,000; `x1, x2, ..., xn` are lengths of the blocks in the first message; `y1, y2, ..., ym` are lengths of the blocks in the second message; `s2` is greater than `s1`, `f` remains unchanged, `p1` is increased by 1, `p2` remains unchanged.**
