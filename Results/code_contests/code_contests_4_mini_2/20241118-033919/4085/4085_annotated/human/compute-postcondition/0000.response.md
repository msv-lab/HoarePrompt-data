The code reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings, which is assigned to the variable `q1`. The previous values of `n`, `m`, and the lists of integers are not directly affected by this operation, but `q1` now holds the split strings from the input.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100,000; the lengths of the blocks in the first message are a list of integers x1, x2, ..., xn where each xi is in the range 1 ≤ xi ≤ 1,000,000; the lengths of the blocks in the second message are a list of integers y1, y2, ..., ym where each yi is in the range 1 ≤ yi ≤ 1,000,000; the total length of the blocks in both messages is equal; `q1` is a list of strings obtained from the input.**
