Postcondition: ***`p1` is less than `a1` and `p2` is less than `a2`. If `s1` equals `s2`, then `s1` and `s2` are both set to 0, `f` is increased by 1, `p1` is incremented by 1, and `p2` is incremented by 1. If `s1` does not equal `s2`, the values of `s1`, `s2`, `f`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged, with `p1` still less than `a1` and `p2` still less than `a2`.***
