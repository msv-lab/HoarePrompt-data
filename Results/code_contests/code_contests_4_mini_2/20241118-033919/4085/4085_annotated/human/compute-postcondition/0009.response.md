The variable `a2` is assigned the value of `int(q1[1])`. The variable `q1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, and the specific value of `q1[1]` is required to determine the value of `a2`. However, since the initial state does not provide the values in `q1`, we cannot specify the exact value of `a2`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 100,000; `x1, x2, ..., xn` are lengths of the blocks in the first message; `y1, y2, ..., ym` are lengths of the blocks in the second message; the total length of the blocks in both messages is equal; `q1` is a list of strings obtained from the input; `q2` is a list of strings obtained from user input; `q3` is a list of strings obtained from user input; `s1` is assigned the value `int(q2[0])`; `s2` is assigned the value `int(q3[0])`; `f` is 0; `p1` is 0; `p2` is 0; `a1` is assigned the value `int(q1[0])`; `a2` is assigned the value `int(q1[1])`.
