The code increments `p2` by 1. Since `p2` has already been increased by 1 in the initial state, the new value of `p2` will be the previous value plus 1 again. The specific previous value of `p2` is not provided, but it's known that it has already increased by 1, so it will now increase to its previous value plus 1. The values of `n`, `m`, `s1`, `s2`, `p1`, and `f` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 100,000; `s1` is 0; `s2` is 0; `p1` has increased by 2; `p2` has increased by 2; `f` has increased by 1.**
