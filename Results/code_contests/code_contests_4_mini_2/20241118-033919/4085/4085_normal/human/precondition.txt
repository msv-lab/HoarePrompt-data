n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5; the lengths of blocks for the first message are a list of integers x1, x2, ..., xn where 1 ≤ xi ≤ 10^6; the lengths of blocks for the second message are a list of integers y1, y2, ..., ym where 1 ≤ yi ≤ 10^6; the sum of lengths of blocks in both messages is equal.
