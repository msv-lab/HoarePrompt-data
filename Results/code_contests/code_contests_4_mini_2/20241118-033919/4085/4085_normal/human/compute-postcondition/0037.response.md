Postcondition: ***`p1` is less than `a1` and `p2` is less than `a2`. If `s1` is greater than `s2`, then `p2` is incremented by 1 and `s2` is updated to `s2 + int(q3[p2])`; otherwise, the values of `p1`, `p2`, `s1`, and `s2` remain unchanged. Additionally, if `s1` is equal to or less than `s2`, there is no change in any of the variables.***
