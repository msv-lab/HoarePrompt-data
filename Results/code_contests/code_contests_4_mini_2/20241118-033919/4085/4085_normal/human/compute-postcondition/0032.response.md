The value of `p1` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `p1` is unknown and the values of `p2`, `s1`, and `s2` are unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `p1` is now incremented by 1, while `p2`, `s1`, and `s2` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`p1` is incremented by 1, `p2` is less than `a2`, `s1` is unchanged, `s2` is unchanged**
