The value of `p1` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `p1` is 0, so after execution, `p1` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `s1` is 0, `s2` is 0, `f` is 1, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 0, `a1` is assigned the integer value of `q1[0]`, `a2` is assigned the integer value of `q1[1]`.

Output State: **`s1` is 0, `s2` is 0, `f` is 1, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 0, `a1` is assigned the integer value of `q1[0]`, `a2` is assigned the integer value of `q1[1]**
