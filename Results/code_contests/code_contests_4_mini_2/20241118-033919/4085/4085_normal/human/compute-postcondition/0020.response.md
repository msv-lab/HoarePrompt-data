Postcondition: ***`s1` is an integer corresponding to the first element of `q2`, and `s2` is the integer value of `q3[0]`. If `s1` is less than `s2`, then `p1` is incremented by 1, and `s1` is updated by adding `int(q2[p1])`. In this case, `s2`, `f`, `p2`, `a1`, and `a2` remain unchanged. If `s1` is not less than `s2`, the values of `s1`, `s2`, `f`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged, and `a1` is assigned the integer value of `q1[0]`, while `a2` is assigned the integer value of `q1[1]`.***
