Postcondition: ***`s1` is an integer corresponding to the first element of `q2`, and `s2` is an integer value of `q3[0]`. If `s1` is greater than `s2`, then `p2` is incremented by 1 and `s2` is updated to its previous value plus the integer value of `q3[p2]`. If `s1` is not greater than `s2`, the values of `s1`, `s2`, `f`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged, while `a1` is assigned the integer value of `q1[0]`, and `a2` is assigned the integer value of `q1[1]`. This covers the case where `s1` is equal to `s2`, ensuring that all edge cases regarding the relationships between `s1` and `s2` are addressed.***
