The function `func` does not accept any parameters and reads three lines of input, where the first line consists of two integers, and the second and third lines consist of lists of integers. It counts how many times the cumulative sum of the integers from the second input list equals the cumulative sum of the integers from the third input list.

1. It initializes cumulative sums `s1` and `s2` from the first elements of the second and third lists, respectively.
2. It uses two pointers, `p1` and `p2`, to iterate through the `q2` and `q3` lists.
3. A loop continues while both pointers are within the bounds of their respective lists. The loop increments the pointers and updates the cumulative sums based on their comparisons.
4. If at any point `s1` equals `s2`, it resets both sums to zero, increments a counter `f`, and advances both pointers.

The function prints the final count of matches found, which is stored in `f`.

However, the function lacks error handling for cases where the inputs may not conform to the expected format (e.g., if there are not enough integers in `q2` or `q3` to satisfy the pointers). Additionally, it does not handle negative integers or non-integer inputs, which could lead to exceptions.

Functionality: ** The function reads three lines of input, counts how many times the cumulative sums of two lists of integers (from the second and third input lines) are equal while iterating through them, and prints the count. It does not handle invalid inputs or potential exceptions that may arise from unexpected input formats. **
