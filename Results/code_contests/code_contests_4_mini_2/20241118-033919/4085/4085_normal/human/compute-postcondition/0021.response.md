Postcondition: ***`s1` is an integer corresponding to the first element of `q2`, `s2` is an integer value of `q3[0]`, and `s1` is greater than or equal to `s2`. The values of `s1`, `s2`, `f`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged. `a1` is assigned the integer value of `q1[0]`, and `a2` is assigned the integer value of `q1[1]`.***
