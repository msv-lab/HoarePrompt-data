The variable `s1` is assigned the value `0`. The previous value of `s1` is not specified, but it is stated that `s1` is equal to `s2`. This means that `s2` must also be `0` if `s1` is being set to `0`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `s1` is 0, `s2` is 0, `f` is 0, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `a1` is assigned the integer value of `q1[0]`, and `a2` is assigned the integer value of `q1[1]`.

Output State: **`s1` is 0, `s2` is 0, `f` is 0, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `a1` is assigned the integer value of `q1[0]`, `a2` is assigned the integer value of `q1[1]`**
