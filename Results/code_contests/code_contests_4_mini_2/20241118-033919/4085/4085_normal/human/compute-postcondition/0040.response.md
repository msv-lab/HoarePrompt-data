The variable `s2` is assigned the value of 0. The values of `p1`, `p2`, `a1`, `a2`, and `s1` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `p1` is less than `a1`, `p2` is less than `a2`, `s1` is 0, and `s2` is 0.

Output State: **`p1` is less than `a1`, `p2` is less than `a2`, `s1` is 0, and `s2` is 0**
