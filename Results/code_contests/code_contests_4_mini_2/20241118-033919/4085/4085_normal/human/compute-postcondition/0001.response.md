The variable `q2` is assigned the value of `raw_input().split()`, which takes an input string, splits it into a list of substrings based on whitespace, and assigns this list to `q2`. The state of the other variables is not affected. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment of `q2`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 10^5; the first message block lengths are a list of integers `x1`, `x2`, ..., `xn`; the second message block lengths are a list of integers `y1`, `y2`, ..., `ym`; the total length of the blocks in the first message equals the total length of the blocks in the second message; `q1` is assigned a list of strings from the input; `q2` is a list of strings from raw input split by whitespace.**
