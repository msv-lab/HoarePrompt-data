The value of `p1` is incremented by 1. The initial state indicates that `p1` is less than `a1`, but the specific value of `p1` is unknown. Therefore, after execution, `p1` will still be less than `a1`, but now it will be `p1 + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`p1` is less than `a1`, `p2` is less than `a2`, `s1` is 0, `s2` is 0, and `p1` is increased by 1**
