The value of `p2` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `p2` is unknown. The values of `p1`, `s1`, and `s2` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `p1` is less than `a1`, `p2` is now increased by 1, `s1` is 0, and `s2` is 0.

Output State: **`p1` is less than `a1`, `p2` is now increased by 1, `s1` is 0, `s2` is 0**
