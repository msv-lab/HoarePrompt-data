Postcondition: ***`s1` is an integer corresponding to the first element of `q2` and `s2` is the integer value of `q3[0]`. If `s1` equals `s2`, then both `s1` and `s2` are set to 0, `f` is incremented by 1, and both `p1` and `p2` are incremented by 1. If `s1` does not equal `s2`, the values of `s1`, `s2`, `f`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged. `a1` is assigned the integer value of `q1[0]` and `a2` is assigned the integer value of `q1[1]`.***
