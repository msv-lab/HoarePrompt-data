The variable `s1` is assigned the value `0`. The values of `p1`, `a1`, `p2`, and `a2` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the initial conditions along with the new assignment for `s1`.

Output State: **`p1` is less than `a1`, `p2` is less than `a2`, `s1` is 0**
