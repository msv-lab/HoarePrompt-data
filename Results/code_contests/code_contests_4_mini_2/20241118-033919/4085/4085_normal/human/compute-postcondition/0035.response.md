The value of `p2` is incremented by 1. The initial state indicates that `p1` is less than `a1` and `p2` is less than `a2`, but since the code only affects `p2`, the values of `p1`, `s1`, and `s2` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `p1` is less than `a1`, `p2` is now increased by 1, `s1` remains the same, and `s2` remains the same.

Output State: **`p1` is less than `a1`, `p2` is now increased by 1, `s1` remains the same, and `s2` remains the same.**
