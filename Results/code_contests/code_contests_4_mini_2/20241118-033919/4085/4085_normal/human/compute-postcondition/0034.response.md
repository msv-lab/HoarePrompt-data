Postcondition: ***`p1` is less than `a1` and `p2` is less than `a2`. If `s1` is less than `s2`, then `p1` is incremented by 1 and `s1` is updated to `s1 + int(q2[p1])`, while `s2`, `p2`, and `f` remain unchanged. If `s1` is not less than `s2`, the values of `p1`, `p2`, `s1`, and `s2` remain unchanged.***
