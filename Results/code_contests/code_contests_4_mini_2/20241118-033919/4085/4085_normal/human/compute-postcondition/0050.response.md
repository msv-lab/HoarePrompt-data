Postcondition: ***`p1` is less than `a1` and `p2` is less than `a2`. If `s1` is greater than `s2`, then `p2` is increased by 1 and `s2` is updated to `s2 + int(q3[p2])`, while `s1`, `f`, `a1`, and `a2` remain unchanged. If `s1` is equal to `s2`, then both `s1` and `s2` are set to 0, `f` is increased by 1, and both `p1` and `p2` are increased by 1. If `s1` is less than or equal to `s2`, the values of `s1`, `s2`, `f`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged.***
