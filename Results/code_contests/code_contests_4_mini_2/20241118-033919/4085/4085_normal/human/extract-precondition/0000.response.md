Precondition: **n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5; the first message block lengths are a list of integers x1, x2, ..., xn where each xi is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ xi ≤ 10^6; the second message block lengths are a list of integers y1, y2, ..., ym where each yi is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ yi ≤ 10^6; the total length of the blocks in the first message equals the total length of the blocks in the second message.**
