You are given a programming problem description and a program that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Program:
```
R = 3
C = 3
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
	tc = [[0 for x in range(C)] for x in range(R)]
	tc[0][0] = cost[0][0]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		tc[i][0] = tc[i-1][0] + cost[i][0]
	for j in range(1, n+1):
		tc[0][j] = tc[0][j-1] + cost[0][j]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		for j in range(1, n+1):
			tc[i][j] = min(tc[i-1][j-1], tc[i-1][j], tc[i][j-1]) + cost[i][j]
	return tc[m][n]
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Program:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
  res = tuple(set(test_tup1) & set(test_tup2))
  return (res) 
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
import math
def is_not_prime(n):
    result = False
    for i in range(2,int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            result = True
    return result
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Program:
```
import heapq as hq
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
  largest_nums = hq.nlargest(n, nums)
  return largest_nums
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Program:
```
def count_ways(n):
  A = [0] * (n + 1)
  B = [0] * (n + 1)
  A[0] = 1
  A[1] = 0
  B[0] = 0
  B[1] = 1
  for i in range(2, n+1):
    A[i] = A[i - 2] + 2 * B[i - 1]
    B[i] = A[i - 1] + B[i - 2]
  return A[n] 
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Your task

Problem description: Polycarp is mad about coding, that is why he writes Sveta encoded messages. He calls the median letter in a word the letter which is in the middle of the word. If the word's length is even, the median letter is the left of the two middle letters. In the following examples, the median letter is highlighted: contest, info. If the word consists of single letter, then according to above definition this letter is the median letter. 

Polycarp encodes each word in the following way: he writes down the median letter of the word, then deletes it and repeats the process until there are no letters left. For example, he encodes the word volga as logva.

You are given an encoding s of some word, your task is to decode it. 

Input

The first line contains a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000) — the length of the encoded word.

The second line contains the string s of length n consisting of lowercase English letters — the encoding.

Output

Print the word that Polycarp encoded.

Examples

Input

5
logva


Output

volga


Input

2
no


Output

no


Input

4
abba


Output

baba

Note

In the first example Polycarp encoded the word volga. At first, he wrote down the letter l from the position 3, after that his word looked like voga. After that Polycarp wrote down the letter o from the position 2, his word became vga. Then Polycarp wrote down the letter g which was at the second position, the word became va. Then he wrote down the letter v, then the letter a. Thus, the encoding looked like logva.

In the second example Polycarp encoded the word no. He wrote down the letter n, the word became o, and he wrote down the letter o. Thus, in this example, the word and its encoding are the same.

In the third example Polycarp encoded the word baba. At first, he wrote down the letter a, which was at the position 2, after that the word looked like bba. Then he wrote down the letter b, which was at the position 2, his word looked like ba. After that he wrote down the letter b, which was at the position 1, the word looked like a, and he wrote down that letter a. Thus, the encoding is abba.
Program:
```

def func():
    n = input()
    s = list(raw_input())
    ns = ''
    i = n - 2
    while i >= 0:
        ns += s[i]
        i -= 2
    if n % 2:
        i = 0
    else:
        i = 1
    while i < n:
        ns += s[i]
        i += 2
    print(ns)
```
