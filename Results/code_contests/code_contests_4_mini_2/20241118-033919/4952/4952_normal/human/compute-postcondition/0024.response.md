According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than `i + 2`, which means that `n` is definitely greater than `i` since `i` has been increased by 2. Therefore, `i` is currently less than `n`, and the loop can execute one more time without any adjustments needed.

State: **`n` is greater than `i + 2`, `ns` is modified to include `s[i]`, and `i` is increased by 2**
