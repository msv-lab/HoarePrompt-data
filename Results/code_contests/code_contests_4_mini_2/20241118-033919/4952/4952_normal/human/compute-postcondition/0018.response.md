Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, and `ns` is a string formed by appending every second character from the list `s` starting from index `i` down to 0. If `n` is odd, then `i` is 0; if `n` is even, then `i` is 1. In both cases, `i` will be less than -1 after the loop ends. If `n` is negative or undefined, the loop does not execute, and `ns` remains an empty string.***
