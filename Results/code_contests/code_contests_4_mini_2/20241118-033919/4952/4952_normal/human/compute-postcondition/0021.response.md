To determine whether the loop can execute one more time, I need to analyze the condition `i < n`. 

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` has been increased by 2, so its current value is `i + 2`.
- `n` is an integer.

For the loop to execute again, it is necessary that `i + 2 < n`. This means that we must adjust `n` to be greater than `i + 2`. 

Since we are given that `n` is an integer but no specific values are provided, we need to ensure that `n` is strictly greater than the adjusted value of `i`. Therefore, we can conclude that:

State: **`n` is greater than `i + 2`**
