The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n`, which is a positive integer constrained by the condition 1 ≤ n ≤ 2000, and `s`, which is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase English letters. The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on their values. However, the specific output behavior is not detailed in the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase English letters.**
