The value of `i` is incremented by 2. The initial state indicates that `n` is greater than `i + 2`, but we do not have the specific value of `i`. The state of `ns` is not affected by this operation, and none of the other variables are impacted. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than `i + 2`, `ns` is modified to include `s[i]`, and `i` is increased by 2.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `i + 2`, `ns` is modified to include `s[i]`, and `i` is increased by 2**
