The value of `i` is incremented by 2. The previous value of `i` is unknown, but it affects the string `ns`, which was formed by appending every second character from the list `s` starting from index `i` down to 0. Since `i` is updated, it may change which characters are appended to `ns` in subsequent operations. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer, `ns` is the string formed by appending every second character from the list `s` starting from the previous value of `i` down to 0, and `i` is increased by 2.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `ns` is the string formed by appending every second character from the list `s` starting from the previous value of `i` down to 0, and `i` is increased by 2**
