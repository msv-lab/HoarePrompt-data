The variable `ns` is updated by appending the character `s[i]` to it. The value of `s` is derived from the string input `n`, and since `i` is at least 2, it ensures that `s[i]` is a valid character in the list. The states of `n` and `s` remain unchanged, but `ns` will have an additional character appended to it. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a string input value, `s` is a list of characters derived from that string input, and `ns` is the original `ns` with the character `s[i]` appended.

Output State: **`n` is a string input value, `s` is a list of characters derived from that string input, and `ns` is the original `ns` with the character `s[i]` appended.**
