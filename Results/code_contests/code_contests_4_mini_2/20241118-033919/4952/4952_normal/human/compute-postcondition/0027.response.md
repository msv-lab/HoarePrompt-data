According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, we have `n` is greater than `i + 2`, and `i` has been increased by 2. 

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `i` remains less than `n`. Since `n` is currently greater than `i + 2`, it follows that `i` is less than `n`, and therefore the loop can execute again without needing any adjustments.

State: **`n` is greater than `i + 2`, `ns` is modified to include `s[i]`, and `i` is increased by 2**
