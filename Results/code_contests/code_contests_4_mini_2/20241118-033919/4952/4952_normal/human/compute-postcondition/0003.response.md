The value of `n` is a string input, and the operation `n - 2` is invalid because you cannot subtract an integer from a string. Therefore, the values of the variables do not change, and the output state is: `n` is a string input value, `s` is a list of characters derived from that string input, `ns` is an empty string, and the operation is invalid.

Output State: **`n` is a string input value, `s` is a list of characters derived from that string input, `ns` is an empty string, and the operation is invalid.**
