The operation `ns += s[i]` attempts to concatenate the element at index `i` of the list `s` to the string `ns`. However, the value of `i` is not provided and if `i` is out of range for the list `s`, the operation would be invalid. Since the operation is invalid due to the lack of a valid index `i`, no changes can occur in the state of the variables.

Therefore, the output state remains unchanged from the initial state. 

Output State: **`n` is a string input value, `s` is a list of characters derived from that string input, `ns` is an empty string, and the operation is invalid.**
