The value of `i` is incremented by 2. Since the previous value of `i` is unknown, after execution, `i` is increased by 2. The other variables' states are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than `i + 2`, `ns` is modified to include `s[i]`, and `i` is increased by 2.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `i + 2`, `ns` is modified to include `s[i]`, and `i` is increased by 2**
