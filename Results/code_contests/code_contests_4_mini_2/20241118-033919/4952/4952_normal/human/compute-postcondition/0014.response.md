Postcondition: ***`i` is a non-negative integer, `ns` is a string formed by appending every second character from the list `s` starting from the character at index `i` down to 0, and `n` is an integer that is odd. After the loop, `i` will be less than -1. If `i` was initially negative or not defined, `ns` remains an empty string.***
