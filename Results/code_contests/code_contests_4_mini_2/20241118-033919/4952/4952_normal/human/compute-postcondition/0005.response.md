The operation `i -= 2` attempts to decrement the value of `i` by 2. However, the initial state does not provide a value for `i`, which means its previous value is unknown. Additionally, since `i` is not defined in the initial state, the operation is considered invalid. Therefore, no changes occur to the existing variables.

Output State: **`n` is a string input value, `s` is a list of characters derived from that string input, `ns` is an empty string, and the operation is invalid with `i` not defined.**
