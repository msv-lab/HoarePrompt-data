The variable `i` is assigned the value `1`. The other variables `ns` and `n` remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is `i` is 1, `ns` is the string formed by appending every second character from the list `s` starting from the character at index `i` down to 0, and `n` is an even integer.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `ns` is the string formed by appending every second character from the list `s` starting from the character at index `i` down to 0, and `n` is an even integer**
