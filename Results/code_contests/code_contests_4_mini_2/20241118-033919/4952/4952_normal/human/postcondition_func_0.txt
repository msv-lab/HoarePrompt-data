The function accepts an integer `n` from user input and a string `s` of length `n`. It constructs a new string `ns` by appending every second character from `s`, first in reverse order starting from index `n-2` to 0, and then in forward order starting from index `0` or `1` depending on whether `n` is odd or even. The function does not handle cases where `n` is less than 2 or if the input is invalid, potentially leading to runtime errors. The final constructed string `ns` is printed.
