The variable `i` is assigned the value `0`. The previous state of `i` is that it is less than `0`, so now it changes from a negative value to `0`. The states of the other variables, `n` and `ns`, are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer, `n` is odd, `ns` contains every other character from the string `n` starting from the last character, `i` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `n` is odd, `ns` contains every other character from the string `n` starting from the last character, `i` is 0**
