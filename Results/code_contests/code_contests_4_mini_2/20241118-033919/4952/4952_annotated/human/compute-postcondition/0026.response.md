The value of `i` is incremented by 2. Since `i` is either 4 or 5, the new possible values for `i` after execution are 6 or 7. The values of `n` and `ns` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 5; `i` is either 6 or 7; `ns` is updated to include the character at index `i` from the string `s`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 5; `i` is either 6 or 7; `ns` is updated to include the character at index `i` from the string `s**
