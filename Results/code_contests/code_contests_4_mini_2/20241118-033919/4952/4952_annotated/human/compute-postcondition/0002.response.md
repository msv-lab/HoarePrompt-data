The value of `ns` is assigned an empty string. The variables `n` and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, and `ns` is an empty string.

Output State: **`n` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, and `ns` is an empty string**
