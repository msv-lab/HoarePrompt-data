Functionality: ** The function accepts user input for an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n`, and it constructs a new string `ns` by concatenating every other character from `s`, first from the end of the string and then from the beginning, depending on whether `n` is odd or even. However, if `n` is not properly initialized as an integer (for example, if a string is provided), the function will not execute the loops as expected, resulting in `ns` remaining an empty string. The function ultimately prints the constructed string `ns`. **
