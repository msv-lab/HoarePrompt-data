The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in the provided definition. However, it is stated that `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\), and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase English letters. 

Since there is no return statement or specific output behavior provided, we cannot determine the exact output of the function. Therefore, we can only note the input constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n`, which is a positive integer between 1 and 2000, and a string `s`, which is of length `n` consisting of lowercase English letters.**
