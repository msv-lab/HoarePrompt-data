The value of `i` is incremented by 2. Since `i` can either be 0 or 1, after the execution, `i` will be either 2 or 3. The values of `n` and `ns` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer; `i` is either 2 or 3; `ns` is either a string containing every other character from `n` starting from the last character (if `n` is odd) or an empty string (if `n` is even).

Output State: **`n` is an integer; `i` is either 2 or 3; `ns` is either a string containing every other character from `n` starting from the last character (if `n` is odd) or an empty string (if `n` is even)**
