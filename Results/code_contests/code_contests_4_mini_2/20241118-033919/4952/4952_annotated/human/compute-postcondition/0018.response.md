Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer. If `n` is odd, then `i` is set to 0 and `ns` contains every other character from the string `n` starting from the last character. If `n` is even, then `i` is set to 1 and `ns` remains an empty string. Additionally, if `n` is not properly initialized due to being a string, the loop does not execute, and `ns` remains an empty string while `i` is unaffected.***
