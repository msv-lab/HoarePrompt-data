The value of `i` is incremented by 2. Since `i` can be either 2 or 3, the new value of `i` will be either 4 or 5. The states of the other variables (`n` and `ns`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 3, `i` is either 4 or 5, and `ns` is updated to include the character at index `i` from the string `s`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is either 4 or 5, and `ns` is updated to include the character at index `i` from the string `s`**.
