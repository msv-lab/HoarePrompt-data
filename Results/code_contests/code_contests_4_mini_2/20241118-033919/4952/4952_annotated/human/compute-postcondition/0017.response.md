The value of `i` is assigned the value of `1`. The previous value of `i` was less than `0`, but it is now updated to `1`. The values of `n` and `ns` remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an even integer, `ns` is an empty string, `i` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer, `ns` is an empty string, `i` is 1**
