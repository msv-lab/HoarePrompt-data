The value of `i` is decremented by 2. Since the previous value of `i` is 0, the new value of `i` will be -2. The values of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `ns` is the first character of `n`, and `i` is -2.

Output State: **`n` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `ns` is the first character of `n`, `i` is -2**
