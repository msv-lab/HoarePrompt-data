According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than or equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is -2. This means that for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to at least 0. No other states need to be adjusted as they do not influence the execution of the loop.

State: **`n` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `ns` is the first character of `n`, `i` is 0**
