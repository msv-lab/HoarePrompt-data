Correctness: **False**

The provided program is supposed to determine if there exists a valid order of letters such that the names are sorted lexicographically according to that order. However, upon closely examining the program, there are several issues that lead to its incorrectness.

1. **Improper Handling of Input**: The program reads input using `raw_input()` and `xrange()`, which is not compatible with Python 3. It should be using `input()` and `range()` instead.

2. **Logic Flaw in Determining Order**: The logic that constructs the order of letters from the names can fail to create a valid order due to potential cycles in the directed graph constructed by the letters. The program checks for cycles in a limited way but does not implement a robust method for topological sorting which is necessary in this context.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle cases where the names are prefixes of one another correctly. For example, if the input is:
   ```
   2
   ab
   abc
   ```
   The output should be a valid ordering that respects that `ab` comes before `abc`. However, the program could wrongly produce an output based on its logic for checking conditions.

4. **Output Format**: The program is expected to output a permutation of characters 'a' to 'z' or "Impossible". There are scenarios where the program might not generate all characters correctly if the sorting logic fails or if it encounters an invalid state.

Overall, due to these inconsistencies and the lack of handling for certain cases, the program cannot be guaranteed to always produce the correct output for all potential inputs, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.

Thus, the final assessment is that the program is not correct for the problem description.
