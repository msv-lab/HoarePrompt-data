The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'Impossible'. The values of the variables do not change as this is simply an output operation. Therefore, the output state is that `n` remains within the range of 1 to 100, but the print statement produces the output 'Impossible'.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the output is 'Impossible'**
