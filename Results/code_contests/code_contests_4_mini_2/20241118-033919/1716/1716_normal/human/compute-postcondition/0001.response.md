The code executes the `exit(0)` statement, which terminates the program immediately. The state of the variables does not change, but the program stops execution. The output state reflects that the program has exited. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the output is 'Impossible', and the program exits.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the output is 'Impossible', and the program exits.**
