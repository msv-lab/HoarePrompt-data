Correctness: **False**

The provided program only contains a function `func_1()` that prints "Impossible" and exits the program. It does not implement any logic to determine whether there exists an order of letters in the Latin alphabet that would make the names sorted lexicographically. 

Given the problem description, the function is supposed to analyze the list of names and derive a possible ordering of the letters. However, the function does not perform any of the required checks, comparisons, or calculations to ascertain if such an order is possible or to generate a valid order.

For instance, if provided with the input:

```
3
rivest
shamir
adleman
```

The correct output should be a lexicographical order of characters or "Impossible". Instead, the program will simply output "Impossible" without any context or reasoning.

Since the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description in any case, it is deemed incorrect.
