The code prints the string 'Impossible', which does not change any of the variables in the initial state. The values of `n` and any names remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, and each name is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with length between 1 and 100, with all names being distinct, and the output is 'Impossible'.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, and each name is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with length between 1 and 100, with all names being distinct; output is 'Impossible'**
