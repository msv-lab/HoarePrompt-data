The code `exit(0)` terminates the program immediately, and no variables are changed. Therefore, the output state reflects the current state of the variables and indicates that the program has exited. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, and each name is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with length between 1 and 100, with all names being distinct; output is 'Impossible', and the program exits.**
