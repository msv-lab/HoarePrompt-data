The provided program attempts to create a frame of a specified height (H) and width (W) using '#' for the borders and '.' for the inside. However, there are several issues with the implementation that prevent it from correctly fulfilling the requirements of the problem description.

### Issues with the Code:
1. **Incorrect character printing**: The program prints a `#` for every position on the borders, but it does not correctly handle the placement of `.` for inner positions. The condition for printing `.` is not properly implemented.

2. **Print formatting**: The `print` statement is used without parentheses, and it does not print a newline after each row of the frame. This leads to incorrect output formatting because the rows will not be separated properly.

3. **Edge case handling**: The program does not handle cases where height (H) and width (W) are less than 3 properly, as the constraints allow only values between 3 and 300. The program should not execute if H or W are less than the constraints, but it does not check that.

### Example where the program fails:
- Input: `3 4`
- Expected Output:
    ```
    ####
    #..#
    ####
    ```
- Actual Output from the program (due to incorrect looping and printing logic):
    ```
    #
    #
    #
    #
    ```

This output does not match the expected output, as it does not properly create the frame structure.

### Conclusion:
Due to the incorrect printing logic and failure to handle the required output formatting, the program does not fulfill the problem description correctly.

Correctness: **False**
