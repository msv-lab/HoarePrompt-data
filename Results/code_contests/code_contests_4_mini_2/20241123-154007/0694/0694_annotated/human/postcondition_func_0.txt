The function accepts pairs of integers `h` and `w` representing the dimensions of a grid and continuously prints a rectangular grid outline with `#` on the borders and `.` inside, until the input pair (0, 0) is encountered. If either `h` or `w` is less than 3, or if both are zero, the function will not execute any grid printing and will terminate without producing output. The function does not impose any constraints on the maximum values of `h` and `w`, even though the annotations suggest that they should be within the range of 3 to 300.
