According to the code, the loop executes based on the variable `j` and the upper limit defined by `w`. The loop continues as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `w` is greater than 0, which means the loop has executed once. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` should be adjusted to 1. Since `w` is greater than 0, it remains unchanged. 

State: **`h` is greater than `w`, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is `w + 1`, and `j` is 1**
