The code prints `#`, and the values of the variables `w`, `h`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `w` is greater than 0, `h` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, and the character `#` is printed.

Output State: **`w` is greater than 0, `h` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, and the character `#` is printed.**
