The code executes a print statement that outputs a period ('.') to the console. The values of the variables `w`, `h`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the print operation. Therefore, the output state reflects their initial values along with the action taken.

Output State: **`w` is greater than 0, `h` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, and a period ('.') is printed to the console.**
