According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2 and `w` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, which would make it 3. Therefore, `j` must be adjusted to 3, while `w` remains greater than 0.

State: **`h` is greater than `w`, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is `w + 1`, and `j` is 3**
