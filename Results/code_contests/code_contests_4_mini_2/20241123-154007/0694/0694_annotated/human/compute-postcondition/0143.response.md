According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `w`. The `range(0, w)` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 0 up to (but not including) `w`. Since it is given that `w` is less than or equal to 0, the loop will not execute because there are no valid numbers to iterate over.

To ensure the loop can execute, `w` needs to be greater than 0. The variable `j` will start at 0 when the loop begins, but since it is currently undefined, it will be defined by the loop itself.

Thus, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
- `w` must be greater than 0.

State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 0**
