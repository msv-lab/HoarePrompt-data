The `print('.')` statement outputs a dot to the console, but it does not affect any of the variables. The values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `w` is 1, `h` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, and `j` is 0.

Output State: **`w` is 1, `h` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 0**
