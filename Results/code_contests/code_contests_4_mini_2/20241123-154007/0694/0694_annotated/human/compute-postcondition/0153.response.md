According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `w`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `w` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to 2. Therefore, we need to adjust `j` to be 2.

No other states need to be adjusted since `h` and `w` remain unchanged, and the only focus for the next iteration is on the variable `j`.

State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 2**
