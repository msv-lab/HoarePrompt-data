According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the width `w`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2. Since `w` is greater than 0, it can be inferred that `w` must also be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again. 

Thus, the adjustment needed is for `w` to be greater than 2. The variable `j` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration. Given that `j` is currently 2, it will become 3 in the next iteration, which means `j` must also be adjusted to reflect this.

State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 3**
