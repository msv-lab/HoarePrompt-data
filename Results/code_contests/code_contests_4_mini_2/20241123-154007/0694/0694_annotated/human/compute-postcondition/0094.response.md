The code executes a print statement that outputs the character `#`. The values of the variables `w`, `h`, `i`, and `j` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state remains as it was, with the addition of the printed character.

Output State: **`w` is greater than 1, `h` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and the character '#' has been printed.**
