Given the initial state condition where `h` is greater than 0 and `w` is greater than 0, the code snippet provided reads input values for `h` and `w`. The `map(int, raw_input().split())` part takes user input, splits it into two parts, and converts them to integers.

Since `raw_input()` is a function that accepts user input, the values assigned to `h` and `w` will depend on what is inputted by the user. However, it is not specified what the input values are.

As for the impact of the code:
- `h` will be assigned the first integer from the input.
- `w` will be assigned the second integer from the input.

Since we do not know the values inputted by the user, the output state cannot specify exact values for `h` and `w`. 

Therefore, the output state is: `h` is the input first integer, `w` is the input second integer.

Output State: **`h` is the input first integer, `w` is the input second integer**.
