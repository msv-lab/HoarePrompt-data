According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `w`. The loop will execute if `w` is greater than 0, which it is according to the initial state. Additionally, since `j` is being assigned the value during the loop execution, it starts at 0 for the first iteration. 

The current values for `i` and `j` do not affect whether the loop can execute since `j` will be set by the loop definition. However, we can note that `i` is `w`, which is greater than 0 but is not relevant for the loop execution.

To summarize, for the loop to execute:
- `w` must be greater than 0, which it is.
- `j` will start at 0.

Thus, the state can be adjusted as follows:

State: **`h` is greater than `w`, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is `w`, `j` is 0**
