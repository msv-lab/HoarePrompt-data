According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `w`. The loop iterates over the range from `0` to `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `0`, which means the loop has just started and will continue as long as `j` is less than `w`. Since `w` is greater than `0`, `j` can increase to `1` for the next iteration. 

As `j` is currently `0`, it will be incremented by `1` in the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, `j` should be adjusted to `1` for the next iteration. The other variables `h` and `w` do not need to be adjusted since their values were not specified as changing in the context of this loop.

State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1**
