According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `j` from `0` to `w - 1`. The loop can execute again if `j` is less than `w - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `w`, which means the loop has already completed its iterations and cannot execute again.

To allow the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be adjusted to `w - 1` (the last valid index for `j`), and `w` must be greater than 0 to ensure the loop can execute. Since `h` and `w` are both greater than 0, there are no additional adjustments needed for `h`.

State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is between 0 and `h - 1`, `j` is equal to `w - 1`**
