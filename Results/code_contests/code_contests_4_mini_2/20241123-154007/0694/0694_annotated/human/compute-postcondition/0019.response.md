According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is within the range defined by `0` to `w - 1`. The current state indicates that `j` is equal to `w - 1` at the end of the last iteration. In order for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to `w`, which is outside the defined range for the loop.

Thus, the only necessary adjustment to the state is that `j` must be set to `w`, and since the loop will not execute again, there are no additional adjustments needed for `h` or `i`.

State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is between 0 and `h - 1`, and `j` is equal to `w`**
