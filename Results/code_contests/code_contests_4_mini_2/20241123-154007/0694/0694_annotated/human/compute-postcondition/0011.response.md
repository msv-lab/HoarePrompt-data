According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j`, which is currently iterating over the range from 0 to `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is between 0 and `w - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. 

Since the loop runs from `0` to `w - 1`, after the last iteration, `j` must be adjusted to `w` in order to account for the next iteration. This means the loop can no longer execute because the range will be exhausted.

No other states need to be adjusted since `h` and `w` are already greater than 0, and `i` is not relevant for this loop. 

State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is between 0 and `h - 1`, `j` is equal to `w`**
