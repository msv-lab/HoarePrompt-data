Output State: **If both `h` and `w` are 0, the loop does not execute, and both `h` and `w` remain 0. If `h` is greater than 0 and `w` is greater than 0, the loop will execute `h` times, printing `w` characters per iteration on the first and last rows as `#`, and `.` for the inner rows. If `h` is greater than 0 and `w` is 0, the loop will execute `h` times without printing anything, resulting in `w` being 0 and `h` remaining greater than 0, while `i` will iterate from 0 to `h-1`. After the loop, `i` will be equal to `h`.**
