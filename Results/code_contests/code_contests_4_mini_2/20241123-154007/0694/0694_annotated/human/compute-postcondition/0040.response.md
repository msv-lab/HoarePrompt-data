According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit `h`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `h`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `w`, and we know `h` is greater than `w`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `w + 1`, and it should still be less than `h`. 

No other states need to be adjusted since `w` is already greater than 0, and `h` is greater than `w`.

State: **`h` is greater than `w`, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is `w + 1`, `j` varies from 0 to `w - 1`**
