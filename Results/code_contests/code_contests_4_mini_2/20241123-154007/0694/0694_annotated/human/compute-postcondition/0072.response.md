The `print('#')` statement outputs the character `#` to the console. The values of the variables `h`, `w`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged, as this statement does not affect them. The output state reflects the unchanged values of these variables along with the output of the print function.

Output State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and the output is '#'**
