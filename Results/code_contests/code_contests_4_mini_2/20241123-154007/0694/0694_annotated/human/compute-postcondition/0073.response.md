The code prints a dot ('.'), and the values of the variables `h`, `w`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and a dot is printed.

Output State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and a dot is printed.**
