Output State: **If `w` is greater than 0, then `j` will take values from 0 to `w-1`, and the output will be `#` for `j` equals 0, `i` equals 0, `i` equals `h - 1`, or `j` equals `w - 1`; otherwise, the output will be `.`. If `w` is 0 or less, the loop does not execute, and `j` remains undefined, `h` is greater than 1, and `i` is 2.**
