The code prints the character `#`. The values of the variables `h`, `w`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged since this operation does not alter any variable. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables.

Output State: **`h` is greater than `w`, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is `w + 1`, `j` is 2**
