Postcondition: ***`h` is greater than `w`, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `w`, and `j` is 1. If `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, then the program prints `#`. Otherwise, it prints `.`. This covers the edge cases where `i` or `j` are at the boundaries of the defined dimensions.***
