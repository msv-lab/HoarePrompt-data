Postcondition: ***`h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `j` is 0. If `i` is 0 or `j` is 0 or `i` is equal to `h - 1` or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, the function prints '#'. Otherwise, if `i` is greater than 0 and less than `h - 1`, and `j` is greater than 0 and less than `w - 1`, the function prints '.'.***
