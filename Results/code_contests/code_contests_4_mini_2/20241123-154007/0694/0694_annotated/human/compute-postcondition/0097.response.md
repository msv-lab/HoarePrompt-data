According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit `w`. The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `w - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, which means it will execute again as long as `j` is less than `w`.

Given that `w` is greater than 1, we need to ensure that `w` is at least 3 for the loop to execute one more time after `j` is incremented. Therefore, we can adjust `w` to be greater than 2. Additionally, since `j` will increment to 3 for the next iteration, `j` should be adjusted to 3.

No other states need to be adjusted since `h`, `i`, and the conditions involving boundaries do not affect the loop's ability to execute again.

State: **`w` is greater than 2, `h` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 3**
