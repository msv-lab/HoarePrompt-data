To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we analyze the provided state and the loop structure. 

Current state: `j` is 1, `h` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `w` is greater than 0. 

The loop is defined as:
```
for j in range(0, w):
    # the loop body is omit
```

In this situation, the loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. Currently, `j` is 1. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 2.

To maintain the correctness of the state, we must ensure that the loop can execute again. Since `w` is greater than 1 (because `j` is currently 1), we do not need to change `w`. The only variable that needs to be adjusted is `j`, which should be set to 2 for the next iteration.

Therefore, the next state should be:
State: **`j` is 2, `h` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `w` is greater than 1**
