The `print('.')` statement outputs a period (.) to the console. The values of the variables `w`, `h`, `i`, and `j` are not changed by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of the variables along with the printed output.

Output State: **`w` is greater than 1, `h` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, and a period (.) is printed to the console.**
