According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `h`. The loop will execute if `h` is greater than 0. Since both `h` and `w` can be equal to 0 and the program would break if they are, we need to ensure that `h` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute. The variable `i` will start at 0 when the loop begins.

State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is assigned the value W, `i` is 0**
