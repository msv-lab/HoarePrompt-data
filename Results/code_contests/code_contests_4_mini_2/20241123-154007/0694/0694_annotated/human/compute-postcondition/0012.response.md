The code `print('#')` will output the character `#` to the console. It does not change the values of any variables. The initial state of the variables remains unchanged, so the output state will reflect that.

Output State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is between 0 and `h - 1`, `j` is equal to `w`, and the output is '#'**
