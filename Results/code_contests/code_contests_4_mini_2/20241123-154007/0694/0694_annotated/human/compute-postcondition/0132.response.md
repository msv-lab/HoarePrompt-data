The code executes a print statement which outputs the character `#`. The values of the variables `h`, `w`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged, as the print function does not affect them. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables along with the print output.

Output State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and the output is '#'**
