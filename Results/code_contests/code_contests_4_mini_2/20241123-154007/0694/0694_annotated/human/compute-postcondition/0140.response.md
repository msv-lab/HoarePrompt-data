Output State: **If `w` is greater than 0, the loop will execute `w` times. During each iteration, `j` will take values from 0 to `w-1`. If `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` equals `h - 1`, or `j` equals `w - 1`, then the character '#' is printed. Otherwise, if `i` is greater than 0 and less than `h - 1`, and `j` is greater than 0 and less than `w - 1`, a '.' is printed. If `w` is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute, and the values remain `h` greater than 0, `w` less than or equal to 0, `i` is 0, and `j` is undefined.**
