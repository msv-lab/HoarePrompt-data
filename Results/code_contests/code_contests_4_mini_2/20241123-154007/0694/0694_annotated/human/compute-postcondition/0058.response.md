According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `h` and the value of `i`. The loop will execute while `i` is less than `h`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `h` is greater than `w`. Since `w` is 0, it indicates that `h` is at least 1 (because `h` is greater than `w`). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. Additionally, we need to ensure that for the loop to run again, `h` must be at least 2.

Therefore, the adjusted states are: `h` is at least 2, `i` is 2, and no characters are printed.

State: **`h` is greater than or equal to 2, `w` is 0, `i` is 2, and no characters are printed.**
