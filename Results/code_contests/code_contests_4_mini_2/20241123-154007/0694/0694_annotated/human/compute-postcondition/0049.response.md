The `print('.')` statement outputs a dot to the console, but it does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged except for the action of printing.

Output State: **`h` is greater than `w`, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is `w + 1`, `j` is 1, and a dot is printed to the console.**
