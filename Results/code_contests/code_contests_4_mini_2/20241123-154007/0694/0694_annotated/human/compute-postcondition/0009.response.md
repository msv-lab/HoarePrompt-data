The code prints a dot ('.'), but it does not change the values of any variables. The variables `h`, `w`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is greater than 0 and less than `h - 1`, and `j` is greater than 0 and less than `w - 1`.

Output State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is greater than 0 and less than `h - 1`, and `j` is greater than 0 and less than `w - 1`**
