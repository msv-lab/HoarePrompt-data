According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `h`. The loop will execute if `h` is greater than 0, as the range function will generate numbers from 0 to `h - 1`. If both `h` and `w` are equal to 0, the program is set to break out of the most internal loop or if statement, which indicates that the loop will not execute in that case. 

Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `h` must be greater than 0, and the variable `i` should start at 0, as it represents the current iteration of the loop. 

State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is any value, `i` is 0**
