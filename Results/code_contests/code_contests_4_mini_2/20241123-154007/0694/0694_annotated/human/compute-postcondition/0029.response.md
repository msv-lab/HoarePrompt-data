According to the code, the loop will execute for values of `j` ranging from 0 to `w - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and since the loop will iterate for `j` from 0 to `w - 1`, it can execute again if `j` is less than `w - 1`. Given that `w` is greater than 0, and `j` is currently 0, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to 1.

Since `j` starts at 0 and will increment with each iteration of the loop, we can set `j` to 1 to prepare for the next iteration. The state of `h`, `w`, and `i` does not need to be adjusted since they do not affect the loop's execution in this context.

State: **`h` is greater than `w`, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `w`, and `j` is 1**
