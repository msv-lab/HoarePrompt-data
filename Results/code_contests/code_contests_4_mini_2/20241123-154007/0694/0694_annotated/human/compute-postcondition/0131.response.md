According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `j` from 0 to `w - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` should be adjusted to 1. The variable `i` remains unchanged, and `h` is still greater than 0. 

State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1**
