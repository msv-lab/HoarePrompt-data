The code `print('.')` outputs a period ('.') to the console. The values of the variables `h`, `w`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged since the print statement does not modify them. Therefore, the output state is based on the initial conditions of these variables.

Output State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is greater than 0 and less than `h - 1`, and `j` is greater than 0 and less than `w - 1`, and a period ('.') is printed to the console.**
