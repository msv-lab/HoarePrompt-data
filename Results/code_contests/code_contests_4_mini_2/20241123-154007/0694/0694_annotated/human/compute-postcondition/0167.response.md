According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `w`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `w` is greater than 0, meaning the loop can execute at least once more since `j` is currently 0 and `w` is greater than 0. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will increment by 1 in each iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be 1. The value of `h` does not need to change, and `i` remains 2. However, since `w` is greater than 0 but we don't have the exact value, it remains as it is.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `j` should be updated to 1 for the next iteration.

State: **`j` is 1, `h` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `w` is greater than 0**
