Output State: **If `w` is greater than 0, the loop executes `w` times, and `j` will take values from 0 to `w-1`. The output will print '#' for `j` equal to 0 and `w - 1`, and '.' for values of `j` in between. If `w` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `j` remains undefined. In that case, `w` is 0, `h` is greater than 0, `i` is 1.**
