In this case, the code reads two integers from input, which will be assigned to `h` and `w`. Since `H` and `W` are defined as integers within the range of 3 to 300, the values of `h` and `w` will be determined by the input provided.

However, since it is not specified what the input values are (as they are normally provided interactively), I cannot assume specific values for `h` and `w`. The only information we have is that the input consists of multiple datasets of two integers, which will be assigned to `h` and `w`, until the termination condition (0, 0) is reached.

Thus, the output state can only reflect that `h` and `w` are assigned values from the input.

Output State: **`h` is assigned the values of H and `w` is assigned the values of W from input**
