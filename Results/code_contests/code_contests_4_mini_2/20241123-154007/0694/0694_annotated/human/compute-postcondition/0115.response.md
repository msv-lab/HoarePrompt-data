According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `w`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, and since `w` is greater than 1, we know that `w` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again. Therefore, to allow the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `w` is at least 3 and increment `j` to 3 for the next iteration.

State: **`w` is greater than 2, `h` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 3**
