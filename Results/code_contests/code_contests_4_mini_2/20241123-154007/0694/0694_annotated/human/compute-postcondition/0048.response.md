The code `print('#')` outputs a string `#` to the console. It does not change the values of any variables. The previous states of the variables remain intact, with `h` greater than `w`, `w` greater than 0, `i` equal to `w + 1`, and `j` equal to 1. Therefore, the output state is: `h` is greater than `w`, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is `w + 1`, `j` is 1, and a `#` is printed to the console.

Output State: **`h` is greater than `w`, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is `w + 1`, `j` is 1, and a `#` is printed to the console**
