The `print('.')` statement outputs a dot to the console. The variables `j`, `h`, `i`, and `w` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `j` is 1, `h` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `w` is greater than 0, and a dot is printed to the console.

Output State: **`j` is 1, `h` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `w` is greater than 0, and a dot is printed to the console.**
