According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 0 to `w`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. Given that at the end of the last iteration `j` is 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to 2. Additionally, since the current value of `j` is 1 and `w` is greater than 1 (as stated), we don't need to adjust the value of `w`.

Thus, the state needs to reflect that `j` will now be 2 for the next iteration. The values of `w` and `h` remain unchanged because they are still greater than 1, and the conditions involving `i` do not require adjustment either.

State: **`w` is greater than 1, `h` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, and `j` is 2**
