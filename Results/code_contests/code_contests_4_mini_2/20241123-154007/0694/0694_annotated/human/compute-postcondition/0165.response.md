The `print('.')` statement outputs a dot to the console. The values of the other variables (`j`, `h`, `i`, and `w`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the print statement. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`j` is 0, `h` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `w` is greater than 0, and the console prints '.'**
