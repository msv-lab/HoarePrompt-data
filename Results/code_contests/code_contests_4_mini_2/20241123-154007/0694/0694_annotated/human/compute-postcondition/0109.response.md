The code executes a print statement that outputs a period (`.`) to the console. The print function does not modify any of the variables `w`, `h`, `i`, or `j`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged. The output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables along with the action of printing a period.

Output State: **`w` is greater than 1, `h` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, and a period (.) is printed to the console.**
