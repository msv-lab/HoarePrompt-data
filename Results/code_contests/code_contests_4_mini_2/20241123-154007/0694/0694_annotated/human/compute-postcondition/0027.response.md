The code snippet `print('.')` outputs a dot to the console. The execution does not change the state of any of the variables `h`, `w`, `i`, or `j`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`h` is greater than `w`, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is `w`, `j` is 0, and `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is not equal to 0, `i` is not equal to `h - 1`, and `j` is not equal to `w - 1`**
