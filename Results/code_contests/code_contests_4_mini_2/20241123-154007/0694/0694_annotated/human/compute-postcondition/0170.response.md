Postcondition: ***`j` is 1, `h` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `w` is greater than 0. If `i` is 0, or `j` is 0, or `i` equals `h - 1`, or `j` equals `w - 1`, then '#' is printed. Otherwise, a dot '.' is printed. This covers the boundaries where `i` or `j` are at the edges of a hypothetical grid defined by `h` and `w`.***
