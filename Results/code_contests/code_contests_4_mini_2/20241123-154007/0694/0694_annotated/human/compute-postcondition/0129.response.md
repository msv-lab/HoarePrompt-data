The code executes a print statement that outputs a period ('.'). The values of `h`, `w`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the print operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variable states along with the printed output.

Output State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is greater than 0 and less than `h - 1`, and `j` is greater than 0 and less than `w - 1`, and a period ('.') is printed.**
