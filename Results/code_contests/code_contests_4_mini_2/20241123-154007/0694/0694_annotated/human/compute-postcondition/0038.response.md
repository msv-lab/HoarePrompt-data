Output State: **`h` is greater than `w`, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `w`, and `j` varies from 0 to `w - 1`. The program prints `#` if `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, otherwise it prints `.`. If `w` is 0 or less, the loop does not execute and `j` remains unchanged.**
