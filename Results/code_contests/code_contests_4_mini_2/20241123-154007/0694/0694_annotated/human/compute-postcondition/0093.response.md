According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the width `w`. Since the loop iterates from `0` to `w - 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `w` is greater than 0, which implies that `w` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute again. Therefore, I need to adjust `w` to be greater than 1 to ensure the loop can run one more time, and increment `j` to 2 as it will be the next value used in the next iteration.

State: **`w` is greater than 1, `h` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and `j` is 2**
