Output State: **If h is greater than 0 and w is greater than 0, the loop will execute h times, where each iteration prints a '#' for the borders and '.' for the interior cells of a grid defined by h and w. If h is 0 or w is 0, the loop does not execute, and no characters are printed. In this case, h remains the initial value and w remains the initial value.**
