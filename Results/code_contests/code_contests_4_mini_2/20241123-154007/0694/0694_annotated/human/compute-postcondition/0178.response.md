According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `h`. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than `h`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `h` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `h` must be greater than 2, and `i` will be incremented to 3 in the next iteration.

State: **`w` is greater than 0, `j` is undefined, `h` is greater than 2, `i` is 3**
