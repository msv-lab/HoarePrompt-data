According to the code, since the loop is a `while True` loop, it is designed to run indefinitely unless a break condition is encountered within the loop body. Therefore, the loop can execute one more time without any adjustments needed to the program state. 

State: **If both `h` and `w` are 0, then `h` is 0 and `w` is 0. If `h` is greater than 0 and `w` is greater than 0, then `h` is greater than 0 and `w` is greater than 0. If `h` is greater than 0 and `w` is 0, then `h` is greater than 0 and `w` is 0.**
