According to the code, the for loop will execute based on the variable `j` and the upper limit `w`. The loop is set to iterate over the range from 0 to `w`, which means it will run as long as `j` is less than `w`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 2, and we need to ensure that `w` is greater than 2. Since `w` is currently greater than 0 and `j` is 1, `w` must be adjusted accordingly to ensure that the loop can run again.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to indicate that `w` must be greater than 2 and that `j` is now 2 for the next iteration.

State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 2**
