According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `j`, which is currently 0. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. Since `w` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so `j` should be adjusted to 1. The values of `h` and `w` do not need to be modified as `h` is greater than 0 and `w` is greater than 0, which ensures that the loop can continue to execute.

State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 1**
