The code prints the character `#`. The values of variables `h`, `w`, `i`, and `j` are not changed by this operation. Therefore, the output state remains as is, with the addition of the printed character.

Output State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is between 0 and `h - 1`, `j` is equal to `w - 1`, and the character `#` is printed.**
