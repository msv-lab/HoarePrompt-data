Postcondition: ***`h` is assigned the value H and `w` is assigned the value W from input. If both `h` and `w` are equal to 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, indicating a termination condition has been met. Otherwise, the program continues executing beyond this point without any changes to `h` and `w`.***
