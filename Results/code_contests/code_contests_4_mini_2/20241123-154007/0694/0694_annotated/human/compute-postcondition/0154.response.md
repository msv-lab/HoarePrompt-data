The `print('#')` statement outputs the character `#` to the console. The values of the variables `h`, `w`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and the function prints `#`.

Output State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and the function prints `#`**
