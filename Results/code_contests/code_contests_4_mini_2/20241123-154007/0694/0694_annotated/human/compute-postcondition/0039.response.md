The `print` statement is incomplete and does not provide any arguments to print. Consequently, no output is generated from this statement. Since there are no changes to the state of the variables, they remain unchanged. 

The output state reflects the initial conditions without any modifications or outputs from the print statement.

Output State: **`h` is greater than `w`, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `w`, `j` varies from 0 to `w - 1`**
