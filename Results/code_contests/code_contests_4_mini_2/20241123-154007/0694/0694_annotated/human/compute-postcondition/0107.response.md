According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit defined by `w`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `w` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will need to be incremented by 1, and it will become 1. Since `j` must be less than `w`, `w` must be adjusted to be greater than 1.

State: **`w` is greater than 1, `h` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, and `j` is 1**
