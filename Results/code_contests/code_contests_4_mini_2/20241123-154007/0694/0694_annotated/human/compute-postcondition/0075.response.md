According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and since `w` is greater than 0, we need to ensure that `j` can increment to allow the loop to execute again. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to 2. 

The other states `h` and `w` do not need to be modified since they do not affect the loop's ability to execute again based on the given condition.

State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 2**
