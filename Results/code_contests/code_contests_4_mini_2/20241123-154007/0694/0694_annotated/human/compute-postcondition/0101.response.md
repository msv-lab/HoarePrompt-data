According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `w`. The loop will only execute if `w` is greater than 0. Currently, `w` is 0, which means the loop will not execute. For the loop to be executed, `w` must be adjusted to at least 1. The variable `j` will start at 0, as it is initialized at the beginning of the loop.

State: **`w` is 1, `h` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 0**
