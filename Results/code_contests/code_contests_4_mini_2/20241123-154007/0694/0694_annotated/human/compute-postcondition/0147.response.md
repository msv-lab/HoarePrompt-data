The `print('.')` statement outputs a dot to the console. It does not modify the values of any variables, and the previous conditions of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `h`, `w`, `i`, and `j`.

Output State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is greater than 0 and less than `h - 1`, `j` is greater than 0 and less than `w - 1`, and a dot is printed to the console**.
