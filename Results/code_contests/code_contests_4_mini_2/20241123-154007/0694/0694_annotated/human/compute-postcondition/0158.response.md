Output State: **If `w` is greater than 0, the loop will execute `w` times, with `j` taking values from 0 to `w-1`. During each iteration, if `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, the program prints '#'. Otherwise, it prints '.'. If `w` is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute, and `j` remains undefined while `h` is greater than 0, `i` is 1.**
