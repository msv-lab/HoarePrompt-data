The `print('#')` statement outputs the character `#` to the console. The values of the variables `h`, `w`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged as no operations are performed on them. Therefore, the output state is: `h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and the output is `#`.

Output State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and the output is `#`**
