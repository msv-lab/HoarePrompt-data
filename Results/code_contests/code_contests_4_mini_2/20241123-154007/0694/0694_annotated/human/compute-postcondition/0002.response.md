The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is assigned the value H and `w` is assigned the value W from input. Both `h` and `w` are equal to 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
