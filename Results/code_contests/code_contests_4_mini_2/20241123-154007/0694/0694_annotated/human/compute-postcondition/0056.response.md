Output State: **`h` is greater than `w`, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is `w + 1`, and `j` ranges from 0 to `w - 1`. For each value of `j`, if `j` is 0 or `j` is `w - 1`, or if `i` is equal to `h - 1` (which will never be true since `i` is always `w + 1`), a `#` is printed; otherwise, a `.` is printed. The loop executes exactly `w` times. If `w` is 0, the loop does not execute, and no characters are printed. In this case, `h` is still greater than `w`, `w` is 0, `i` remains `w + 1`, and `j` is undefined.**
