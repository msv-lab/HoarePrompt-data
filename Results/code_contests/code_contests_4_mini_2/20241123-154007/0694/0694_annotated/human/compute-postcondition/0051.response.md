According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the width `w`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and since `w` is greater than 0, we can infer that for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to 2 (the next value in the range). 

Since `h` is greater than `w`, it does not affect the ability of the loop to execute again; we only need to consider `j`. The other variables (`h`, `w`, `i`) do not need to be adjusted because they are not directly affected by the loop's execution state.

State: **`h` is greater than `w`, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is `w + 1`, and `j` is 2**
