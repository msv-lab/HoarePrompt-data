The `print('.')` statement outputs a dot to the console. The values of the variables `h`, `w`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is greater than `w`, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `w`, and `j` is 1, and a dot is printed.

Output State: **`h` is greater than `w`, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `w`, `j` is 1, and a dot is printed.**
