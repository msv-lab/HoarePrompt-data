Postcondition: ***`w` is greater than 1, `h` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and `j` is 2. If `i` is 0 or `j` is 0 or `i` equals `h - 1` or `j` equals `w - 1`, the character '#' is printed. Otherwise, the character '.' is printed. This covers all edges cases where `i` or `j` could be at the boundaries of the grid defined by `h` and `w`.***
