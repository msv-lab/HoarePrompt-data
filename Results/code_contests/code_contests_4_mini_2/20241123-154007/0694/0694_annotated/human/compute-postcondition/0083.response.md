According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `w`. The loop will only execute if `w` is greater than 0, as it defines the range for `j`. Given that `w` is currently 0, the loop will not execute. To ensure the loop can execute, `w` must be greater than 0. Since `i` is already set to 1, it does not need adjustment.

State: **`w` is greater than 0, `h` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 0**
