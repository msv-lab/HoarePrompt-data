Postcondition: ***`h` is greater than `w`, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is `w + 1`, and `j` is 1. If `i` is 0 or `j` is 0 or `i` is equal to `h - 1` or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, a `#` is printed to the console. Otherwise, a `.` is printed to the console. This means that if `i` or `j` are at the boundary positions of the grid defined by `h` and `w`, a `#` will be printed; otherwise, a `.` will be printed. Note that since `h` is greater than `w`, and `w` is greater than 0, the variable `i` will always be at least 1, so the condition `i == 0` will never be true. Thus, the edge cases primarily revolve around the values of `j`, `i == h - 1`, and `j == w - 1`.***
