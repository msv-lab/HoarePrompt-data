Output State: **If w is 0, the loop does not execute, and `w` is 0, `h` is greater than 1, `i` is 2; if w is greater than 0, `w` remains unchanged, `h` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, and `j` will iterate from 0 to w-1, printing '#' if `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is `h - 1`, or `j` is `w - 1`, otherwise printing '.'; however, the `print` statement is incomplete and does not produce an output.**
