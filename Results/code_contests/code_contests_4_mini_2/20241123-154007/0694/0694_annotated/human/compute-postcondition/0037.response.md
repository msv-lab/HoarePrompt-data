According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit defined by `w`. The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2 and `w` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to increment to 3, and `j` must be less than `w`. 

Since `w` is greater than 0 but we don't have a specific value for `w`, we can't determine its exact value but we can say that it needs to be at least 4 for the loop to continue executing. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows: `j` is 3 and `w` is greater than 3.

State: **`h` is greater than `w`, `w` is greater than 3, `i` is equal to `w`, and `j` is 3**
