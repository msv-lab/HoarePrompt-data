According to the code, the `while True` loop indicates that it will continue to execute indefinitely unless there is a break statement or some external condition that stops it. Since this loop will always execute at least once, there are no conditions that need to be adjusted to allow the loop to execute one more time.

State: **If `h` is greater than 0 and `w` is greater than 0, `i` is less than `h`, `j` is less than `w`.**
