The code `print('.')` outputs a dot to the console but does not change any of the variable states. The values of `h`, `w`, `i`, and `j` remain the same. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables along with the action of printing a dot.

Output State: **`h` is greater than `w`, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `w + 1`, `j` is 0, and a dot is printed.**
