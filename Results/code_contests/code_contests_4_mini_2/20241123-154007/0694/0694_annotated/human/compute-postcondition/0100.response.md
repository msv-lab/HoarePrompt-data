According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `h`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `h` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `h` must be greater than 1 (since `i` starts at 0 and increments with each iteration). Therefore, `h` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 1. The value of `i` will also increment in the next iteration, so it should be set to 2.

State: **`w` is 0, `h` is greater than 1, `i` is 2**
