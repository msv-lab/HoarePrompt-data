The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is the input first integer, `w` is the input second integer, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **`h` is the input first integer, `w` is the input second integer, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
