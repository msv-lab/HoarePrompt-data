Postcondition: ***`w` is greater than 1, `h` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, and `j` is 2. If `i` is 0 or `j` is 0 or `i` is equal to `h - 1` or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, the function prints '#'. Otherwise, the function prints a period (.). Thus, if `i` or `j` is on the boundary of the grid defined by `w` and `h`, '#' is printed; otherwise, a '.' is printed.***
