The `print('#')` statement outputs the character `#`, but it does not change the values of any variables. The values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `h` is greater than `w`, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `w`, `j` is 1, and the output is `#`.

Output State: **`h` is greater than `w`, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `w`, `j` is 1, and the output is `#`**
