According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the variable `h`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `h`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `h` is greater than 0, which means the loop can execute one more time. 

After the current iteration, `i` would be incremented by 1 for the next iteration. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust `i` to 1. The value of `h` does not need to be adjusted since it remains greater than 0.

State: **`w` is 0, `h` is greater than 0, `i` is 1**
