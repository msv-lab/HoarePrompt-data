The code snippet prints the character `#`. The values of the variables `h`, `w`, `i`, and `j` are not affected by the print statement. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged in terms of variable values, but we note that the `#` character is printed.

Output State: **`h` is greater than `w`, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `w + 1`, `j` is 0, and either `i` equals 0, `j` equals 0, `i` equals `h - 1`, or `j` equals `w - 1` and `#` is printed.**
