The `print('#')` statement outputs the character `#` to the console. The values of the variables `h`, `w`, `i`, and `j` are not affected by this print statement. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged in terms of the variable values. The initial conditions regarding the relationships among `h`, `w`, `i`, and `j` still hold true.

Output State: **`h` is greater than `w`, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `w`, `j` is equal to 0, `i` is 0 or `j` is 0 or `i` is equal to `h - 1` or `j` is equal to `w - 1, and the output is '#'**
