The `print('#')` statement outputs the character `#` to the console. The values of the variables `h`, `w`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is `h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and the character `#` is printed.

Output State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and the character `#` is printed.**
