Postcondition: ***`h` is greater than `w`, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `w`, and `j` is 2. If `i` is 0, or `j` is 0, or `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, the output is `'#'`. Otherwise, the output is `'.'`. This covers all edge cases where `i` or `j` could be at the boundaries of their defined ranges.***
