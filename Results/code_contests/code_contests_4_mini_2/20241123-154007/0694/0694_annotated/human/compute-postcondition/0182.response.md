The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, as it reads multiple datasets of integers H and W from the input until it encounters the terminating pair (0, 0). Each dataset consists of two integers, H and W, where H is the height and W is the width of a structure, constrained by the conditions 3 ≤ H ≤ 300 and 3 ≤ W ≤ 300. 

The function processes these datasets and, for each valid pair of H and W, it generates output based on the values provided. However, when the input pair (0, 0) is encountered, the function terminates without performing any further operations.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple datasets of integers H and W, where each pair represents dimensions constrained by 3 ≤ H ≤ 300 and 3 ≤ W ≤ 300, terminating on the input pair (0, 0).**
