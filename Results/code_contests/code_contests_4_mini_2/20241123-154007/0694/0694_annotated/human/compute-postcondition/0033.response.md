According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the width `w`. The loop iterates over the range from 0 to `w`, which means it can execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `w` is greater than 1 (since `h` is greater than `w` and `w` is greater than 0). For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to 2.

State: **`h` is greater than `w`, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `w`, and `j` is 2**
