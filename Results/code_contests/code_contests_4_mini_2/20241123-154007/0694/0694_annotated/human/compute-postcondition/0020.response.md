Output State: **If `h` is greater than 0 and `w` is greater than 0, the loop executes `w` times. During each iteration, `j` takes values from 0 to `w - 1`. When `j` is 0 or `j` is `w - 1`, or if `i` is 0 or `i` is `h - 1`, the program prints `#`. In all other cases, the program prints `.`. If either `h` is 0 or `w` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `i` remains 0.**
