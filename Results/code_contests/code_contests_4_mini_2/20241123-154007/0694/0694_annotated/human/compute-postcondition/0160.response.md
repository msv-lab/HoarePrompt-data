According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `h`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `h`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `h` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `h` must be greater than 1 (to ensure that `i` can increment to 2 and still be less than `h`). 

Since `j` remains undefined and does not affect the loop condition, it does not need to be adjusted. Therefore, the adjustments needed are:

- `h` needs to be greater than 1.
- `i` will be incremented to 2 for the next iteration.

State: **`j` remains undefined, `h` is greater than 1, `i` is 2**
