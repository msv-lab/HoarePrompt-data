The code prints the character `'#'`. The values of the variables `h`, `w`, `i`, and `j` do not change as the print statement does not affect their state. Therefore, the output state remains focused on the initial conditions and the output from the print statement.

Output State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, and either `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1`; and the program prints '#'**
