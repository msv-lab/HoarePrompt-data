Postcondition: ***`h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 2. If `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is `h - 1`, or `j` is `w - 1`, the character `#` is printed. Otherwise, if `i` is within the bounds (0 < `i` < `h - 1`) and `j` is not at the borders (0 < `j` < `w - 1`), the output is a dot (.).***
