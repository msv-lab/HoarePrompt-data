The `print('.')` statement outputs a dot to the console. The values of the variables `h`, `w`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables and the action of printing a dot.

Output State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and a dot is printed to the console.**
