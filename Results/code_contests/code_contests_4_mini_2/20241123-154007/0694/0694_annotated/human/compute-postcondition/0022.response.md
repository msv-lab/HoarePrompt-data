According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `h`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `h`. At the end of the last iteration, `h` is greater than 0, which indicates that it has executed `w` times, meaning `i` is currently equal to `w`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to `w + 1`, and since `h` is greater than `0`, it must also be adjusted to be greater than `w`. 

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute once more:
- `h` must be adjusted to be greater than `w`, and 
- `i` should be set to `w` (the current value of `i` is `w` since the loop has run `w` times).

State: **`h` is greater than `w`, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is `w`, `j` is unchanged**
