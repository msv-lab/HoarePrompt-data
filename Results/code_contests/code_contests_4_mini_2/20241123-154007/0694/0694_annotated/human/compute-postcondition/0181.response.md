Output State: **If both `h` and `w` are greater than or equal to 3, the loop will execute and print a grid outline with `#` on the borders and `.` inside. After the loop, `h` and `w` will remain unchanged. If either `h` or `w` is less than 3, the loop will not execute, and the values of `h` and `w` will remain unchanged. If the input pair (0, 0) is encountered, the loop will terminate without printing anything, and `h` and `w` will also remain unchanged. If either `h` or `w` is 0, the loop does not execute, resulting in no output and unchanged values for `h` and `w`.**
