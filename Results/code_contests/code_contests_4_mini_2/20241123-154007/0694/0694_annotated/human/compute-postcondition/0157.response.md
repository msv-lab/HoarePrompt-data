According to the code, the loop will iterate over the variable `j` from 0 to `w - 1`. The current state indicates that at the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2. To execute the loop one more time, `j` must be incremented. 

Given that `j` starts at 0 and goes up to `w - 1`, for the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be 3 and must be less than `w`. The current state indicates that `w` is greater than 0, but it does not specify `w`'s exact value. For the loop to run again, we need to ensure that `w` is at least 4 (since `j` will be 3 in the next iteration).

Therefore, the adjustments needed are:
- `j` needs to be adjusted to 3.
- `w` must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute again.

The other states (`h` and `i`) do not need to be adjusted as they are not relevant to the loop execution.

State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 3**
