According to the code, the loop executes for each value of `j` in the range from 0 to `w`. The value of `j` determines what character is printed based on its current value at the start of the next iteration.

At the end of the last iteration, we have `j` as 2, which is within the bounds of the loop (since `j` is less than `w`, which is greater than 2). For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. 

Thus, to adjust the states accurately:
- Since `j` is currently 2, it should be incremented to 3.
- The value of `i` remains unchanged as it does not affect the loop execution for the next iteration.

Therefore, no adjustments are required for `h` and `w`, as their current states do not impact the loop's continuation.

State: **`h` is greater than 0, `w` is greater than 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 3**
