According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the condition of the loop, which iterates from 0 to `W - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to 2, which is still within the bounds of `W`.

Since `W` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `W` ≤ 300, and `j` is currently 1, we still meet the loop condition as long as `W` is greater than 2. Therefore, the only adjustments needed are to increment `j` to 2.

State: **`H` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `H` ≤ 300, `W` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `W` ≤ 300, `h` is greater than 0, `i` is less than `h - 1`, and `j` is 2.**
