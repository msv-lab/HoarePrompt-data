According to the code, the loop will execute based on the variable `W`, which determines the number of iterations. For the loop to execute at least once, `W` must be at least 1. Given that `W` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `W` ≤ 300, it satisfies this condition. 

The loop variable `j` will start at 0, and with each iteration, it will increase by 1 until it reaches `W - 1`. Since the requirement specifies that `j` is equal to `W - 1` after the loop executes, the loop must have completed its iterations. 

At the start of the loop, `i` is equal to `h - 1`, but the value of `i` does not affect the execution of the loop itself. Thus, no adjustments are needed for `i`, `H`, or `h` in terms of the loop execution.

To summarize, the necessary states before the loop starts are:
- `H` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `H` ≤ 300 (no adjustment needed).
- `W` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `W` ≤ 300 (no adjustment needed).
- `h` is greater than 0 (no adjustment needed).
- `i` is equal to `h - 1` (remains unchanged).
- `j` will be initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`H` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `H` ≤ 300, `W` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `W` ≤ 300, `h` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `h - 1`, `j` is 0**
