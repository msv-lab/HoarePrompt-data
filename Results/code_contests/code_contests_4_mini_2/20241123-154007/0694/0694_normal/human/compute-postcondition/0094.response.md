The code prints the character '#'. The values of the variables `h`, `w`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged as the print statement does not affect them. Therefore, the output state is: `h` is greater than or equal to 1, `w` is greater than 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and the character '#' is printed.

Output State: **`h` is greater than or equal to 1, `w` is greater than 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and the character '#' is printed.**
