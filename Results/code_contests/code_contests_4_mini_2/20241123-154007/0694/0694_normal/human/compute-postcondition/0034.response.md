The code snippet `print('#')` outputs the character `#` to the console. The values of the variables `H`, `W`, `h`, `i`, and `j` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state remains the same with the addition of the printed character.

Output State: **`H` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `H` ≤ 300, `W` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `W` ≤ 300, `h` is greater than 0, `i` is less than `h - 1`, `j` is 2, and the printed output is '#'**
