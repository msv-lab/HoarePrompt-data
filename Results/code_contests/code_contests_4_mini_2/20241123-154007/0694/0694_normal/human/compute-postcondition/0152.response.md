Postcondition: ***`h` remains unchanged, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `h`, and `j` is equal to the next value of `j` (which is `j + 1`). If `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, the character `#` is printed. Otherwise, a dot `.` is printed to the console.***
