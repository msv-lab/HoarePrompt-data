To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let’s analyze the current state and the loop.

1. **Current State:**
   - `H` is an integer such that \( 3 \leq H \leq 300 \)
   - `W` is an integer such that \( 3 \leq W \leq 300 \)
   - `h` is greater than 0
   - The output conditions depend on the values of `i` and `j`.

2. **Loop Analysis:**
   - The loop is defined as `for j in range(0, w):`. This means the loop will iterate from `j = 0` to `j = W - 1`.
   - The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `W`.

3. **Current Values:**
   - We need to ensure that `j` is adjusted to allow for one additional iteration.
   - If the loop has executed until the last value of `j` (i.e., `j` has reached `W - 1`), then we need to adjust `W` to allow for another iteration, which means `W` must now be greater than the previous value.

4. **Final Considerations:**
   - Since `j` starts at 0 and goes up to `W - 1`, if the last iteration was at `j = W - 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `W` must be increased to \( W + 1 \) (at least) to ensure the loop can iterate again.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

State: **`H` is an integer such that 3 ≤ H ≤ 300, `W` is an integer such that 4 ≤ W ≤ 301, `h` is greater than 0, `i` is not specified, `j` is 0**
