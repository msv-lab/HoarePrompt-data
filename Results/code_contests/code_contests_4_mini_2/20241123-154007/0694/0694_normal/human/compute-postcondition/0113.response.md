The `print('.')` statement outputs a dot character to the console. The values of the variables (`h`, `w`, `i`, and `j`) remain unchanged as the print function does not modify any variable state. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables.

Output State: **`h` remains unchanged, `w` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is less than `h`, `j` is 2, and a dot character is printed to the console.**
