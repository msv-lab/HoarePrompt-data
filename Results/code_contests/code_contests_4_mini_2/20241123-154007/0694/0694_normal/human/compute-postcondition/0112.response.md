The code executes a print statement, which outputs the character `#` to the console. The values of the variables `h`, `w`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that the print operation occurs without altering any variable values.

Output State: **`h` remains unchanged, `w` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is less than `h`, `j` is 2, and the character `#` is printed.**
