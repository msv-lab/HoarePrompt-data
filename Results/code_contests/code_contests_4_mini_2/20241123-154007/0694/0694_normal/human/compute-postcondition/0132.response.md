The code `print('#')` outputs the character `#` to the console. The values of the variables `h`, `w`, and `j` remain unchanged as the print statement does not modify any variables. Therefore, the output state is: `h` is greater than or equal to 1, `w` is greater than 0, and `j` is equal to `w`, and the character `#` is printed.

Output State: **`h` is greater than or equal to 1, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is equal to `w`, and the character `#` is printed.**
