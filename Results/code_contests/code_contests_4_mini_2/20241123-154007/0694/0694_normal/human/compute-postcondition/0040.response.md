According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `h`. Currently, we know that `i` is less than `h - 1`, which means `i` is at least 0 and at most `h - 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than `h - 1`, so for the loop to execute again, `i` will be incremented to `h - 1`. This means that after the next iteration, `i` will equal `h - 1`. 

Since `h` is between 3 and 300, `h` itself does not need to be adjusted because it remains within its bounds. Therefore, no other states need to be modified.

State: **`H` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `H` ≤ 300, `W` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `W` ≤ 300, `h` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `h - 1`, and `j` is equal to `W - 1` after the loop executes.**
