Postcondition: ***`h` remains unchanged, `w` is greater than 0, and `i` is equal to `h`. If `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, then `#` is printed. Otherwise, if none of these conditions are met (meaning `i` is not 0, `j` is not 0, `i` is not equal to `h - 1`, and `j` is not equal to `w - 1`), then a dot (.) is printed.***
