According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variable `w`. The loop will execute if `w` is greater than 0, as it iterates from 0 to `w - 1`. Given the current state where `w` is greater than or equal to 0, we need to ensure that `w` is at least 1 for the loop to execute. 

Additionally, the variable `j` will start at 0 during the first iteration of the loop. 

Thus, for the loop to be executed, we need to adjust the state as follows: `w` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`h` is greater than `i`, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `h`, `j` is 0**
