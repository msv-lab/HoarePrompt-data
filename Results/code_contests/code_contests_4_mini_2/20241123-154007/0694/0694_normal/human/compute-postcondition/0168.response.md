The `print('#')` statement outputs a string `'#'` to the console. It does not change the values of any of the existing variables. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged in terms of variable values, but the output to the console is acknowledged. 

Output State: **`h` is greater than `i`, `w` is greater than 1, `i` is equal to `h`, `j` is 0, and the output is '#'**
