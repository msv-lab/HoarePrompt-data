Postcondition: ***`h` is greater than or equal to 1, `w` is greater than or equal to 1, and `j` is equal to `w - 1`. If `i` is 0, or `j` is 0, or `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, the character `#` is printed. Otherwise, a period ('.') is printed. This covers the edge cases where `i` is at the first or last row, or `j` is at the first or last column, ensuring that the appropriate character is printed based on these conditions.***
