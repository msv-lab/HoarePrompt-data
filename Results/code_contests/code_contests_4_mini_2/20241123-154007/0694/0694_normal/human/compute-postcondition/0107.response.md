According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `w`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `w` is greater than or equal to 1, which means the loop can execute again. To execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
- `j` will become 1 (the next value in the range).
- `w` remains unchanged since it is greater than or equal to 1 and does not need to be adjusted for the loop to continue.

State: **`h` is unchanged, `w` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is less than `h`, and `j` is 1**
