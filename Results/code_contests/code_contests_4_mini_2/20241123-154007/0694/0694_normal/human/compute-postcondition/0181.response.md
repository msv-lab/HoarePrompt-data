Output State: **`h` and `w` remain unchanged and are integers such that 3 ≤ `H` ≤ 300 and 3 ≤ `W` ≤ 300 after the loop execution. The loop will print a rectangle with '#' for the borders and '.' for the inner area defined by `h` and `w`. The loop continues until the input `h` and `w` are both 0, at which point it will terminate. If valid values for `h` and `w` (greater than or equal to 3) are provided, the rectangle will be printed correctly. If inputs are not provided or are invalid (e.g., not integers), the loop will not execute, and no output will be produced. If `h` or `w` were 0, the loop would not execute, but this situation cannot occur with the given constraints.**
