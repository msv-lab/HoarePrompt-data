The statement `h, w = map(int, raw_input().split())` assigns values to `h` and `w` by taking input from the user, splitting that input into separate values, and converting them into integers. The input will be two integers representing the height and width of the rectangle, respectively. Since `h` is greater than or equal to 1 and `w` is greater than or equal to 1, both variables will be defined as positive integers. Other variables are not affected, so the output state reflects the assignment of `h` and `w`.

Output State: **`h` is an input integer >= 1, `w` is an input integer >= 1**
