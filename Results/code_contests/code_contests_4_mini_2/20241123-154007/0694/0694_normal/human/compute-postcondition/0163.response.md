The `print('#')` statement outputs the character `#` to the console. It does not affect any of the variables; therefore, the output state remains unchanged. The initial state mentions that `h` is greater than `i`, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `h`, `j` is 0, and at least one of the conditions is true. 

Output State: **`h` is greater than `i`, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `h`, `j` is 0, and at least one of the following is true: `i` is equal to 0, `j` is equal to 0, `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1; and the output is '#'**
