According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `h`. The loop will execute as long as `h` is greater than 0. Since the precondition states that `h` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, the loop can execute without any adjustments needed for `h`. 

The variable `i` will start at 0 and will increment with each iteration of the loop until it reaches `h - 1`. Since `h` is at least 1, `i` will be initialized to 0.

Therefore, the states that need to be established for the loop to execute correctly are:

State: **`h` is greater than or equal to 1, `w` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0**
