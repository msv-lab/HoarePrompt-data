The `print('#')` statement outputs the character `#` to the console. The variables `h`, `w`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged, as the print statement does not affect their values. The output does not change the state of these variables. Therefore, the output state is: `h` remains unchanged, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `h`, and either `i` is 0, or `j` is 0, or `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1. Additionally, `#` is printed.

Output State: **`h` remains unchanged, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `h`, and either `i` is 0, or `j` is 0, or `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1, and `#` is printed.**
