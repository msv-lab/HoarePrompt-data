The code prints a dot ('.'), but does not change any of the variable values in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged concerning the variables. 

Output State: **`h` is greater than or equal to 1, `w` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is greater than 0 and less than `h - 1`, `j` is greater than 0 and less than `w - 1`, and a dot was printed.**
