According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `w`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `w` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to 2 (the next value), and `w` must be at least 2. 

Since `w` is currently greater than or equal to 1, we need to ensure that `w` is at least 2 for the loop to continue; thus, we can adjust the state accordingly. The value of `j` will be updated to 2 as it increments with each iteration.

State: **`h` remains unchanged, `w` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is less than `h`, and `j` is 2**
