The code executes a print statement which outputs a dot ('.'). The variables `H`, `W`, `h`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the previous values of the variables and indicates the output from the print statement.

Output State: **`H` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `H` ≤ 300, `W` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `W` ≤ 300, `h` is greater than 0, `i` is less than `h - 1`, `j` is 1, and the output is '.'**
