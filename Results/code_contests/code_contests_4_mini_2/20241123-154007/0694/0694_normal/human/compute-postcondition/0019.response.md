According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the variable `W`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `W`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `W` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `W` ≤ 301. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, which would make `j` equal to 2. The condition that `j` must be less than `W` is satisfied since `W` is at least 4. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `j` is now 2.

State: **`H` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `H` ≤ 300, `W` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `W` ≤ 301, `h` is greater than 0, `i` is not specified, and `j` is 2.**
