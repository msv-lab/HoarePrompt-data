According to the code, the `while True` loop will always execute, as it is designed to run indefinitely. Therefore, there is no need to adjust any states to allow the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`h` is greater than or equal to 1, `w` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` varies from 0 to `h - 1`, `j` varies from 0 to `w - 1`**
