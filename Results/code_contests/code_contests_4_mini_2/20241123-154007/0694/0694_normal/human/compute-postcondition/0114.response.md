Postcondition: ***`h` remains unchanged, `w` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is less than `h`, and `j` is 2. If `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, the character `#` is printed. Otherwise, a dot character `.` is printed. This covers all edge cases regarding the values of `i` and `j` relative to `h` and `w`.***
