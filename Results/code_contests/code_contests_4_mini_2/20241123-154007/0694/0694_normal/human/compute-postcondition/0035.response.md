The `print('.')` statement outputs a period (`.`) to the console. It does not alter the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state reflects that the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`H` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `H` ≤ 300, `W` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `W` ≤ 300, `h` is greater than 0, `i` is less than `h - 1`, `j` is 2, and a period (.) is printed to the console.**
