The code executes a print statement, which outputs a period ('.') to the console. The values of the variables `h`, `i`, `w`, and `j` remain unchanged after the execution since the print statement does not modify any of them. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of the variables.

Output State: **`h` is greater than `i`, `w` is greater than 1, `i` is equal to `h`, `j` is 0 and a period ('.') is printed to the console**.
