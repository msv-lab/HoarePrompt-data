The `print('.')` statement outputs a dot to the console. It does not affect the values of the variables `h`, `w`, `i`, or `j`. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged with respect to the variable values. The only impact is the printing of the dot.

Output State: **`h` is greater than or equal to 1, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is greater than 0 and less than `h - 1`, `j` is greater than 0 and less than `w - 1`, and a dot is printed to the console.**
