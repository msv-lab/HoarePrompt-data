According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `W`. The loop will execute if `W` is at least 1. Given that `W` is between 3 and 300, it is guaranteed to be greater than 0. However, the state of `j` must be initialized before the loop starts. 

At the start of the loop, `j` will begin at 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `j` needs to be set to 0. The states are already within the defined ranges.

State: **`H` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `H` ≤ 300, `W` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `W` ≤ 300, `h` is greater than 0, `i` is less than `h - 1, `j` is 0**
