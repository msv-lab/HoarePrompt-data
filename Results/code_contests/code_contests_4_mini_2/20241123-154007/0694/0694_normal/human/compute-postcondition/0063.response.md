Postcondition: ***`h` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, and `w` is an integer greater than or equal to 1. If both `h` and `w` are 0, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement; however, since the precondition states that `h` and `w` cannot be 0, this condition will never be met. Thus, the program will continue executing without breaking.***
