According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `w`. The loop will execute if `w` is greater than 0. Since the current state indicates that `w` is greater than or equal to 1, the loop can indeed execute. The loop variable `j` will start from 0, which is appropriate for the range given.

Thus, for the loop to be executed, the variables `h`, `w`, and `i` can remain as they are, since they do not affect the looping condition directly. The state of `j` will be initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`h` is greater than or equal to 1, `w` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 0**
