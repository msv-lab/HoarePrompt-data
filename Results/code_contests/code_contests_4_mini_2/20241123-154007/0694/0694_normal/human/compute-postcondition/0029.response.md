To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we analyze the provided information step by step.

1. The loop is iterating over `j` from 0 to `W - 1`. The current state indicates that `j` is currently 0.

2. Since the loop uses `range(0, W)`, it will execute as long as `j` is less than `W`. After the current iteration where `j` is 0, the next value of `j` will be 1 in the next iteration.

3. The current values of `H` and `W` are constrained within the range of 3 to 300, and `h` is greater than 0. The values of `H` and `W` do not need to be adjusted as long as they remain in the specified range.

4. The current state indicates that `i` is less than `h - 1`, which does not affect the loop execution since it concerns the outer loop rather than the loop over `j`.

5. For the loop to execute one more time, we need `j` to be adjusted to its next value, which will be `j = 1`. This means the only change required is to reflect that `j` has been incremented.

Taking these into account, we conclude that the only adjustment needed is for `j` to be updated to 1.

State: **`H` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `H` ≤ 300, `W` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `W` ≤ 300, `h` is greater than 0, `i` is less than `h - 1`, `j` is 1**
