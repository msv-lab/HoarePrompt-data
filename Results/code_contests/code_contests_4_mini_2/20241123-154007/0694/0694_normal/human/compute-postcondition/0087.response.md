The code executes a print statement which outputs a single period ('.'). The values of the variables `h`, `w`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged as they are unaffected by the print function. Therefore, the output state indicates the current values of these variables and the printed output.

Output State: **`h` is greater than or equal to 1, `w` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is greater than 0 and less than `h - 1`, `j` is greater than 0 and less than `w - 1`, and the output is '.'**
