According to the code, the loop will execute based on the variable `j`, which is currently equal to `w`. The loop iterates from `0` to `w - 1`, so for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to `w`, and since the range is from `0` to `w`, when `j` is equal to `w`, it indicates that the loop has completed its iterations. Therefore, to prepare for the next iteration, `j` should be set to `w`, and the state of `w` remains unchanged.

State: **`h` is greater than or equal to 1, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is equal to `w`**
