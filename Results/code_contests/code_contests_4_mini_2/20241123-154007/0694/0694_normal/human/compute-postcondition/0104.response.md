Postcondition: ***`h` is unchanged, `w` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is less than `h`, `j` is 0, and none of the following are true: `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1`. Therefore, `i` is greater than 0 and less than `h - 1`, and `j` is less than `w - 1`.***
