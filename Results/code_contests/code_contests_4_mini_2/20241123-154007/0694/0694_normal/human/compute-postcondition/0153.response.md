According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and `w`. The loop continues as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to the next value of `j`, which is `j + 1`, and `w` is greater than 0. 

To allow the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `w`. Since `j` is now equal to `w`, we need to adjust `j` to be less than `w`. Thus, `j` should be set to `w - 1` so that it can execute the loop again.

Additionally, since `i` is equal to `h` and remains unchanged, we do not need to adjust `i` or `h`.

State: **`h` remains unchanged, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `h`, and `j` is equal to `w - 1`**
