Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters and repeatedly reads pairs of integers `h` and `w` from input, where both must be greater than or equal to 3. For each valid pair, it prints a rectangle with `#` characters for the borders and `.` characters for the inner area until both `h` and `w` are 0, at which point the function terminates. If `h` or `w` are not provided or are invalid (e.g., not integers), the function does not execute any output. The function does not return any value. **
