The code prints the character `#`. The values of the variables `H`, `W`, `h`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables along with the printed character.

Output State: **`H` and `W` are integers such that 3 ≤ `H` ≤ 300 and 3 ≤ `W` ≤ 300; `h` is greater than 0; `i` is equal to `h - 1`, and `j` is 2; printed character is '#'**
