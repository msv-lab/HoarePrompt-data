The code snippet `print('.')` outputs a dot (.) to the console. It does not change the values of any variables, including `h`, `w`, `i`, and `j`. The output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables and the action of printing a dot.

Output State: **`h` remains unchanged, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `h` and `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is not equal to 0, `i` is not equal to `h - 1`, and `j` is not equal to `w - 1; printed a dot (.)**
