According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `w`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `w`.

At the end of the last iteration, we have:
- `h` is greater than or equal to 1 (this does not impact `j` or `w` directly).
- `w` is greater than 0 (which means the loop can potentially execute).
- `j` is equal to `w`, which indicates that the loop has reached its limit and will not execute again.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than `w`. Since `j` is currently equal to `w`, it needs to be adjusted to `w - 1` to allow for another iteration.

State: **`h` is greater than or equal to 1, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is equal to `w - 1`**
