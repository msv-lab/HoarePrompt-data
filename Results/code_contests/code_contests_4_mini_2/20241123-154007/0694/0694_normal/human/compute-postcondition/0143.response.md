According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `w`. For the loop to execute, `w` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` is set to `h`, which does not affect the loop execution but indicates the state at the start of the loop. Before the loop starts, `h` and `w` are unchanged, but we need to ensure that `w` is greater than 0 for the loop to run. 

Therefore, to adjust the states for the loop to execute, we need to state that `w` is greater than 0, and since `i` is set to `h`, we indicate that `i` remains equal to `h`.

State: **`h` remains unchanged, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is h**
