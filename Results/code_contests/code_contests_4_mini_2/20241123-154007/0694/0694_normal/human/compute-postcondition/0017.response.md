The code simply executes a print statement that outputs a dot ('.'). The values of the variables `H`, `W`, `h`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged as the print function does not affect the state of these variables. Therefore, the output state is: `H` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `H` ≤ 300, `W` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `W` ≤ 301, `h` is greater than 0, `i` is not specified, `j` is 1, and the output is '.'.

Output State: **`H` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `H` ≤ 300, `W` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `W` ≤ 301, `h` is greater than 0, `i` is not specified, `j` is 1, and the output is '.'**
