The code executes a `print` statement, which outputs a dot ('.') to the console. The values of the variables `h`, `w`, and `j` remain unchanged after this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `h` is greater than or equal to 1, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is equal to `w`, and a dot ('.') is printed.

Output State: **`h` is greater than or equal to 1, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is equal to `w`, and a dot ('.') is printed.**
