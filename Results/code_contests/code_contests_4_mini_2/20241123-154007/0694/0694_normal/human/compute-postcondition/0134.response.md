Postcondition: ***`h` is greater than or equal to 1, `w` is greater than 0, and `j` is equal to `w`. If `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is `h - 1`, or `j` is `w - 1`, the character `#` is printed. Otherwise, a dot ('.') is printed. This includes cases where `i` is on the borders of the grid defined by `h` and `w`, or `j` is at the leftmost or rightmost edges.***
