According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit `W`. The loop is defined to iterate from 0 to `W - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to 2, which means the next value of `j` for the loop will be 3. 

To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that `j` is still less than `W`. Since `j` is currently 2, for the loop to execute again, `W` must be greater than 3 (i.e., `W` must be at least 4).

Since `W` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `W` ≤ 300, and we need `j` to be less than `W`, we can conclude that `W` should be greater than 3.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `j` should be updated to 3 for the next iteration.
- `W` must be greater than 3 to allow the loop to proceed.

State: **`H` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `H` ≤ 300, `W` is greater than 3, `h` is greater than 0, `i` is less than `h - 1`, and `j` is 3**
