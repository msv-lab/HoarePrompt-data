According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit defined by `h`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `h`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is unchanged and `h` is unchanged, which means we do not know the exact value of `i`, but it must be less than `h` for the loop to execute again. Since `j` is undefined, it does not affect the loop's execution.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state such that `i` is less than `h`. Assuming `i` was the same as it was before the loop started (which we know is unchanged), we need to ensure that `i` is a value that satisfies `i < h`. If `i` was already `h - 1`, then on the next iteration `i` would be `h`, and the loop would stop executing.

Thus, the states need to reflect that `i` should be adjusted to ensure that it remains less than `h`.

State: **`h` is unchanged, `w` is unchanged, `i` is less than `h`, and `j` is undefined**
