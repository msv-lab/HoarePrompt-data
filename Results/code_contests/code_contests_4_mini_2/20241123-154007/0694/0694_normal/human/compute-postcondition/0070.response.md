Postcondition: ***`h` is greater than or equal to 1 and `w` is greater than or equal to 1. If `i` is 0, or `j` is 0, or `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, the output is '#'. Otherwise, if `i` is greater than 0 and less than `h - 1`, and `j` is greater than 0 and less than `w - 1`, the output is '.'***
