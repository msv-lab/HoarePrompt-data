According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `w`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `w` is greater than 1. This means the loop can execute again since `j` is less than `w`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented. After the next iteration, `j` will be 1.

No other states need to be adjusted since `h`, `i`, and `w` do not change in relation to the loop's execution in this context.

State: **`h` is greater than `i`, `w` is greater than 1, `i` is equal to `h`, and `j` is 1**
