Postcondition: ***`h` and `w` are input integers greater than or equal to 1. If both `h` and `w` are equal to 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. However, since `h` is always greater than or equal to 1, the condition `h == 0 and w == 0` will never be true, and thus the break statement will never execute. Therefore, the program continues without interruption.***
