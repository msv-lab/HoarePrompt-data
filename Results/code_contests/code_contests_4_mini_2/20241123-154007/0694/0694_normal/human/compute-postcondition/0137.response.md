The `print('.')` statement outputs a period but does not affect the values of any variables. The initial states of `h`, `w`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `h` is greater than or equal to 1, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is equal to `w`, and a period is printed.

Output State: **`h` is greater than or equal to 1, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is equal to `w`, and a period is printed.**
