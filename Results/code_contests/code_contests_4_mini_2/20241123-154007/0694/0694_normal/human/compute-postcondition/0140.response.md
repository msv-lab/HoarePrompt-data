Output State: **`h` is greater than or equal to 1, `w` is greater than 0, and the loop executes `w` times. For each iteration `j` from 0 to `w-1`, if `i` is 0, `h - 1`, or `j` is 0 or `w - 1`, the character '#' is printed; otherwise, a dot '.' is printed. If `w` is 0, the loop does not execute, and no characters are printed.**
