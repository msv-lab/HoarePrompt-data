The `print('#')` statement outputs the character `#` to the console. The values of the variables `h`, `w`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged by this statement. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables and acknowledges the printed output.

Output State: **`h` is greater than or equal to 1, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, and the character '#' is printed.**
