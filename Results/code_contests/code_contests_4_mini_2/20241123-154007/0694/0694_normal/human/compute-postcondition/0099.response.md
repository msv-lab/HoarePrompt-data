The `print` statement does not produce any output, as it lacks any arguments to print. Therefore, there are no changes made to the values of the variables in the current context. The output state reflects that the values of `h`, `w`, and `i` remain unchanged, and `j` remains undefined as the loop does not execute.

Output State: **`h` is unchanged, `w` is unchanged, `i` is unchanged, and `j` is undefined**
