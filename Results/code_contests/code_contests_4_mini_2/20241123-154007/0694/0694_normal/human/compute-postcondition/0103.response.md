The `print('#')` statement outputs the character `#` to the console. This action does not modify any of the existing variables (`h`, `w`, `i`, `j`) in the program. The initial conditions regarding these variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `h` is unchanged, `w` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is less than `h`, `j` is 0, and a `#` is printed.

Output State: **`h` is unchanged, `w` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is less than `h`, `j` is 0, and a `#` is printed.**
