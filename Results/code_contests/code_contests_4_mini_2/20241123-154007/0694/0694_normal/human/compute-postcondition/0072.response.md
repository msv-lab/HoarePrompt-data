The code `print('#')` outputs the character `#` to the console. The initial state of the variables (`h`, `w`, and `j`) is not affected by this print statement, and their values remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `h` is greater than or equal to 1, `w` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is equal to `w - 1`, and the character `#` is printed.

Output State: **`h` is greater than or equal to 1, `w` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is equal to `w - 1`, and the character `#` is printed.**
