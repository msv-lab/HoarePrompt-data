According to the code, the loop will execute `w` times, iterating through the range from 0 to `w - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is either 0 or `w - 1`, as it represents the current index in the loop. 

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, `j` needs to be adjusted to the next value in the range. If `j` is currently `w - 1`, the loop cannot execute again because it has reached the end of the range. Since `w` is greater than 0, the only way for the loop to execute again is for `j` to be adjusted to `w`, which is outside the current range.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `j` must be set to `w`, indicating the loop cannot execute again.

Given that there's no other information that needs to be modified based on the current states of `h` and `w`, the remaining states remain unchanged.

State: **`h` is greater than or equal to 1, `w` is greater than 0, `j` is equal to `w`**
