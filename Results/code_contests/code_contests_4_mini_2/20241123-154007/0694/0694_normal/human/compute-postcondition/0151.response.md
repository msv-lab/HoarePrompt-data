The `print('.')` statement outputs a dot to the console. It does not modify any variables or change their states. Therefore, the values of the variables remain the same after execution. 

The output state is: `h` remains unchanged, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `h`, `j` is equal to the next value of `j` (which is `j + 1`), and a dot is printed to the console.

Output State: **`h` remains unchanged, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `h`, `j` is equal to the next value of `j` (which is `j + 1`), and a dot is printed to the console.**
