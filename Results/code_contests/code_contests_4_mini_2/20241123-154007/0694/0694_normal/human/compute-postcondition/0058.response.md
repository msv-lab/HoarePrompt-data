According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `h`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `h`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `h - 1`, which means that in the next iteration, `i` will be incremented to `h`. Since `i` will no longer be less than `h`, the loop will not execute again. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `h` must be increased by at least 1, and `i` should be reset to `h - 1` (which is now valid) and `j` should be defined (let's assume it can be set to 0 as it has not been defined yet).

State: **`H` and `W` remain integers within the given ranges, `h` is greater than 1, `i` is equal to `h - 1`, `j` is 0**
