According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the range defined by `w`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, we have `j` equal to `w - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to `w`, which is not within the range of the loop (0 to `w - 1`).

Since `j` is equal to `w - 1`, it will not allow the loop to execute again, meaning that `j` needs to be adjusted to equal `w`, and `i` should remain unchanged as `h`.

State: **`h` remains unchanged, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `h`, and `j` is equal to `w`**
