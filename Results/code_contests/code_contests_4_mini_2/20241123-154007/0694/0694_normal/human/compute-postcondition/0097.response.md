According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `w`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, and since `w` is greater than 2, `j` must be less than `w` for the loop to execute again.

To execute one more time, `j` should be incremented by 1 to 3. Therefore, `j` needs to be adjusted to 3. The other states do not need to be adjusted because they do not affect the loop execution.

State: **`h` is greater than or equal to 1, `w` is greater than 2, `i` is 1, and `j` is 3**
