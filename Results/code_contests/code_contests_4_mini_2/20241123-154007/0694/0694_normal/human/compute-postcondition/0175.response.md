According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `w`. The loop will iterate while `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `w` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be adjusted to the next value, which would be 2. Additionally, `w` needs to be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

Thus, the states need to be adjusted to reflect that `j` is now 2 and `w` is greater than 2.

State: **`h` is greater than `i`, `w` is greater than 2, `i` is equal to `h`, and `j` is 2**
