Output State: **If `w` is at least 1, the loop executes `w` times, and during each iteration `h` remains unchanged, `i` remains less than `h`, and `j` takes values from 0 to `w-1`. If `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, a `#` is printed; otherwise, a `.` is printed. If `w` is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute, and `j` remains undefined while `h` and `i` stay unchanged.**
