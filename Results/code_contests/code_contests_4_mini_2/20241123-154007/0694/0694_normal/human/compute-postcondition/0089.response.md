According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` should be adjusted to 1. Since there are no conditions affecting `h` or `w`, those states remain unchanged.

State: **`h` is greater than or equal to 1, `w` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, and `j` is 1**
