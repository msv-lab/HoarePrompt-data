The variables `h` and `w` are assigned values from the `raw_input()` function, which takes a single line of input and splits it into two parts that are then converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The initial states of `H` and `W` are not affected by this operation, but `h` and `w` now hold the integer values that were input. 

Since `H` and `W` can be any integers within the specified range, the output state will reflect that `h` and `w` are now integers based on user input.

Output State: **`H` is an integer such that 3 ≤ H ≤ 300; `W` is an integer such that 3 ≤ W ≤ 300; `h` is an integer from input; `w` is an integer from input**
