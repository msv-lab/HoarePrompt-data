According to the code, the loop will execute again as long as `j` is less than `W`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. Since the loop iterates from 0 to `W - 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. 

To determine the states that need to be adjusted, we note that `j` is currently 0. Therefore, it will need to be adjusted to 1 to reflect the next iteration. The other states (`H`, `W`, `h`, and `i`) do not need to be modified since they do not affect the loop condition directly.

State: **`H` and `W` are integers such that 3 ≤ `H` ≤ 300 and 3 ≤ `W` ≤ 300, `h` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `h - 1`, and `j` is 1.**
