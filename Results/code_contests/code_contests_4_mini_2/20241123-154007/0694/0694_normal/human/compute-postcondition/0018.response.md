Postcondition: ***`H` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `H` ≤ 300, `W` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `W` ≤ 301, `h` is greater than 0, `i` is not specified, and `j` is 1. If `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `W - 1`, the character '#' is printed. Otherwise, if none of these conditions are met, '.' is printed.***
