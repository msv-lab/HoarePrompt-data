The `print('.')` statement outputs a dot (".") to the console. The values of the variables `H`, `W`, `h`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged as the print statement does not modify any of them. Therefore, the output state is: `H` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `H` ≤ 300, `W` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `W` ≤ 301, `h` is greater than 0, `i` is not specified, `j` is 0, and a dot is printed.

Output State: **`H` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `H` ≤ 300, `W` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `W` ≤ 301, `h` is greater than 0, `i` is not specified, `j` is 0, and a dot is printed.**
