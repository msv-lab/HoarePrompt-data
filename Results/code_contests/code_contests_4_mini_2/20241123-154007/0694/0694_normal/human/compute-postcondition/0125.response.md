According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `w`. If `w` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Given that `h` is greater than or equal to 1 and `i` is currently 0, these states do not affect the execution of the loop. The variable `j` will start at 0 and increment up to `w - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `w` must be greater than 0, and the initial state of `j` is 0.

State: **`h` is greater than or equal to 1, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 0**
