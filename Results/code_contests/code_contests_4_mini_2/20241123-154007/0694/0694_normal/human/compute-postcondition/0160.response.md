According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `h`. Since the loop iterates from `0` to `h - 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `h` must be greater than the current value of `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `h`, which means the loop has just completed its last valid iteration. 

To allow the loop to execute one more time, `h` must be incremented by at least 1, making it greater than `i`. Therefore, we adjust `h` to be greater than `i`, which is currently equal to `h`. 

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`h` is greater than `i`, `w` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `h`, `j` iterates from 0 to `w - 1`**
