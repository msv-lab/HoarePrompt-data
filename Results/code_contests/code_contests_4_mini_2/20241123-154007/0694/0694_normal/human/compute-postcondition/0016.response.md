The code prints the character `'#'` but does not modify any of the variables. The state of the variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `H` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `H` ≤ 300, `W` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `W` ≤ 301, `h` is greater than 0, `i` is not specified, `j` is 1, and the character `'#'` is printed.

Output State: **`H` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `H` ≤ 300, `W` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `W` ≤ 301, `h` is greater than 0, `i` is not specified, `j` is 1, and the character '#' is printed.**
