The `print('#')` statement outputs the character `#` to the console. The values of the variables `h`, `w`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged as this statement does not modify them. Therefore, the output state is: `h` remains unchanged, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `h`, `j` is equal to the next value of j (which is `j + 1`), and the character `#` is printed.

Output State: **`h` remains unchanged, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `h`, `j` is equal to the next value of j (which is `j + 1`), and the character `#` is printed.**
