The `print('.')` statement outputs a dot to the console. It does not change the values of any variables, so the output state remains unchanged regarding the variable values. 

Output State: **`H` is an integer such that 3 ≤ H ≤ 300, `W` is an integer such that 3 ≤ W ≤ 300, `h` is greater than 0, `i` is greater than 0 and less than `h - 1`, `j` is greater than 0 and less than `W - 1, and a dot is printed to the console.**
