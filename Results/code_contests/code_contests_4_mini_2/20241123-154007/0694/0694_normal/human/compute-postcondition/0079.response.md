According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the upper bound `w`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `w`. To execute the loop one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, which means it needs to be adjusted to `w` (the loop will not execute again since `j` is not less than `w`).

Additionally, since `j` is equal to `w`, there is no need to adjust `h` or any other states because they don't influence the loop's ability to run again.

State: **`h` is greater than or equal to 1, `w` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is equal to `w`**
