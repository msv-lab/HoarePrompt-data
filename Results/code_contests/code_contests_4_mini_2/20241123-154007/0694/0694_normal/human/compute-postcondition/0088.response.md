Postcondition: ***`h` is greater than or equal to 1, `w` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, and `j` is 0. If `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, the output is '#'. Otherwise, if `i` is between 1 and `h - 2` and `j` is between 1 and `w - 2`, the output is '.'.***
