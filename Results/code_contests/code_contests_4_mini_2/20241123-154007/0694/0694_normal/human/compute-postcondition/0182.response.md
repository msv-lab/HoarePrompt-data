The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates with two constraints: `H` and `W`, which are integers such that 3 ≤ H ≤ 300 and 3 ≤ W ≤ 300. The function's output is determined based on these constraints, but since the output specifics are not provided, we cannot detail the return value beyond this. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to utilize the integer values of `H` and `W`, both constrained between 3 and 300, but the exact return value is unspecified.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and operates within the constraints of integers H and W, both ranging from 3 to 300. The exact return value is unspecified.**
