Output State: **`H` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `H` ≤ 300, `W` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `W` ≤ 300, `h` is greater than 0, `i` is less than `h - 1`, and `j` is equal to `W - 1` after the loop completes execution. The loop will execute `W` times, where for each iteration, the value of `j` will range from 0 to `W - 1`. The output will be '#' when `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `W - 1`, and '.' will be printed otherwise. If `W` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and `j` will not have a defined value.**
