Output State: **If `h` is greater than 0, the loop executes `W` times with `j` taking values from 0 to `W - 1`. The output is `'#'` when `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `W - 1`. Otherwise, the output is `'.'`. If `W` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and no output is generated. In this case, `H` and `W` remain integers within the given ranges, `h` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `h - 1`, and `j` is undefined as the loop has not executed.**
