The code outputs a period (`.`) to the console, but does not affect the values of any variables. The state of the variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `h` is unchanged, `w` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is less than `h`, `j` is 0, and none of the following are true: `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1`.

Output State: **`h` is unchanged, `w` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is less than `h`, `j` is 0, and none of the following are true: `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1**
