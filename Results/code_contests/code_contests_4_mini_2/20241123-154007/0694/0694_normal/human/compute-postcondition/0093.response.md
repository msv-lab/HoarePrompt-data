According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `w`. The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented, and thus it will be 2 in the next iteration. 

We also know that `w` is greater than or equal to 1, but we need to ensure that `j` can be less than `w` for the loop to continue. Since `j` is currently 1, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `j` is less than `w`, so we must ensure that `w` is greater than 2.

State: **`h` is greater than or equal to 1, `w` is greater than 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 2**
