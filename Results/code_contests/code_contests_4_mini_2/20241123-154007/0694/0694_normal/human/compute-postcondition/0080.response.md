Output State: **`h` is greater than or equal to 1, `w` is greater than or equal to 1, and `j` varies from 0 to `w - 1`. For each iteration, if `i` is 0, or `j` is 0, or `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, the output is `'#'`. Otherwise, the output is `'.'`. If `w` is 0, the loop does not execute and there is no output, while `i` remains 0. If `h` is 0 or less, the loop does not execute, and both `h` and `w` are unchanged.**
