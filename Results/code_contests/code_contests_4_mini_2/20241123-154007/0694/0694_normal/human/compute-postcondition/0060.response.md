Since the loop is a `while True`, it will always execute one more time regardless of the current state. Therefore, there is no need to modify any state variables.

State: **If h is greater than or equal to 1 and w is greater than or equal to 1, the loop will print a rectangle border made of '#' characters with '.' characters inside. If h or w were 0 (which cannot occur with the given constraints), the loop would not execute.**
