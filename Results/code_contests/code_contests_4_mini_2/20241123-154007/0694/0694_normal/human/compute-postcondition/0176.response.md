Output State: **`h` is greater than `i`, `w` is greater than or equal to 0, and `i` is equal to `h`. If `w` is greater than 0, the loop will execute `w` times, printing '#' if `i` is 0, or `j` is 0, or `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1`. For other values of `j` (1 to `w - 2`) and if `i` is less than `h - 1`, the output will be '.'. If `w` is 0, the loop does not execute, leaving `h`, `i`, and `j` unchanged.**
