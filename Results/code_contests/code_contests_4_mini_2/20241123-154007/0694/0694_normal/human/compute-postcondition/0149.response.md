According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `w`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `w` is greater than 0, and `j` is equal to some value that is less than `w`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.

Since `j` is currently less than `w`, we can adjust `j` to represent the next value it will take in the next iteration, which is `j + 1`. The other states (`h` and `i`) do not require any changes as they are not directly affecting the loop execution.

State: **`h` remains unchanged, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `h`, `j` is equal to the next value of j (which is `j + 1`)**
