According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` relative to `W`. The loop will execute for values of `j` from 0 to `W - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, which is within the bounds of the loop.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to the next value, which would be 2. The conditions regarding `H`, `W`, and `h` do not need to be adjusted, as they are not affected by the loop iteration.

Thus, the adjusted state will reflect the new value of `j`, while the other variables remain unchanged.

State: **`H` and `W` are integers such that 3 ≤ `H` ≤ 300 and 3 ≤ `W` ≤ 300; `h` is greater than 0; `i` is equal to `h - 1`, and `j` is 2.**
