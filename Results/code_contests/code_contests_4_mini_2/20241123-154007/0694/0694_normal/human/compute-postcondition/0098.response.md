Output State: **If `w` is greater than 0, the loop will execute `w` times. For each iteration, `j` will take values from 0 to `w - 1`. The output will be '#' if `j` is 0, or `j` is equal to `w - 1`, or `i` is 0, or `i` equals `h - 1`. If `w` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `j` remains undefined. If `h` is at least 1 and `i` is 1, then `i` is constant, and the checks will determine the output character for each `j`. The final state will reflect the values of `h`, `w`, and `i` as unchanged, with `j` ranging from 0 to `w - 1`.**
