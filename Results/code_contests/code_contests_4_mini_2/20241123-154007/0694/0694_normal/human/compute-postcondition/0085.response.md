The code prints a `#` character to the output. The initial state of the variables does not change as the print statement only affects the output and does not modify any variables. Therefore, the output state is as follows: `h` is greater than or equal to 1, `w` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, and the output includes the printed character `#`.

Output State: **`h` is greater than or equal to 1, `w` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, and the output is '#'**
