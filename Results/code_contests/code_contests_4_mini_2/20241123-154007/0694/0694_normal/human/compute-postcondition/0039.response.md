Output State: **`H` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `H` ≤ 300, `W` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `W` ≤ 300, `h` is greater than 0, `i` is less than `h - 1`, and `j` is equal to `W - 1` after the loop completes execution. The print statement is prepared but has no output because there is no specific string provided to be printed.**
