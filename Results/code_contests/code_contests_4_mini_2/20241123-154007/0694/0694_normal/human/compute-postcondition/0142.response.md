According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `h`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `h`. At the end of the last iteration, the variable `i` has its current value, and `h` remains unchanged. To determine whether the loop can execute one more time, we need to know the value of `i` at the end of the last iteration.

Since the loop runs for `h` iterations, at the end of the last iteration, `i` must be `h - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `h`, which means `i` would need to be incremented to `h`.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `i` to `h` for the loop to execute one more time. The values of `h` and `w` remain unchanged.

State: **`h` remains unchanged, `w` remains unchanged, `i` is h**
