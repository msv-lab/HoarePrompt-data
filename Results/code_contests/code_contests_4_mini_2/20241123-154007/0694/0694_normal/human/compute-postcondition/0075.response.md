According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the width `w`. The loop iterates over the range from 0 to `w - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `w - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `w - 1`. Therefore, `j` needs to be adjusted to `w`, and since the loop will be starting from `j = 0` again, the conditions regarding `h` and `w` do not change.

State: **`h` is greater than or equal to 1, `w` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is equal to `w`**
