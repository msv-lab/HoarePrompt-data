The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is an input integer greater than or equal to 1, `w` is an input integer greater than or equal to 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State: **`h` is an input integer greater than or equal to 1, `w` is an input integer greater than or equal to 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
