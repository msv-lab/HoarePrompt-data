According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `j`. The loop is set to run for values of `j` ranging from 0 to `W - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. 

Since the loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `W`, we need to ensure `j` is updated correctly to reflect the next iteration. Thus, `j` will become 1, and we should also confirm that `W` remains within its established bounds.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `j` should be updated to 1.

No other states need to be adjusted since `H`, `W`, and `h` do not change with each iteration of the loop.

State: **`H` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `H` ≤ 300, `W` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `W` ≤ 301, `h` is greater than 0, `i` is not specified, `j` is 1**
