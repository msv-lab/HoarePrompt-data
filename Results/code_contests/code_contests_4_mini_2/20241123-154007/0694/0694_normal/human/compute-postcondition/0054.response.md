Postcondition: ***`H` and `W` are integers such that 3 ≤ `H` ≤ 300 and 3 ≤ `W` ≤ 300; `h` is greater than 0; `i` is equal to `h - 1`, and `j` is 2. If `i` is 0 or `j` is 0 or `i` is equal to `h - 1` or `j` is equal to `W - 1`, the printed character is '#'. Otherwise, the printed character is '.'.***
