The `print('#')` statement outputs the string `#` to the console. The values of the variables `H`, `W`, `h`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged, as the print statement does not modify any of them. Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged values of all variables and indicates that `#` has been printed.

Output State: **`H` and `W` are integers such that 3 ≤ `H` ≤ 300 and 3 ≤ `W` ≤ 300; `h` is greater than 0; `i` is equal to `h - 1`; `j` is 1; and `#` has been printed.**
