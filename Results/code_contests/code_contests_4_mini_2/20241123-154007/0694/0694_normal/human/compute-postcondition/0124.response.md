According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the value of `h` is greater than 0, and since both `h` and `w` are guaranteed to be greater than or equal to 1, the loop will definitely execute. The loop variable `i` will start at 0. 

Therefore, the necessary adjustments to the state are minimal since `h` is already valid for execution, and `i` should be initialized to 0 before entering the loop.

State: **`h` is greater than or equal to 1, `w` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0**
