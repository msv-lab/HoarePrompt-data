The code executes a `print` statement that outputs the character `#`. The variables `h`, `w`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged as printing does not affect their values. Therefore, the output state is: `h` remains unchanged, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `h`, and `j` is equal to `w - 1`, and the output is `#`.

Output State: **`h` remains unchanged, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `h`, `j` is equal to `w - 1`, and the output is `#`**
