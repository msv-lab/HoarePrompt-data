Postcondition: ***`H` is an integer such that 3 ≤ H ≤ 300, `W` is an integer such that 3 ≤ W ≤ 300, `h` is greater than 0, and if either `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `W - 1`, then the output printed is '#'. Otherwise, if `i` is greater than 0 and less than `h - 1`, and `j` is greater than 0 and less than `W - 1`, a dot is printed to the console. This ensures that the boundaries of the grid defined by `h` and `W` are correctly represented.***
