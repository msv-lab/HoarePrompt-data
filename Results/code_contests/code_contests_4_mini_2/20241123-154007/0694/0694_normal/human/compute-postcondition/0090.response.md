The code executes a print statement, which outputs the character '#'. The values of variables `h`, `w`, `i`, and `j` are not affected by the print statement. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables as well as the output produced by the print statement.

Output State: **`h` is greater than or equal to 1, `w` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, and the output is '#'**
