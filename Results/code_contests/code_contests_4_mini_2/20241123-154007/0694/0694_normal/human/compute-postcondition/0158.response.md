Output State: **`h` remains unchanged, `w` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `h`, and `j` iterates from 0 to `w - 1`. If `w` is 0, the loop does not execute, and nothing is printed. If `w` is greater than 0, for each value of `j`, character `#` is printed if `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `w - 1`; otherwise, a dot `.` is printed.**
