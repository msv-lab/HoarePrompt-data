According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `h`. The loop will execute if `i` is less than `h`. At the end of the last iteration, `h` is greater than `i`, and since `i` is equal to `h`, the loop does not execute. For the loop to be able to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `h`. Therefore, `i` needs to be adjusted to be one less than `h`, which is `h - 1`. 

The values of `w` and `j` do not need to be adjusted as they are not related to the loop condition. 

State: **`h` is greater than `i`, `w` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `h - 1`, `j` is unchanged**
