The code prints the character `#`. The values of the variables `H`, `W`, `h`, `i`, and `j` are not modified by this operation, and the output of the print function does not change the state of any variable. Therefore, the output state remains the same, reflecting the original values of the variables.

Output State: **`H` is an integer such that 3 ≤ H ≤ 300, `W` is an integer such that 4 ≤ W ≤ 301, `h` is greater than 0, `i` is not specified, `j` is 0**
