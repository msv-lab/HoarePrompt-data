According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the width `w`. The loop iterates over the range from 0 to `w - 1`, which means it can execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, the state indicates that `j` is currently at a value that has not been specified but is within the bounds of the loop.

Since `h` is greater than or equal to 1 and `w` is greater than or equal to 1, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `w - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be adjusted to be equal to `w - 1`, as this is the last valid index for `j` to ensure the loop can continue.

State: **`h` is greater than or equal to 1, `w` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is equal to `w - 1`**
