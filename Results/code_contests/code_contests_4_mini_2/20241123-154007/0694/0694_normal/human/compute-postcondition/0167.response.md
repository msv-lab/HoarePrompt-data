According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` in relation to `w`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `w`. At the end of the last iteration, `w` is greater than 0, and since `j` has not been specified, it can be inferred that `j` has been incremented in the last iteration and is now equal to `w - 1`. 

To allow the loop to execute one more time, `w` must be at least 1, and `j` must be adjusted to 0. However, since `j` has reached `w - 1`, it cannot execute again unless `w` is increased. 

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are that `w` should be greater than `w - 1`, meaning that `w` should be at least 2. The variable `j` should also be reset to 0.

State: **`h` is greater than `i`, `w` is greater than 1, `i` is equal to `h`, `j` is 0**
