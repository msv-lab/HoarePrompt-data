According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `h`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `h`. At the end of the last iteration, `h` is greater than or equal to 1, and `i` must be adjusted to reflect the next iteration. Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 1. 

Since `h` is already greater than or equal to 1, it will allow the loop to execute again. There are no other states that need to be adjusted.

State: **`h` is greater than or equal to 1, `w` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1**
