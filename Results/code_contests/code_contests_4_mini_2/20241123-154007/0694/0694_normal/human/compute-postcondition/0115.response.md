According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j`. The loop iterates over the range from 0 to `w`, and since `j` is currently 2, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 3. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `w` is greater than or equal to 2, which allows for `j` to be 2, but to allow for one more iteration, `w` must also be at least 4 (so that `j` can be 3). Therefore, the state needs to reflect that `w` is greater than or equal to 4, and `j` must be adjusted to 3.

State: **`h` remains unchanged, `w` is greater than or equal to 4, `i` is less than `h`, and `j` is 3.**
