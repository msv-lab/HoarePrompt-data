Output State: **`H` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `H` ≤ 300, `W` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `W` ≤ 300, `h` is greater than 0, `i` is not specified, and `j` ranges from 0 to `W - 1`. For each value of `j`, if `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `W - 1`, then a '#' is printed. Otherwise, if `i` is greater than 0 and less than `h - 1`, and `j` is greater than 0 and less than `W - 1`, a '.' is printed. If `W` is less than 3, the loop does not execute, and `W` remains unchanged. If `h` is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute, and `h` remains unchanged.**
