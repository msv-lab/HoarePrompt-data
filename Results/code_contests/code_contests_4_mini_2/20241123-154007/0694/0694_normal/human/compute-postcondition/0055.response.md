According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the upper bound `W`. The loop iterates over the range from 0 to `W - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 3. The loop can continue executing as long as `j` is less than `W`.

Since `W` is already greater than or equal to 3, and `j` is currently 2, no other states need to be adjusted. The only necessary adjustment is to reflect the increment of `j`.

State: **`H` and `W` are integers such that 3 ≤ `H` ≤ 300 and 3 ≤ `W` ≤ 300; `h` is greater than 0; `i` is equal to `h - 1`, and `j` is 3.**
