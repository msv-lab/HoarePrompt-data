According to the code, the loop will execute based on the value of `w`. For the loop to execute, `w` must be at least 1 (i.e., `W` must be greater than 0). The variable `j` will start from 0 and will increment until it reaches `w - 1`. Since `W` is an integer between 3 and 300, it guarantees that `w` will also be at least 3. Therefore, the loop can execute as long as `W` holds its defined range.

At the beginning of the loop, `j` will be initialized to 0. 

So for the loop to be executed, `W` must be greater than 0, and `j` will start at 0.

State: **`H` is an integer such that 3 ≤ H ≤ 300, `W` is an integer such that 3 ≤ W ≤ 300, `h` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 0**
