The `print('#')` statement outputs the string `#` to the console. The values of the variables `h`, `i`, `w`, and `j` are not affected by this print operation. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged regarding the variable values.

Output State: **`h` is greater than `i`, `w` is greater than 1, `i` is equal to `h`, and `j` is 1**
