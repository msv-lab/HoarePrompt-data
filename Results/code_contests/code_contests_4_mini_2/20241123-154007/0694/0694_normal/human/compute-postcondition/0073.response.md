The code executes a print statement which outputs a period ('.') to the console. The values of the variables `h`, `w`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the original values and notes the printed output.

Output State: **`h` is greater than or equal to 1, `w` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is equal to `w - 1`, and a period ('.') is printed to the console.**
