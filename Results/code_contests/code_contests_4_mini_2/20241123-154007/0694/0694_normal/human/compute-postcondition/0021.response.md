The `print` statement does not produce any output since there are no arguments provided to print. Additionally, the values of the variables `H`, `W`, `h`, `i`, and `j` are not affected by this statement. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`H` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `H` ≤ 300, `W` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `W` ≤ 300, `h` is greater than 0, `i` is not specified, and `j` ranges from 0 to `W - 1**
