The code snippet executes a print statement, which outputs a dot ('.') but does not change the values of any variables. The variables remain unchanged after this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the initial conditions of the variables.

Output State: **`h` remains unchanged, `w` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `h`, `j` is equal to `w - 1, and a dot (.) is printed.**
