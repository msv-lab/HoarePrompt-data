The code assigns new values to `h` and `w` based on user input, where `raw_input()` accepts space-separated integers and `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers. The previous conditions state that `h` is greater than or equal to 1 and `w` is greater than or equal to 1, but the new values of `h` and `w` will replace the previous values. Therefore, the output state reflects that `h` and `w` can now be any integers that are input.

Output State: **`h` is an input integer greater than or equal to 1; `w` is an input integer greater than or equal to 1**
