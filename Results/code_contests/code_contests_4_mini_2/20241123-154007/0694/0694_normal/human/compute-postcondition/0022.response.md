According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `h`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `h`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is not specified, and `h` is greater than 0. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased by 1 compared to its value at the end of the last iteration. Since `h` is greater than 0, we can assume `i` was less than `h` in the previous iteration. 

To allow for one more execution of the loop, we must adjust the state to indicate that `i` is now equal to its previous value plus 1, and `h` must remain the same to ensure that the loop condition still holds. 

Since we do not have the exact value of `i`, we can denote it as "i is less than h - 1" to ensure the loop has one more execution left.

State: **`H` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `H` ≤ 300, `W` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `W` ≤ 300, `h` is greater than 0, `i` is less than `h - 1**.
