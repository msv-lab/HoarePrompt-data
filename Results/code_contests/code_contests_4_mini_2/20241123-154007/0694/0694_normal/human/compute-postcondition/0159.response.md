Output State: **`h` remains unchanged, `w` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `h`, and `j` iterates from 0 to `w - 1`. If `w` is 0, nothing is printed. If `w` is greater than 0, the output consists of characters based on the conditions described, but nothing is explicitly printed due to the empty `print` statement.**
