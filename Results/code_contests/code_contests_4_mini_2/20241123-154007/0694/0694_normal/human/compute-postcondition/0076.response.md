The code executes a print statement that outputs the character `#`. The values of the variables `h`, `w`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `h` is greater than or equal to 1, `w` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is equal to `w`, and `#` is printed.

Output State: **`h` is greater than or equal to 1, `w` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is equal to `w`, and `#` is printed.**
