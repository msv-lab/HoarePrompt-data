Postcondition: ***`h` is greater than or equal to 1, `w` is greater than 2, `i` is 1, and `j` is 2. If `i` is 0 or `j` is 0 or `i` is equal to `h - 1` (which is not possible here since `i` is 1 and `h` is at least 1) or `j` is equal to `w - 1` (which is also not possible since `j` is 2 and `w` is greater than 2), the character '#' is printed. Otherwise, a dot (.) is printed. All conditions are accounted for, ensuring that the output character is determined based on the values of `i` and `j` relative to the boundaries defined by `h` and `w`.***
