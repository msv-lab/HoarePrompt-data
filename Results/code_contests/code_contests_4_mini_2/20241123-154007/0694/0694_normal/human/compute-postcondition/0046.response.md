Postcondition: ***`H` and `W` are integers such that 3 ≤ `H` ≤ 300 and 3 ≤ `W` ≤ 300, `h` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `h - 1`, and `j` is 0. If `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is equal to `h - 1`, or `j` is equal to `W - 1`, the output is `#`. Otherwise, `i` is greater than 0 and less than `h - 1`, and `j` is greater than 0 and less than `W - 1`, resulting in the output being `.`.***
