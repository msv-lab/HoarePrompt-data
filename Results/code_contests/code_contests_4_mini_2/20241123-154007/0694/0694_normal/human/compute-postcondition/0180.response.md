According to the code, the `while True` loop will always execute, as it has no terminating condition. Since the loop can execute indefinitely, there are no adjustments needed to the states of `h` and `w`. They can remain unchanged as the loop will continue to run as long as there are no external conditions affecting its execution.

State: **After the loop executes, `h` remains unchanged and is greater than or equal to 1, `w` remains unchanged and is greater than or equal to 0.**
