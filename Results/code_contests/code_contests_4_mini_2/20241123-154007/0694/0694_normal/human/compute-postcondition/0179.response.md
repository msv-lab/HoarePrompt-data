Output State: **After the loop executes, `h` remains unchanged and is greater than or equal to 1, `w` remains unchanged and is greater than or equal to 0. If `w` is greater than 0, the loop prints '#' for the borders and '.' for the inner area of a grid of dimensions `h` by `w`. If `w` is 0, the loop does not execute, and nothing is printed, while `h` and `w` remain unchanged.**
