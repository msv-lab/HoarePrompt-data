Output State: **`h` is greater than or equal to 1, `w` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` varies from 0 to `h - 1`, `j` varies from 0 to `w - 1`. The output consists of '#' for the borders of a rectangle defined by `h` and `w`, and '.' for the inner area. If `h` is 1 or `w` is 1, the rectangle will only consist of '#'. If either `h` or `w` were less than 1 (which they cannot be in this scenario), the loop would not execute and no output would be produced.**
