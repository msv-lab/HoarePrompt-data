The function accepts an integer input `K` that specifies a maximum length and a string input `S`. It prints the entire string `S` if its length is less than or equal to `K`; otherwise, it prints the first `K` characters of `S` followed by '...'. The function does not accept any parameters and always returns the integer 0.
