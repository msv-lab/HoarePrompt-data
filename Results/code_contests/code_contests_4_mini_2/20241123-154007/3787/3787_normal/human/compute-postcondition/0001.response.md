The value of `S` is assigned the result of `input().strip()`, which means `S` will now hold a string input from the user with any leading or trailing whitespace removed. The variable `K` remains unchanged since it is not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `S` as an input string while keeping `K` as an integer between 1 and 100.

Output State: **`K` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `S` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed**
