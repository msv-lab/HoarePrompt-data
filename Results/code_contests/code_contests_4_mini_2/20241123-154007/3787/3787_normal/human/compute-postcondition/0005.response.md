The code prints the first `K` characters of the string `S` followed by '...'. Since `K` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and the length of `S` is greater than `K`, the output will be the first `K` characters of `S` concatenated with '...'. The values of `K` and `S` are not changed by the print statement, and there are no other variables affected.

Output State: **`K` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `S` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed; the output is S[:K] + '...'**
