Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the input when reading from standard input. Specifically, the use of `iter(sys.stdin.readlines()).next` is incorrect, as it raises an `AttributeError`. The correct approach would be to use `next(iter(sys.stdin.readlines()))` to retrieve the next line. However, even if this were corrected, there is a potential issue with how the program handles the input. 

For instance, if the input were provided as:
```
7
nikoandsolstice
```
the program would function correctly, but if the input format is slightly different, such as an empty line or unexpected whitespace, the program could fail or produce an unintended output. 

Additionally, if the input for K is outside the specified range (even though the problem states that K will always be valid), the program does not enforce this constraint. 

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements in every potential case, leading to the conclusion of incorrectness.
