The function accepts an integer `K` (which is the maximum length of the string to display, expected to be between 1 and 100) and a string `S`. It prints the entire string `S` if its length is less than or equal to `K`. If the length of `S` exceeds `K`, it prints the first `K` characters of `S` followed by '...'. The function always returns 0. Note that the function does not validate the input values for `K` and `S`, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the inputs do not meet the expected criteria.
