The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `K`, which is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), and `S`, which is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100 (inclusive). After executing the function body, the function returns the integer 0 regardless of the values of `K` and `S`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept an integer `K` and a string `S`, and it always returns 0. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters K (an integer between 1 and 100) and S (a string of lowercase letters), and it always returns 0.**
