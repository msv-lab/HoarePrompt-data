The value of `K` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous value of `K` could be any integer between 1 and 100, but the exact value is not specified. The variable `S` remains unaffected. Therefore, the output state is that `K` is an integer between 1 and 100, and `K` is now an input integer.

Output State: **`K` is an integer between 1 and 100, `S` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100, and `K` is now an input integer**
