The code prints the first `K` characters of the string `S` followed by an ellipsis ('...'). Since `S` is stripped of whitespace and has a length greater than `K`, the slice `S[:K]` will successfully retrieve the first `K` characters of `S`. The value of `K` determines how many characters are taken from `S`.

The output will not alter the state of `K` or `S`, but it will produce a printed output. The output state will include the values of `K` and `S`, and the printed result will be `S[:K] + '...'`.

Output State: **`K` is an integer between 1 and 100, `S` is an input string stripped of whitespace, and the printed output is `S[:K] + '...'`**
