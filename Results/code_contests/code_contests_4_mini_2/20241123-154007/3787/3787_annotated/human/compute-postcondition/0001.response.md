The variable `S` is assigned the value of `input().strip()`, which means it will take an input string from the user and remove any leading or trailing whitespace. The integer variable `K` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `K` is an integer between 1 and 100, and `S` is an input string stripped of whitespace.

Output State: **`K` is an integer between 1 and 100, `S` is an input string stripped of whitespace**
