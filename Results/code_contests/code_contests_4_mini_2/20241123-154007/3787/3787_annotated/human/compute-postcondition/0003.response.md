The code prints the value of `S`. The value of `S` is an input string stripped of whitespace, and its length is less than or equal to `K`, which is an integer between 1 and 100. However, since the content of `S` is not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine its specific value.

Output State: **`K` is an integer between 1 and 100, `S` is an input string stripped of whitespace, and the length of `S` is less than or equal to `K`; the value of `S` is printed.**
