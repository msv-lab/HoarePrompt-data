Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads an integer `K` and a string `S` from standard input, which adheres to the constraints (1 ≤ K ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ |S| ≤ 100).

2. **Length Check**:
   - It checks if the length of `S` is less than or equal to `K`. If true, it simply prints `S`, which is correct as per the problem description.

3. **Truncation and Appending**:
   - If the length of `S` exceeds `K`, it correctly extracts the first `K` characters from `S` and appends '...' to the end before printing. This behavior matches the requirement of the prompt precisely.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge cases where:
     - `S` has a length equal to `K`.
     - `S` has a length greater than `K`.
   - Additionally, it handles cases where `S` has a length less than `K` without any issues.

5. **Output**:
   - The output format matches the requirements of the problem, ensuring that the output string is as specified in the prompt.

Since the program executes as expected for all potential cases and adheres to the problem description without missing any logic or edge cases, it is deemed correct.
