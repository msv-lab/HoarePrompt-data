According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the string `S`. The loop will continue executing as long as there are characters left in the string `S`. At the end of the last iteration, `S` consists of characters '0' and '1' with at least 1 character, and the first character `c` has already been processed.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider that one character has been processed. Therefore, the string `S` must be adjusted to reflect that one character has been consumed. 

If `S` originally had at least 1 character, after processing the first character, `S` will now have at least 0 characters remaining. However, since we need to indicate that the loop can still execute, we need to ensure there is at least 1 character left in `S` for the next iteration.

This means that `S` must be adjusted to reflect that it contains only the remaining characters after the first character has been processed. 

Thus, we can adjust `S` to be a string of characters '0' and '1' with at least 0 characters left, and since we don't have specific information on the remaining characters, we will keep it general.

State: **`S` is a string of characters '0' and '1' with at least 0 characters left**
