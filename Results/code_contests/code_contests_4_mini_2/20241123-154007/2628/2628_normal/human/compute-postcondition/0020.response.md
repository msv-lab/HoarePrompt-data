Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `S` consisting of characters '0' and '1', counts the occurrences of '0's and '1's in the string, and prints the maximum count between the two. If `S` is an empty string, it will simply print 0 since both counts will remain at their initialized value of 0. The function does not return any value. **
