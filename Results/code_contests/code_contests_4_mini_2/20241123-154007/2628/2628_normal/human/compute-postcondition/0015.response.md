Postcondition: ***`S` is a string composed of characters '0' and '1' with at least 1 character. If `c` is '0', then `s0` is increased by 1. If `c` is '1', then `s1` is increased by 1. The values of `s0` and `s1` reflect the count of '0's and '1's in `S`, respectively, depending on the value of `c`.***
