The variables `s0` and `s1` are both initialized to 0. The previous state of `S` is a string consisting of '0' and '1'. The assignment of `s0` and `s1` does not depend on the value of `S` and does not change the state of `S`. Therefore, the output state reflects the initial values of `S`, `s0`, and `s1`.

Output State: **`S` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1', `s0` is 0, `s1` is 0**
