The operation `s1 += 1` attempts to increment `s1` by 1. However, since `s1` is not defined in the initial state and `S` is a string, this operation will result in an error if `s1` was not previously defined. 

Therefore, the output state is: `S` is a string of characters '0' and '1' with at least 0 characters left; `s1` is not defined.

Output State: **`S` is a string of characters '0' and '1' with at least 0 characters left; `s1` is not defined.**
