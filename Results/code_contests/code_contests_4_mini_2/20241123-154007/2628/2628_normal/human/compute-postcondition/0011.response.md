Postcondition: ***`S` is a string composed of characters '0' and '1' with at least 0 characters. If `c` is '0', then `s0` is incremented by 1. If `c` is '1', then `s1` is incremented by 1. In both cases, `s0` and `s1` are not defined before the program fragment is executed and will only be defined after the increment operation.***
