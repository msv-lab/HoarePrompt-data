The value of `s1` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `s1` is 0, so after execution, `s1` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `S` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with at least 1 character, `s0` is 0, `s1` is 1, and the first character of `S` is '1'.

Output State: **`S` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with at least 1 character, `s0` is 0, `s1` is 1, and the first character of `S` is '1'**.
