The value of `s0` is incremented by 1. Since `s0` was initially 0, after execution, `s0` becomes 1. The values of other variables `S`, `s1`, and `c` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `S` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with at least 1 character, `s0` is 1, `s1` is 0, and the first character `c` of `S` is '0'.

Output State: **`S` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with at least 1 character, `s0` is 1, `s1` is 0, and the first character `c` of `S` is '0'**
