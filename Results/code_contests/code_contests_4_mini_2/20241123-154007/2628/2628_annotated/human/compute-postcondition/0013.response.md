The value of `s0` is incremented by 1. Since `s0` can either be 1 or 2, after the increment, `s0` will either be 2 or 3. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `S` is the substring of `S` starting from the third character, `c` is the next character in `S`, `s0` is either 2 or 3, `s1` is either 0 or 1 or `s1` is either 1 or 2, `s0` is either 0 or 1.

Output State: **`S` is the substring of `S` starting from the third character, `c` is the next character in `S`, `s0` is either 2 or 3, `s1` is either 0 or 1 or `s1` is either 1 or 2, `s0` is either 0 or 1**
