Postcondition: ***`S` is the substring of `S` starting from the second character. If `c` is '0', then `s0` is either 1 or 2 after being incremented by 1, and `s1` remains either 0 or 1. If `c` is not '0' (i.e., it is '1'), then `s1` is either 1 or 2 after being incremented by 1, and `s0` remains either 0 or 1.***
