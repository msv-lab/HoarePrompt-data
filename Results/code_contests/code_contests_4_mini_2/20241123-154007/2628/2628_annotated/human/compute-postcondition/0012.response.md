According to the code, the loop will execute again for each character `c` in the substring `S`. At the end of the last iteration, `S` is already a substring that starts from the second character. The variable `c` will take the next character in `S` during the next iteration. 

To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the length of `S`. Since `S` is the substring starting from the second character, it implies that the original string had at least two characters. 

The variables `s0` and `s1` are affected by the value of `c`, but we need to ensure that `S` has more characters left for the loop to proceed. If `c` is '0', `s0` will be either 1 or 2, and `s1` will remain either 0 or 1. If `c` is '1', `s1` will be either 1 or 2, and `s0` will remain either 0 or 1. 

Thus, for the loop to continue, we must ensure that `S` has at least one more character after the current character being processed. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `S` to reflect that it now starts from the third character. 

State: **`S` is the substring of `S` starting from the third character, `c` is the next character in `S`, `s0` is either 1 or 2, `s1` is either 0 or 1 or `s1` is either 1 or 2, `s0` is either 0 or 1.**
