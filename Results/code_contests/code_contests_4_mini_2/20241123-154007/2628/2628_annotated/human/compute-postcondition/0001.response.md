`S` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1', and the variables `s0` and `s1` are both initialized to 0. The code assigns the value of `s0` and `s1` to 0, so their values remain unchanged. The output state reflects the current values of the variables. 

Output State: **`S` is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1'; `s0` is 0; `s1` is 0**
