The value of `s1` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `s1` can be either 0, 1, or 2. Therefore, the new value of `s1` can be either 1, 2, or 3 respectively. The values of `S`, `c`, and `s0` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`S` is the substring of `S` starting from the third character, `c` is the next character in `S`, `s0` is either 1 or 2, `s1` is either 1, 2, or 3, `s0` is either 0 or 1.**
