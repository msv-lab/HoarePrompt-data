The variable `s0` is incremented by 1. Previously, `s0` was 0, so after execution, `s0` becomes 1. The values of the other variables (`S`, `s1`, and `c`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `S` is a non-empty string consisting of characters '0' and '1', `s0` is 1, `s1` is 0, and the first character `c` of `S` is '0'.

Output State: **`S` is a non-empty string consisting of characters '0' and '1', `s0` is 1, `s1` is 0, and the first character `c` of `S` is '0'**
