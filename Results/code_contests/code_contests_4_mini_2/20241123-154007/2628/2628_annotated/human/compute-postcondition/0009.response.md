The value of `s0` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `s0` can either be 0 or 1, so after execution, `s0` can be either 1 or 2. The values of `S` and `s1` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `S` is the substring of S starting from the second character, `s0` is either 1 or 2, and `s1` is either 0 or 1.

Output State: **`S` is the substring of S starting from the second character, `s0` is either 1 or 2, `s1` is either 0 or 1**
