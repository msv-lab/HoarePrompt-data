Postcondition: ***`S` is the substring of `S` starting from the third character, `c` is the next character in `S`. If `c` is '0', then `s0` is either 2 or 3, and `s1` remains either 0 or 1. If `c` is not '0', then `s0` remains either 1 or 2, and `s1` is incremented, resulting in `s1` being either 1, 2, or 3. In either case, `s0` can only be 0 or 1.***
