The value of `s1` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `s1` is either 0 or 1. Therefore, the new value of `s1` will be either 1 or 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`S` is the substring of S starting from the second character, `s0` is either 0 or 1, `s1` is either 1 or 2**
