The value of `s1` is incremented by 1, and the previous value of `s1` is 0. After execution, `s1` becomes 1. The states of the other variables (`S`, `s0`, and `c`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `S` is a non-empty string consisting of characters '0' and '1', `s0` is 0, `s1` is 1, and `c` is '1'.

Output State: **`S` is a non-empty string consisting of characters '0' and '1', `s0` is 0, `s1` is 1, and `c` is '1'**
