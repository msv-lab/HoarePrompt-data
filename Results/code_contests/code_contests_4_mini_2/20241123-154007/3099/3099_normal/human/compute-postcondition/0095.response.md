Output State: **If `plen` is greater than 0, the loop will execute for each index `i` from 0 to `plen - 1`. If at any point `p[i]` is equal to '?' and `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, or if `p[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, then `y` is set to False and the loop breaks. If all checks pass through the loop, `y` remains True. If `plen` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `y` remains True.**
