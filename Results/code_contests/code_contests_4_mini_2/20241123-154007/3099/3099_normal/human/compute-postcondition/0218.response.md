The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `y0` is either True or False, `y1` is False, `i` is less than `p1len`, `p1len` is greater than 0, and 'NO' is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
