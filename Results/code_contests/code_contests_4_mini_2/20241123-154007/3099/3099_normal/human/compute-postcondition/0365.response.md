The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `p1len` is greater than or equal to 0, `qr` is defined, `y1` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `y0` is False, `p0len` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, the element at index `i` of `p0` is equal to '?', and the character at index `i` of `q` is not in `good_letters`; the output is 'NO' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
