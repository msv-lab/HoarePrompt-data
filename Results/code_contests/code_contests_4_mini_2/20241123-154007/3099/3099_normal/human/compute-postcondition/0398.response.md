Postcondition: ***If `p0len` is greater than 0 and `y0` is False, the loop will continue to the next iteration without modifying `p1len`, `qr`, `y1`, `n`, `q`, and `qlen`. If `p0len` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `y0` remains True, leaving `p1len`, `qr`, `y1`, `n`, `q`, and `qlen` unchanged.***
