Postcondition: ***`y0` and `y1` can be either True or False. If both `y0` and `y1` are True, the program prints 'YES'. If either `y0` or `y1` is False, or if the intersection of `t` with `good_letters` is non-empty, the program does not print anything. The loop continues only if there are no elements from `t` in `good_letters`.***
