Postcondition: ***`y` is False, `i` is `plen - 1`, and `plen` remains unchanged. If `p[i]` is equal to '?', and `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, the output is 'NO', `y` remains False, and execution breaks out of the loop. If `q[i]` is in `good_letters`, there is no output, and the state of `y`, `i`, and `plen` continues unchanged. If `p[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, the function prints 'NO', sets `y` to False, and breaks out of the loop. If `p[i]` is equal to `q[i]`, the values of `y`, `i`, and `plen` remain unchanged.***
