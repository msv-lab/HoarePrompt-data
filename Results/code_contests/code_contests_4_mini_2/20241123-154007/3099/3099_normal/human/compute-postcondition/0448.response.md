The `continue` statement does not modify the values of any variables, but it causes the program to skip the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged in terms of variable values, but we acknowledge that the loop iteration is being skipped.

Output State: **`t` is a slice of `q` that contains elements starting from index `p0len` to the end of `q` if `p1len` is 0, or from index `p0len` to the index calculated as `-p1len`, and there is at least one element in `t` that is present in the `good_letters` set; we skip the remaining code in the current loop iteration.**
