Postcondition: ***`y` is True if all characters in `p` match those in `q`, or if `plen` is 0; `n` is greater than 1; `q` is an input string; `qlen` is the length of `q`. If `qlen` does not equal `plen`, the program prints 'NO' and continues to the next iteration of the loop, indicating that there is a mismatch in lengths. If `qlen` equals `plen`, the program proceeds without printing.***
