Postcondition: ***`y` is True, indicating that all checks in the loop have passed successfully. The variables `plen`, `p`, and `q` are defined such that if `plen` is greater than 0, the loop has executed for each index `i` from 0 to `plen - 1`, ensuring that for each index, either `p[i]` is not equal to '?' or `q[i]` is in `good_letters`, and that `p[i]` is equal to `q[i]`. If `plen` is 0, the loop has not executed, and `y` remains True.***
