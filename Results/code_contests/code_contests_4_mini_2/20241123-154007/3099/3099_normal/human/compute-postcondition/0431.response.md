The value of `y1` is assigned `False`. The previous value of `y1` was `True`, but it is now updated to `False`. Other variables (`i`, `p1len`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `y1` is False, `i` is k + 1, `p1len` is greater than k + 1, and the output is 'NO'.

Output State: **`y1` is False, `i` is k + 1, `p1len` is greater than k + 1, and the output is 'NO'**
