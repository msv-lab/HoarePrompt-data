The `continue` statement is encountered, which causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop. The values of the variables do not change as a result of this statement. Therefore, the output state reflects the existing values of the variables without any modifications.

Output State: **`y0` is either True or False, `y1` is either True or False, intersection of `t` with `good_letters` is empty, `n` is greater than the current iteration count, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, and the output is 'NO'**
