Postcondition: ***`p1len` is greater than or equal to 0, `qr` is defined, `y1` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, and `y0` is set to False. If the character at index 1 of `p0` is a '?', 'NO' is printed and the execution breaks if the character at index 1 of `q` is not in `good_letters`. If the character at index 1 of `p0` is not a '?', 'NO' is printed and the execution breaks if the character at index 1 of `p0` does not match the character at index 1 of `q`. If the characters match or if `q[1]` is in `good_letters`, the program continues executing without any changes to the variables.***
