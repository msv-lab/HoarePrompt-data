The `print('NO')` statement outputs the string 'NO' to the console. It does not change the values of any variables; thus, `y`, `i`, and `plen` remain as they were in the initial state. The output from the `print` statement does not affect the state of the variables.

Output State: **`y` is False if the first element of `p` is a '?' and the first element of `q` is not in `good_letters`, or if the first element of `p` is not equal to the first element of `q`; `i` is incremented by 1 (i + 1), `plen` remains unchanged, and 'NO' is printed.**
