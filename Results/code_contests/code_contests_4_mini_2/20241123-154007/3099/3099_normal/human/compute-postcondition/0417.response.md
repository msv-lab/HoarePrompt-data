The value of `y1` is assigned `False`, changing its previous value from `True` to `False`. The variable `i` remains unchanged as its new value is not calculated in this snippet. The variable `p1len` also remains unchanged, and the print statement indicating 'NO' does not affect the variable states. Therefore, the output state is: `y1` is False, `i` is `i + 1`, `p1len` is unchanged, and 'NO' is printed.

Output State: **`y1` is False, `i` is `i + 1`, `p1len` is unchanged, and 'NO' is printed**
