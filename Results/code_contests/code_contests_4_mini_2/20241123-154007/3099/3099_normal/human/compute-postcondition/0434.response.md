Postcondition: ***`y1` is initially True, `i` is `k + 1`, and `p1len` is greater than `k + 1`. If `p1[i]` is a question mark and `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, then `y1` is set to False; if `qr[i]` is in `good_letters`, `y1` remains True. If `p1[i]` is not a question mark and `p1[i]` differs from `qr[i]`, then `y1` is set to False; if they are equal, `y1` remains True. Thus, after executing the block, `y1` will be False if either condition leads to a mismatch or an invalid character, and will remain True if both conditions are satisfied.***
