The code executes a print statement which outputs 'NO'. The values of the variables `y`, `i`, and `plen` remain unchanged; thus, they retain their initial values. Therefore, the Output State is: `y` is False, `i` is `plen - 1`, and `plen` remains unchanged, and the output is 'NO'.

Output State: **`y` is False, `i` is `plen - 1`, `plen` remains unchanged, and the output is 'NO'**.
