Postcondition: ***`y` is True if all characters in `p` match those in `q` according to the specified conditions, or if `plen` is 0, in which case 'YES' is printed. If `y` is False, it indicates either that a mismatch was found during the comparison or that a '?' in `p` corresponded to a character in `q` that was not in `good_letters`, but in this case, 'YES' is not printed. Thus, 'YES' is printed only when `y` is True, reflecting a successful match or no processing due to `plen` being 0.***
