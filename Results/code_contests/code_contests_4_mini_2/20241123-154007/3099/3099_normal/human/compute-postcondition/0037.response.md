Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`, `p` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?" and "*", and `q` is a string of equal length to `p`. If the character at index `i` of `p` is a '?', and the character at index `i` of `q` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed and `y` is set to False. If the character at index `i` of `p` is a '?', and the character at index `i` of `q` is in `good_letters`, the program continues without any changes to `y`. If the character at index `i` of `p` is not a '?', and it does not match the character at index `i` of `q`, 'NO' is printed and `y` is set to False. If the characters at index `i` of `p` and `q` match, `y` remains True with no further actions taken. In all cases, if any of the conditions to print 'NO' are met, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
