The value of `y1` is assigned the value `False`. The previous value of `y1` was `True`, but now it is changed to `False`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `y0` is False or True; `y1` is False; `qr` is the reverse of an unknown variable `q`; `p1len` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; the element at index `i` of `p1` is not equal to '?'; and the element at index `i` of `p1` is not equal to the element at index `i` of `qr`, and 'NO' is printed.

Output State: **`y0` is False or True; `y1` is False; `qr` is the reverse of an unknown variable `q`; `p1len` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; the element at index `i` of `p1` is not equal to '?'; and the element at index `i` of `p1` is not equal to the element at index `i` of `qr`, and 'NO' is printed.**
