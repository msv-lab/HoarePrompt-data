The `print('NO')` statement outputs the string 'NO' to the console. It does not change the values of any variables, but it indicates a response based on the conditions described in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains consistent with the initial values of the variables.

Output State: **`y` is True, `i` is 0, `plen` is greater than 0, the element at index `i` of the list `p` is equal to '?', and the element at index `i` of the list `q` is not in `good_letters`, and the output is 'NO'**
