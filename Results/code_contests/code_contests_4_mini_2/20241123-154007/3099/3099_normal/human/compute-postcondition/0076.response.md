The value of `y` is assigned `False`, changing its previous value from `True` to `False`. The values of `i` and `plen`, as well as the output string 'NO', remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `y` is False, `i` is 1, `plen` is greater than 1, and the output is 'NO'.

Output State: **`y` is False, `i` is 1, `plen` is greater than 1, and the output is 'NO'**
