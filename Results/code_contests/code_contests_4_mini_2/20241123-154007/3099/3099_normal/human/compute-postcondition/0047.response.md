Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`, `p` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?" and "*", `q` is a string of equal length to `p`, and `i` is `i + 1`. If the character at position `i` in `p` is a '?', then if `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, the output is 'NO', `y` is set to False, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `q[i]` is in `good_letters`, there is no change to `y` or output. If the character at position `i` in `p` is not '?', and if `p[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, the program prints 'NO', sets `y` to False, and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `p[i]` is equal to `q[i]`, no changes occur to `y` or the program flow. In summary, `y` is set to False and 'NO' is printed if either `q[i]` is not in `good_letters` when `p[i]` is '?', or if `p[i]` and `q[i]` are not equal when `p[i]` is not '?`.***
