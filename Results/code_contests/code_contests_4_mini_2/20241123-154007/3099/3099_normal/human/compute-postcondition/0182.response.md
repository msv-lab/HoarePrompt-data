Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`, `p` is an input string with length `plen`, `p0` is the substring of `p` before the first '*', `p1` is the substring of `p` after the first '*' reversed, `p0len` is greater than 0, `p1len` is the length of `p1`, `q` is an input string with length `qlen`, `y0` is False, `p0len` is at least `p0len + 1`, and if the first character of `p0` at index `i` does not match the character of `q` at index `i`, the output is 'NO' and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
