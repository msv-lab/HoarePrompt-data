The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or the most internal statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `y0` is False or True; `y1` is False; `qr` is the reverse of an unknown variable `q`; `p1len` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; the element at index `i` of `p1` is not equal to '?'; and the element at index `i` of `p1` is not equal to the element at index `i` of `qr`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
