The value of `y` is assigned to `False`, changing its state from `True` to `False`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `y` is False, `plen` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `qlen` is not equal to `plen`, the function prints 'NO', `i` is 0, the first element of the list `p` at index `i` is equal to '?', and the element `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`.

Output State: **`y` is False, `plen` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `qlen` is not equal to `plen`, the function prints 'NO', `i` is 0, the first element of the list `p` at index `i` is equal to '?', and the element `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`**
