The value of `y` is explicitly assigned as `False`, and since `y` was already `False`, there is no change in its state. The previous values of the affected variables remain the same, and the console output does not impact the variable states. Therefore, the Output State is: `y` is False, `i` is `plen - 1`, and the console outputs 'NO'.

Output State: **`y` is False, `i` is `plen - 1`, and the console outputs 'NO'**
