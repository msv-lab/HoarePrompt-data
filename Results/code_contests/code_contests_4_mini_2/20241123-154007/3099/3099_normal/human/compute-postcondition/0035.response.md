The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or conditional statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`, `p` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?" and "*", `n` is greater than 0, `plen` is greater than 0, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `y` is False, `i` is 1, and the output is 'NO', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
