Postcondition: ***If `y` is True, the output is 'YES'. If `plen` is 0, `y` remains True and thus 'YES' is printed. If `y` is False, it indicates that either some elements of `p` do not match the corresponding elements of `q`, or there are invalid characters in `p` that do not correspond to `good_letters`, resulting in 'NO' being printed if `n` is greater than 0 and `qlen` is not equal to `plen`.***
