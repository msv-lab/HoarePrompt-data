Postcondition: ***If `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`, then 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `p1[i]` is equal to `qr[i]`, `y1` remains unchanged and the loop continues without any output. In both cases, `y0` remains False, and `i` is equal to `p1len`.***
