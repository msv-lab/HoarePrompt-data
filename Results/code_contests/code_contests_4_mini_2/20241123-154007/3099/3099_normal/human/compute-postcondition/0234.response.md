Postcondition: ***`y0` is either True or False. If `p1[i]` is equal to '?' and `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, then `y1` is set to False and 'NO' is printed, breaking out of the loop. If `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`, then `y1` is also set to False and 'NO' is printed, breaking the loop. In cases where `qr[i]` is in `good_letters`, or if `p1[i]` is equal to `qr[i]`, `y1` remains True, and if `p1[i]` is equal to `qr[i]`, `i` is incremented by 1 as long as `i` is less than `p1len`, which is greater than 0. Thus, `y1` is True if the conditions of matching or valid letters are met, while it is False if either of the two conditions leads to a mismatch or an invalid letter situation.***
