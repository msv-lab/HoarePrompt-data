The code executes a print statement with the string 'NO'. This does not change the values of any variables. 

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the addition that 'NO' is printed. 

Output State: **`y0` is False, `y1` can be either True or False, the intersection of `t` with `good_letters` is empty, `i` is 2, and 'NO' is printed.**
