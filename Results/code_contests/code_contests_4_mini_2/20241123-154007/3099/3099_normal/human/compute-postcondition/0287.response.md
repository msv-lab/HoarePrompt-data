The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `y0` is False, `y1` can be either True or False, the intersection of `t` with `good_letters` is empty, `i` is 2, and 'NO' is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
