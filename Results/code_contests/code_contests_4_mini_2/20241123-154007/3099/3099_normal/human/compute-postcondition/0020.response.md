Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`, `p` is an input string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?" and "*", `n` is greater than 0, `plen` is greater than 0, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `y` is a Boolean variable initialized to True, and `i` is 0 with `p[i]` being a question mark. If the character at index `i` of `q` is not in `good_letters`, then 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the character at index `i` of `q` is in `good_letters`, no changes are made to `y`, and the program continues execution.***
