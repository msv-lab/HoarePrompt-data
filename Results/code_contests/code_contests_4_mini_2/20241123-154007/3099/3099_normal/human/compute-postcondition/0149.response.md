The variable `p1` is assigned the value of `p1` reversed. The previous state of `p1` is not provided, but it is a substring of the input string `p` after the first '*'. Therefore, after execution, `p1` will contain the characters of its previous value in reverse order. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`, `p` is an input string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?" and "*", `n` is an input string, `plen` is the length of `p`, `p0` is the substring of `p` before the first '*', and `p1` is the substring of `p` after the first '*' reversed.**
