Postcondition: ***`y0` is either True or False, `y1` is set to False if `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `p1[i]` is equal to `qr[i]`, `y1` remains True. Additionally, `i` is less than `p1len` and `p1len` is greater than 0, indicating that the index `i` is within the bounds of the list.***
