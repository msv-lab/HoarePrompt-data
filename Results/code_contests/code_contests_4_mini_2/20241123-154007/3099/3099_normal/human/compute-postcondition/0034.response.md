The value of `y` is assigned `False`, changing its previous value of `True` to `False`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`, `p` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?" and "*", `n` is greater than 0, `plen` is greater than 0, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `y` is False, `i` is 1, and the output is 'NO'.
