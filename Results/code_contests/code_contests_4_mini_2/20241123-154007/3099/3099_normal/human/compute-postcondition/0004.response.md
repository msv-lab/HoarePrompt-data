The variable `n` is assigned the value of `input()`, which accepts an input string. The value of `n` will be a string based on user input. The states of the other variables (`good_letters`, `p`, `plen`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`, `p` is an input string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?" and "*", `n` is an input string, and `plen` is the length of `p`.

Output State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`, `p` is an input string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?" and "*", `n` is an input string, and `plen` is the length of `p`**
