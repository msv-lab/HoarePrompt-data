The value of `y1` is assigned to `False`. The initial state indicates that `y1` can either be `True` or `False`, but it is now explicitly set to `False`. The other variables (`y0`, `i`, and the printed output 'NO') remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `y0` is False, `y1` is False, `i` is `p1len`, and 'NO' is printed.

Output State: **`y0` is False, `y1` is False, `i` is p1len, and 'NO' is printed**
