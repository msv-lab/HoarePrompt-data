Postcondition: ***`y0` is False, `y1` remains either True or is set to False. If `p1[i]` is a question mark and `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed and `y1` is set to False, exiting the loop. If `p1[i]` is a question mark and `qr[i]` is in `good_letters`, no change occurs to `y1`, and the loop continues with `i` still equal to `p1len - 1`. If `p1[i]` is not a question mark and is not equal to `qr[i]`, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the loop is exited. If `p1[i]` is not a question mark and is equal to `qr[i]`, the values of `y1` remain unchanged, and the loop continues with `i` still equal to `p1len - 1.`***
