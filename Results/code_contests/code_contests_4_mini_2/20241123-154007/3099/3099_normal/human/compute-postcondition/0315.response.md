According to the code, the loop's execution depends on the variable `i` and the length of `p1`, denoted as `p1len`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `p1len`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is not explicitly provided, but we know that it must be `p1len - 1` or less for the loop to have executed. 

Given the state information:
- `y0` is False,
- `y1` is either still True or set to False.

Since the loop is constructed to iterate over `range(p1len)`, the next value of `i` at the start of the next iteration will be `i + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be adjusted to `p1len - 1` (the last valid index) in the current iteration. 

To ensure the loop can execute again, `i` should be incremented to `p1len` (which is the end of the loop range). There is no need to adjust the values of `y0` or `y1` as they are not dependent on the loop's continuation but rather on the conditions evaluated within the loop body.

Thus, the necessary adjustments for the state would be:
State: **`y0` is False, `y1` is either still True or set to False, `i` is p1len**
