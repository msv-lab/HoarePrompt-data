Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`, `p` is an input string, `n` is greater than 0, `plen` is the length of `p`, `p0` is the substring of `p` before the first '*', `p1` is the substring of `p` after the first '*' reversed, `p0len` is greater than 0, `p1len` is the length of `p1`, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, and `y0` is False. If the character at position `i` of `q` is not in `good_letters`, the program outputs 'NO', sets `y0` to False, and breaks out of the loop. If the character at position `i` of `q` is in `good_letters`, the program continues without any output or modification to `y0`.***
