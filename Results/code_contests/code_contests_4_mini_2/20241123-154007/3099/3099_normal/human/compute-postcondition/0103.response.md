The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. The values of the variables `y`, `plen`, `n`, `qlen`, and the printed output 'NO' do not change as a result of the `continue` statement. Therefore, the output state is: `y` is True, `plen` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, and the function prints 'NO'.

Output State: **`y` is True, `plen` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, and the function prints 'NO'**
