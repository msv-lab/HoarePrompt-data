The `print` statement outputs the string 'NO' to the console. The values of the other variables remain unchanged, as the `print` function does not affect them. Therefore, the output state is: `y0` is False, `y1` can be either True or False, the intersection of `t` with `good_letters` is empty, `n` is greater than the current iteration count, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, `p0len` is greater than 0, and `i` is 1, and the output is 'NO'.
