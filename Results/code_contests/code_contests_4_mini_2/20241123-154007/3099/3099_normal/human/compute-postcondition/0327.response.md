The variable `y1` is assigned the value `False`. The previous value of `y1` was either `True` or `False`, but it is now explicitly set to `False`. The states of the other variables (`y0`, `i`, and the output) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `y0` is False, `y1` is False, `i` is `p1len - 1`, and the output is 'NO'.

Output State: **`y0` is False, `y1` is False, `i` is `p1len - 1`, and the output is 'NO'**
