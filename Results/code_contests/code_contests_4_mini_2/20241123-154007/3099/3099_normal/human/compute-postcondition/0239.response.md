Postcondition: ***If `y1` is False, the loop continues to the next iteration without any change to `y0`, which can either be True or False. If `y1` is True, the loop proceeds to the next iteration as usual, while `y0` remains unchanged. In the case where `p1len` is 0, `y1` is True, and the state of `y0` does not affect the loop execution.***
