Postcondition: ***`y0` and `y1` can be either True or False, `t` is a slice of `q` determined by the value of `p1len`. If the intersection of the elements in `t` with `good_letters` is non-empty, indicating that at least one element of `t` is found in `good_letters`, the program prints 'NO' and skips to the next iteration of the loop. If there are no elements from `t` in `good_letters`, the loop continues without printing anything.***
