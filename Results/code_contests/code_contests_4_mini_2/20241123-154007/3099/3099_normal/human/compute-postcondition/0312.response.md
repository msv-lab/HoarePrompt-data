The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `y0` is False, `y1` is False, `p1len` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, the element `p1[i]` is not equal to '?', and the element `p1[i]` is not equal to the element `qr[i]`, and 'NO' is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
