The variable `y1` is assigned the value `False`. The previous value of `y1` was `True`. The other variables `y0`, `p1len`, `i`, and the contents of the lists `p1` and `qr` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `y0` is False, `y1` is False, `p1len` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, the first element of the list `p1` at index `i` is equal to '?', and the value of `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, and the function prints 'NO'.
