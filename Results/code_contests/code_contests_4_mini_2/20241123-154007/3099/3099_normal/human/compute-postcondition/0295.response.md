Output State: **`y0` is False if any character at index `i` of `p0` is '?' and the corresponding character in `q` is not in `good_letters`, or if any character at index `i` of `p0` does not match the character at index `i` of `q`. If `p0` and `q` match at all indices or if all '?' characters in `p0` correspond to characters in `good_letters`, then `y0` remains True. If `p0` is empty (i.e., `p0len` is 0), the loop does not execute, and `y0` remains True. If `p0len` is greater than 0 and `n` is greater than the current iteration count, then `qlen` is unchanged and `i` will be less than `p0len`.**
