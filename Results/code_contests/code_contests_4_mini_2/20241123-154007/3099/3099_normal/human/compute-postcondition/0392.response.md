Postcondition: ***`p1len` is greater than or equal to 0, `qr` is defined, `y1` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `y0` is set to False. If the character at index `i` of `p0` is not equal to the character at index `i` of `q`, the program prints 'NO', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, while ensuring that `p0len` is greater than `i` and `i` is incremented by 1. If the characters are equal, the program continues execution past the if statement.***
