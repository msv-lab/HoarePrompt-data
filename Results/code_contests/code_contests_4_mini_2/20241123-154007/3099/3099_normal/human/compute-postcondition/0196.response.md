Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`, `p` is an input string, `n` is greater than 0, `plen` is the length of `p`, `p0` is the substring of `p` before the first '*', `p1` is the substring of `p` after the first '*' reversed, `p0len` is the length of `p0`, `p1len` is the length of `p1`, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, and `y0` is False, indicating that either a mismatch occurred between `p0` and `q` or a character in `q` is not in `good_letters`, as the conditions for matching have not been satisfied.***
