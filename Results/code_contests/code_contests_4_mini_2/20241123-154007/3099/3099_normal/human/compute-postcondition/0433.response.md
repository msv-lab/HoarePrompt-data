Postcondition: ***`y1` is initially True, and if the condition `p1[i] != qr[i]` holds true, then `y1` is set to False, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `p1[i]` equals `qr[i]`, then `y1` remains True. Since `i` is `k + 1` and `p1len` is greater than `k + 1`, the check occurs for the element at index `i`.***
