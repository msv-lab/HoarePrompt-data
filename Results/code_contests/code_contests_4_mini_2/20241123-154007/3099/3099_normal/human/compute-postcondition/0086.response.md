The value of `y` is assigned the value `False`. The previous value of `y` was `True`, so now `y` changes to `False`. The values of `i` and `plen` remain unchanged, and the print statement does not affect the state of the variables. Therefore, the output state is: `y` is False, `i` is 2, and `plen` is greater than 1.

Output State: **`y` is False, `i` is 2, `plen` is greater than 1**
