The code executes a print statement which outputs the string 'NO'. It does not change the values of any variables, as the print function merely displays output to the console. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables and the printed output.

Output State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`, `p` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?" and "*", `q` is a string of equal length to `p`, `i` is `i + 1`, and the function prints 'NO'**
