The value of `y` is assigned `False`. The previous value of `y` was `True`, but now it changes to `False`. The states of the other variables, `i` and `plen`, are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `y` is False, `i` is 2, `plen` is greater than 1.

Output State: **`y` is False, `i` is 2, `plen` is greater than 1**
