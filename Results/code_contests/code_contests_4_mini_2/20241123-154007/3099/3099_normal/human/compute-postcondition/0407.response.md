Postcondition: ***`y1` is True initially, and if the character `qr[0]` (the first character of the reversed string `q`) is not in `good_letters`, the program prints 'NO', sets `y1` to False, and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `qr[0]` is in `good_letters`, `y1` remains True, and no changes occur to `y1` or any other variables.***
