Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`, `p` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?" and "*", `n` is an input string, and `plen` is the length of `p`. If `n` is greater than 0, for each input string `q` with length `qlen`, if `*` is not in `p`, then for each `q`, if `qlen` equals `plen`, 'YES' is printed if all characters in `p` match those in `q` considering '?' matches any character in `good_letters`; otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If `plen` is 0, 'YES' is printed immediately. If `*` is in `p`, then for each `q`, if `qlen` is less than `plen - 1`, 'NO' is printed. If `qlen` is valid, 'YES' is printed if both substrings of `q` match `p0` and `p1`, and `t` does not contain any elements from `good_letters` within the specified indices; otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If `good_letters` is empty, or if `n` is 0, no output occurs. The output will depend on whether each corresponding `q` meets the specified conditions.***
