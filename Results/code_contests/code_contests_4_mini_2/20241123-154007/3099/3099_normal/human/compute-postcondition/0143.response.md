The print statement outputs the string 'YES' to the console. The values of the variables `y`, `plen`, `n`, and `qlen` remain unchanged and are not directly affected by the print statement. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables along with the printed output.

Output State: **`y` is True, `plen` can be any value, `n` is greater than 0, `qlen` is not equal to `plen`, and the output is 'YES'**
