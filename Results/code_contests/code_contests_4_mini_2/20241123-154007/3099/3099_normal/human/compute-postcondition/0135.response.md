The `print('NO')` statement outputs the string 'NO' to the console. It does not modify any variables in the initial state. The values of `y`, `i`, and `plen` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `y` is False, `i` is `plen - 1`, and the console outputs 'NO'.

Output State: **`y` is False, `i` is `plen - 1`, and the console outputs 'NO'**
