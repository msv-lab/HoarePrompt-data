The code executes a print statement, which outputs the string 'NO'. The values of the variables `y0`, `y1`, and `i` remain unchanged as the print statement does not modify them. Therefore, the output state is: `y0` is False, `y1` remains either True or is set to False, `i` is `p1len - 1`, and the output is 'NO'.

Output State: **`y0` is False, `y1` remains either True or is set to False, `i` is `p1len - 1`, and the output is 'NO'**
