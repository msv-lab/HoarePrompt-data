Postcondition: ***`y1` is initially True, `i` is k + 1, and `p1len` is greater than k + 1. If `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, then `y1` is set to False and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `qr[i]` is in `good_letters`, `y1` remains True and no change occurs to `y1`.***
