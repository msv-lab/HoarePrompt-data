The variable `y1` is assigned the value `False`, changing its previous value from `True` to `False`. The other variables `i` and `p1len` remain unaffected as they are not modified by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `y1` is initially True, `i` is k + 1, `p1len` is greater than k + 1, and 'NO' is printed; now `y1` is False.

Output State: **`y1` is initially True, `i` is k + 1, `p1len` is greater than k + 1, and 'NO' is printed; now `y1` is False.**
