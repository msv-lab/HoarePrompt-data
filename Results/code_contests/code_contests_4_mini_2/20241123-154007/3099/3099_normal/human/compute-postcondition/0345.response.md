Postcondition: ***`p1len` is greater than or equal to 0, `qr` is defined, `y1` remains unchanged. If `p1len` is 0, then `t` is assigned the value of `q` starting from index `p0len`. If `p1len` is greater than 0, then `t` is assigned a slice of `q` from index `p0len` to index `-p1len`. If `qr` is undefined, the loop does not execute and may lead to an error.***
