The `continue` statement is executed, which causes the program to skip the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables remain unchanged except for the loop control variable, which is implied to change in the next iteration. Therefore, the output state is: `p0len` is greater than 0, `y0` is False, and the loop continues to the next iteration.

Output State: **`p0len` is greater than 0, `y0` is False, and the loop continues to the next iteration**.
