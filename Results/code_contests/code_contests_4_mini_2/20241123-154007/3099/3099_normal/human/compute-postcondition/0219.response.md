Postcondition: ***`y0` is either True or False, `y1` is set to False, and 'NO' is printed if `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`. The index `i` is less than `p1len`, which is greater than 0, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `qr[i]` is in `good_letters`, the values of `y0` and `y1` remain unchanged.***
