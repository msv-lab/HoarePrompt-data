Postcondition: ***`y1` is initially True. If `p1[i]` is equal to '?', and `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, `y1` becomes False, `i` is incremented by 1, and execution breaks out of the loop. If `qr[i]` is in `good_letters`, then `y1` remains True and `i` is not incremented. If `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`, then `y1` is set to False, `i` is incremented by 1, and execution breaks out of the loop. If `p1[i]` is equal to `qr[i]`, the values of `y1`, `i`, and `p1len` remain unchanged. In cases where `p1[i]` is a '?', and `qr[i]` is in `good_letters`, or `p1[i]` is equal to `qr[i]`, the program maintains the original state of `y1`, `i`, and `p1len`.***
