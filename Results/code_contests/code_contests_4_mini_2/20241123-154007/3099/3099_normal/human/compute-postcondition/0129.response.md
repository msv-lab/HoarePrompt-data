Postcondition: ***`y` is False if the first element of `p` is a '?' and the first element of `q` is not in `good_letters`, or if the first element of `p` is not equal to the first element of `q`. If `p[i]` is a '?' and `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed, and the program breaks. If `p[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, 'NO' is printed, and the program breaks. If `p[i]` is equal to `q[i]`, then `i` is incremented by 1, and `plen` remains unchanged, allowing the program to continue executing. All cases where `p[i]` is either '?' or not equal to `q[i]` result in `y` being set to False.***
