Postcondition: ***`y0` is either False or True, `y1` is False if the first character of `p1` is '?' and the first character of `qr` is not in `good_letters`, in which case 'NO' is printed and the execution breaks. If `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`, 'NO' is printed and `y1` is set to False, breaking the execution as well. If neither condition applies, `y1` remains True and the program continues without any changes.***
