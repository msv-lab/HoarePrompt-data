The code prints 'NO', which affects the output but does not change the values of the variables. The variable `y1` is True, `i` is `i + 1`, and `p1len` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `y1` is True, `i` is `i + 1`, `p1len` is unchanged, and 'NO' is printed.

Output State: **`y1` is True, `i` is `i + 1`, `p1len` is unchanged, and 'NO' is printed.**
