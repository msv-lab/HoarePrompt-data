Postcondition: ***`y0` is False or True, `y1` is False if the element at index `i` of `p1` is not equal to the element at index `i` of `qr`. The length of `p1` (`p1len`) is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and the element at index `i` of `p1` is not equal to '?'. If the condition is met, the program prints 'NO' and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, the state of `y1` remains True and continues executing the program without any changes to `y1`.***
