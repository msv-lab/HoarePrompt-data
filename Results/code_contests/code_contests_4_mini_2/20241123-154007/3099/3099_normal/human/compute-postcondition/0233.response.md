Postcondition: ***`y0` is either True or False; if `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`, then `y1` is set to False, 'NO' is printed, and the loop is exited. If `p1[i]` is equal to `qr[i]`, `y1` remains True, `i` is incremented by 1, and it is ensured that `i` is less than `p1len`, which is greater than 0. Additionally, if `p1[i]` is '?' and `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, the condition is handled as part of the larger logic, which would also set `y1` to False and print 'NO' accordingly.***
