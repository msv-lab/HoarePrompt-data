Postcondition: ***`p1len` is greater than or equal to 0, `qr` is defined, `y1` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `q` is an input string, and `qlen` is the length of `q`. If `qlen` is less than `p1len - 1`, 'NO' has been printed, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `qlen` is greater than or equal to `p1len - 1`, the program proceeds without any action in this block.***
