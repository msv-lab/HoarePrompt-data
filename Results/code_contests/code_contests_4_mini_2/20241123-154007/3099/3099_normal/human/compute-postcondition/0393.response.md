Postcondition: ***`p1len` is greater than or equal to 0, `qr` is defined, `y1` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `y0` is set to False. If `p0[i]` is '?', and if `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `p0[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, 'NO' is printed, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `p0[i]` is equal to `q[i]`, the program continues execution past the if statement. The condition ensures that `p0len` is greater than `i`, and `i` is incremented by 1.***
