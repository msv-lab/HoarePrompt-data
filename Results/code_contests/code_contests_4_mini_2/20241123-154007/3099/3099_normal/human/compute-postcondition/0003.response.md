The variable `plen` is assigned the value of `len(p)`, which calculates the length of the string `p`. The values of `good_letters`, `n`, and any query strings remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the length of `p` while retaining the other variables' states.

Output State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`, `p` is an input string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?" and "*", `n` is a positive integer, and `plen` is the length of `p`**
