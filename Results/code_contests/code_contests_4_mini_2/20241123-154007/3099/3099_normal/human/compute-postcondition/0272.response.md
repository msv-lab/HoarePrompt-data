Postcondition: ***`y0` is False, `y1` is either True or False, the intersection of `t` with `good_letters` is empty, `n` is greater than the current iteration count, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, `p0len` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `p0[i]` is not equal to '?', and if the character at index `i` of `p0` does not match the character at index `i` of `q`, then the program prints 'NO' and breaks out of the loop. If `p0[i]` matches `q[i]`, none of the variables are updated in this block.***
