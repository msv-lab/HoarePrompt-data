The variable `y` is assigned the value `False`, which is already its initial state. The other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged for them.

Output State: **`y` is False, `i` is incremented by 1 (i + 1), `plen` remains unchanged, and 'NO' is printed**.
