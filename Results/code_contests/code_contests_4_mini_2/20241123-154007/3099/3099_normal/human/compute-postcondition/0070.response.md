The value of `y` is assigned `False`, changing its state from `True` to `False`. The other variables `i` and `plen` remain unaffected, as well as the elements `p[i]` and `q[i]`. Therefore, the output state is: `y` is False, `i` is 0, `plen` is greater than 0, the element `p[i]` is not equal to '?', and the element `p[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, and 'NO' was printed.

Output State: **`y` is False, `i` is 0, `plen` is greater than 0, the element `p[i]` is not equal to '?', and the element `p[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, and 'NO' was printed.**
