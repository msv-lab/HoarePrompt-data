The code prints 'NO', which does not affect the values of any variables. The previous states of the variables are unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `y0` is either True or False, `y1` is True, `i` is less than `p1len`, `p1len` is greater than 0, and 'NO' is printed.

Output State: **`y0` is either True or False, `y1` is True, `i` is less than `p1len`, `p1len` is greater than 0, and 'NO' is printed**.
