Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`, `p` is an input string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?" and "*", `n` is greater than 0, `plen` is the length of `p`, and `qlen` is the length of `q`. If `qlen` is not equal to `plen`, 'NO' is printed indicating a mismatch in lengths. If `qlen` is equal to `plen`, the program continues without any output related to this condition.***
