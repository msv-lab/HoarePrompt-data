The variable `gls` is assigned the value from `raw_input()`, which accepts a user input string. The initial state of the other variables (`good_letters`, `p`, `n`, and the query string) is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `good_letters` is a string of distinct lowercase English letters, `p` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?" and "*", `n` is a positive integer, and each query string is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters; `gls` is a user input string.

Output State: **`good_letters` is a string of distinct lowercase English letters, `p` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?" and "*", `n` is a positive integer, and each query string is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters; `gls` is a user input string.**
