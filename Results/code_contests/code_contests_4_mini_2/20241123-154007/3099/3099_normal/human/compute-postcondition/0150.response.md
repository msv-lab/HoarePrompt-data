The length of the substring `p0` is calculated and assigned to the variable `p0len`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the value of `p0len` based on the length of the substring `p0`.

Output State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`, `p` is an input string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?" and "*", `n` is an input string, `plen` is the length of `p`, `p0` is the substring of `p` before the first '*', `p1` is the substring of `p` after the first '*' reversed, and `p0len` is the length of `p0`.**
