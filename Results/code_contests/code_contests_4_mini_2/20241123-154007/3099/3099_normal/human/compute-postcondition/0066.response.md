Postcondition: ***`y` is a boolean variable that is initially True. If the element at index `i` of the list `p` is equal to '?', and the element at index `i` of the list `q` is not in `good_letters`, then `y` is set to False, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop. The value of `i` remains 0, and `plen` is greater than 0. If the condition is not met, `y` remains True.***
