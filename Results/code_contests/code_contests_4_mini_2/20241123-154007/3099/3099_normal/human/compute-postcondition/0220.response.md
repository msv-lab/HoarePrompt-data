The `print('NO')` statement outputs the string 'NO' to the console. The values of the variables `y0`, `y1`, `i`, and `p1len` do not change as a result of this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `y0` is either True or False, `y1` is True, `i` is less than `p1len`, and `p1len` is greater than 0.

Output State: **`y0` is either True or False, `y1` is True, `i` is less than `p1len`, `p1len` is greater than 0**
