The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop of the if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `y0` is False, `y1` is either True or False, the intersection of `t` with `good_letters` is empty, `n` is greater than the current iteration count, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, `p0len` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `p0[i]` is not equal to '?', the character at index `i` of `p0` is not equal to the character at index `i` of `q`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
