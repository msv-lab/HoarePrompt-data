The code snippet `print('NO')` outputs the string 'NO' to the console. It does not modify any of the existing variables, so their states remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `p1len` is greater than or equal to 0, `qr` is defined, `y1` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `y0` is set to False, `p0len` is greater than `i`, and `i` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`p1len` is greater than or equal to 0, `qr` is defined, `y1` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `y0` is set to False, `p0len` is greater than `i`, and `i` is incremented by 1**
