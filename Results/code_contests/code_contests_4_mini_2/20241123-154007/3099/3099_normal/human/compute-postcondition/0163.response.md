The code executes a print statement that outputs 'NO'. The previous state of the variables does not change as a result of this print action. Therefore, the output state is: `good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`, `p` is an input string, `n` is greater than 0, `plen` is the length of `p`, `p0` is the substring of `p` before the first '*', `p1` is the substring of `p` after the first '*' reversed, `p0len` is greater than 0, `p1len` is the length of `p1`, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `y0` is True, `i` is 0, the character at position `i` of `p0` is '?', the character at position `i` of `q` is not in `good_letters`, and the function prints 'NO'.
