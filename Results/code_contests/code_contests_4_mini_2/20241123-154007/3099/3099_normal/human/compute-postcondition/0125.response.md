The code snippet prints 'NO'. The values of the variables `y`, `i`, and `plen` remain unchanged because the print statement does not modify any variable states. 

Output State: **`y` is False if the first element of `p` is a '?' and the first element of `q` is not in `good_letters`, or if the first element of `p` is not equal to the first element of `q`; `i` is incremented by 1 (i + 1), `plen` remains unchanged, and 'NO' is printed.**
