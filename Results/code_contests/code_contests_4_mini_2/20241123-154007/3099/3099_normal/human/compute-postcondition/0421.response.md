The variable `y1` is assigned the value `False`. The previous value of `y1` was `True`, but the other variables (`i` and `p1len`) remain unchanged. The print statement 'NO' has no impact on the variable states. Therefore, the output state is: `y1` is False, `i` is `i + 1`, `p1len` is unchanged, and 'NO' is printed.

Output State: **`y1` is False, `i` is `i + 1`, `p1len` is unchanged, and 'NO' is printed.**
