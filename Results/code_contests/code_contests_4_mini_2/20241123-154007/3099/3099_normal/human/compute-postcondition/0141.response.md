Output State: **`y` is False if any element of `p` (from index 0 to plen - 1) is a '?' and the corresponding element of `q` is not in `good_letters`, or if any element of `p` is not equal to the corresponding element of `q`. If `plen` is 0, the loop doesn't execute, and `y` remains True. If `n` is greater than 0, `qlen` is not equal to `plen`, and 'NO' is printed if any of the conditions fail during the loop execution.**
