According to the code, the loop will continue executing as long as the index `i` is less than `p1len`. At the end of the last iteration, `y0` is False, and `y1` remains either True or is set to False. The loop is controlled by `i`, which is currently equal to `p1len - 1`. In order for the loop to execute one more time, `i` would need to be incremented. However, since `i` is already at its maximum value (i.e., `p1len - 1`), the loop cannot execute again.

Thus, the only adjustment that needs to be made is to indicate that `i` is now equal to `p1len` and `y1` will not change since the loop will not run again.

State: **`y0` is False, `y1` remains either True or is set to False, `i` is equal to `p1len`**
