The value of `y` is assigned `False`, changing its previous value from `True` to `False`. The other variables `i` and `plen` remain unaffected. The output state is therefore: `y` is False, `i` is 1, `plen` is greater than 1, and 'NO' is printed to the output.

Output State: **`y` is False, `i` is 1, `plen` is greater than 1, and 'NO' is printed to the output**
