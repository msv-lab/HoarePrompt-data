Postcondition: ***`y0` is False, `y1` is True. If `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`, the string 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the execution breaks out of the loop. The precondition guarantees that `p1len` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `p1[i]` is not equal to '?', therefore, `p1[i]` must be different from `qr[i]` for the condition to be true. If `p1[i]` equals `qr[i]`, there is no change in `y1` or output.***
