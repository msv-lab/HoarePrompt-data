Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`, `p` is an input string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?" and "*", `n` is greater than 0, `plen` is greater than 0, `qlen` is the length of `q`, and `i` is 0. If the character at position `i` in `p` is not equal to the character at position `i` in `q`, 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If the characters at position `i` in both `p` and `q` are equal, the state of `y` remains True and no output occurs. Additionally, since it is stated that the character at position `i` in `p` is not '?', the only condition affecting the output is the inequality of the characters at that position.***
