Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`, `p` is an input string, `n` is greater than 0, `plen` is the length of `p`, `p0` is the substring of `p` before the first '*', `p1` is the substring of `p` after the first '*' reversed, `p0len` is greater than 0, `p1len` is the length of `p1`, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `y0` is False, `p0len` is at least `p0len + 1`, and `i` is 0. If the character `p0[i]` is a '?', then if `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, the program outputs 'NO', sets `y0` to False, and breaks; otherwise, if `p0[i]` does not match `q[i]`, the program also outputs 'NO', sets `y0` to False, and breaks. In all cases, if the conditions are not met, the program outputs 'NO' and breaks, while if they are met, the state of `y0` remains unchanged (still False), indicating that the match is either incomplete or invalid.***
