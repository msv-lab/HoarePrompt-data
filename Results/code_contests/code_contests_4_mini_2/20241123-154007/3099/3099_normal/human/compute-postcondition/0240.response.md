The variable `t` is assigned the value `None`. The values of `y0` and `y1` remain unchanged, as the assignment does not affect them. Therefore, the output state is: `y0` can either be True or False, `y1` can be True or False, and `t` is None.

Output State: **`y0` can either be True or False, `y1` can be True or False, and `t` is None**
