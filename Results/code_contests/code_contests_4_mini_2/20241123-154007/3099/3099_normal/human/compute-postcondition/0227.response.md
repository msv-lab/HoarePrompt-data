The value of `y1` is explicitly set to `False`, and its previous value was also `False`. The state of the other variable `y0` remains unaffected, as the assignment does not impact it. The output state includes the values of `y0`, `y1`, and the fact that 'NO' was printed.

Output State: **`y0` is either True or False, `y1` is False, and 'NO' is printed**
