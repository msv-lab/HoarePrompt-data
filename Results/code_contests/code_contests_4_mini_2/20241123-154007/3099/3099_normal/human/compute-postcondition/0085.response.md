The `print` statement outputs the string 'NO' to the console. The values of the variables `y`, `i`, and `plen` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is `y` is True, `i` is 2, `plen` is greater than 1, and 'NO' is printed.

Output State: **`y` is True, `i` is 2, `plen` is greater than 1, and 'NO' is printed**
