Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`, `p` is an input string, `n` is greater than 0, `plen` is the length of `p`, `p0` is the substring of `p` before the first '*', `p1` is the substring of `p` after the first '*' reversed, `p0len` is greater than 0, `p1len` is the length of `p1`, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `y0` is False, `p0len` is at least `p0len + 1`, and `i` is 1. If the character at `q[1]` is not in `good_letters`, the output is 'NO', `y0` remains False, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `q[1]` is in `good_letters`, there are no changes made to `y0` or the program state as the else part is not defined.***
