The code snippet contains a `continue` statement, which does not change any variable states but instead skips the rest of the code in the current iteration of the loop. Since no variables are altered, the output state remains focused on the existing states.

Output State: **`p1len` is greater than or equal to 0, `qr` is defined, `y1` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, and 'NO' has been printed, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
