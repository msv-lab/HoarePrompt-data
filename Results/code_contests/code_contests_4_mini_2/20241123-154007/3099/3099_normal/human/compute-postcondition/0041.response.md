The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`, `p` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?" and "*", `q` is a string of equal length to `p`, `i` is `i + 1`, the output is 'NO', `y` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
