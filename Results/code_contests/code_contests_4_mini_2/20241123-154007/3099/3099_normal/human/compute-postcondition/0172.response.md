Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`, `p` is an input string, `n` is greater than 0, `plen` is the length of `p`, `p0` is the substring of `p` before the first '*', `p1` is the substring of `p` after the first '*' reversed, `p0len` is greater than 0, `p1len` is the length of `p1`, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `y0` is False, `i` is 0, and if the character at position `i` in `p0` is not equal to the character at position `i` in `q`, then 'NO' is printed, `y0` is set to False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. In any other case, the program continues without printing anything or altering `y0`.***
