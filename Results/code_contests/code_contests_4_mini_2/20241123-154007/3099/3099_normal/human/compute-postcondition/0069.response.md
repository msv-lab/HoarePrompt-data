The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'NO'. The values of the variables `y`, `i`, and `plen` remain unchanged, as the print statement does not affect them. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variable values along with the printed output.

Output State: **`y` is True, `i` is 0, `plen` is greater than 0, the element `p[i]` is not equal to '?', and the element `p[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, and 'NO' is printed.**
