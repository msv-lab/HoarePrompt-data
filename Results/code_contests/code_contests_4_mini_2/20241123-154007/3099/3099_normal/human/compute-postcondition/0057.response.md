The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables do not change, but we skip the rest of the current loop iteration. Therefore, the output state is `y` is True if all characters in `p` match those in `q`, or if `plen` is 0; `n` is greater than 1; `q` is an input string; `qlen` is the length of `q`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
