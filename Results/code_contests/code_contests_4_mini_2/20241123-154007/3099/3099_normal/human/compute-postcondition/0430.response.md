The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'NO'. The values of the variables `y1`, `i`, and `p1len` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables along with the output from the print statement.

Output State: **`y1` is initially True, `i` is k + 1, `p1len` is greater than k + 1, and the output is 'NO'**
