The code will print 'NO', which does not change any of the variables' values. The initial state remains unchanged, and we simply have an output from the print statement. Therefore, the Output State is: `good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`, `p` is an input string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?" and "*", `n` is greater than 0, `plen` is the length of `p`, `qlen` is the length of `q`, and the length of `q` is not equal to the length of `p`, and 'NO' is printed.
