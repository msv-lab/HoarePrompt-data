The `good_letters` variable is assigned the value of a set created from the characters in the string `gls`. Since `good_letters` is a set, it will contain distinct characters from `gls`. The other variables (`p`, `n`, and the query string) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `good_letters` as a set of distinct characters from `gls`.

Output State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`, `p` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?" and "*", `n` is a positive integer, and each query string is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters**.
