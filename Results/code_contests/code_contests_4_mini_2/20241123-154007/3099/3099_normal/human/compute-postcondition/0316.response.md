The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'NO'. The values of the variables `y0`, `y1`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of the variables along with the printed output.

Output State: **`y0` is False, `y1` is either True or False, `i` is p1len, and 'NO' is printed.**
