According to the code, the loop iterates over the range defined by `plen`, which is the length of string `p`. For the loop to execute one more time, the index `i` needs to be less than `plen`.

At the end of the last iteration, we do not have the exact value of `i`, but we know that it was less than `plen` to allow the loop to continue. Therefore, we need to adjust `i` to `i + 1` to indicate the next iteration. Additionally, since we are iterating through the indices of `p` and `q`, we do not need to change `good_letters` or any other states.

Assuming `i` was the last index before the loop ended, we need to set `i` to the next index which is `i + 1`. 

State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`, `p` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?" and "*", `q` is a string of equal length to `p`, `i` is `i + 1`**
