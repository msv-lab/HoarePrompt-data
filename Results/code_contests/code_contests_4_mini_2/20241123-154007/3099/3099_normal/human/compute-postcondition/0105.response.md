The value of `y` is assigned `True`, but this does not change the state of any other variables. The values of `plen`, `n`, and `qlen` remain as they were. Since the initial conditions state that `qlen` is not equal to `plen`, the function will print 'NO'. However, the assignment of `y` does not affect the state regarding any print actions. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables.

Output State: **`y` is True, `plen` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `qlen` is not equal to `plen`, and the function prints 'NO'**
