Postcondition: ***If `y1` is False, it indicates that either a character in `p1` does not match the corresponding character in `qr`, or a character in `p1` is a '?' that does not correspond to a character in `good_letters`. Consequently, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `y1` is True, it means that all characters in `p1` either match those in `qr` or are valid '?' characters, and the loop will not skip to the next iteration. In summary, `y1` determines whether the loop continues or not based on the validity of the characters in `p1` compared to `qr`.**
