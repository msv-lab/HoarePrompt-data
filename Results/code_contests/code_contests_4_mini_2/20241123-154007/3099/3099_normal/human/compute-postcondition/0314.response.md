Postcondition: ***`y0` is False, `y1` is either still True or set to False. If `p1[i]` is equal to '?', and `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, the program prints 'NO' and `y1` is set to False. If `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`, the program prints 'NO', and `y1` is set to False; if `p1[i]` equals `qr[i]`, there is no change in `y1` or output, and the state remains as it was before execution. Overall, the program ensures that if any conditions lead to 'NO', `y1` reflects that outcome.***
