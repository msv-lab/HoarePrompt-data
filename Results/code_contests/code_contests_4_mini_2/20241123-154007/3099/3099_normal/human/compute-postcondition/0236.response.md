Output State: **`y1` is False if any character in `p1` does not match with `qr` and is not in `good_letters`. If `p1[i]` is equal to '?' and `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, then `y1` is set to False and 'NO' is printed, breaking the loop. If `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`, then `y1` is also set to False and 'NO' is printed, breaking the loop. If all characters match or are valid, `y1` remains True. The loop does not execute if `p1len` is 0, in which case `y1` remains True and `y0` is either True or False, depending on its initial state.**
