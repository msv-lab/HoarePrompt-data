Postcondition: ***`p1len` is greater than or equal to 0, `qr` is defined, `y1` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `y0` is False if the character at index `i` in `p0` is not equal to the character at index `i` in `q`, and the execution breaks out of the loop. If the characters are equal, `y0` remains True, and the program continues execution. Additionally, `p0len` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and the element `p0[i]` is not equal to '?'.***
