The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `p1len` is greater than or equal to 0, `qr` is defined, `y1` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `y0` is False, 'NO' is printed, `p0len` is greater than 0, `i` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
