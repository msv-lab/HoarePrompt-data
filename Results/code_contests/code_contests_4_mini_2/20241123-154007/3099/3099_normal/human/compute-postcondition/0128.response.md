Postcondition: ***`y` is False if the first element of `p` is a '?' and the first element of `q` is not in `good_letters`, or if the first element of `p` is not equal to the first element of `q`. If `p[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the program breaks out of the loop. If `p[i]` is equal to `q[i]`, `i` is incremented by 1, `plen` remains unchanged, and the program continues executing.***
