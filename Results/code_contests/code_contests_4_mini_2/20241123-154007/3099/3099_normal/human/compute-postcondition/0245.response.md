Postcondition: ***`y0` can be either True or False, `y1` can be either True or False, and `t` is assigned based on the value of `p1len`. If `p1len` is 0, then `t` is set to a slice of `q` starting from index `p0len` to the end. If `p1len` is greater than 0, then `t` is assigned a slice of `q` starting from `p0len` up to the negative index `-p1len`, effectively excluding the last `p1len` elements of `q` from `t`. In either case, `t` remains assigned based on the values of `q` and `p0len`, which are not defined within the context provided.***
