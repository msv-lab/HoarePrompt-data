Postcondition: ***`y0` is either True or False, `y1` is either True or False, the intersection of `t` with `good_letters` is empty, `n` is greater than the current iteration count, and `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`. If `qlen` is less than `plen - 1`, the output is 'NO'. If `qlen` is greater than or equal to `plen - 1`, there is no output specified from this fragment.***
