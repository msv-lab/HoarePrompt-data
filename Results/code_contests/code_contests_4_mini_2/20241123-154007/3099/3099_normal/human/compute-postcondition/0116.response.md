The value of `y` is assigned to `False`, changing its previous value from `True`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `y` while retaining the states of the other variables.

Output State: **`y` is False, `plen` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `qlen` is not equal to `plen`, the function prints 'NO', `i` is 0, the element `p[i]` is not equal to '?', and the values of `p[i]` and `q[i]` are not equal; and the function prints 'NO'**
