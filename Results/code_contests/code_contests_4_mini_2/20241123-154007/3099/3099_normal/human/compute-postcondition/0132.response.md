The variable `y` is assigned the value `False`, but it already holds the same value of `False`. The values of `i` and `plen` remain unchanged, and the output is 'NO'. Therefore, the output state is: `y` is False, `i` is `plen - 1`, `plen` remains unchanged, and the output is 'NO'.

Output State: **`y` is False, `i` is `plen - 1`, `plen` remains unchanged, and the output is 'NO'**
