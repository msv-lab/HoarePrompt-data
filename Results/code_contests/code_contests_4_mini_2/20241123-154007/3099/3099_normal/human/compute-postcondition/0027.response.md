Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`, `p` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?" and "*", `n` is greater than 0, `plen` is greater than 0, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `y` is a Boolean variable initialized to True, and `i` is 0. If the character at index `i` of `p` is a '?', and the character at index `i` of `q` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed and `y` is set to False, breaking out of the loop. If the character at index `i` of `q` is in `good_letters`, `y` remains True, and execution continues. If the character at index `i` of `p` is not equal to the character at index `i` of `q`, 'NO' is printed and `y` is set to False, breaking out of the loop. If the characters at index `i` in both `p` and `q` are equal, `y` remains unchanged and no output occurs. Thus, `y` can either remain True or be set to False based on the conditions evaluated, reflecting the validity of the matching process between `p` and `q`.***
