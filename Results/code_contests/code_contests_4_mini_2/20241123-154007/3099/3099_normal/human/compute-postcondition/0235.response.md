To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we analyze the provided state information and the loop construct.

1. The loop is governed by the variable `i`, which iterates through the range defined by `p1len`.
2. For the loop to continue executing, the value of `i` must be less than `p1len`.
3. Since `y1` is set to True under certain conditions during the loop, we need to ensure that these conditions are satisfied.

Given that `y0` is either True or False, and based on the provided conditions:
- If `p1[i]` is equal to '?' and `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, the loop breaks, and `y1` is set to False.
- If `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`, the loop also breaks, and `y1` is set to False.
- If `qr[i]` is in `good_letters` or if `p1[i]` is equal to `qr[i]`, then `y1` remains True, and if `p1[i]` is equal to `qr[i]`, `i` is incremented by 1.

To enable the loop to execute one more time:
- The value of `i` must be incremented to allow for the next iteration.
- Additionally, `i` must be less than `p1len` for the loop to continue.

Given that the next state needs to consider the increment of `i`, we need to ensure that:
- `i` is adjusted to `i + 1` (indicating the next index), and since `i` is currently at the maximum value allowed (which is `p1len - 1`), we need to ensure `i` remains less than `p1len`.

Thus, we conclude that for the loop to execute one more time:
- The value of `i` should be adjusted to be less than `p1len` (specifically, `i` should be equal to `p1len - 1` if it was previously `p1len - 2`).

State: **`y0` is either True or False, `i` is currently less than `p1len - 1`**
