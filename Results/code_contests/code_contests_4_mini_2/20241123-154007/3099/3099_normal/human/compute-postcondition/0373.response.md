Postcondition: ***`p1len` is greater than or equal to 0, `qr` is defined, `y1` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, and `y0` is set to False and 'NO' is printed if the character at index `i` of `p0` is a '?' and the character at index `i` of `q` is not in `good_letters`. If `p0[i]` is a '?' but `q[i]` is in `good_letters`, then `y0` remains True and execution continues. If `p0[i]` is not a '?' and is not equal to `q[i]`, `y0` is set to False and 'NO' is printed, otherwise `y0` remains True and execution continues. Additionally, `p0len` is greater than 0, and `i` is 0.***
