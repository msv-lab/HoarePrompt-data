The variable `y1` is assigned the value `True`. Since `p0len` is greater than 0 and `y0` is False, the loop will continue, but the assignment of `y1` to `True` does not change any of the other variables (`p1len`, `qr`, `y1`, `n`, `q`, and `qlen`) because they are unaffected by this specific assignment. The previous value of `y1` is now confirmed as `True`. Therefore, the output state is: `y1` is True, and the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`y1` is True, and `p1len`, `qr`, `y0`, `n`, `q`, and `qlen` remain unchanged**
