Postcondition: ***`y0` is False, `y1` remains either True or is set to False, and if `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, then 'NO' is printed and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `qr[i]` is in `good_letters`, the state of `y1` and the program execution continues without any changes to `y1`.***
