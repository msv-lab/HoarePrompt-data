The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed by this statement. Therefore, the output state reflects that the loop continues executing without any changes to `y0` or `y1`.

Output State: **`y1` is False, and the loop continues to the next iteration; `y0` remains unchanged (either True or False)**
