Postcondition: ***`t` is a slice of `q`, which contains elements starting from index `p0len` to the end of `q` if `p1len` is 0, or from index `p0len` to the index calculated as `-p1len` if `p1len` is greater than 0. If there is at least one element in `t` that is present in the `good_letters` set, the output will be 'NO' and the program will continue to the next iteration of the loop. If `t` contains no elements from `good_letters`, the program proceeds with the next statements.***
