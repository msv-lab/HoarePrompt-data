Postcondition: ***`p1len` is greater than or equal to 0, `qr` is defined, `y1` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `y0` is set to False, `p0len` is greater than `i`, and after incrementing `i` by 1, if `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
