Postcondition: ***`y0` is False, if `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`, the function prints 'NO', sets `y1` to False, and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `p1[i]` is equal to `qr[i]`, the values of `y1` remain unchanged, and the loop continues with `i` still equal to `p1len - 1`.***
