Postcondition: ***`y0` is either False or True, `y1` is False, `qr` is the reverse of an unknown variable `q`, `p1len` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and if the first element of `qr` is not in `good_letters`, the output is 'NO' and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged and the program continues without printing 'NO'.***
