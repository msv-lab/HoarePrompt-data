`y1` is assigned the value `False`, changing its previous value of `True`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `y0` is either True or False, `y1` is False, `i` is less than `p1len`, `p1len` is greater than 0, and 'NO' is printed.

Output State: **`y0` is either True or False, `y1` is False, `i` is less than `p1len`, `p1len` is greater than 0, and 'NO' is printed**
