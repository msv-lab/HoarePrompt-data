The code prints 'NO', but it does not modify any variables. The previous values of the affected variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `y` is True, `i` is 1, `plen` is greater than 1, and 'NO' is printed to the output.

Output State: **`y` is True, `i` is 1, `plen` is greater than 1, and 'NO' is printed to the output**
