The variable `p` is split at the '*' character into two parts: `p0` and `p1`. This means that `p0` will contain everything before the first '*' in `p`, and `p1` will contain everything after the first '*'. The exact values of `p0` and `p1` depend on the specific contents of `p`, but since `p` contains at least one '*' character, `p0` will not be empty. The other variables, `good_letters`, `n`, and `plen`, are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`, `p` is an input string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?" and "*", `n` is an input string, `plen` is the length of `p`, `p0` is the substring of `p` before the first '*', and `p1` is the substring of `p` after the first '*'**.
