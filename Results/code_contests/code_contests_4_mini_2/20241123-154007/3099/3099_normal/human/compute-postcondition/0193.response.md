Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`, `p` is an input string, `n` is greater than 0, `plen` is the length of `p`, `p0` is the substring of `p` before the first '*', `p1` is the substring of `p` after the first '*' reversed, `p0len` is greater than 0, `p1len` is the length of `p1`, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `y0` is False, `p0len` is at least `p0len + 1`, and `i` is 1. If `p0[1]` is a '?', and `q[1]` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed and `y0` remains False. If `q[1]` is in `good_letters`, there are no changes made to `y0`. If `p0[1]` is not '?', and `p0[1]` does not match `q[1]`, 'NO' is printed, `y0` is set to False, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. In summary, if there is a mismatch or if `q[1]` is not a good letter, 'NO' is printed and `y0` remains False; otherwise, `y0` is unchanged.***
