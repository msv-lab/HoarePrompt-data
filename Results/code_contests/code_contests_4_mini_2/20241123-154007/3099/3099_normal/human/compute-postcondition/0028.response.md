According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `plen`. If `i` is less than `plen`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `plen` is greater than 0. To allow the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` should be adjusted to 1.

No other states need to be adjusted as the other variables do not influence the continuation of the loop.

State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`, `p` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?" and "*", `n` is greater than 0, `plen` is greater than 0, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `y` is a Boolean variable initialized to True, and `i` is 1.**
