The code snippet executes a print statement, which outputs the string 'NO'. The values of the other variables, `y1`, `i`, and `p1len`, remain unchanged as the print statement does not affect them. Therefore, the output state is `y1` is True, `i` is `i + 1`, `p1len` is unchanged, and 'NO' is printed.

Output State: **`y1` is True, `i` is `i + 1`, `p1len` is unchanged, and 'NO' is printed**
