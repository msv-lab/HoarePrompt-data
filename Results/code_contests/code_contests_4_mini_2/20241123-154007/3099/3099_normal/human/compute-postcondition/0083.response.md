Postcondition: ***`y` is True initially, `i` is 1, and `plen` is greater than 1. If `p[i]` is '?', and `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, then `y` is set to False, `i` remains 1, and the execution breaks. If `q[i]` is in `good_letters`, the values of `y`, `i`, and `plen` remain unchanged. If `p[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, then 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the execution breaks; otherwise, if `p[i]` is equal to `q[i]`, the values of `y`, `i`, and `plen` remain unchanged. This ensures that the state of `y` can be either True or False after execution, depending on the conditions met.***
