The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or the most internal structure we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `y` is False, `plen` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `qlen` is not equal to `plen`, the function prints 'NO', `i` is 0, the first element of the list `p` at index `i` is equal to '?', and the element `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
