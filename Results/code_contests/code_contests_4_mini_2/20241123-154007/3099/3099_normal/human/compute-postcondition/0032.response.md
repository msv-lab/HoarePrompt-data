Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`, `p` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?" and "*", `n` is greater than 0, `plen` is greater than 0, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `y` is a Boolean variable initialized to True, and `i` is 1. If the character at index `i` of `q` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the character at index `i` of `q` is in `good_letters`, the program continues executing without printing anything or modifying `y`.***
