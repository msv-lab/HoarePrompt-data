The function `func` accepts the following parameters: `good_letters`, `p`, `n`, and `queries`. 

- `good_letters` is a string of distinct lowercase English letters.
- `p` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?" and "*" where "*" occurs at most once.
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `queries` is a list of strings, where each query string is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters.

After executing the function body, the output will depend on the conditions defined by the parameters. Specifically, if `p` matches the criteria specified by the `good_letters` and the queries, the function will return a corresponding result based on these conditions.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a string of good letters, a pattern string `p`, a positive integer `n`, and a list of query strings, and to process these inputs according to the matching rules defined by the pattern and the good letters.
