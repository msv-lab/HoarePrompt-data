Postcondition: ***`y` is False if the first element of `p` is a '?' and the first element of `q` is not in `good_letters`, or if the first element of `p` is not equal to the first element of `q`. Otherwise, `y` remains True, and there are no changes to the values of `plen`, `n`, and `qlen`, which continue to satisfy their initial conditions.***
