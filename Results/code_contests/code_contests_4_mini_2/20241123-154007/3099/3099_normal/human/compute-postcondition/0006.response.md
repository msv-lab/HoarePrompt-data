According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. The state of `good_letters`, `p`, and `plen` does not affect the execution of the loop. Therefore, to ensure that the loop can execute, `n` must be greater than 0. Additionally, since the loop uses a loop variable (represented by `_`), it can be initialized at the beginning of the loop. 

State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`, `p` is an input string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?" and "*", `n` is greater than 0, `plen` is the length of `p`, and the loop variable `_` is initialized for each iteration**
