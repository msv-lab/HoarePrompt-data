Postcondition: ***`p1len` is greater than or equal to 0, `qr` is defined, `y1` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `y0` is set to False, and 'NO' is printed if the character at index 1 of `p0` does not match the character at index 1 of `q`. In this case, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the characters match, the program continues executing without any changes to the variables.***
