The variable `y0` is reassigned the value of `False`, which is its current value, so there is no change in its state. The values of the other variables (`y1`, `t`, `good_letters`, `i`, and the printed output 'NO') remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `y0` is False, `y1` can be either True or False, the intersection of `t` with `good_letters` is empty, `i` is 2, and 'NO' is printed.

Output State: **`y0` is False, `y1` can be either True or False, the intersection of `t` with `good_letters` is empty, `i` is 2, and 'NO' is printed**
