The break statement does not change the values of any variables but exits the most internal loop or if statement that was being executed. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables along with the interruption of the loop or condition. 

Output State: **`y1` is False, `i` is k + 1, `p1len` is greater than k + 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
