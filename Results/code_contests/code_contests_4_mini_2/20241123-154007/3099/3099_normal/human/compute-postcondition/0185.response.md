The code `print('NO')` outputs the string 'NO' to the console. The previous values of the affected variables are not altered by this statement, and the state of the variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`, `p` is an input string, `n` is greater than 0, `plen` is the length of `p`, `p0` is the substring of `p` before the first '*', `p1` is the substring of `p` after the first '*' reversed, `p0len` is greater than 0, `p1len` is the length of `p1`, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `y0` is False, `p0len` is at least `p0len + 1`, `i` is 1, and the output is 'NO'.
