Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`, `p` is an input string, `n` is greater than 0, `plen` is the length of `p`, `p0` is the substring of `p` before the first '*', `p1` is the substring of `p` after the first '*' reversed, `p0len` is the length of `p0`, `p1len` is the length of `p1`, `q` is an input string, and `qlen` is the length of `q`. If `qlen` is less than `plen - 1`, then 'NO' is printed, indicating that `q` is not long enough to match the conditions defined by `p`. If `qlen` is greater than or equal to `plen - 1`, the program continues execution without printing anything related to this condition.***
