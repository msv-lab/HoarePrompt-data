Postcondition: ***`y0` is False, `y1` can be either True or False, and the intersection of `t` with `good_letters` is empty. If the character at index `i` in the string `p0` is a question mark and the character at index `i` in the string `q` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed and the execution breaks. If the character at index `i` of `p0` does not match the character at index `i` of `q`, 'NO' is printed and the execution breaks. In both cases, the conditions regarding `n`, `qlen`, and `p0len` remain unchanged, and `i` is still 1.***
