The code executes a print statement which outputs 'NO'. The variables `y0`, `y1`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `y0` is False, `y1` remains either True or is set to False, `i` is `p1len - 1`, and the function prints 'NO'.

Output State: **`y0` is False, `y1` remains either True or is set to False, `i` is `p1len - 1`, and the function prints 'NO'**
