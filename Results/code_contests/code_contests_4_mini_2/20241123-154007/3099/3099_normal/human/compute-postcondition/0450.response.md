Postcondition: ***`t` is a slice of `q`, which contains elements starting from index `p0len` to the end of `q` if `p1len` is 0, or from index `p0len` to the index calculated as `-p1len` if `p1len` is greater than 0. The boolean variables `y0` and `y1` are both true. Additionally, `t` contains no elements from the `good_letters` set.***
