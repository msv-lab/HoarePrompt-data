The value of `y1` is assigned the value `False`. The previous value of `y1` was `True`, so after execution, `y1` is now `False`. The other variables `y0`, `i`, and `p1len` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `y0` is either True or False, `y1` is False, `i` is less than `p1len`, `p1len` is greater than 0.

Output State: **`y0` is either True or False, `y1` is False, `i` is less than `p1len`, `p1len` is greater than 0**
