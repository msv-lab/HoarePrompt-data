The code prints 'NO', which does not affect the values of the variables. The states of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `y1` is initially True, `i` is k + 1, `p1len` is greater than k + 1, and 'NO' is printed.

Output State: **`y1` is initially True, `i` is k + 1, `p1len` is greater than k + 1, and 'NO' is printed.**
