Functionality: ** The function accepts a string of good letters, a pattern string `p` that may contain the characters '?', '*', and lowercase English letters, and a positive integer `n` that indicates the number of query strings. It processes each query by checking if it matches the pattern `p` based on specific rules: if `*` is not present in `p`, it checks for exact matches while allowing '?' to match any character from `good_letters`. If `*` is present, it checks if the query can be split into two parts corresponding to the substrings before and after `*`, ensuring that the middle part doesn't contain any characters from `good_letters`. The function outputs 'YES' or 'NO' for each query based on these conditions. If there are no queries or if the pattern is empty, no output occurs. It also handles the case where lengths of queries do not match the required conditions.**
