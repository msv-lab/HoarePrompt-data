Postcondition: ***`y` is a boolean value, `i` is 0, `plen` is greater than 0, and `p[i]` is not equal to '?'. If `p[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, then 'NO' has been printed, `y` is set to False, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `p[i]` is equal to `q[i]`, then `y` remains True and the program continues without any changes to `y`.***
