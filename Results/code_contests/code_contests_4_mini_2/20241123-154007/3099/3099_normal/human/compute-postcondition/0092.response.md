Postcondition: ***`y` is True initially, `i` is 2, and `plen` is greater than 1. If `p[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, then `y` is set to False, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `p[i]` is equal to `q[i]`, `y` remains True, and the program continues executing beyond this condition.***
