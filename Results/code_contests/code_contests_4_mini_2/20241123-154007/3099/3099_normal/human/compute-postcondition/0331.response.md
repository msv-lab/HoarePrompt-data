The value of `y1` is assigned to `False`, which means it is explicitly set to `False`. The previous state of `y1` could either be `True` or `False`, but after this assignment, it is definitely `False`. The values of `y0` and `i` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `y0` is False, `y1` is False, `i` is `p1len - 1`, and the function prints 'NO'.

Output State: **`y0` is False, `y1` is False, `i` is `p1len - 1`, and the function prints 'NO'**
