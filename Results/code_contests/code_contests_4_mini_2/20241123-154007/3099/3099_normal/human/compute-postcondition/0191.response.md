The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`, `p` is an input string, `n` is greater than 0, `plen` is the length of `p`, `p0` is the substring of `p` before the first '*', `p1` is the substring of `p` after the first '*' reversed, `p0len` is greater than 0, `p1len` is the length of `p1`, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `y0` is False, `p0len` is at least `p0len + 1`, `i` is 1, and the output is 'NO', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
