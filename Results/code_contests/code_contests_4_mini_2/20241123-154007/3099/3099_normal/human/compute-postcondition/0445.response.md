Postcondition: ***`t` is assigned a slice of `q`. If `p1len` is 0, `t` contains the elements of `q` starting from index `p0len` to the end of `q`. If `p1len` is greater than 0, `t` contains the elements of `q` from index `p0len` to the index calculated as `-p1len`, effectively excluding the last `p1len` elements of `q`.***
