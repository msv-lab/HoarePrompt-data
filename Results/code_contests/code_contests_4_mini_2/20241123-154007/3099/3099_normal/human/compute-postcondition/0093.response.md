Postcondition: ***`y` is True initially, `i` is 2, and `plen` is greater than 1. If `p[i]` is equal to '?', and if `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, then `y` is set to False, and execution breaks; otherwise, if `q[i]` is in `good_letters`, `y` remains True. If `p[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, then `y` is set to False and execution breaks; otherwise, if `p[i]` is equal to `q[i]`, `y` remains True. Thus, after execution, `y` may be False if any of the conditions leading to a 'NO' were met, or it remains True if all checks passed. The value of `i` remains 2 and `plen` remains greater than 1 throughout.***
