Postcondition: ***`y` is False, `i` is `plen - 1`, and `plen` remains unchanged. If `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, the output is 'NO' and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `q[i]` is in `good_letters`, no output occurs and the state of the program continues without modification to `y`, `i`, or `plen`.***
