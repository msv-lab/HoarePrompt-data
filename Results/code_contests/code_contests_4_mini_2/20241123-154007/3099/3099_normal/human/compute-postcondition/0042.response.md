Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`, `p` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?" and "*", `q` is a string of equal length to `p`, and `i` is `i + 1`. If `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, the output is 'NO', `y` is set to False, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `q[i]` is in `good_letters`, there is no change to `y` or output, and the program continues executing the subsequent statements.***
