Postcondition: ***`y0` is False, and `y1` remains either True or is set to False. If `p1[i]` is a '?', and `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed and execution breaks out of the loop. If `qr[i]` is in `good_letters`, then 'NO' is not printed and execution continues. If `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and execution breaks out of the loop. If `p1[i]` is equal to `qr[i]`, `y1` remains unchanged, and execution continues without output. In all cases, `i` is equal to `p1len`.***
