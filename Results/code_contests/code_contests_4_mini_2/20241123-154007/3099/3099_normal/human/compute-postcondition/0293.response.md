Postcondition: ***`y0` is False, `y1` can be either True or False, and the intersection of `t` with `good_letters` is empty. If `p0[2]` is '?', and `q[2]` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `q[2]` is in `good_letters`, no changes are made to `y0`, and the program continues. If `p0[2]` is not '?', then 'NO' is printed, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if `p0[2]` is not equal to `q[2]`.***
