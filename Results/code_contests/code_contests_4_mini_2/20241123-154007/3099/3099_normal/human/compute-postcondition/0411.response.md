The value of `y1` is changed to `False`. The other variables (`qr`, `p1len`, `i`, `p1`, and their respective conditions) remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `y1`.

Output State: **`y1` is False, `qr` is the reverse of `q`, `p1len` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, the first element of `p1` (i.e., `p1[0]`) is not equal to '?', and the element `p1[0]` is not equal to `qr[0]`, and the output is 'NO'**
