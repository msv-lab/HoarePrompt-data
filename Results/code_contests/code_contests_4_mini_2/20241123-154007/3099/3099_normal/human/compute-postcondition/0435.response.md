According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `p1len`. The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `p1len`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `k + 1` and `p1len` is greater than `k + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to `k + 2`, and `p1len` must be greater than `k + 2`.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be adjusted to `k + 2`.
- `p1len` should be adjusted to greater than `k + 2` to ensure the loop can run again.

State: **`y1` is initially True, `i` is `k + 2`, and `p1len` is greater than `k + 2`**
