The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'NO'. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `y` is True, `plen` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, and the function prints 'NO'.

Output State: **`y` is True, `plen` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, and the function prints 'NO'**
