Postcondition: ***`y` is a boolean variable that was initially True. If `p[i]` is equal to '?', and `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, then `y` is set to False and the program breaks out of the loop. If `p[i]` is equal to '?' but `q[i]` is in `good_letters`, then `y` remains True. If `p[i]` is not equal to '?' and `p[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, 'NO' is printed, and `y` is set to False. If `p[i]` is not equal to '?' and `p[i]` is equal to `q[i]`, then `y` remains True. The value of `i` remains 0 and `plen` is greater than 0 throughout these conditions.***
