The value of `y1` is assigned `False`, which changes its previous value from `True` to `False`. The states of the other variables (`y0`, `p1len`, `i`, `p1[i]`, `qr[i]`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `y0` is False, `y1` is False, `p1len` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, the element `p1[i]` is not equal to '?', and the element `p1[i]` is not equal to the element `qr[i]`, and 'NO' is printed.

Output State: **`y0` is False, `y1` is False, `p1len` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, the element `p1[i]` is not equal to '?', and the element `p1[i]` is not equal to the element `qr[i]`, and 'NO' is printed.**
