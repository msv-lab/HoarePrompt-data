Postcondition: ***If `y` is True, the program outputs 'YES'. If `y` is False, there is no output. If `plen` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `y` remains True, resulting in the output 'YES'. Thus, the output is 'YES' if `y` is True, and no output occurs if `y` is False, regardless of the value of `plen`.***
