Postcondition: ***`y0` is False, `y1` can be either True or False, the intersection of `t` with `good_letters` is empty, `n` is greater than the current iteration count, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, `p0len` is greater than 0, and `i` is 0. If the character at index `i` of `p0` is '?', and the character at index `i` of `q` is not in `good_letters`, the program prints 'NO'. If `p0[i]` is not equal to '?' and does not match `q[i]`, it also prints 'NO'. If `p0[i]` is '?' and `q[i]` is in `good_letters` or if `p0[i]` matches `q[i]`, then `y0` remains True and no other variables are updated.***
