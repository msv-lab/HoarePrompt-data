According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `plen`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has been incremented to `i + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be adjusted back to its previous value, which is `i`, and we need to ensure that `plen` is greater than that value.

Since we know that `i` is now `i + 1`, we can infer that `plen` must be greater than `i + 1`. Therefore, the necessary adjustment is to ensure that `plen` is greater than `i + 1`.

State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`, `p` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?" and "*", `q` is a string of equal length to `p`, and `i` is `i`, `plen` is greater than `i + 1`**
