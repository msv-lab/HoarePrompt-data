The code executes a `print` statement that outputs 'NO'. The values of the variables `y`, `i`, and `plen` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `y` is True, `i` is 1, `plen` is greater than 1, and the output is 'NO'.

Output State: **`y` is True, `i` is 1, `plen` is greater than 1, and the output is 'NO'**
