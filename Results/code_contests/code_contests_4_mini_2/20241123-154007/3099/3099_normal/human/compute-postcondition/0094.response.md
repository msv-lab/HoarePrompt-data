According to the code, the loop can execute again if the value of `i` is less than `plen`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `plen` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3, and `plen` must be at least 4 (since `plen` must be greater than `i`).

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows: `i` should be set to 3, and `plen` should be greater than 3 to ensure that the loop can continue executing.

State: **`y` is True, `i` is 3, `plen` is greater than 3**
