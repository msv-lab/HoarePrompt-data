Output State: **`p1len` is greater than or equal to 0, `qr` is defined, `y1` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `y0` is False, `p0len` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, the element `p0[i]` is not equal to '?', and the character at index `i` in `p0` is not equal to the character at index `i` in `q`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
