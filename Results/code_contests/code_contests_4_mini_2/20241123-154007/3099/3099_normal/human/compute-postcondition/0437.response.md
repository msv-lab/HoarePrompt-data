Postcondition: ***`y1` is False, meaning that either there is at least one character in `p1` that is a '?' and the corresponding character in `qr` is not in `good_letters`, or there is at least one character in `p1` that does not match the corresponding character in `qr`. Additionally, `p1` may contain valid characters matching `qr` or valid '?' characters, but at least one condition has caused `y1` to be False. If `p1len` is 0, then `y1` remains True, indicating that the loop does not execute. In cases where both `p1` and `qr` are empty, `y1` is still True.***
