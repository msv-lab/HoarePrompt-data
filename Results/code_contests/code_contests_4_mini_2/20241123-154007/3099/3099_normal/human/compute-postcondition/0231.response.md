The value of `y1` is assigned the value `False`, which it already holds. The values of the other variables are not affected, so the output state remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `y0` is either True or False; `y1` is False, and 'NO' is printed.

Output State: **`y0` is either True or False; `y1` is False, and 'NO' is printed.**
