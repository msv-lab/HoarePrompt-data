In the given initial state, `y` is assigned the value of `False` based on the specified conditions. The variable `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is not specified, so we cannot determine its exact new value. The variable `plen` remains unchanged, and the string 'NO' is printed as an output, but this does not affect the state of the variables.

Therefore, the output state is: `y` is False, `i` is incremented by 1 (but the previous value is unknown), and `plen` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`y` is False, `i` is incremented by 1, `plen` remains unchanged**
