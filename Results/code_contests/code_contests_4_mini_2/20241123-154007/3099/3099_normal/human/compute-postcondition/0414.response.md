Postcondition: ***`y1` is initially True. If the first character of `qr` (which is the first character of the reversed string `q`) is a question mark and it is not in `good_letters`, the program prints 'NO', sets `y1` to False, and breaks out of the loop. If `qr[0]` is in `good_letters`, `y1` remains True. If `p1[0]` is not equal to `qr[0]`, the program prints 'NO', sets `y1` to False, and breaks out of the loop. If `p1[0]` is equal to `qr[0]`, `y1` remains True. Thus, after executing the block, `y1` will be False if either of the conditions for printing 'NO' are met, otherwise it will remain True.***
