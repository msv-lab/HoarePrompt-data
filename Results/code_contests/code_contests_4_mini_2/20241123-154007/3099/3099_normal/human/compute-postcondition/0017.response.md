The code executes a print statement that outputs 'NO'. This does not change any of the variable states but indicates an outcome based on the conditions provided. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables and the printed output.

Output State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`, `p` is an input string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?" and "*", `n` is greater than 0, `plen` is greater than 0, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `y` is True, `i` is 0, the character at index `i` of `p` is a question mark, and the character at index `i` of `q` is not in `good_letters`; and 'NO' is printed.**
