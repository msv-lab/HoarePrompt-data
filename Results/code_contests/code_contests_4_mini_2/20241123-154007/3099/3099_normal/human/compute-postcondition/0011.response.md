The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables remain unchanged. The output state is: `good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`, `p` is an input string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?" and "*", `n` is greater than 0, `plen` is the length of `p`, `qlen` is the length of `q`, and the length of `q` is not equal to the length of `p`, and 'NO' is printed.
