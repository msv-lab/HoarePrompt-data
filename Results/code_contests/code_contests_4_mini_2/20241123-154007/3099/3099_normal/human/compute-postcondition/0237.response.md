Postcondition: ***`y1` is False, indicating that at least one character in `p1` does not match with `qr` and is not in `good_letters`, or `p1[i]` is equal to '?' and `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, or `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`. The loop has been exited, and 'NO' has been printed. The value of `y0` remains unchanged and can be either True or False.***
