Postcondition: ***`y1` is True, `qr` is the reverse of `q`, and `p1len` is greater than 0. If `p1[0]` is not equal to `qr[0]`, then the function outputs 'NO', sets `y1` to False, and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `p1[0]` is equal to `qr[0]`, then `y1` remains True, and there is no output.***
