`y1` is assigned the value `False`. The previous value of `y1` can either be `True` or `False`, but after this assignment, it becomes `False`. The other variables `y0` and `i` are not affected by this operation. The output state is: `y0` is False, `y1` is False, `i` is p1len, and 'NO' is printed.

Output State: **`y0` is False, `y1` is False, `i` is p1len, and 'NO' is printed.**
