Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`, `p` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?" and "*", and `q` is a string of equal length to `p`. If the characters at position `i` in `p` and `q` are not equal, the program prints 'NO', sets `y` to False, and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the characters are equal, no changes occur to `y` or the program flow.***
