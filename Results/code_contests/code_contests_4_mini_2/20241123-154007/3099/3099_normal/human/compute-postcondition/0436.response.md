Output State: **`y1` will be False if any character in `p1` is a '?' and the corresponding character in `qr` is not in `good_letters`, or if any character in `p1` does not match the corresponding character in `qr`. If `p1` contains only valid characters matching `qr` or valid '?' characters, `y1` remains True. If `p1len` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `y1` remains True. In cases where `p1` and `qr` are both empty, the loop does not execute, and `y1` is still True.**
