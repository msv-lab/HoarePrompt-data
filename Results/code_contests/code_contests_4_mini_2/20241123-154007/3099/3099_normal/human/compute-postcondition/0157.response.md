The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables; it simply skips the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged, except for noting that we are skipping the current iteration.

Output State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`, `p` is an input string, `n` is greater than 0, `plen` is the length of `p`, `p0` is the substring of `p` before the first '*', `p1` is the substring of `p` after the first '*' reversed, `p0len` is the length of `p0`, `p1len` is the length of `p1`, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is less than `plen - 1`, and the output is 'NO', and we continue to the next iteration.**
