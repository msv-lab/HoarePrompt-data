Postcondition: ***`y` is False if the first element of `p` is a '?' and the first element of `q` is not in `good_letters`, or if the first element of `p` is not equal to the first element of `q`. If `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The variable `i` is incremented by 1, and `plen` remains unchanged.***
