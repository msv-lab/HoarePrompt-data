Postcondition: ***`y0` is either True or False, `y1` is set to False and 'NO' is printed if `p1[i]` is '?' and `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`. If `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]` in the else part, `y1` is also set to False and 'NO' is printed. If `qr[i]` is in `good_letters`, `y1` remains True. If `p1[i]` is equal to `qr[i]`, `y1` remains True as well. The index `i` is less than `p1len`, which is greater than 0, ensuring that the comparison is valid and within bounds.***
