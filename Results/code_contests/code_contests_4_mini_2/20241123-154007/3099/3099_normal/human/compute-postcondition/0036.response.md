Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`, `p` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?" and "*", `n` is greater than 0, `plen` is greater than 0, `qlen` is the length of `q`, and `i` is 1. If the character at position `i` in string `p` is not equal to the character at position `i` in string `q`, the output is 'NO', `y` is set to False, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of `y` remains True, but no further actions are taken as there is no else part.***
