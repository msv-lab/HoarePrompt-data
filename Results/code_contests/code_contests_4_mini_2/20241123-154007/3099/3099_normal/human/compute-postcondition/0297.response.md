The `continue` statement is executed, which causes the loop to skip the rest of the current iteration and proceeds to the next iteration. Since no variable values are changed as a result of this statement, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`y0` is False, indicating that either there is at least one character at index `i` of `p0` that is '?' and the corresponding character in `q` is not in `good_letters`, or there is at least one character at index `i` of `p0` that does not match the character at index `i` of `q`. Additionally, `p0` is not empty (i.e., `p0len` is greater than 0), `n` is greater than the current iteration count, and `i` is less than `p0len`.**
