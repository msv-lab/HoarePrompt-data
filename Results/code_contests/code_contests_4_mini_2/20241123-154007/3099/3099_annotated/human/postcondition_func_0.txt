The function accepts a string of distinct lowercase English letters (`good_letters`), a pattern string (`p`) that may include lowercase letters, '?' characters, and at most one '*' character, along with a non-negative integer (`n`). It processes `n` query strings and checks if each query matches the pattern based on the defined rules. If there is no '*', it checks for an exact match considering '?' can match any character from `good_letters`. If there is a '*', it verifies that the segments of the query before and after the '*' match the respective segments in the pattern while ensuring that the substring between the two segments does not contain any characters from `good_letters`. The function returns 'YES' or 'NO' for each query based on these conditions. Edge cases include handling empty queries, queries shorter than expected lengths, and correct interpretation of '?' and '*'. If `n` is zero, no queries are processed and no output is produced.
