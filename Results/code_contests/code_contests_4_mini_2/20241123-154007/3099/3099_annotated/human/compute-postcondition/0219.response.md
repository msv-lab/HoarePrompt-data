Postcondition: ***`y0` is True, `y1` is False; if `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, the program prints 'NO', sets `y1` to False, and breaks out of the loop, indicating an invalid character. If `qr[i]` is in `good_letters`, `y1` remains unchanged at True. This logic ensures that the program correctly handles the cases where `qr[i]` is either valid or invalid with respect to `good_letters`.***
