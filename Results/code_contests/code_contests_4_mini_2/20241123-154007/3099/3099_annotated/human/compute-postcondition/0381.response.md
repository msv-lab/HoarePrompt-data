The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than `k`, `qlen` is either less than `plen - 1` or greater than or equal to `plen - 1`, `y0` is set to False, `i` is 1, `p0len` is greater than 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
