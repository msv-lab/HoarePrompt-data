The given code executes a print statement which outputs the string 'NO'. The values of the variables `plen`, `y`, and `i` are not affected by this print operation. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged in terms of variable values. 

Output State: **`plen` is at least 2, `y` is False, `i` is 2, and the output is 'NO'**
