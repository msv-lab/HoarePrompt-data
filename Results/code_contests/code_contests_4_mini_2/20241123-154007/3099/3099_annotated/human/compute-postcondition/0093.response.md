Postcondition: ***`plen` is at least 3 and `y` is initially True. If `p[i]` is equal to '?', then if `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the program breaks. If `q[i]` is in `good_letters`, `y` remains True. If `p[i]` is not equal to '?', but `p[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, then 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the program breaks. If `p[i]` is equal to `q[i]`, the values of `y` and the program state remain unchanged.***
