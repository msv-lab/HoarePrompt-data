The value of `y` is assigned the value `False`. The previous value of `y` was `True`, but now it changes to `False`. The values of `plen` and `i` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `plen` is at least 3, `y` is False, `i` is 2, and the output is 'NO'.

Output State: **`plen` is at least 3, `y` is False, `i` is 2, and the output is 'NO'**
