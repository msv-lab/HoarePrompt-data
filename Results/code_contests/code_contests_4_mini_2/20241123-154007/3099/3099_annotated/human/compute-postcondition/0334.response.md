Postcondition: ***`y1` is initially True. If `p1[i]` is equal to '?', and `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, the function prints 'NO', sets `y1` to False, and breaks the execution. If `qr[i]` is in `good_letters`, `y1` remains True. If `p1[i]` is not equal to '?', and `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`, the function prints 'NO', sets `y1` to False, and breaks the execution. If `p1[i]` is equal to `qr[i]`, `y1` remains True, and no other variables are altered. In all cases, if neither condition leads to a change in `y1`, it retains its initial value of True.***
