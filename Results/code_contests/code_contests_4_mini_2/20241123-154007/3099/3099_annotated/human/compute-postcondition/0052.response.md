Postcondition: ***If `plen` is at least 1 and `y` is True, the function prints 'YES'. If `plen` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `y` remains True, resulting in the same output. If `y` is False due to any character mismatches or invalid conditions during the loop execution, 'YES' is not printed.***
