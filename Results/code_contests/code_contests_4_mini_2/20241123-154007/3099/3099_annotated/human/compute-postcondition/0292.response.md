Postcondition: ***`p1len` is greater than 0, `y1` is False, `n` is greater than _, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, `y0` remains False, `p0len` is greater than 2, and `i` is 2. If the character at index `i` of `p0` is not equal to the character at index `i` of `q`, the program prints 'NO', sets `y0` to False, and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
