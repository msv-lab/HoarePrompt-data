Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct lowercase English letters from `gls`. If the character at index 2 of the input string `q` is not in `good_letters`, the function prints 'NO', sets `y0` to False, and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the character is in `good_letters`, no changes are made to `y0` or any other variables, and no output is produced.***
