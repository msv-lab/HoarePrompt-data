Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct lowercase English letters from `gls`, `p` is an input string from the user with length at least 2, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `q` is an input string of length `qlen`, and `i` is 2. If the character at position `i` of `q` is not in `good_letters`, the program prints 'NO', sets `y` to False, and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the character at position `i` of `q` is in `good_letters`, the program continues without any changes to `y` or a print statement.***
