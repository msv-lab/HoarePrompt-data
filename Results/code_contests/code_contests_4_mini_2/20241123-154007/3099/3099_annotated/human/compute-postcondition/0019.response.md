The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `good_letters` is a set of distinct lowercase English letters from `gls`, `p` is an input string from the user, `plen` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `y` is False, `i` is 0, the character at index `i` of `p` is a question mark ('?'), and the character at index `i` of `q` is not in `good_letters`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
