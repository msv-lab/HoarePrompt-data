The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. The values of the variables are not changed by this statement. Therefore, the output state reflects that we are continuing to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`p1len` is greater than 0, `y1` is False, `n` is greater than _, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
