The `print` statement outputs the string 'NO' to the console, but it does not change any of the variable values. The variables `p1len`, `i`, and `y1` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `p1len` is the length of `p1`, `i` is `p1len`, `y1` is the same as before, and the output is 'NO'.

Output State: **`p1len` is the length of `p1`, `i` is `p1len`, `y1` is the same as before, and the output is 'NO'**
