Postcondition: ***`y0` remains unchanged unless `p0[i]` is equal to '?' and `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, in which case `y0` is set to False, 'NO' is printed, and the execution breaks. If `p0[i]` is not equal to '?' and `p0[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, then `y0` is also set to False, 'NO' is printed, and the execution breaks. In all cases, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than `k`, `qlen` can be either less than or greater than or equal to `plen - 1`, and `p0len` is greater than 1.***
