Postcondition: ***`y0` is False, `y1` is False, `qr` is the reverse of `q`. If `y1` is False, it indicates that at least one character in `p1` did not match the corresponding character in `qr`, or a character in `p1` was a '?' and the corresponding character in `qr` was not in `good_letters`, leading to the continuation to the next iteration of the loop. If `p1len` is 0, `y1` remains True, and the loop does not execute. Thus, if `y1` is False, the loop proceeds without changing `y1`, ensuring that the continuation logic accounts for edge cases where `p1` may be empty or all characters match.***
