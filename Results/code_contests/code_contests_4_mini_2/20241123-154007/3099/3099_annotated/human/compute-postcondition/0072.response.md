Postcondition: ***`plen` is at least 1, `y` is True initially and `n` is greater than 0. If the character at index `i` in string `p` is not equal to the character at index `i` in string `q`, then 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the current loop is exited. If the characters are equal, the program continues execution without any changes to `y`.***
