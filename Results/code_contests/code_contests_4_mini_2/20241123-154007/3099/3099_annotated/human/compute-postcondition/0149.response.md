The variable `p1` is assigned the value of its reverse, indicated by `p1[::-1]`. The original value of `p1` is changed to its reversed version, but the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `p1` while the other variables remain as they were.

Output State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct lowercase English letters from `gls`, `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the reversed substring after '*', `plen` is the length of the input string `p`, and `n` is an input string**
