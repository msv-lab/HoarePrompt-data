According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `plen`. If `plen` is at least 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `plen` is at least 1, meaning the loop can execute again. For the loop to execute one more time, `plen` must be at least 2 because the loop will iterate from 0 to `plen - 1`. The variable `i` will also need to be incremented to 1 for the next iteration.

State: **`plen` is at least 2, `y` is initially True, `i` is 1**
