Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct lowercase English letters from `gls`, `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the reversed substring after '*', `plen` is the length of the input string `p`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `p0len` is greater than 0, `p1len` is the length of `p1`, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, and `i` is 0. If the character at index `i` of `p0` is a '?', then `y0` is False if the character at index `i` of `q` is not in `good_letters`, and the output 'NO' is printed, exiting the loop. Otherwise, `y0` remains True. If the character at index `i` of `p0` is not equal to the character at index `i` of `q`, then `y0` is set to False, 'NO' is printed, and the loop is exited. If they are equal, `y0` remains unchanged, and the program continues executing.***
