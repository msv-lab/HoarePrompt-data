Postcondition: ***`plen` is at least 1, `y` is True, `n` is greater than 0, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, and `i` is 0. If the character at position `i` in string `p` is not equal to the character at position `i` in string `q`, 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, there is no change to `y` or control flow.***
