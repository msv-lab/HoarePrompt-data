Postcondition: ***`y0` is True, `y1` is False, `qr` is the reversed value of `q`, `p1len` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and the element at index `i` of `p1` is equal to '?'. If the element at index `i` of `qr` is not in `good_letters`, the program prints 'NO' and the value of `y1` is set to False, indicating that a character at the specified position does not meet the required condition. There are no further conditions or else parts to handle.***
