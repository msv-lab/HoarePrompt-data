Postcondition: ***`y0` is False, `y1` is False, `qr` is the reverse of `q`, and `p1len` is greater than 1. If the character at index `i` (which is 2) of `qr` is not in `good_letters`, the program prints 'NO', sets `y1` to False, and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `qr[i]` is in `good_letters`, then no changes occur to `y1`, and execution continues without breaking.***
