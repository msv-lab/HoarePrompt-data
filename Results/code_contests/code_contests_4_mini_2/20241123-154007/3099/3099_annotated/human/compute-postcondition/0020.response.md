Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct lowercase English letters from `gls`, `p` is an input string from the user, `plen` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `q` is an input string with length `qlen`, `y` is a boolean variable, and `i` is 0. If the character at index `i` of `q` is not in `good_letters`, the program prints 'NO', sets `y` to False, and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the character at index `i` of `q` is in `good_letters`, `y` remains True, and no other actions are taken.***
