The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop, if there is one. Since we are not provided with any information about the loop structure or the context in which `continue` is executed, we assume that it is being executed within a loop. 

Therefore, the output state is: `good_letters` is a set of distinct lowercase English letters from `gls`, `p` is an input string from the user, `plen` is the length of the input string `p`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, and `qlen` is not equal to `plen`, and the output is 'NO', and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
