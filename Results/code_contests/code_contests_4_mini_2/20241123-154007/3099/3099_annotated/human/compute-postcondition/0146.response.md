Output State: **After the loop executes `n` times, for each input string `q`, if `plen` is greater than 0 and `y` is True, the function prints 'YES' indicating that `q` successfully matched the conditions defined by `p`. If `plen` is 0, the loop does not execute and `y` remains True, so 'YES' is not printed. If `y` becomes False during the execution due to mismatches or invalid conditions (i.e., characters in `p` do not match corresponding characters in `q`, or characters in `p` are '?' but the corresponding characters in `q` are not in `good_letters`), 'YES' is not printed. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and no output occurs. The values of `qlen` will be equal to `plen` for each valid `q`.**
