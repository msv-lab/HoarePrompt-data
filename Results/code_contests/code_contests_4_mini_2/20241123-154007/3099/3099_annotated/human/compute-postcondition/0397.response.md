The statement `continue` causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables are not changed by this statement, but the loop will continue to execute as long as its condition allows (up to a maximum of `p0len` times). Thus, the output state reflects that the loop will continue without any changes to the variable states.

Output State: **`p0len` is greater than 0, the loop will continue executing, `y0` is False, `n` is greater than `k`, `qlen` is either less than or greater than or equal to `plen - 1`**
