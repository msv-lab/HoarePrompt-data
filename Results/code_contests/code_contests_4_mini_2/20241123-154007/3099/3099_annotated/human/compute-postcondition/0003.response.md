The length of the string `p` is calculated and assigned to the variable `plen`. The value of `plen` will be equal to the number of characters in the input string `p`. The variable `good_letters` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `good_letters` is a set of distinct lowercase English letters from `gls`, `p` is an input string from the user, and `plen` is the length of the input string `p`.

Output State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct lowercase English letters from `gls`, `p` is an input string from the user, and `plen` is the length of the input string `p`.**
