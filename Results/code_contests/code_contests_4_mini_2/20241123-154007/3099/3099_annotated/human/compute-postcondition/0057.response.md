The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and continue with the next iteration. Since the values of the variables do not change and the program moves to the next iteration of the loop without any further action taken, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables and acknowledges the continuation of the loop.

Output State: **`plen` is at least 1, `y` is True, `n` is greater than 0, and `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`; 'NO' is printed and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
