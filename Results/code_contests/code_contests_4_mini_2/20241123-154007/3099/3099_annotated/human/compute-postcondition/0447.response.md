The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'NO'. The values of the variables `y0`, `y1`, `qr`, and `t` are not changed by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables along with the printed output.

Output State: **`y0` is False, `y1` is False, `qr` is the reverse of `q`, `t` is the substring of `q` based on `p1len`, and the function prints 'NO'**
