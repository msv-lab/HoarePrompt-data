Postcondition: ***`p1len` is greater than 0, `y1` is False, `n` is greater than _, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, `y0` remains False, `p0len` is greater than 0, and `i` is 1. If `p0[i]` is a '?' and `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed and the program breaks out of the loop. If `p0[i]` is a '?' and `q[i]` is in `good_letters`, no output occurs and the program continues. If `p0[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, 'NO' is printed and the program breaks out of the loop, ensuring that `y0` remains False in both cases.***
