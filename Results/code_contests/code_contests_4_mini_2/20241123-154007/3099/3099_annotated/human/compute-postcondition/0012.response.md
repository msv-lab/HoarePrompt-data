Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct lowercase English letters from `gls`, `p` is an input string from the user, `plen` is the length of `p`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `q` is an input string, and `qlen` is the length of `q`. If `qlen` is not equal to `plen`, the output is 'NO' and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `qlen` equals `plen`, there is no output and the program proceeds without interruption.***
