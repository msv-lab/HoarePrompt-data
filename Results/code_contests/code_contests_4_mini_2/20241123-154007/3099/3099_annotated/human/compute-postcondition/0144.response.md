Postcondition: ***`y` is a boolean variable that indicates whether all characters at each index `i` in `p` satisfy the given conditions in relation to `q`. If `y` is True, the output is 'YES'. If `plen` is 0, then `y` remains True and the print statement does not execute. If `plen` is at least 1, `y` remains True if all corresponding characters are either equal or if `p[i]` is a question mark ('?') corresponding to a character in `q` that is in `good_letters`. If any condition fails, `y` becomes False, and the output does not print 'YES'.***
