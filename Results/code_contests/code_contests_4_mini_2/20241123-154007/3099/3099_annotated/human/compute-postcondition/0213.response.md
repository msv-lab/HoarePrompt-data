Postcondition: ***`y0` is True, `y1` is False, `qr` is the reversed value of `q`, `p1len` is greater than 0, and `i` is 0. If the first element of `p1` (i.e., `p1[0]`) is not equal to `qr[0]`, the output is 'NO', and `y1` is set to False, indicating a mismatch. If there is no mismatch in the first element, the program proceeds without changes to `y1`.***
