Given the initial state:

- `y0` is True
- `y1` is False if the first element of `p1` is equal to '?', and the corresponding element in `qr` is not in `good_letters`. Otherwise, `y1` can be True or False based on conditions not specified here.
- If the first element of `p1` is not equal to `qr[0]`, the program prints 'NO' and sets `y1` to False. 
- If `p1[0]` is equal to `qr[0]` and `p1[0]` is not '?', then `y1` remains True; `p1len` is greater than 0, `i` is 1.

Now executing the code snippet:
```
print('NO')
```

The print statement outputs 'NO', but does not affect the variable states. 

Therefore, the output state remains as follows:
- `y0` is True
- `y1` remains False (assuming conditions leading to the print statement were met, as indicated by the context of the problem)
- No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`y0` is True, `y1` is False, and the program prints 'NO'**
