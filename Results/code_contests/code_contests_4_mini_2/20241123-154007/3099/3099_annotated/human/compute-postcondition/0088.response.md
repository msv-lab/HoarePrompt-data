Postcondition: ***`plen` is at least 3, `y` is initially True. If `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, then `y` is set to False and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `q[i]` is in `good_letters`, `y` remains True, and the program continues execution beyond this block.***
