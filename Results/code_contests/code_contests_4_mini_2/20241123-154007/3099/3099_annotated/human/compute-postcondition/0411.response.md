The value of `y1` is assigned to `False`. The previous value of `y1` was `True`, so it changes from `True` to `False`. The other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `y0` is False, `y1` is False, `qr` is the reverse of `q`, `p1len` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, the element at index `i` of `p1` is not equal to '?', the element at index `i` of `p1` is not equal to the element at index `i` of `qr`, and the output is 'NO'.

Output State: **`y0` is False, `y1` is False, `qr` is the reverse of `q`, `p1len` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, the element at index `i` of `p1` is not equal to '?', the element at index `i` of `p1` is not equal to the element at index `i` of `qr`, and the output is 'NO'**.
