The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of the if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `y1` is False, `p1len` is greater than 0, `q` is defined with a value, `qr` is the reversed value of `q`, `i` is 0, and 'NO' is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
