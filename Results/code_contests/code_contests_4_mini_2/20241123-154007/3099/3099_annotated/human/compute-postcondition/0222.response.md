The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. The program also prints 'NO', which does not affect the variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `y0` is True, `y1` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, while the program prints 'NO'.
