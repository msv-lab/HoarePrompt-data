The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables `plen`, `y`, `n`, and `qlen` remain unchanged. The output state indicates that we are continuing to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`plen` is at least 1, `y` is True, `n` is greater than 0, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
