Postcondition: ***If `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`, then `y1` is set to False, and 'NO' is printed, leading to an exit from the most internal loop or if statement. If `p1[i]` is equal to `qr[i]`, the program continues without modifying `y1` or producing any output, assuming subsequent logic follows after this condition. Additionally, since `i` is equal to `p1len`, this implies that the comparison is being made at the boundary of the string length, which could indicate a potential edge case where `i` might be out of bounds if `p1` or `qr` are not properly indexed. Therefore, it's crucial to ensure that both `p1` and `qr` have lengths greater than `i` to avoid index errors.***
