The `print('NO')` statement outputs the string 'NO' to the console. This action does not modify the values of any variables, including `plen`, `y`, or `i`. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables, along with the printed output.

Output State: **`plen` is at least 3, `y` is True, `i` is 2, and 'NO' is printed to the console**
