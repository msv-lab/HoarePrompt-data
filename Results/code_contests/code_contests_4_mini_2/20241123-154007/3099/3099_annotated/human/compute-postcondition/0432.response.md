The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `y0` is False, `y1` is False, `qr` is the reverse of `q`, `p1len` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, and the output is 'NO', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
