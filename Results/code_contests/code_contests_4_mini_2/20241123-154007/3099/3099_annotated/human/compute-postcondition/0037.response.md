Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct lowercase English letters from `gls`, `p` is an input string from the user, `plen` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `q` is an input string of length `qlen`, and `i` is 1. If the character at index `i` of string `p` is a '?', and the character at index `i` of string `q` is not in `good_letters`, the output 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `q[i]` is in `good_letters`, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `p[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, the output 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `p[i]` equals `q[i]`, the program continues without changing `y` or producing any output, maintaining its previous values. This ensures that all conditions regarding the character comparisons and the content of `good_letters` are adequately handled.***
