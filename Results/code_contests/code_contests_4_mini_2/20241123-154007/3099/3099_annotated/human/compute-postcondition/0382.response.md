Postcondition: ***If `p0[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, then the function prints 'NO', sets `y0` to False, and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, while `n` is greater than `k`, `qlen` is either less than `plen - 1` or greater than or equal to `plen - 1`, `i` is 1, and `p0len` is greater than 1. If `p0[i]` is equal to `q[i]`, no changes are made to `y0`, and the state remains as initially described in the precondition.***
