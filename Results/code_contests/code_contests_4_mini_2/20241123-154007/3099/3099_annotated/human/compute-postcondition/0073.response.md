Postcondition: ***`plen` is at least 1, `y` is initially True. If the character at index `i` of the string `p` is '?', and if the character at index `i` of the string `q` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed, and `y` is set to False. If the character at index `i` of the string `q` is in `good_letters`, `y` remains True. If the character at index `i` of the string `p` is not equal to the character at index `i` of the string `q`, 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and execution breaks out of the current loop. If they are equal, the program continues without changing `y`. The variable `n` remains greater than 0, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, and `i` is 0 throughout the execution.***
