Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than `k`, and if the length of the user input string `q` (`qlen`) is less than `plen - 1`, then 'NO' is printed, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `qlen` is greater than or equal to `plen - 1`, then nothing is printed, and the program proceeds normally.***
