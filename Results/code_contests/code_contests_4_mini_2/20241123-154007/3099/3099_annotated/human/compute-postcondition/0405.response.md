The variable `y1` is assigned the value `False`, changing its previous value from `True` to `False`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `y0` is False, `y1` is False, `qr` is the reverse of `q`, `p1len` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, the first element of `p1` at index `i` is equal to '?', and the element `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`; printed 'NO'.
