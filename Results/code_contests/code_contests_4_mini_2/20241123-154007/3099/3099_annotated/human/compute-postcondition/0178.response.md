Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct lowercase English letters from `gls`, `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the reversed substring after '*', `plen` is the length of the input string `p`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `p0len` is greater than 1, `p1len` is the length of `p1`, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, and `i` is 1. If the character at index `1` of `q` is not in `good_letters`, the function prints 'NO', sets `y0` to False, and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues without changes to `y0` or printing.***
