The value of `y` is explicitly assigned the value `False`, which confirms its current state. The previous values of the affected variables are `plen` is at least 2, `y` is False, and `i` is 2. The assignment does not change any other variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same for `plen` and `i`, while `y` is confirmed to be False.

Output State: **`plen` is at least 2, `y` is False, `i` is 2**
