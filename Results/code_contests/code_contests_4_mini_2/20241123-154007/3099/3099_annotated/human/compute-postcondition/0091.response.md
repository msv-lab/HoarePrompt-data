The `break` statement is executed, which causes an immediate exit from the most inner loop or if statement that we were directly inside. However, the values of the variables do not change as a result of this execution. Therefore, the output state remains the same for the unaffected variables. 

Output State: **`plen` is at least 3, `y` is False, `i` is 2, and 'NO' is printed to the console and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
