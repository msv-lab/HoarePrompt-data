Postcondition: ***`y1` is a boolean value indicating whether all conditions for the characters in `p1` and `qr` are satisfied. If `y1` is False, it signifies that at least one condition has failed during the execution of the loop, which only executes if `p1len` is greater than 0. If `p1len` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `y1` remains True. Therefore, if the loop has executed and `y1` is False, it confirms that one or more conditions were not met; otherwise, if `y1` is True, all conditions were satisfied or the loop did not execute.***
