The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement that we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `good_letters` is a set of distinct lowercase English letters from `gls`, `p` is an input string from the user, `plen` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `q` is an input string of length `qlen`, `y` is False, `i` is 1, and 'NO' is printed to the output, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
