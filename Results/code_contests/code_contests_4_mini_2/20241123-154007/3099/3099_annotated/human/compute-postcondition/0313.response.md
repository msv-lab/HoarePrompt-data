Postcondition: ***`y1` is True initially, `p1len` is greater than 0, `q` is defined with a value, `qr` is the reversed value of `q`, and if `p1[0]` is not equal to `qr[0]`, 'NO' is printed and `y1` is set to False, indicating a mismatch at the first position. If `p1[0]` equals `qr[0]`, `y1` remains True, and no change occurs to `y1` or any other variables as no further action is taken.***
