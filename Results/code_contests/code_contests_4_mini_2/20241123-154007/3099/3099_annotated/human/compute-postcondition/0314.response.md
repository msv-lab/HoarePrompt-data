Postcondition: ***`y1` is a Boolean variable that is initially True. If `p1[0]` is equal to '?', and if the first character of `qr` (which is the reversed value of `q`) is not found in `good_letters`, then 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and execution breaks out of the current loop. If `qr[0]` is in `good_letters`, then `y1` remains True. If `p1[0]` is not equal to '?', and `p1[0]` is not equal to `qr[0]`, then 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and execution breaks out of the current loop. If neither condition is met, `y1` remains True, indicating that the conditions were satisfied and no mismatch occurred.***
