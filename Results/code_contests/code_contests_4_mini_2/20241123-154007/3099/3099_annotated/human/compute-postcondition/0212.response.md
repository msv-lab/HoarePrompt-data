The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `y0` is True, `y1` is False, `qr` is assigned the reversed value of `q`, `p1len` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, the element `p1[0]` is not equal to '?', the element `p1[0]` is not equal to `qr[0]`, and the output is 'NO', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
