The code executes a `print` statement which outputs the string 'NO'. The values of the variables `plen`, `y`, and `i` do not change as a result of this execution. Therefore, the output state remains the same for the variables while reflecting the output of the print statement.

Output State: **`plen` is at least 3, `y` is True, `i` is 2, and the output is 'NO'**
