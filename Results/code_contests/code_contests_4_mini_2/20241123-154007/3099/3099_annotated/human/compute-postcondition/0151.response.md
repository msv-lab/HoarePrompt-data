The variable `p1len` is assigned the value of `len(p1)`, which computes the length of the substring `p1`. The other variables are not affected by this operation, and their values remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state retains the information about `good_letters`, `p0`, `p1`, `plen`, `n`, and `p0len`, while also providing the new value for `p1len`.

Output State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct lowercase English letters from `gls`, `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the reversed substring after '*', `plen` is the length of the input string `p`, `n` is an input string, `p0len` is the length of `p0`, and `p1len` is the length of `p1`**
