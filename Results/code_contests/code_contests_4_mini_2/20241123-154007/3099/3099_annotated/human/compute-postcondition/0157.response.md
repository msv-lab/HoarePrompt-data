The statement `continue` does not change the values of any variables but indicates that the program should skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. Since the context suggests that the program is within a loop, the output state will reflect that the execution continues in the loop without modifying any states. 

Output State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct lowercase English letters from `gls`, `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the reversed substring after '*', `plen` is the length of the input string `p`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `p0len` is the length of `p0`, `p1len` is the length of `p1`, `q` is an input string, and `qlen` is the length of `q`; the function continues to the next iteration of the loop.**
