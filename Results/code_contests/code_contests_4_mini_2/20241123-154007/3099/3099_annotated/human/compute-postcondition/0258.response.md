Postcondition: ***`p1len` is greater than 0, `y1` is False, `n` is greater than _, and `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`. If `qlen` is less than `p1len - 1`, the program prints 'NO' and continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `qlen` is greater than or equal to `p1len - 1`, no action is taken in this block.***
