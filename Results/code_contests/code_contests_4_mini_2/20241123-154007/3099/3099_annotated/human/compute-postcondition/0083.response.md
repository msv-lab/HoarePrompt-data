Postcondition: ***`plen` is at least 2, `y` is initially True. If the character at index `i` of `p` is '?', and if `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, then 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the function breaks out of the loop. If `q[i]` is in `good_letters`, then no output occurs and `y` remains True. If the character at index `i` of `p` is not '?', and if `p[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the function breaks out of the loop. If the characters at index `i` of `p` and `q` are equal, then no output occurs and `y` remains True. Thus, the final state of `y` reflects whether a discrepancy was found in the comparisons based on the conditions checked.***
