Output State: **`y` is False if any character at index `i` in `p` is a question mark ('?') and the corresponding character in `q` is not in `good_letters`, or if any character at index `i` in `p` is not equal to the character at index `i` in `q`. If `plen` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `y` remains True. If `plen` is at least 1 and all conditions are satisfied, `y` remains True.**
