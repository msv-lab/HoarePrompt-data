Postcondition: ***`y0` is False, `y1` is False, `qr` is the reverse of `q`, `p1len` is greater than 0, and `i` is 0. If the first element of `p1` at index `i` is equal to '?' and `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed and the execution breaks. If the first element of `p1` at index `i` is equal to '?' and `qr[i]` is in `good_letters`, no output occurs. If the first element of `p1` at index `i` is not equal to `qr[i]`, 'NO' is printed and the execution breaks. If `p1[i]` is equal to `qr[i]`, no output occurs, and the program continues without changing `y1`.***
