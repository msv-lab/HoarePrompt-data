To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the variables involved in the loop and their current states.

1. The loop iterates from `0` to `p1len - 1`. 
2. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to `p1len`, meaning the loop has already completed all its iterations.
3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to `p1len + 1`, which is out of bounds, hence we cannot just adjust `i`.
4. Since `p1len` must be greater than `i` for the loop to run again, and `i` being equal to `p1len` indicates that we have completed the final allowed iteration, we need to adjust `p1len` to be `p1len + 1`.
5. This adjustment is necessary to enable another iteration of the loop.

In summary, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `p1len`, as it directly impacts the loop's ability to execute again. 

State: **`p1len` is `p1len + 1`, `i` is equal to `p1len`, and `y1` is the same as before**
