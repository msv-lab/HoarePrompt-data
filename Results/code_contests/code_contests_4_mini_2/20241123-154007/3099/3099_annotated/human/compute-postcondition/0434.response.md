Postcondition: ***`y0` is False, `y1` is False, `qr` is the reverse of `q`, and `p1len` is greater than 1. If the character at index `i` (which is 2) of `p1` is a '?', then if `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed and `y1` remains False; if `qr[i]` is in `good_letters`, no changes occur. If `p1[i]` is not a '?', then if `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`, 'NO' is printed and `y1` remains False; if they are equal, there are no changes or output. In all cases, the execution may break out of the innermost loop or if statement based on the conditions evaluated.***
