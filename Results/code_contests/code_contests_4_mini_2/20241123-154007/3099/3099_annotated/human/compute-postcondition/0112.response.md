Postcondition: ***`plen` is at least 1, `y` is set to False, and the program prints 'NO' if the character at index `i` of `q` is not in `good_letters`. If the character at index `i` of `p` is a question mark ('?'), `n` is greater than 0, and `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
