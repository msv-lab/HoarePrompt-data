Postcondition: ***`y0` is False, `y1` is False, `qr` is the reverse of `q`, and `t` is assigned based on the value of `p1len`. If `p1len` is 0, then `t` is equal to the substring of `q` starting from index `p0len` to the end. If `p1len` is greater than 0, then `t` is assigned the substring of `q` from index `p0len` to the index `-p1len`, which excludes the last `p1len` characters of `q`.***
