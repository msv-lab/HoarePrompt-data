Postcondition: ***`y1` is initially True and `i` is equal to `p1len - 1`, where `p1len` is greater than `i`. If `p1[i]` is equal to '?', and if `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, the function prints 'NO', sets `y1` to False, and exits the loop. If `qr[i]` is in `good_letters`, `y1` remains True. If `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`, the function prints 'NO', sets `y1` to False, and exits the loop. If neither condition is met, `y1` remains True, indicating a match or valid character.***
