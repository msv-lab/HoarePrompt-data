Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than `k`, `qlen` is either less than `plen - 1` or greater than or equal to `plen - 1`, `y0` is either unchanged or set to False, `i` is 1, `p0len` is greater than 1. If the element at index `i` of `q` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed, and `y0` is set to False, breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the element at index `i` of `q` is in `good_letters`, the values of `y0`, `i`, and the printed output remain unchanged.***
