The code executes a print statement which outputs the string 'NO'. The values of the variables `y1`, `i`, and `p1len` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `y1` is True, `i` is equal to `p1len - 1`, `p1len` is greater than `i`, and the function prints 'NO'.

Output State: **`y1` is True, `i` is equal to `p1len - 1`, `p1len` is greater than `i`, and the function prints 'NO'**
