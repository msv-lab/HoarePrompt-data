The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `good_letters` is a set of distinct lowercase English letters from `gls`, `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the reversed substring after '*', `plen` is the length of the input string `p`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `p0len` is greater than 0, `p1len` is the length of `p1`, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `y0` is False, `i` is 0, the character at index `i` of `p0` is '?', and the character at index `i` of `q` is not in `good_letters`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
