Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct lowercase English letters, `p` is an input string from the user, `plen` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `q` is an input string of length `qlen`, `y` is a boolean variable, and `i` is 1. If the character at index `i` of string `q` is not in `good_letters`, the output 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the character at index `i` is within `good_letters`, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
