The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'YES'. The variables `plen` and `y` are not affected by this operation, and their states remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `plen` is at least 1, `y` is True, and the function prints 'YES'.

Output State: **`plen` is at least 1, `y` is True, and the function prints 'YES'**
