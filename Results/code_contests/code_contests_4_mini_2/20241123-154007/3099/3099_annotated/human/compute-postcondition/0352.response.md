Postcondition: ***If `y0` and `y1` are both true booleans, indicating that all conditions for the characters in `p1` and `qr` are satisfied, then 'YES' is printed. If either `y0` or `y1` is false, nothing is printed, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. The variable `t` is correctly sliced from `q` based on the lengths of `p1` and `p0` while ensuring no negative indices are used.***
