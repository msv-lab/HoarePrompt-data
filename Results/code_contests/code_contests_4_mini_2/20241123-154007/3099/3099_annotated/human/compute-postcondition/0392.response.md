Postcondition: ***`y0` is unchanged if `p0[i]` is equal to `q[i]`. If `p0[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, then `y0` is set to False, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than `k`, `qlen` is either less than or greater than or equal to `plen - 1`, and `p0len` is greater than 1, and the output is 'NO' followed by a break in the execution.***
