The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `plen` is at least 3, `y` is False, `i` is 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **`plen` is at least 3, `y` is False, `i` is 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
