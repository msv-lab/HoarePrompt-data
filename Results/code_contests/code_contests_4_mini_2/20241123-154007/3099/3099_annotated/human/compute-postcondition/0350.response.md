Postcondition: ***`y0` is a boolean, `y1` is a boolean indicating that all conditions for the characters in `p1` and `qr` are satisfied. `t` is a slice of `q` starting from index `p0len` to the end of `q` if `p1len` is 0, or sliced from `q` starting at `p0len` and ending at the appropriate index if `p1len` is greater than 0, ensuring that no negative indices are used.***
