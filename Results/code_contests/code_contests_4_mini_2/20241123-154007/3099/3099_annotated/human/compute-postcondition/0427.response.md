The value of `y1` is assigned the value `False`, which is its current value. Therefore, there is no change to the state of `y1`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`y0` is False, `y1` is False, `qr` is the reverse of `q`, `p1len` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, and the function prints 'NO'**
