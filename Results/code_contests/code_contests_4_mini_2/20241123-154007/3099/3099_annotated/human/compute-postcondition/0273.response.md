Postcondition: ***`p1len` is greater than 0, `y1` is False, `n` is greater than _, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, `y0` is False, `p0len` is greater than 0, and `i` is 0. If the character at index `i` of `p0` is '?', the function checks if the character at index `i` of `q` is in `good_letters`; if it is not, 'NO' is printed, and the program exits the most internal loop. If the character at index `i` of `p0` is not equal to the character at index `i` of `q`, 'NO' is printed, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop. Thus, `y0` is set to False in either case where a condition fails.***
