The `continue` statement is executed, which causes the program to skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables do not change as a result of this statement. Therefore, the output state remains the same.

Output State: **`y0` is False, `y1` is False, `qr` is the reverse of `q`, and at least one character in `p1` did not match the corresponding character in `qr`, or a character in `p1` was a '?' and the corresponding character in `qr` was not in `good_letters`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
