The `print('NO')` statement outputs the string 'NO' to the console. The values of the variables `y0`, `y1`, `qr`, `p1len`, `i`, `p1`, and `good_letters` remain unchanged as this statement does not modify any variables. Therefore, the output state is: `y0` is True, `y1` is True, `qr` is the reversed value of `q`, `p1len` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, the element at index `i` of `p1` is equal to '?', and the element at index `i` of `qr` is not in `good_letters`, and the output 'NO' is printed.
