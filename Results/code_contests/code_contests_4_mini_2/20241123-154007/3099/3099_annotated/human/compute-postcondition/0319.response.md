Postcondition: ***`y1` is True, `i` is equal to `p1len - 1`, and `p1len` is greater than `i`. If `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, the function prints 'NO', sets `y1` to False, and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `qr[i]` is in `good_letters`, `y1` remains True, and there are no changes to `i` or `p1len`.***
