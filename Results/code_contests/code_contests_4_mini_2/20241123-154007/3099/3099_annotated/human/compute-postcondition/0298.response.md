Postcondition: ***If `y0` is False, the loop continues to the next iteration; this occurs when `p0len` is greater than 0 and at least one character of `p0` does not match the corresponding character of `q`, or a '?' in `p0` corresponds to a character in `q` that is not in `good_letters`. If `p0len` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `y0` remains True. Additionally, `p1len` is greater than 0, `y1` is False, `n` is greater than _, and `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`. Thus, if the loop continues, it implies that either `y0` is False or no further statements are executed in the current iteration.***
