Postcondition: ***`y0` is False, `y1` is False, `qr` is the reverse of `q`, `p1len` is greater than 1, and `i` is 1. If the character at index `i` of `qr` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed, `y1` remains False, and execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the character at index `i` of `qr` is in `good_letters`, no changes occur to `y1` and the program continues execution.***
