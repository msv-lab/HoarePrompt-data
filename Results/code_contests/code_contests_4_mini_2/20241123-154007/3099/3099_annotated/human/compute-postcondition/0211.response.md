The value of `y1` is assigned `False`, changing its previous value from `True` to `False`. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `y0` is True, `y1` is False, `qr` is assigned the reversed value of `q`, `p1len` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, the element `p1[0]` is not equal to '?', and the element `p1[0]` is not equal to `qr[0]`, and the output is 'NO'.
