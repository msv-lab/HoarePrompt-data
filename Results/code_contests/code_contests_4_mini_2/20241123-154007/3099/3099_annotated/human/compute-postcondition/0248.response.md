The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. Instead, it skips the current iteration of the loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Given the information that `p1len` is greater than 0, `y1` is False, `t` is a substring of `q`, and the intersection of the set of characters in `t` and `good_letters` is not empty (indicating that `t` contains at least one character from `good_letters`), the program will continue to the next iteration without changing any variable states.

Output State: **`p1len` is greater than 0, `y1` is False, `t` is a substring of `q`, the intersection of `t` and `good_letters` is not empty, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
