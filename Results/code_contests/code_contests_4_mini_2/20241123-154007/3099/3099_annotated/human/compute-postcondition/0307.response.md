Postcondition: ***`y1` is a Boolean variable that is initially True. If the first character of `qr` (which is the reversed value of `q`) at index `i` (where `i` is 0) is not found in `good_letters`, then `y1` is set to False, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The length of `p1` is greater than 0, and the first element of `p1` at index `i` is equal to '?' prior to this check. If `qr[0]` is in `good_letters`, `y1` remains True.***
