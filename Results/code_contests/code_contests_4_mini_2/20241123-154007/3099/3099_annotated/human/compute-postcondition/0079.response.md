The code prints 'NO', which does not affect the values of the variables `plen`, `y`, or `i`. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged except for the action of printing. The values of the variables are still `plen` is at least 2, `y` is True, and `i` is 1.

Output State: **`plen` is at least 2, `y` is True, `i` is 1, and 'NO' is printed**
