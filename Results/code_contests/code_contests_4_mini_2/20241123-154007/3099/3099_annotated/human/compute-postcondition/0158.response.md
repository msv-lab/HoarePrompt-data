Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct lowercase English letters from `gls`, `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the reversed substring after '*', `plen` is the length of the input string `p`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `p0len` is the length of `p0`, `p1len` is the length of `p1`, `q` is an input string, and `qlen` is the length of `q`. If `qlen` is less than `plen - 1`, the program prints 'NO' and continues to the next iteration of the loop, indicating that the length of `q` is insufficient to match the expected pattern derived from `p`. Otherwise, this condition is not met, and the loop proceeds without printing 'NO'.***
