The variable `y1` is assigned the value `False`, changing its previous value from `True` to `False`. The variable `i` and the output remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `y1` is False, `i` is equal to `p1len`, and the output is 'NO'.

Output State: **`y1` is False, `i` is equal to `p1len`, and the output is 'NO'**
