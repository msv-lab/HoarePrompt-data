The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. In this case, the state of the variables does not change, but we will not execute any further code in the current loop iteration. Therefore, the output state is that `p0len` is greater than 0, `y0` is False, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`p0len` is greater than 0, `y0` is False, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
