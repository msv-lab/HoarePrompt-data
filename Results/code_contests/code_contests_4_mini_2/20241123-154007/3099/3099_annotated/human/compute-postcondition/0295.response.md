Output State: **If `p0len` is greater than 0, then after the loop executes, `y0` will be False if any character of `p0` does not match the corresponding character of `q`, or if a '?' in `p0` corresponds to a character in `q` that is not in `good_letters`. If `p0len` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `y0` remains True. `p1len` is greater than 0, `y1` is False, `n` is greater than _, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`. Additionally, if all characters match, or '?' corresponds to valid characters, `y0` remains True.**
