Postcondition: ***If `p1len` is greater than 0 and `y1` is False, the loop continues to the next iteration. This occurs if at least one of the following conditions is met: at least one `p1[i]` is equal to `'?'` and the corresponding `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, or at least one `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`. If `p1len` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `y1` remains True. Otherwise, if `y1` is True, the loop proceeds without interruption.***
