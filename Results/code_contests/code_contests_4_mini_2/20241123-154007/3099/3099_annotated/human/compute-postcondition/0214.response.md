Postcondition: ***`y0` is True, `y1` is False if the first element of `p1` is equal to '?', and the corresponding element in `qr` is not in `good_letters`, the program prints 'NO' and sets `y1` to False. If the first element of `p1` is not equal to `qr[0]`, the program prints 'NO' and sets `y1` to False. If `p1[0]` is equal to `qr[0]` and `p1[0]` is not '?', then `y1` remains True. The conditions also ensure that `p1len` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0.***
