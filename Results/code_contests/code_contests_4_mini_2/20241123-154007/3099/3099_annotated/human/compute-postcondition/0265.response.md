The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state remains as it was before the execution of the break statement.

Output State: **`p1len` is greater than 0, `y1` is False, `n` is greater than _, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, `y0` is False, `p0len` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, the element at index `i` of `p0` is equal to '?', the character at index `i` of `q` is not in `good_letters`, and the output is 'NO', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
