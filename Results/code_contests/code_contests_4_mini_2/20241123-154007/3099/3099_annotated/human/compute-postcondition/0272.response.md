Postcondition: ***`p1len` is greater than 0, `y1` is False, `n` is greater than _, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, `y0` is now False, `p0len` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and the character at index `i` of `p0` is not equal to the character at index `i` of `q`. The function prints 'NO' and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement when the characters at index `i` of `p0` and `q` are not equal.***
