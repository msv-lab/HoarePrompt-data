According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `p1len`. The loop will execute again as long as `i` is less than `p1len`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `p1len` is greater than 1, which means the loop can execute again. 

To execute the loop one more time, `i` will increment by 1 in the next iteration, so it needs to be adjusted to 2. The value of `p1len` remains greater than 1, and no other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`y0` is False, `y1` is False, `qr` is the reverse of `q`, `p1len` is greater than 1, and `i` is 2**
