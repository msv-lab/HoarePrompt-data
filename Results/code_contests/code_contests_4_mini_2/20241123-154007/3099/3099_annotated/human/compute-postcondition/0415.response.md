In the given scenario, we need to determine what adjustments need to be made to the states for the loop to execute one more time.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `y0` is False
- `y1` is False
- `qr` is the reverse of `q`
- `p1len` is greater than 0
- `i` is 0

The loop iterates over the range of `p1len`. Since `p1len` is indicated to be greater than 0, this means that the loop can execute at least once. 

At the start of the next iteration:
- The value of `i` will be incremented by 1 after the current iteration completes.
- We need to ensure `i` remains less than `p1len` for the loop to execute again.

Currently, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be adjusted to 1 and it should remain less than `p1len`. Thus, we should state that `p1len` needs to be at least 2, allowing `i` to be 1 for the next iteration.

No other states need to be adjusted since `y0`, `y1`, `qr`, and the conditions regarding the contents of `p1` and `qr` do not need to change for the loop to execute again.

State: **`y0` is False, `y1` is False, `qr` is the reverse of `q`, `p1len` is greater than 1, and `i` is 1**
