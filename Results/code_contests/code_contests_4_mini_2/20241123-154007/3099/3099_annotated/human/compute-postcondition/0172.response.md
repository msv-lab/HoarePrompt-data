Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct lowercase English letters from `gls`, `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the reversed substring after '*', `plen` is the length of the input string `p`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `p0len` is greater than 0, `p1len` is the length of `p1`, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `y0` is False, `i` is 0, and the character at index `i` of `p0` is not equal to the character at index `i` of `q`. If the character at index `i` of `p0` does not match the character at index `i` of `q`, the output 'NO' is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `p0[i]` is equal to `q[i]`, `y0` remains True, and the program continues executing without any changes to `y0`.***
