The `print('NO')` statement outputs the string 'NO' to the console. It does not alter the values of any variables, so the state of the variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than `k`, `qlen` is either less than `plen - 1` or greater than or equal to `plen - 1`, `y0` is True, `p0len` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, the `i`-th element of `p0` is a question mark ('?'), and the `i`-th element of `q` is not in `good_letters`, and the function prints 'NO'.
