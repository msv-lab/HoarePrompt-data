The value of `y` is assigned to `False`, changing its previous value of `True`. The values of `plen` and `i` remain unchanged, and 'NO' was printed before this code execution. Therefore, the Output State is: `plen` is at least 2, `y` is False, `i` is 1, and 'NO' is printed.

Output State: **`plen` is at least 2, `y` is False, `i` is 1, and 'NO' is printed**
