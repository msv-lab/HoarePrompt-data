The `print('NO')` statement outputs the string 'NO' to the console. This statement does not modify any of the existing variables; hence, their values remain unchanged. The output state reflects that the string 'NO' has been printed. 

Output State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct lowercase English letters from `gls`, `p` is an input string from the user, `plen` is greater than or equal to 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `q` is an input string of length `qlen`, `i` is 2, and 'NO' has been printed.**
