The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. The values of the variables (`y0`, `y1`, `qr`, `t`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state remains as it was prior to the execution of the `continue` statement.

Output State: **`y0` is False, `y1` is False, `qr` is the reverse of `q`, `t` is the substring of `q` based on `p1len`, and the function prints 'NO'**
