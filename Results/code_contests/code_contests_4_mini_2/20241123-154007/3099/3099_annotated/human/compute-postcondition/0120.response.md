According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `plen`. At the end of the last iteration, `plen` is at least 1, which indicates that `i` will have a value of at least 0 if it has not reached `plen` yet. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to increment to the next value, which means `i` should be adjusted to 1. 

Since `plen` is at least 1, and we are not given the exact value of `i`, we can assume that `i` is currently 0 (the starting point for the range). Thus, `i` needs to be adjusted to 1 for the loop to continue. There is no need to adjust any other states based on the provided information.

State: **`plen` is at least 1, `y` is False, `i` is 1**
