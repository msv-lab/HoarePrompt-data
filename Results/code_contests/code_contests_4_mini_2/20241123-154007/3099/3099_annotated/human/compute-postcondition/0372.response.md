Postcondition: ***If `p0[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, then `y0` is set to False, 'NO' is printed, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `p0[i]` is equal to `q[i]`, the program continues without changing `y0`. The conditions before executing the fragment are that `n` is greater than `k`, `qlen` is either less than `plen - 1` or greater than or equal to `plen - 1`, `p0len` is greater than 0, and `i` is 0, with `p0[i]` not equal to '?'.***
