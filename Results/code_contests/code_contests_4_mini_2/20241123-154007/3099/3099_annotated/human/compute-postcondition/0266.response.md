Postcondition: ***`p1len` is greater than 0, `y1` is False, `n` is greater than _, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, `y0` is False, `p0len` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, the element at index `i` of `p0` is equal to '?', and if the character at index `i` of `q` is not in `good_letters`, the output is 'NO' and the program exits the most internal loop or if statement.***
