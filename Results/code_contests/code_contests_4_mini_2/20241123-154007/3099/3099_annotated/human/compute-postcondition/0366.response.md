Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than `k`, `qlen` is either less than `plen - 1` or greater than or equal to `plen - 1`, `y0` is set to False, `p0len` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and the `i`-th element of `p0` is a question mark ('?'). If the `i`-th element of `q` is not in `good_letters`, then 'NO' is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop. Otherwise, if the condition is not met, the state remains unchanged with respect to `y0`, `q`, and the other variables.***
