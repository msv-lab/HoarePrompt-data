Postcondition: ***`y0` is False and `y1` is False, `qr` is the reverse of `q`, `p1len` is greater than 1, and if `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]` (where `i` is 2), the output is 'NO' and the execution breaks out of the innermost loop or if statement. If `p1[i]` is equal to `qr[i]`, the program continues without any output or modification to `y1`.***
