The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `p1len` is greater than 0, `y1` is False, `n` is greater than _, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, `y0` is False, `p0len` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, the character at index `i` of `p0` is not equal to '?', the character at index `i` of `p0` is not equal to the character at index `i` of `q`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
