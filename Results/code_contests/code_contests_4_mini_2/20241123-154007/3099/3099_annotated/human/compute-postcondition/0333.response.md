Postcondition: ***`y1` is initially True. If `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`, then `y1` is set to False, 'NO' is printed, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `p1[i]` is equal to `qr[i]`, `y1` remains True, but the program does not alter any other variables or provide output.***
