Postcondition: ***`plen` is at least 1, `y` is False, and `i` is 1. If `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `q[i]` is in `good_letters`, no changes occur to `y`, and the program continues executing the following statements without printing 'NO'.***
