The variable `y1` is assigned the value `False`. This directly changes the value of `y1`, while the values of `p1len`, `i`, and any other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects this change. 

Output State: **`p1len` is the length of `p1`, `i` is `p1len`, `y1` is False, and the function prints 'NO'**
