The `print` function outputs the string 'NO' to the console. The value of `y1` remains True, and the value of `i` is equal to `p1len`, but these values are not changed by the print statement. Therefore, the output state is `y1` is True, `i` is equal to `p1len`, and 'NO' is printed to the console.

Output State: **`y1` is True, `i` is equal to `p1len`, and 'NO' is printed to the console**
