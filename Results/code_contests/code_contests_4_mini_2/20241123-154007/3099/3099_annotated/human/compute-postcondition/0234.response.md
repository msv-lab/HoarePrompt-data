Postcondition: ***`p1len` is the length of `p1`, `i` is equal to `p1len`, and `y1` is the same as before unless `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, in which case the program prints 'NO', sets `y1` to False, and breaks out of the loop. If `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`, then 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the program breaks out of the loop. If `p1[i]` is equal to `qr[i]`, the state of `y1` remains unchanged. It is also essential that both `p1` and `qr` have lengths greater than `i` to prevent index errors.***
