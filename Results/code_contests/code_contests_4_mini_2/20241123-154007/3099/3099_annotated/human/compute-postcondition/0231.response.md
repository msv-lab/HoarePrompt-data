The variable `y1` is assigned the value `False`. The previous value of `y1` is the same as before, but it is now updated to `False`. The values of `p1len` and `i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Since `y1` changes its value, the output state will reflect this.

Output State: **`p1len` is the length of `p1`, `i` is `p1len`, `y1` is False, and the output is 'NO'**
