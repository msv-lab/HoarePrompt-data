The variable `y` is assigned the value `False`, changing its previous value from `True` to `False`. The values of the other variables (`plen` and `i`) are not affected by this assignment. The `print` statement indicating 'NO' does not alter the state of any variables. Therefore, the output state reflects the changes.

Output State: **`plen` is at least 3, `y` is False, `i` is 2, and 'NO' is printed to the console**
