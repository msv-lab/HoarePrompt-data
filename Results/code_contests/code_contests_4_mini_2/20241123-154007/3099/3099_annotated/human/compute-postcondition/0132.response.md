The value of `y` is assigned as `False`, but `y` already holds the value `False`. Therefore, the state of `y` remains unchanged. The states of the other variables (`plen`, `i`, and the output) are not affected by this assignment. Thus, the output state is: `plen` is at least 2, `y` is False, `i` is 2, and the output is 'NO'.

Output State: **`plen` is at least 2, `y` is False, `i` is 2, and the output is 'NO'**
