Postcondition: ***If `plen` is at least 1 and `y` is True, meaning the character-by-character comparison of `p` and `q` encountered no discrepancies, 'YES' is printed. If `plen` is 0 or less, or if discrepancies were found during the comparison (either because a character in `p` either did not match the corresponding character in `q`, or a character in `p` was '?' and the corresponding character in `q` was not in `good_letters`), 'YES' is not printed and `y` would remain unchanged. In all cases, `n` is greater than 0, and `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`.***
