Given the initial state, the code snippet provided indicates that the program will print 'NO'. The variable `y1` is set to False based on the conditions detailed in the task, but since the code does not include an explicit assignment operation, its value will remain unchanged.

The relevant states are:
- `y0` is True
- `y1` is False (as per the conditions set in the task)
- The operation prints 'NO'.

The print statement does not affect the values of `y0` or `y1`.

Output State: **`y0` is True, `y1` is False, and the program prints 'NO'**
