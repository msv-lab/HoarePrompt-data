The value of `y1` is assigned the value `False`, but `y1` is already `False`, so there is no change. The state of other variables remains unaffected, and the program prints 'NO'. Therefore, the output state is: `y0` is True, `y1` is False, and the program prints 'NO'.

Output State: **`y0` is True, `y1` is False, and the program prints 'NO'**
