Postcondition: ***`plen` is at least 2, `y` is initially True. If `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, the function prints 'NO', sets `y` to False, and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `q[i]` is in `good_letters`, `y` remains True and no output occurs, ensuring that `y` reflects the status of the condition checked.***
