To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions provided in the program state.

1. The loop iterates over a range defined by `p1len`, implying that `i` must be less than `p1len` for the loop to continue executing.
2. The provided state mentions that `y1` is initially True, and it can be set to False based on certain conditions related to `p1[i]` and `qr[i]`.
3. Since we need to adjust the states for the next iteration, we focus on the value of `i` and ensure that it is incremented for the next iteration.

Given that the loop is currently in its last iteration:

- If `i` is the last index (i.e., `i == p1len - 1`), then for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented to `p1len`, which means it will no longer satisfy the loop condition (`i < p1len`).
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be adjusted to `p1len - 1` (the last valid index) before the loop checks the condition again.

Based on the analysis, the only state that needs adjustment is the value of `i`. If `i` is currently at `p1len - 1`, it should be set to `p1len` to exit the loop.

However, since the task is to identify what needs to be true for the loop to execute one more time, we can focus on ensuring `i` is set to a value that allows the loop to execute again.

State: **`y1` is True, `i` is less than `p1len`, `p1len` is greater than 0**
