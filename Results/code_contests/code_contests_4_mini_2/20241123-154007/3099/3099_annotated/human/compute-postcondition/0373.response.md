Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than `k`, `qlen` is either less than `plen - 1` or greater than or equal to `plen - 1`, `y0` is either unchanged or set to False. If `p0[i]` is a question mark ('?') and the `i`-th element of `q` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed, and `y0` becomes False. If `p0[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, 'NO' is printed, and `y0` also becomes False. If both conditions do not trigger, the program continues without changing `y0`. The value of `i` remains 0 and `p0len` is greater than 0.***
