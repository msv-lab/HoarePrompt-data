The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state remains consistent with the initial state.

Output State: **`p1len` is greater than 0, `y1` is False, and at least one of the following conditions is met: either at least one `p1[i]` is equal to `'?'` and the corresponding `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, or at least one `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
