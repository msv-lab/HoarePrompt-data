Postcondition: ***`p1len` is greater than 0, `y1` is False, and `t` is defined as a substring of `q` based on the lengths `p0len` and `p1len`. If the intersection of `t` and `good_letters` is not empty, the program prints 'NO' and continues to the next iteration of the loop. If there are no common elements between `t` and `good_letters`, the program proceeds without printing 'NO'.***
