Postcondition: ***`plen` is at least 1, `y` is False, and `i` is 1. If `p[i]` is '?', and `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed, and `y` remains False, breaking out of the execution. If `q[i]` is in `good_letters`, no changes occur to `y`, and the program continues. If `p[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and execution breaks. If `p[i]` is equal to `q[i]`, no changes occur to `y` or the flow of execution. This accounts for all possible scenarios regarding the values of `p[i]` and `q[i]` with respect to `good_letters`.***
