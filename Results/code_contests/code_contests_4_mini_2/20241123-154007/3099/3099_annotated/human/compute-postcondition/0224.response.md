Postcondition: ***If `p1[i]` is equal to '?', and `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, the program prints 'NO' and sets `y1` to False. If `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`, the program prints 'NO' and sets `y1` to False. If `p1[i]` is equal to `qr[i]`, then `y1` remains True. Thus, after executing this block, `y1` will be False if either `qr[i]` is invalid based on `good_letters` or if the characters at index `i` of `p1` and `qr` do not match. If both conditions are satisfied, `y1` remains True. This ensures that all cases regarding the validity of `qr[i]` and the equality of characters at index `i` are handled properly.***
