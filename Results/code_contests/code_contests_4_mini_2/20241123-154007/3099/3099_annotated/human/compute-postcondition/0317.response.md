The variable `y1` is assigned the value `False`. The previous value of `y1` was `True`, and the other variables `i` and `p1len` remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `y1` is False, `i` is equal to `p1len - 1`, `p1len` is greater than `i`, and 'NO' is printed to the console.

Output State: **`y1` is False, `i` is equal to `p1len - 1`, `p1len` is greater than `i`, and 'NO' is printed to the console.**
