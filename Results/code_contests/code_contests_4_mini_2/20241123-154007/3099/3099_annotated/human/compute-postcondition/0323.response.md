Postcondition: ***`y1` is True initially. If `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`, then `y1` is set to False, indicating a mismatch, and the loop or if statement is exited. Since `i` is equal to `p1len - 1` and `p1len` is greater than `i`, this condition handles the last index of the array. If there is no mismatch, the value of `y1` remains True.***
