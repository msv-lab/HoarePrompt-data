Postcondition: ***`y0` is False, `y1` is False, `qr` is the reverse of `q`, `p1len` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and the first element of `p1` at index `i` is equal to '?'. If the element `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. There is no else part, so the program does not change `y1` to True or execute any further actions if `qr[i]` is in `good_letters`.***
