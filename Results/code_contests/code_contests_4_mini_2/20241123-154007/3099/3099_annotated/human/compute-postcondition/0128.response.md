Postcondition: ***`plen` is at least 1, `y` is False, and `i` is 1. If `p[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, the function prints 'NO', sets `y` to False, and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `p[i]` is equal to `q[i]`, the function continues executing without any changes to `y` or breaking out of the loop.***
