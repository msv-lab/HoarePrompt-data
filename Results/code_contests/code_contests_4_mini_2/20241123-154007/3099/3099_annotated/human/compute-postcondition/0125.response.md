The code prints the string 'NO', which does not change the values of any variables. The previous values of the affected variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `plen` is at least 1, `y` is False, `i` is 1, and the function prints 'NO'.

Output State: **`plen` is at least 1, `y` is False, `i` is 1, and the function prints 'NO'**
