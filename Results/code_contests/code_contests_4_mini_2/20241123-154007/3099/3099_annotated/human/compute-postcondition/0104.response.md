Postcondition: ***`plen` is at least 1, `y` is True, `n` is greater than 0, and `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`. If `qlen` is not equal to `plen`, the output 'NO' is printed and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `qlen` is equal to `plen`, no output is produced and the program proceeds normally in the loop.***
