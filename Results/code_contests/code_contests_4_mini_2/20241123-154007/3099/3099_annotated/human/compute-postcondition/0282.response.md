Postcondition: ***`p1len` is greater than 0, `y1` is False, `n` is greater than _, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, `y0` is False, `p0len` is greater than 0, and `i` is 1. If the character at index `i` of `p0` does not match the character at index `i` of `q`, 'NO' is printed, `y0` remains False, and the program exits the most internal loop or if statement.***
