Postcondition: ***If the character at index 2 of `p0` is a '?', the function checks if the character at index 2 of `q` is in `good_letters`. If it's not, 'NO' is printed, `y0` is set to False, and execution breaks out of the loop. If the character is in `good_letters`, no changes are made to `y0` or output. If the character at index 2 of `p0` is not a '?', and it does not match the character at index 2 of `q`, 'NO' is printed, `y0` is set to False, and execution breaks out of the loop; otherwise, if they match, no changes are made to `y0` or output.***
