To determine the necessary adjustments to the state for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the loop's structure and the variables involved.

1. The loop iterates based on the variable `n`, which determines how many times the loop will execute.
2. The loop will execute only if the current index (represented by `_`) is less than `n`. Since `_` is a placeholder for the current iteration, we can infer that it starts from 0 and increases with each iteration.
3. The loop will execute one more time if `_` is currently less than `n - 1`, meaning that after the last iteration, `_` needs to increment by 1 to be equal to `n - 1`.
4. The current state does not provide information about the value of `_` or `n`, so we can infer that `n` must be greater than the current value of `_`.

Given that the loop has just executed, we can deduce that `_` has increased by 1 after the last iteration. Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `n` is greater than the current value of `_`.

Assuming that at the end of the last iteration `_` was `k`, the adjusted state should reflect that `n` is greater than `k`.

State: **`n` is greater than `k`, where `k` is the last value of _ in the previous iteration.**
