Output State: **`y0` is False, `y1` is False, `qr` is the reverse of `q`, and if `p1len` is greater than 0 then the loop will execute `p1len` times checking each character of `p1` against `qr`. If `p1` is empty (`p1len` is 0), the loop does not execute, and `y1` remains True. If any character in `p1` is a '?' and the corresponding character in `qr` is not in `good_letters`, or if any character in `p1` does not match the corresponding character in `qr`, 'NO' is printed, and `y1` is set to False, with the loop terminating early. If all characters match or the '?' conditions are satisfied, `y1` remains unchanged as True.**
