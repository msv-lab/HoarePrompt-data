Postcondition: ***`p0len` is greater than 0, the loop executed a maximum of `p0len` times. `y0` is False, indicating that at least one character in `p0` does not match the corresponding character in `q`, or that `p0[i]` is a '?' and `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`. `n` is greater than `k`, and `qlen` is either less than or greater than or equal to `plen - 1`, which remains unchanged.***
