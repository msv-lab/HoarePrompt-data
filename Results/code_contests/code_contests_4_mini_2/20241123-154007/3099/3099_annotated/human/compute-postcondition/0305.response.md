The value of `y1` is assigned `False`, which changes its previous value from `True` to `False`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `y1` is False, `p1len` is greater than 0, `q` is defined with a value, `qr` is the reversed value of `q`, `i` is 0, the first element of `p1` at index `i` is equal to '?', and the character at index `i` of `qr` is not in `good_letters`.

Output State: **`y1` is False, `p1len` is greater than 0, `q` is defined with a value, `qr` is the reversed value of `q`, `i` is 0, the first element of `p1` at index `i` is equal to '?', and the character at index `i` of `qr` is not in `good_letters`.**
