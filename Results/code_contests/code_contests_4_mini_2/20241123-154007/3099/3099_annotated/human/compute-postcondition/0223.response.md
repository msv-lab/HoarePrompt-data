Postcondition: ***`y0` is True and `y1` is False if the character at index `i` of `p1` does not match the character at index `i` of `qr`, in which case 'NO' is printed and the program breaks out of the loop. If `p1[i]` equals `qr[i]`, then `y1` remains True. This condition applies for the index `i` being greater than or equal to 1, ensuring all edge cases where `p1` does not match `qr` are handled accordingly.***
