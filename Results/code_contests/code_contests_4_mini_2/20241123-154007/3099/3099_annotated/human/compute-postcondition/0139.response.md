Postcondition: ***`plen` is at least 2, `y` is False. If `p[i]` is equal to '?', and if `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, the program prints 'NO', sets `y` to False, and breaks out of the most internal loop. If `q[i]` is in `good_letters`, the program continues without changes to `y`. If `p[i]` is not equal to '?', and `p[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, the program prints 'NO', sets `y` to False, and breaks out of the most internal loop. If `p[i]` is equal to `q[i]`, the program continues without changes to `y`.***
