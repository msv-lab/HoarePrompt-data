The value of `y1` is assigned `False`, but `y1` is already `False` in the initial state. Therefore, there is no change in the value of `y1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Thus, the output state is: `y0` is False, `y1` is False, `qr` is the reverse of `q`, `p1len` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, and the output is 'NO'.

Output State: **`y0` is False, `y1` is False, `qr` is the reverse of `q`, `p1len` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, and the output is 'NO'**
