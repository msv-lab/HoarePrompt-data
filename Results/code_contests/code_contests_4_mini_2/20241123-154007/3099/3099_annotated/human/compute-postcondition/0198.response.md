Postcondition: ***If `p0len` is greater than 0 and `y0` is False, the loop continues to the next iteration without executing the following code; if `y0` is True, the execution proceeds normally. If `p0len` is 0, the loop does not execute at all, and `y0` remains True. The value of `y0` indicates whether all characters matched or were valid '?', while 'NO' is printed if a mismatch occurs or if a '?' does not correspond to a character in `good_letters`.***
