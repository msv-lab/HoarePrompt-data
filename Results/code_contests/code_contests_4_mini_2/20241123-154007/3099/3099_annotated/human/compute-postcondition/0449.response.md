Postcondition: ***`y0` is False, `y1` is False, `qr` is the reverse of `q`, and `t` is the substring of `q` based on the value of `p1len`. If the intersection of the set of characters in `t` and `good_letters` is not empty, the function prints 'NO'. This implies that `t` contains at least one character that is considered a good letter, otherwise, no output occurs from this block.***
