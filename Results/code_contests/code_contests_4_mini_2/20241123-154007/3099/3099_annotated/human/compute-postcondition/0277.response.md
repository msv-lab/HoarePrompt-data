The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `p1len` is greater than 0, `y1` is False, `n` is greater than _, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, `y0` is False, `p0len` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
