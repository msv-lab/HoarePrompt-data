The `print('NO')` statement outputs the string 'NO' to the console. The values of `y1`, `i`, and `p1len` remain unchanged because this statement does not modify any variables. Therefore, the output state is: `y1` is True, `i` is equal to `p1len - 1`, `p1len` is greater than `i`, and 'NO' is printed to the console.

Output State: **`y1` is True, `i` is equal to `p1len - 1`, `p1len` is greater than `i`, and 'NO' is printed to the console.**
