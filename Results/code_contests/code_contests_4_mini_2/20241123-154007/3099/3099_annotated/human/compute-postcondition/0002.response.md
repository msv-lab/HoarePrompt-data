The variable `p` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`, which accepts input from the user. The set `good_letters` remains unchanged as it contains a set of distinct lowercase English letters from `gls`. Therefore, the output state is that `good_letters` is a set of distinct lowercase English letters from `gls`, and `p` is an input string from the user.

Output State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct lowercase English letters from `gls`, `p` is an input string from the user**
