According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` in relation to `plen`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `plen`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `plen` is at least 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `plen` must be at least 2, and `i` should be incremented to 2 to reflect the next iteration.

State: **`plen` is at least 2, `y` is False, `i` is 2**
