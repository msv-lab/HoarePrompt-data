The `print('NO')` statement outputs the string 'NO' to the console. The values of the variables `plen`, `y`, and `i` do not change as a result of this operation. Therefore, the output state remains focused on the initial variable values.

Output State: **`plen` is at least 2, `y` is False, `i` is 2, and the function prints 'NO'**
