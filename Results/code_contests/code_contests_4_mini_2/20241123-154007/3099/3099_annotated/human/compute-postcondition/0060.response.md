According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `plen`. Since `plen` is stated to be at least 1, the loop can execute at least once. The variable `i` will start at 0 for the first iteration. Therefore, the states need to reflect that `i` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`plen` is at least 1, `y` is True, `n` is greater than 0, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, `i` is 0**
