Postcondition: ***`plen` is at least 1, `y` is False if the character at index `i` of the string `q` is not in `good_letters`. If the character at index `i` of the string `q` is in `good_letters`, `y` remains True. The variable `n` is greater than 0, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, `i` is 0, and the character at index `i` of the string `p` is equal to '?'.***
