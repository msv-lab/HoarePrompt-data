The function `func` accepts three parameters: `good_letters`, `pattern`, and `n`. 

- `good_letters` is a string of distinct lowercase English letters.
- `pattern` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, '?' and at most one '*'.
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).

The function processes a series of query strings, which are non-empty strings of lowercase English letters. The total length of all query strings does not exceed \(10^5\).

The functionality of the function `func` is to determine how many of the provided query strings match the specified `pattern`, considering the constraints set by `good_letters`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a string of distinct lowercase English letters `good_letters`, a string `pattern` consisting of lowercase letters, '?', and at most one '*', and a positive integer `n`. It returns the number of query strings that match the `pattern` according to the rules defined by `good_letters`.**
