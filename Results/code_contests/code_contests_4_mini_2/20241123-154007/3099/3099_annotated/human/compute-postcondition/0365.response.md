The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than `k`, `qlen` is either less than `plen - 1` or greater than or equal to `plen - 1`, `y0` is False, `p0len` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, the `i`-th element of `p0` is a question mark ('?'), and the `i`-th element of `q` is not in `good_letters`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
