Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct lowercase English letters from `gls`, `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the reversed substring after '*', `plen` is the length of the input string `p`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `p0len` is greater than 1, `p1len` is the length of `p1`, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, and `i` is 1. If the character at index `i` in `p0` does not match the character at index `i` in `q`, the output is 'NO', `y0` is set to False, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If they match, no changes are made to `y0`, and the program continues executing without printing 'NO'.***
