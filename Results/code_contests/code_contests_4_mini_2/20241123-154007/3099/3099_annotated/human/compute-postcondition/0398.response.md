Postcondition: ***If `y0` is False, the loop continues executing, indicating that at least one character in `p0` does not match the corresponding character in `q`, or that a character in `p0` is a '?' and the corresponding character in `q` is not in `good_letters`. In this case, `p0len` is greater than 0, `n` remains greater than `k`, and `qlen` remains either less than or greater than or equal to `plen - 1`. If `p0len` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `y0` remains True, while `n` and `qlen` retain their respective values.***
