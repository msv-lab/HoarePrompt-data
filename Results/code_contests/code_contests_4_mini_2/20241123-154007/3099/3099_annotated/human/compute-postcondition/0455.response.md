Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct lowercase English letters, `p` is an input string, `plen` is the length of `p`, and `n` is a non-negative integer. If `'*'` is not in `p`, for each input string `q`, if `qlen` equals `plen` and meets the conditions defined by `p`, 'YES' is printed; otherwise, 'NO' is printed if any mismatches occur or `q` contains invalid characters for `good_letters`. If `n` is 0, no output occurs. If `'*'` is in `p`, for each input string `q`, if `qlen` is less than `plen - 1`, 'NO' is printed. If the prefixes defined by `p0` and `p1` match their respective segments in `q` with the constraints of `good_letters`, 'YES' is printed; otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If `p` is empty, no checks are performed, meaning 'YES' is printed if `n` is greater than 0 and no strings are processed. If `n` is 0 or less, no output occurs. The program handles all edge cases, including empty strings and mismatch scenarios, to ensure accurate results.***
