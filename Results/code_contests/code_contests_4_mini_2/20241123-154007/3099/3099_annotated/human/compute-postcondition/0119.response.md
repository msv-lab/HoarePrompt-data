Postcondition: ***`plen` is at least 1, `y` is False and 'NO' is printed if the character at index `i` of `p` is a question mark ('?') and the character at index `i` of `q` is not in `good_letters`. If the character at position `i` in string `p` is not equal to the character at position `i` in string `q`, 'NO' is printed, and `y` is set to False. If neither of these conditions is met, `y` remains True. The program also breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if any of the above conditions are satisfied.***
