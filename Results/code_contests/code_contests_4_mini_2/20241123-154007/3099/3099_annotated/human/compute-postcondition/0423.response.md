Postcondition: ***`y0` is False, `y1` is False, `qr` is the reverse of `q`, `p1len` is greater than 1, and `i` is 1. If the character at index `i` of `p1` is not equal to the character at index `i` of `qr`, the program prints 'NO', sets `y1` to False, and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the characters are equal, there is no change in the values of `y0`, `y1`, or the loop state.***
