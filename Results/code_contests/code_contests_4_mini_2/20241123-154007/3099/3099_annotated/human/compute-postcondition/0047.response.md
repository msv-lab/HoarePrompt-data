Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct lowercase English letters from `gls`, `p` is a string of length at least 2, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `q` is a string of length `qlen`, and `i` is 2. If the character at index `i` of `p` is a question mark and the character at index `i` of `q` is not in `good_letters`, the program prints 'NO', sets `y` to False, and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the character at index `i` of `p` is a question mark but the character at index `i` of `q` is in `good_letters`, no changes are made to `y` or output. If the character at index `i` of `p` does not match the character at index `i` of `q`, the program prints 'NO', sets `y` to False, and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If they match, no changes occur. In all cases, the integrity of `y` reflects whether the conditions were satisfied or not, ensuring that if any mismatch or violation occurs, `y` is set to False.***
