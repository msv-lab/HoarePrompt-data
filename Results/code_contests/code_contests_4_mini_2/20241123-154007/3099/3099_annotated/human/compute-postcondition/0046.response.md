Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct lowercase English letters from `gls`, `p` is an input string from the user, `plen` is greater than or equal to 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `q` is an input string of length `qlen`, and `i` is equal to 2. If the character at index `i` of string `p` does not match the character at index `i` of string `q`, the program outputs 'NO', sets `y` to False, and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the characters do match, no changes are made to `y` or the program's output.***
