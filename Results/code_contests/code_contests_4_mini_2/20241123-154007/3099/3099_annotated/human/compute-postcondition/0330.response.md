The code executes a print statement that outputs 'NO'. The values of the variables `y1` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `y1` is initially True, `i` is equal to `p1len`, and the output is 'NO'.

Output State: **`y1` is initially True, `i` is equal to `p1len`, and the output is 'NO'**
