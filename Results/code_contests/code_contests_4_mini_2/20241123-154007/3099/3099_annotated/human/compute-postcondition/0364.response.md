The value of `y0` is assigned the value `False`, changing its previous state from `True` to `False`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than `k`, `qlen` is either less than `plen - 1` or greater than or equal to `plen - 1`, `y0` is False, `p0len` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, the `i`-th element of `p0` is a question mark ('?'), and the `i`-th element of `q` is not in `good_letters`, and the function prints 'NO'.
