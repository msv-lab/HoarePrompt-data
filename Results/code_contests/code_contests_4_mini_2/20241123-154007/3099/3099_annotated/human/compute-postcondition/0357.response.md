The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables `n`, `k`, and `qlen` remain unchanged, and 'NO' has already been printed prior to this statement. Therefore, the output state indicates that we are still in a loop, continuing to the next iteration without modifying any variables.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `k`, `qlen` is the length of the user input string `q`, 'NO' is printed, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
