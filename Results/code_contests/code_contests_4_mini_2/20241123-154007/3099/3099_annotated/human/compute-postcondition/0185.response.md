The code snippet `print('NO')` outputs the string 'NO' to the console. The values of the other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this print statement. Therefore, the output state remains as the initial state plus the printed output.

Output State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct lowercase English letters from `gls`, `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the reversed substring after '*', `plen` is the length of the input string `p`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `p0len` is greater than 1, `p1len` is the length of `p1`, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `i` is 2, and the output is 'NO'**
