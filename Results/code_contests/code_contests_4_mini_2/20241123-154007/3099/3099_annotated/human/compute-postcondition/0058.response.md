Postcondition: ***`plen` is at least 1, `y` is True, `n` is greater than 0, and `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`. If `qlen` is not equal to `plen`, 'NO' is printed and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `qlen` is equal to `plen`, the program proceeds with the next steps without printing 'NO'.***
