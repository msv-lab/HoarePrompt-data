The `print('NO')` statement outputs the string `NO` to the console but does not change the values of any variables. The previous values of the variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `p1len` is the length of `p1`, `i` is `p1len`, `y1` is the same as before, and the function prints 'NO'.

Output State: **`p1len` is the length of `p1`, `i` is `p1len`, `y1` is the same as before, and the function prints 'NO'**
