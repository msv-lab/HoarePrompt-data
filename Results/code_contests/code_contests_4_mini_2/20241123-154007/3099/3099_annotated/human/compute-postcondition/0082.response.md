Postcondition: ***`plen` is at least 2, if the elements at index `i` of lists `p` and `q` are not equal, then 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the elements at index `i` are equal, the state of `y` remains True, and no output is printed.***
