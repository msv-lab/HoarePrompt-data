The code assigns the value `False` to `y1`, which changes its previous value from `True` to `False`. The variable `i` remains unchanged, and `p1len` is still greater than `i`. The print statement 'NO' does not affect the state of the variables. Therefore, the output state is: `y1` is False, `i` is equal to `p1len - 1`, `p1len` is greater than `i`.

Output State: **`y1` is False, `i` is equal to `p1len - 1`, `p1len` is greater than `i`**
