The value of `y1` is assigned the value `False`, but `y1` is already `False`. Therefore, the state of the other variables is not affected, and the program prints 'NO'. The output state is `y0` is True, `y1` is False, and the program prints 'NO'.

Output State: **`y0` is True, `y1` is False, and the program prints 'NO'**
