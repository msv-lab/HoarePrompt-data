According to the code, the loop executes as long as `i` is less than `p1len`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `p1len - 1`, which means it is the last valid index for the loop. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented, but since `i` has already reached its maximum value (which is `p1len - 1`), it cannot execute again without exceeding the bounds of the range.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `i` must be less than `p1len` for the loop to execute again. Since `i` is `p1len - 1`, for the loop to be valid in the next iteration, `i` should be equal to `p1len` in this scenario, indicating that there are no further iterations left to execute.

State: **`y1` is initially True, `i` is equal to `p1len`**
