The value of `y1` is assigned the value `False`, which is its current value. Other variables (`y0`, `qr`, `p1len`, and `i`) remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `y0` is False, `y1` is False, `qr` is the reverse of `q`, `p1len` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and the function prints 'NO'.

Output State: **`y0` is False, `y1` is False, `qr` is the reverse of `q`, `p1len` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and the function prints 'NO'**
