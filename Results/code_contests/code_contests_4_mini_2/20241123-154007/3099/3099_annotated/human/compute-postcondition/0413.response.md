Postcondition: ***`y0` is False, `y1` is False, `qr` is the reverse of `q`, `p1len` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and if the element at index `i` of `p1` is not equal to the element at index `i` of `qr`, the output is 'NO', and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the elements are equal, no change occurs in `y1` or output.***
