Postcondition: ***`p1len` is greater than 0, `y1` is False, `n` is greater than _, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, `y0` remains False, `p0len` is greater than 2, and if the character at index `i` of `p0` is a '?', then if `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, the output is 'NO' and the loop is exited; otherwise, if `p0[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, the program prints 'NO', sets `y0` to False, and breaks out of the loop. This includes the edge case where `q[i]` is in `good_letters`, resulting in no changes to `y0` or the control flow.***
