Postcondition: ***`l` is a 2D list of size `n x m`, where if `a` equals 1 and `b` is between 1 and `n`, the entire row at index `b - 1` is filled with the value `c`. If `b` is less than 1 or greater than `n`, or if `m` is less than or equal to 0, the list `l` remains unchanged. If `a` is not equal to 1, then for each `i` from 0 to `n - 1`, `l[i][b - 1]` is updated to `c`, unless `b` is less than 1 or greater than `m`, which may lead to an index error. If `n` is 0, the list also remains unchanged. `k` is greater than 0, and `b` and `c` are assigned from input integers.***
