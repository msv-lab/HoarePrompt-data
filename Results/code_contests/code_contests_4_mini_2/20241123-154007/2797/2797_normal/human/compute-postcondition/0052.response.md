According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `m` and the current value of `i`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `m` is greater than 0. 

To execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2, and it must still be less than `m`. Thus, `m` needs to be at least 2 for the loop to execute again. The value of `l` and other variables do not require adjustment for the loop to run one more time.

State: **`l` is a 2D list of size `n x m`, `a` is assigned a value based on user input, `b` is a positive integer based on user input, `c` is assigned a value based on user input, `m` is greater than 1, `i` is 2**
