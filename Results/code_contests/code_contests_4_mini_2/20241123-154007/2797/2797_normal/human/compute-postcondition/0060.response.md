The value of `l[i][b - 1]` is updated to `c`. The previous values of the affected variables are `i` is 1, and `c` has a value assigned based on user input. The other variables `a`, `b`, and `n` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value in the list `l`.

Output State: **`l[1][b - 1]` is updated to `c`, `a` is not equal to 1, `b` and `c` are assigned values based on user input, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1**
