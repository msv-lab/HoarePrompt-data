Output State: **`l` is a 2D list of size `n x m`. If `k` is greater than 0 and for each loop iteration, if `a` equals 1 and `1 ≤ b ≤ n`, then the entire row `l[b - 1]` is filled with the value of `c`. If `a` is not equal to 1, and if `1 ≤ b ≤ m`, then the entire column `l[i][b - 1]` for all `i` in the range from `0` to `n-1` is filled with the value of `c`. If `b` is out of the range [1, n] for rows or [1, m] for columns, or if `k` is initially 0, then `l` remains unchanged and continues to be a 2D list filled with zeros. If `n` or `m` is 0, the list `l` remains unchanged as it cannot be updated. At the end, `k` is decremented to `0` after the loop ends.**
