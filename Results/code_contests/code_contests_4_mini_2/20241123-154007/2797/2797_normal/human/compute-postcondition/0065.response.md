Postcondition: ***`l` is a 2D list of size `n x m`. If `a` equals 1 and `m` is greater than 0, the row at index `b-1` (if `b` is valid, i.e., `1 <= b <= n`) is filled with the value `c` across all columns from 0 to `m-1`. If `m` is 0, `l` remains unchanged. If `a` is not equal to 1, each element in column `b-1` (if `b` is valid, i.e., `1 <= b <= m`) is updated to `c` for all rows from 0 to `n-1`. If `n` is 0, `l` remains unchanged. In all cases, if `b` is less than 1 or greater than `n` (for the row update) or less than 1 or greater than `m` (for the column update), it will lead to an index error when accessing `l`. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` retain their assigned values based on user input throughout the execution.***
