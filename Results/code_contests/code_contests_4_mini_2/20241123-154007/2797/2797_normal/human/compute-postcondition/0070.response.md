Functionality: ** The function initializes a 2D list of size `n x m` filled with zeros. It then processes `k` operations based on inputs, where each operation either fills an entire row or an entire column of the list with a value `c` depending on the given parameters. If `k` is 0 initially or if `n` or `m` is 0, the list remains unchanged. After processing the operations, it prints the resulting 2D list. The function accepts no parameters directly; it relies on external input for `n`, `m`, and `k`. **
