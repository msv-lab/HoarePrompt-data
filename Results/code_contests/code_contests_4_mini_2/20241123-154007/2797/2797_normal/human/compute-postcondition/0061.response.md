According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2, and since `n` is greater than 1, we can keep that condition as is. Therefore, no change is required for `n`. 

The states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` needs to be updated to 2.

State: **`l[1][b - 1]` is updated to `c`, `a` is not equal to 1, `b` and `c` are assigned values based on user input, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1**
