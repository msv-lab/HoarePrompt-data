According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. The loop will execute for `i` ranging from 0 to `m - 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `m` must be at least 1. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` do not affect the execution of the loop since they are not involved in the loop control.

Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `m` must be greater than 0, and the initial value of `i` must be set to 0 for the first iteration.

State: **`l` is a 2D list of size `n x m`, `a` is assigned a value based on user input, `b` is assigned a value based on user input, `c` is assigned a value based on user input, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
