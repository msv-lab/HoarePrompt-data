The code assigns the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` by taking input from the user and splitting it into three integers using `map(int, raw_input().split())`. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` will hold these new values, but the specific values are not provided in the initial state. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `l` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables and the newly assigned variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer after decrement, `l` is a 2D list of size n x m filled with zeros, and `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned new integer values from input.**
