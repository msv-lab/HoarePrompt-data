Output State: **`l` is a 2D list of size `n x m` with the row `l[b - 1]` filled with the value of `c` for all indices from `0` to `m-1`, provided that `b` is within the valid range of `1` to `n`. If `b` is less than 1 or greater than `n`, the loop does not execute, and `l` remains a 2D list filled with zeros. `a` is equal to 1, `c` is an input integer, and `i` will take values from `0` to `m-1` during the loop execution.**
