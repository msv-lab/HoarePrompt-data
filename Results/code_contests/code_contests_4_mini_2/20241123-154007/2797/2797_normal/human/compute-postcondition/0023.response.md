Postcondition: ***`l` is a 2D list of size `n x m`. If `a` is equal to 1 and `1 ≤ b ≤ n`, then the entire row `l[b - 1]` is filled with the value of `c`. If `a` is not equal to 1, and if `n > 0` and `1 ≤ b ≤ m`, then the entire column `l[i][b - 1]` for all `i` in the range `0` to `n-1` is filled with the value of `c`. If `b` is out of the range [1, n] or [1, m], or if `n` is 0, then `l` remains unchanged and continues to be a 2D list filled with zeros.***
