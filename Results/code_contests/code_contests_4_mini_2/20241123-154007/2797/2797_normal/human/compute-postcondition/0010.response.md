According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `m` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be greater than 1, and `i` should be incremented to 2. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is a positive integer, `l` is a 2D list with `l[b - 1][1]` assigned the value of `c`, `a` is equal to 1, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `i` is 2**
