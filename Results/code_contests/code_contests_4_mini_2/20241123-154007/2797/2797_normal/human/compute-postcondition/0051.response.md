The value of `l[b - 1][i]` is assigned the value of `c`. Given that `b` is a positive integer and `m` is greater than 0, `b - 1` will be a valid index for the list `l`. The variable `i` has a value of 1, so this will update the element at the second column (index 1) of the row corresponding to `b - 1` in the 2D list `l` to the value of `c`. The values of the other variables (`a`, `l`, and `c`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is a 2D list of size `n x m`, `a` is assigned a value based on user input, `b` is a positive integer based on user input, `c` is assigned a value based on user input, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and `l[b - 1][1]` is updated to `c`.**
