Output State: **`l` is a 2D list of size `n x m` where the entire row at index `b - 1` is filled with the value `c` if `b` is between 1 and `n` and `m` is greater than 0. If `b` is less than 1 or greater than `n`, the loop does not execute and `l` remains unchanged. If `m` is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute and `l` remains unchanged.**
