According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. Since `m` is a positive integer, the loop will execute if `m` is at least 1. The variable `i` will start at 0 at the beginning of the loop. Given that `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers, we can conclude that `m` must be greater than 0 and that `i` will initially be 0.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is a positive integer, `l` is a 2D list of size `n x m` filled with zeros, `a` is equal to 1, `b` and `c` are assigned new integer values from input, `i` is 0**
