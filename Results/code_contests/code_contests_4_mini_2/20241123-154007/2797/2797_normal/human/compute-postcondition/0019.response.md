According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, indicating that the next value of `i` will be 2 in the next iteration. Since `n` is a positive integer, we can conclude that for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 1.

No other states need to be adjusted as they do not affect the loop condition.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer after decrement, `l` has been updated at index [1][b - 1] to c, `a` is not equal to 1, `b` and `c` are assigned new integer values from input, `i` is 2**
