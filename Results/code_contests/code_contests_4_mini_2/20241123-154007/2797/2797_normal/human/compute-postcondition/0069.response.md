The function `func` accepts no parameters directly as it is defined without any. Instead, it operates on a set of constraints and relationships established externally for the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`, as well as a series of operations that consist of three integers. 

- `n` and `m` are positive integers representing dimensions, constrained such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 5000\).
- `k` is a positive integer indicating the number of operations, constrained such that \(1 \leq k \leq 100000\).
- Each operation consists of three integers: the first integer indicates the type of operation (either 1 or 2), the second integer denotes a valid row index (for type 1 operations) or a valid column index (for type 2 operations), and the third integer represents a color value, constrained such that \(1 \leq ai \leq 10^9\).

The function produces outputs based on the operations performed, though the specifics of the outputs are not detailed in the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to process a series of operations defined by these parameters and constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but operates on external variables n, m, and k, and processes a series of operations defined by three integers, returning results based on the operations performed.**
