The value of `k` is decremented by 1. The value of `k` is greater than 0, so after execution, `k` will still be greater than 0. The variable `l` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `l` is a 2D list of size `n x m`, `k` is greater than 0 after decrementing by 1.

Output State: **`l` is a 2D list of size `n x m`, `k` is greater than 0 after decrementing by 1**
