Output State: **If m is greater than 0, then the loop executes m times, updating the row at index b-1 in the 2D list l with the value c for each column index from 0 to m-1. After the loop, `l` will have the row at index b-1 filled with the value c across all columns from 0 to m-1. If m is 0, the loop does not execute, and the 2D list l remains unchanged while a, b, and c retain their assigned values based on user input. Additionally, if b is less than 1 or greater than n, it will result in an index error when accessing l[b - 1].**
