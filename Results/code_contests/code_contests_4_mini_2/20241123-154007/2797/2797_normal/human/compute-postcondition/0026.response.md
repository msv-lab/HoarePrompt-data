The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned from the input provided by `raw_input()`, split into three parts and converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The variable `l` remains unaffected as its content is not altered by this line of code. The variable `k` is still greater than 0 after decrementing by 1, so it remains positive. Therefore, the output state is: `l` is a 2D list of size `n x m`, `k` is greater than 0, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned from the input integers.

Output State: **`l` is a 2D list of size `n x m`, `k` is greater than 0, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned from the input integers.**
