The code assigns the value `c` to the element located at the `b - 1` row and `i` column of the 2D list `l`. The previous values of the affected variables are: `l` is a 2D list of size `n x m`, `b` is a value greater than 0, `i` is 1, and `c` is an input value. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `l[b - 1][i]` is now equal to `c`, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is a 2D list of size `n x m`, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is assigned from input, `b` is assigned from input, `c` is assigned from input, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than 1, and `l[b - 1][i]` is assigned the value `c`**
