The value `l[b - 1][i]` is assigned the value of `c`. The variable `b` is greater than 0, which means `b - 1` is a valid index for the 2D list `l`. The variable `i` is 2, which is also within the bounds of the columns of `l` since `m` is greater than 2. Therefore, the assignment modifies the 2D list `l` at the specified position. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`l` is a 2D list of size `n x m`, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is assigned from input, `b` is assigned from input, `c` is assigned from input, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than 2, and `l[b - 1][i]` is assigned the value `c`.**
