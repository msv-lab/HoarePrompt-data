The value of `k` is decremented by 1, but the previous value of `k` is unknown since it is only stated to be a positive integer. The values of `n`, `m`, and `l` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer after decrement, and `l` is a 2D list of size n x m filled with zeros.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer after decrement, and `l` is a 2D list of size n x m filled with zeros**
