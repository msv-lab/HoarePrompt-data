According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `m`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `m` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 1.

Since the loop is set to execute `m` times starting from `i = 0`, it will continue executing as long as `i < m`. Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to increment the value of `i` by 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is a positive integer, `l` is a 2D list of size `n x m` filled with zeros except `l[b - 1][0]` is assigned the value of `c`, `a` is equal to 1, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `i` is 1**
