According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit `m`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `m`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `m` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented to 1, and it must still satisfy the condition `i < m`. Therefore, `m` must be at least 2 for the loop to continue.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`l` is a 2D list of size `n x m`, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is assigned from input, `b` is assigned from input, `c` is assigned from input, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than 1; `l[b - 1][i]` is assigned the value `c`.**
