The code takes input from the user, splits it into three parts, and then assigns those parts to variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The initial state provides no specific values for `a`, `b`, and `c`, so they will be assigned based on user input. The variable `l` remains unchanged as the code does not affect it. Thus, the output state reflects that `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned values based on the user input.

Output State: **`l` is a 2D list of size `n x m`, `a`, `b`, `c` are assigned values based on user input**
