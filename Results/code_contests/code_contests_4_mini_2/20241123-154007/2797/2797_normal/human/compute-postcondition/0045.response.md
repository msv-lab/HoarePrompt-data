According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If `k` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is greater than 0, so it does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time. No other states need to be adjusted since the loop condition is already satisfied.

State: **`l` is a 2D list of size `n x m`, `k` is greater than 0**
