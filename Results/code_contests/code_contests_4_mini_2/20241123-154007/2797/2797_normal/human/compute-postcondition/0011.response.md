The statement `l[b - 1][i] = c` assigns the value of `c` to the 2D list `l` at the position `[b - 1][i]`. The values of `b` and `i` are given, with `b` being an input integer and `i` being 2. The variable `c` is also defined as an input integer. The previous state of the affected variable, `l`, is not explicitly defined, but we know that `l[b - 1][1]` has been assigned the value of `c`. The assignment will change the specific index of `l` but does not affect the other variables.

Therefore, the output state reflects the changes made to the 2D list `l`:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is a positive integer, `l[b - 1][1]` is assigned the value of `c`, `a` is equal to 1, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `i` is 2, and `l[b - 1][2]` is assigned the value of `c`.**
