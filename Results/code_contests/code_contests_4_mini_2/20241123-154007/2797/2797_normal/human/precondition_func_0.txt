n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 5000, k is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 100000, and each operation consists of three integers where the first integer is either 1 or 2, the second integer is a valid row index (1 ≤ ri ≤ n for rows or 1 ≤ ci ≤ m for columns), and the third integer is a positive integer for color (1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9).
