The code snippet assigns values to `n`, `m`, and `k` using the `map` function which applies `int` to each element of the list produced by `raw_input().split()`. The initial state indicates that `n`, `m`, and `k` can take integer values within specified ranges, but no specific values are provided for them. 

Since `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned based on input, they will now hold the values input by the user. Other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned values from input, where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 5000 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 100000**
