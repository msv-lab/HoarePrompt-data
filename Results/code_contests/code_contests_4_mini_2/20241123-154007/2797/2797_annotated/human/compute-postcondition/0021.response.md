According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 3, and `n` must be greater than 3 to allow the next iteration. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to reflect that `i` will be 3 in the next iteration and `n` needs to be specified as greater than 3.

State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `l[2][b - 1]` is assigned the value of `c`**
