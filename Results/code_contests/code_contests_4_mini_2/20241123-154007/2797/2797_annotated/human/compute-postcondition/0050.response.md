According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the value of `m`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and since `m` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. 

For the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1. The variable `m` does not need to be adjusted because it is greater than 0 and remains unchanged.

State: **`l` is a 2D list of dimensions `n x m` initialized to 0, `k` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `a`, `b`, `c` are input integers, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and `l[b - 1][0]` is assigned the value `c`.**
