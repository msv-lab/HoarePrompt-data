Output State: **`l` contains the value `c` in the row indexed by `b - 1` for each column from 0 to `m - 1`. If `m` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `l` remains a 2D list initialized to 0. If `b` is less than 1 or greater than `n`, it may cause an index error, as `l[b - 1]` could be out of bounds.**
