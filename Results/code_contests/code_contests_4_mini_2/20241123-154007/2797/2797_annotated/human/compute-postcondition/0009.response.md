The statement `l[b - 1][i] = c` assigns the value of `c` to the 2D list `l` at the position specified by the indices `b - 1` and `i`. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `l`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `i` are already defined in the initial state. 

Here, `l` is a 2D list of size `n x m` initialized to 0, and `i` is 1. The variable `b` is taken from input, and since it is greater than 0, `b - 1` will be a valid index for the rows of `l`. The value of `c` is also taken from input.

Thus, this operation modifies the 2D list `l` by setting the element at row `b - 1` and column `1` to the value of `c`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is assigned from input, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is assigned from input and decreased by 1, `l` is a 2D list with dimensions n x m initialized to 0, `a` is equal to 1, `b` is assigned from input, `c` is assigned from input, `i` is 1, and `l[b - 1][1]` is assigned the value of `c`.**
