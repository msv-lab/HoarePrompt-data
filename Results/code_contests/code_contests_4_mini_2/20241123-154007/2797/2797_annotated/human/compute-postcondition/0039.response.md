The variable `l[i][b - 1]` is assigned the value of `c`. Since `i` is 1 and `b` is within the valid range [1, n], `b - 1` will be a valid index for the second dimension of the list `l`. The previous value of `l[1][b - 1]` is not defined in the initial state but it will be updated to the value of `c`. Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`l` is a 2D list of dimensions `n x m` initialized to 0, `a` is an integer not equal to 1, `b` is an integer within the valid range [1, n], `c` is an input integer, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, and `l[1][b - 1]` is assigned the value of `c`.**
