According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will execute again as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, which will make it 1. The value of `n` remains unchanged. 

No other states need to be adjusted since they do not impact the loop's ability to execute again.

State: **`l` is a 2D list of dimensions `n x m` initialized to 0, `k` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `a` is not equal to 1, `b` and `c` are input integers, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, and `l[0][b - 1]` is now `c`.**
