The value of `l[i][b - 1]` is assigned the value of `c`. The variable `i` has a value of 2, and `l[2][b - 1]` will be updated to `c`. The values of `n` and `c` are not directly affected by this assignment, but we know that `n` is greater than 1. Therefore, the output state reflects the change made to the list `l`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `l[2][b - 1]` is assigned the value of `c`**
