The statement `l[b - 1][i] = c` assigns the value `c` to the element at the position `[b - 1][i]` in the 2D list `l`. The dimensions of `l` are `n x m`, meaning it has `n` rows and `m` columns, with `m` being greater than 1. The variable `i` is currently 1, and `l[b - 1][0]` is already set to `c`. This implies that the assignment will not change the state of `l[b - 1][0]` but will update the value at `l[b - 1][1]` (since `i` is 1).

Thus, the output state reflects the assignment made to the 2D list:

Output State: **`l[b - 1][i]` is set to `c` (where `i` is 1)**
