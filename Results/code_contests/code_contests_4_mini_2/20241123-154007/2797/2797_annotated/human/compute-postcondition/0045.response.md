To determine how to modify the program state for the `while` loop to execute one more time, we need to examine the condition of the loop: `k > 0`. 

1. **Understanding the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `k` is greater than 0. Therefore, in order for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be adjusted to be greater than 0 at the end of the previous iteration.

2. **Assessing the Current State**: At the end of the last iteration, we do not have the current value of `k`. However, for the loop to execute again, we can conclude that `k` must be adjusted to a value greater than 0.

3. **Conclusion**: Since the only requirement for the loop to run again is that `k` must be greater than 0, we can state that `k` needs to be set to some value greater than 0.

Thus, the program state can be formulated to indicate that `k` is greater than 0, while retaining the other parts of the state as they are.

State: **`l` is a 2D list of dimensions `n x m` initialized to 0, `k` is greater than 0**
