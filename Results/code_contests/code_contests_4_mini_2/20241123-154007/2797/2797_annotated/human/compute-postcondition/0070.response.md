Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters and initializes a 2D list `l` of size `n x m` filled with zeros. It then processes `k` operations where each operation can either fill an entire row or an entire column of `l` with a specified value based on user input. If `a` is 1, it fills the row `b-1` with `c`, and if `a` is not 1, it fills the column `b-1` with `c`. If the indices are out of bounds, it will result in an index error which leaves `l` unchanged. If `n` or `m` is zero or less, no operations are performed and `l` remains as a 2D list of zeros. Finally, the function prints the modified list. **
