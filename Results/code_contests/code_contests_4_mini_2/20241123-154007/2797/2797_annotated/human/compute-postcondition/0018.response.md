The code assigns the value `c` to `l[i][b - 1]`. The value of `c` is previously assigned to `l[0][b - 1]`. The variable `i` is 1, so after execution, `l[1][b - 1]` will hold the same value as `l[0][b - 1]`, which is `c`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and `l[1][b - 1]` is assigned the value of `c`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and `l[1][b - 1]` is assigned the value of `c**
