According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0, which means the loop can execute again. For the next iteration, `i` will increment by 1. Thus, `i` should be adjusted to 1. The value of `n` remains greater than 0, so it does not need to be changed.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and the value `c` is assigned to `l[0][b - 1]`**
