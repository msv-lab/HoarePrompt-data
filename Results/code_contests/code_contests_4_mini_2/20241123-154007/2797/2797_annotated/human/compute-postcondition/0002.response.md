The code involves nested loops that iterate through a 2D list `l` with dimensions `n x m`. The values of `l` are initialized to 0, and the loops will print each element of `l`. Since `l` is a 2D list filled with zeros, the output will consist of `n` rows of `m` zeros printed in a single line for each row, separated by spaces.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is assigned from input, `m` is assigned from input, `k` is assigned from input, `l` is a 2D list with dimensions n x m initialized to 0 and printed as n rows of m zeros**
