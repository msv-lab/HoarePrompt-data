The value at `l[b - 1][i]` is assigned the value of `c`. Given that `l` is a 2D list initialized to 0 and `b` is an input integer, the value at the position `l[b - 1][i]` will change from 0 to the value of `c`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a 2D list of dimensions `n x m` initialized to 0, `k` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `a`, `b`, `c` are input integers, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and `l[b - 1][i]` is now `c`.

Output State: **`l` is a 2D list of dimensions `n x m` initialized to 0, `k` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `a`, `b`, `c` are input integers, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and `l[b - 1][i]` is now `c`.**
