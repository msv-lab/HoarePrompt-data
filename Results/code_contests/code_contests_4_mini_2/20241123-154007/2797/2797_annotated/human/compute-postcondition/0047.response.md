The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the values obtained from `map(int, raw_input().split())`. The `raw_input()` function takes input as a string, which is then split into separate components and converted to integers by `map(int, ...)`. The previous values of `l` and `k` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects that `a`, `b`, and `c` hold the integer values parsed from the input, while `l` remains a 2D list of dimensions `n x m` initialized to 0, and `k` is a positive integer decreased by 1.

Output State: **`l` is a 2D list of dimensions `n x m` initialized to 0, `k` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `a`, `b`, `c` are input integers**
