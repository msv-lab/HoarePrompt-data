According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the variable `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is still unchanged, and since `m` is greater than 0, `i` must be adjusted to `0` and incremented for the next iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be adjusted to `1` (the next value in the range).

No other states need to be adjusted, as `l`, `k`, `a`, `b`, and `c` do not change with respect to the loop's execution.

State: **`l` is a 2D list of dimensions `n x m` initialized to 0, `k` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `a`, `b`, `c` are input integers, `m` is greater than 0, and `i` is 1.**
