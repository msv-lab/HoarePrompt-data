According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `m`, which defines the number of iterations. For the loop to execute, `m` must be at least 1. The states that need to be adjusted are related to ensuring that `m` is greater than 0. The variables `l`, `a`, `b`, and `c` do not directly affect the loop execution since the loop only depends on `i` and `m`. 

Therefore, the necessary adjustments are: `l` is a 2D list of dimensions `n x m`, `m` must be greater than 0, and `i` starts at 0. 

State: **`l` is a 2D list of dimensions `n x m`, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
