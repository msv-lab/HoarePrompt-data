Postcondition: ***`l` is a 2D list of dimensions `n x m` initialized to 0. If `a` is 1 and `b` is within the valid range [1, n], `l` contains the value `c` in the row indexed by `b - 1` for each column from 0 to `m - 1`. If `m` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `l` remains unchanged. If `a` is not 1 and `b` is within the valid range [1, m], the value `c` is assigned to `l[i][b - 1]` for each `i` from 0 to `n-1`. If `n` is 0 or less, the loop does not execute, leaving `l` unchanged. Index errors may occur if `b` is less than 1 or greater than `n` while accessing `l[b - 1]` in the first case or if `b` is less than 1 or greater than `m` in the second case.***
