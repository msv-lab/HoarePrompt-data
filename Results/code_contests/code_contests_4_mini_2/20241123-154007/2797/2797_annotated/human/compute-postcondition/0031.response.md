According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `m` must be greater than 1, and `i` should be incremented to 2.

State: **`l[b - 1][i]` is set to `c`, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than 1**
