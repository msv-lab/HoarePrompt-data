Postcondition: ***`l` is a 2D list of dimensions `n x m` initialized to 0. If `a` equals 1 and `m` is greater than 0, the `b - 1`th row of `l` is filled with the value `c` for all columns from 0 to `m-1`. If `m` is 0, `l` remains unchanged. If `a` is not 1 and `n` is greater than 0, the `b - 1`th column of `l` is filled with the value `c` for all rows from 0 to `n-1`. If `n` is 0, `l` remains unchanged. Additionally, `b` must be in the range [1, n] or [1, m] depending on the value of `a` to avoid index errors; if `b` is outside these ranges, an error will occur without modifying `l`.***
