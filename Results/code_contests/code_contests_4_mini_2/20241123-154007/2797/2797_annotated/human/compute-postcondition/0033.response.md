According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `m`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `m` is greater than 1. Since `m` being greater than 1 does not provide a specific value for `m`, the current value of `i` (which is 2) must be adjusted to 3 for the loop to execute one more time. Additionally, `m` must be adjusted to be greater than 2 to ensure that the loop can continue.

State: **`l[b - 1][i]` is set to `c`, `i` is 3, `m` is greater than 2**
