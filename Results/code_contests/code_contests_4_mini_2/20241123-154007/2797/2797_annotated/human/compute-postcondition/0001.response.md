The variable `l` is assigned a 2D list (list of lists) where each inner list contains `m` elements, all initialized to `0`, and there are `n` such lists. The values of `n` and `m` are determined by user input, falling within the ranges specified (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 5000). The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` do not change their values during this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the initialization of `l` and retains the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.

Output State: **`n` is assigned from input, `m` is assigned from input, `k` is assigned from input, and `l` is a 2D list with dimensions n x m initialized to 0**
