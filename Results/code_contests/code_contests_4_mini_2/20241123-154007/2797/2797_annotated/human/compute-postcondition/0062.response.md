The variable `l[i][b - 1]` is assigned the value `c`. Given that `i` is 2, this means we are assigning the value of `c` to the element at the third row (index 2) and the column indexed by `b - 1` in the 2D list `l`. The previous values of `l[0][b - 1]` and `l[1][b - 1]` were both `c`, but this does not affect the assignment. The overall state of the variables is not changed except for the specific element in the 2D list. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `l`.

Output State: **`l` is a 2D list of dimensions `n x m` initialized to 0, `k` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `a` is not equal to 1, `b` and `c` are input integers, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `l[0][b - 1]` is now `c`, `l[1][b - 1]` is now `c`, `l[2][b - 1]` is now `c`**
