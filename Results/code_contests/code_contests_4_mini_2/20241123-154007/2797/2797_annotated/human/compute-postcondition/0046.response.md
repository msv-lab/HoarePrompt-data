The value of `k` is decremented by 1. Since `k` is greater than 0, it will take a new value of `k - 1`, which is still a positive integer. The value of `l` remains unchanged as the operation only affects `k`. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `k` while leaving `l` in its initial state.

Output State: **`l` is a 2D list of dimensions `n x m` initialized to 0, `k` is a positive integer decreased by 1**
