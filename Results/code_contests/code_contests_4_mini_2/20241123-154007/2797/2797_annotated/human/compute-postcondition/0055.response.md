Output State: **`l` is a 2D list of dimensions `n x m` where the row indexed by `b - 1` is filled with the value `c` for all columns from 0 to `m - 1`. If `m` is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute, and `l` remains unchanged with all elements initialized to 0. If `b` is less than 1 or greater than `n`, it may result in an index error when accessing `l[b - 1]`.**
