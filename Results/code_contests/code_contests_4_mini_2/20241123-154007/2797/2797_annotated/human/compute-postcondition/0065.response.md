Postcondition: ***`l` is a 2D list of dimensions `n x m` initialized to 0. If `a` is 1 and `b` is between 1 and `n`, the row at index `b - 1` is filled with the value `c` for all columns from `0` to `m - 1`. If `m` is less than or equal to 0, the list remains unchanged. If `a` is not 1 and `b` is between 1 and `m`, the column at index `b - 1` is set to `c` for every row from `0` to `n - 1`. If `n` is 0, the list remains unchanged. In cases where `b` is less than 1 or greater than `n` (for the first case) or less than 1 or greater than `m` (for the second case), the code does not execute the loops and `l` remains unchanged, `k` stays a positive integer decreased by 1, while `a`, `b`, and `c` remain as input integers.***
