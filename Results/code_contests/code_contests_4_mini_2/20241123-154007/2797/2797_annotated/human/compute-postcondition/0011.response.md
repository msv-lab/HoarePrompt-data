The code assigns the value of `c` to the 2D list `l` at the position determined by `b - 1` (the row index) and `i` (the column index). The previous values of the affected variables are: `l` is a 2D list initialized to 0, `b` is a value from input, and `c` is also a value from input. The value of `i` is 2.

The impact of the code is that the element at `l[b - 1][2]` is updated to the value of `c`. The dimensions of `l` are defined as `n x m`, and since `m` is greater than 0, `b - 1` must be a valid row index within the bounds of `n`.

Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value in the 2D list.

Output State: **`n` is assigned from input, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is assigned from input and decreased by 1, `l` is a 2D list with dimensions n x m initialized to 0, `a` is equal to 1, `b` is assigned from input, `c` is assigned from input, `i` is 2, and `l[b - 1][2]` is assigned the value of `c`.**
