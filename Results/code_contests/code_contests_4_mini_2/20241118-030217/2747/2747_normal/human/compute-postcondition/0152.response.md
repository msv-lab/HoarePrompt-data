Postcondition: ***`count` is incremented by 1. If either `temp[0]` is in `same` or `lol` is in `same`, then both `temp` and `lol` are empty lists. If neither condition is met and the length of `same` is equal to `int(inp[1])`, the execution breaks, otherwise `temp` and `lol` are empty lists and `temp[0]` is appended to `same`, indicating that the state of `same` has been modified. The length of `order` remains greater than 1 throughout the process.***
