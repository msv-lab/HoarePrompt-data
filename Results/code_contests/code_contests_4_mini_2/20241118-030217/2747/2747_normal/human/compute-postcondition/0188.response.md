The line `lol = []` assigns an empty list to the variable `lol`. This overwrites the previous state of `lol`, which was already an empty list. The values of the other variables, `count` and `temp`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `count` is 0, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, and `order` has at least 2 elements.

Output State: **`count` is 0, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, and `order` has at least 2 elements**
