Postcondition: ***`count` is less than or equal to `len(order) - 2`, and `lol` has a new element appended from `temp[0][0]`. If the length of `same` is equal to `int(inp[1])`, we break out of the most internal loop, ensuring we exit the loop under this condition. If the length of `same` is not equal to `int(inp[1])`, the loop continues without any modification to `count` or `lol`.***
