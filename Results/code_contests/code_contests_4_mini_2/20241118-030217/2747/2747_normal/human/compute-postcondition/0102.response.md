The code appends the second element (index 1) of the first sublist of `temp` to the list `lol`. Given that `temp` was previously appended with a new list containing `order[i]` and `order[count]`, `temp[0]` is a list with at least 2 elements. Therefore, `temp[0][1]` is well-defined. The previous values of `order`, `count`, and `temp` do not change, but `lol` will now contain the additional element from `temp`.

Output State: **`order` contains at least 1 element; `count` is less than or equal to `len(order) - 2; `temp` is now appended with `order[i]` and `order[count]`; `lol` has a new element `temp[0][1]` appended.**
