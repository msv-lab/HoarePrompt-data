Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `l` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ 10^18, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^6, `a` is a list of strings obtained from `raw_input().split()`, `inp` is a list of strings with `inp[1]` being "1", `order` contains the first element of `a`, `same` is an empty list, and `count` is incremented by 1. If `c` is equal to `len(a) - 1`, then `c` is reset to 0; otherwise, `c` is incremented by 1.***
