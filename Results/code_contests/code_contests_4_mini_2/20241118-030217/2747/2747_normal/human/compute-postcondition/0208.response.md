The value `temp[0][1]` is appended to the list `lol`. The previous state indicates that `temp` contains an additional list with elements `order[i]` and `order[len(order) - 1]`, so `temp[0][1]` is defined based on those elements. Since the exact values of `order[i]` and `order[len(order) - 1]` are unknown, we can't determine the specific value being appended to `lol`. However, we can state that `lol` is updated by adding the value of `temp[0][1]`.

Output State: **`temp` now contains an additional list with elements `order[i]` and `order[len(order) - 1]`; `lol` is updated by appending `temp[0][1]`**
