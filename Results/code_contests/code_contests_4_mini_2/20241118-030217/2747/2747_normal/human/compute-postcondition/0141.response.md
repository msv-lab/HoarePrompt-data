The variable `lol` is assigned a new empty list. The previous values of the other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `count` is 0, the length of `order` is greater than 1, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is now an empty list, and either `temp[0]` is in `same` or `lol` is in `same`.

Output State: **`count` is 0, the length of `order` is greater than 1, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is now an empty list, and either `temp[0]` is in `same` or `lol` is in `same`**
