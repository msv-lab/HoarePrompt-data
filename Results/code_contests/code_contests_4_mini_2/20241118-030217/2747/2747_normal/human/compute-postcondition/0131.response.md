Output State: **If `count` is less than the length of `order`, the loop will execute. After each iteration, `count` is incremented by 1. If `temp[0]` or `lol` is in `same`, `temp` and `lol` are reset to empty lists, and `count` is incremented. If the length of `same` reaches `int(inp[1])`, the loop will break. If `temp[0]` is not in `same` and the length of `same` is less than `int(inp[1])`, `temp[0]` is appended to `same`, and `temp` and `lol` are reset. If `count` is initially greater than or equal to the length of `order`, the loop will not execute and `count` remains 0, `temp` and `lol` remain empty, and `same` remains unchanged.**
