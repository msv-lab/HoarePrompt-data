Postcondition: ***`order` contains at least 1 element, `count` is less than or equal to `len(order) - 2`, `temp` has `order[i]` and `order[count]`, `lol` has `temp[0][1]` appended followed by `temp[0][0]`. If the length of `same` equals `int(inp[1])`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. There are no alternative actions taken since there is no else part present.***
