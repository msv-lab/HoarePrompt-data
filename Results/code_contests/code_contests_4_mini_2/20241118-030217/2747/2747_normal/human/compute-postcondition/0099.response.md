Postcondition: ***`order` contains at least 1 element. If `temp[0]` or `lol` is in `same`, then `temp` and `lol` are set to empty lists, `count` is incremented by 1, and no other changes are made to any variables. Otherwise, if the length of `same` equals `int(inp[1])`, the program breaks; if not, `temp[0]` is appended to `same`, and `temp` and `lol` are reset to empty lists, with `count` also incremented by 1. Additionally, `c` is updated to `count % len(order)`, and `i` remains 0.***
