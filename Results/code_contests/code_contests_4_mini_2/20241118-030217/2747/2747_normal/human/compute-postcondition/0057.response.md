The variable `c` is assigned the value `0`. The previous state of `c` could be either `0` or the next index in `a`, but since we are explicitly setting `c` to `0`, it overrides any previous value. The states of the other variables (`count`, `i`, and `order`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `count` is 0, `i` is 0, `c` is 0, and `order` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`count` is 0, `i` is 0, `c` is 0, and `order` remains unchanged**
