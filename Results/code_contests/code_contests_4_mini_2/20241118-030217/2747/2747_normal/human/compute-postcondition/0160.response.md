The `pass` statement does not change any variables or affect the program's state; it serves as a placeholder. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged. The output state is: `count` is incremented by 1, `lol` is an empty list, `temp` is empty.

Output State: **`count` is incremented by 1, `lol` is an empty list, `temp` is empty**
