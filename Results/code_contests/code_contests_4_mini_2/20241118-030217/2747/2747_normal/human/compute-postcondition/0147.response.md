Postcondition: ***`count` is 0, the length of `order` is greater than 1, `temp` contains one sublist with `order[i]` and `order[0]`, `lol` contains two elements: `temp[0][1]` and `order[i]`, `temp[0]` is not in `same`, and `lol` is not in `same`. If the length of `same` is equal to the integer value of `inp[1]`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the length of `same` is not equal to `inp[1]`, the program continues execution without breaking.***
