The code initializes an empty list `temp`. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed by this assignment. The variable `count` remains 0, and the length of `order` is still greater than 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is 0, the length of `order` is greater than 1, and `temp` is an empty list.

Output State: **`count` is 0, the length of `order` is greater than 1, and `temp` is an empty list**
