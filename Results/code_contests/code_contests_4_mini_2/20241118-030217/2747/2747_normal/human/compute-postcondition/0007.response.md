The variable `count` is initialized to `0`. The other variables are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state remains the same for those variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ l ≤ 10^18, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^6, `a` is a list of strings obtained from `raw_input().split()`, `inp` is a list of strings with `inp[1]` being "1", `order` contains the first element of `a`, `same` is an empty list, `c` is 0, and `count` is 0**.
