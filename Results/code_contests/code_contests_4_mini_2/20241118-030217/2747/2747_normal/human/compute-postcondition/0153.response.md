To determine what needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions surrounding the `while` loop.

The loop condition is `count <= len(order) - 1`. This means that as long as `count` is less than or equal to the length of `order` minus one, the loop will execute again. 

Given the statement at the end of the previous iteration, we know:
- `count` has been incremented by 1.
- The length of `order` remains greater than 1.

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to verify the relationship between `count` and `len(order) - 1`. 

If `count` has been incremented by 1, then for the loop to execute again:
- `count` must be less than or equal to `len(order) - 1`.

This means that the value of `count` must be adjusted so that it is still less than or equal to `len(order) - 1` after the increment. If `count` is currently equal to `len(order) - 1`, it would not allow the loop to execute again; hence, `count` should be adjusted down to `len(order) - 2` or kept as is if it was already less than that.

However, since we do not have the exact numeric values of `count` and `len(order)`, we can state that `count` must be less than or equal to `len(order) - 1` after adjusting for the increment.

Thus, we need to ensure that `count` is less than or equal to `len(order) - 2` for the loop to potentially run again.

State: **`count` is less than or equal to `len(order) - 2`**
