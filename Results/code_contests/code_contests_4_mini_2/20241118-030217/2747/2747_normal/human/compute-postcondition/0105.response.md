The code initializes `lol` as an empty list. The previous state indicates that `lol` has new elements appended from `temp`, but since `temp` is now an empty list, there are no elements to append. The previous values of `order` and `count` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `lol` is now an empty list.

Output State: **`order` contains at least 1 element; `count` is less than or equal to `len(order) - 2; `lol` is now an empty list; `temp` is now an empty list.**
