The statement `count = count + 1` increments the value of `count` by 1. The previous value of `count` is 1, so after execution, `count` becomes 2. The values of `i` and `c` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `count` is 2, `i` is 0, `c` is 0.

Output State: **`count` is 2, `i` is 0, `c` is 0**
