The variable `c` is incremented by 1. However, the initial value of `c` is not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine the specific value of `c` after the increment. The other variable `count` remains unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is 1 and `c` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`count` is 1 and `c` is increased by 1**
