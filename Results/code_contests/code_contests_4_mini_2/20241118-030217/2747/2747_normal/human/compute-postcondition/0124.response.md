Postcondition: ***`order` contains at least 1 element, `count` is equal to `len(order) - 1`, `temp` is updated with a new entry `[order[i], order[count]]`, and `lol` now includes `temp[0][0]` if the length of `same` is equal to the integer value of `inp[1]`. If this condition is not met, the program continues execution without breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
