The `pass` statement does not change the values of any variables. The values of `temp` and `lol` remain empty lists, and `count` is already stated to be increased by 1. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `count` while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, `count` is increased by 1**
