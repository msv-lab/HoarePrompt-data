Postcondition: ***`order` contains at least 1 element, `count` is 0, `c` is `count % len(order)`, `i` is 0, `temp` contains [[order[0], order[0]]], `lol` contains [order[0], order[0]], `temp[0]` is not in `same`, and `lol` is not in `same`. If the length of `same` is equal to the integer value of `inp[1]`, then the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
