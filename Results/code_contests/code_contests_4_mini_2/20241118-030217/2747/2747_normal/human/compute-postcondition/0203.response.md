The variable `lol` is assigned an empty list `[]`, which means that it is now an empty list. The previous values of the affected variables are unchanged: `count` is 0, `temp` is still an empty list, and `same` contains `temp[0]` (but since `temp` is empty, `temp[0]` does not exist). Therefore, the output state reflects the changes made. 

Output State: **`count` is 0, `temp` is [], `lol` is [], and `same` contains `temp[0]` which does not exist**.
