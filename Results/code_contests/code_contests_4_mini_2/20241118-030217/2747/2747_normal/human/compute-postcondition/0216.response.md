The code appends `temp[0]` to the list `same`. The initial state describes that `same` could either be empty or contain elements. The state of `temp` is not directly influenced by this operation, and we do not know the current length or content of `same`. Therefore, after executing the code, `same` will have `temp[0]` added to it. The output state reflects this change.

Output State: **`same` contains `temp[0]` appended to it; `lol` is updated by appending `temp[0][0]`.**
