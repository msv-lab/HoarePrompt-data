The code `temp = []` initializes `temp` as an empty list. This means that any previous value stored in `temp` is discarded, and `temp` now holds no elements. The variables `order`, `count`, and `same` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `temp` while maintaining the previous states of the other variables.

Output State: **`order` contains at least 1 element, `count` is equal to `len(order) - 1`, `temp` is [], and `same` includes the previous `temp[0]`.**
