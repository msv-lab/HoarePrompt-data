The variable `c` is assigned the value `0`. The previous values of the other variables (`count` and `i`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state remains consistent with the original values of `count` and `i`, while `c` is now defined.

Output State: **`count` is 2, `i` is 0, `c` is 0**
