The variable `c` is assigned the value `0`. The initial state indicates that `c` can either be reset to `0` or incremented by `1`. However, since `c` is explicitly set to `0` in the code, the previous condition regarding its value does not affect the outcome. The other variables `count` and `i` remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the output state is: `count` is 1, `i` is 0, and `c` is 0.

Output State: **`count` is 1, `i` is 0, and `c` is 0**
