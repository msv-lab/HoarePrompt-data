Postcondition: ***`order` contains at least 1 element. If `temp[0]` is in `same` or `lol` is in `same`, then `temp` and `lol` are reset to empty lists, and `count` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if the length of `same` equals `int(inp[1])`, the execution breaks; if not, the previous `temp[0]` is appended to `same`, and both `temp` and `lol` are reset to empty lists, with `count` incremented by 1. The program ensures that `count` is always incremented when the conditions are met, and `lol` will only contain the first element of `temp[0]` if the first condition is false.***
