The line of code reads input from the user and splits it into a list of strings. The variable `inp` will now hold this list of strings based on the input provided. The initial values of `n`, `l`, `k`, and `a` are not directly affected, but the value of `inp` will depend on the user's input. Therefore, the output state will indicate that `inp` is a list of strings from the input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ l ≤ 10^18, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^6, `a` is a list of n positive integers where each element is in the range 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9, and `inp` is a list of strings from the input.**
