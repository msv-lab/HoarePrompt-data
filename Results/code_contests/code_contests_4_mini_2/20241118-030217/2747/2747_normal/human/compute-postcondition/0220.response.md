Postcondition: ***`temp` contains an additional list with elements `order[i]` and `order[len(order) - 1]`, and has `temp[0]` in it, while `lol` is updated by appending `temp[0][0]`. If `temp[0]` or `lol` is in `same`, then `temp` and `lol` are set to empty lists, and `count` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if the length of `same` equals `int(inp[1])`, the loop breaks; if not, `temp[0]` is appended to `same`, `temp` and `lol` are set to empty lists, and `count` is increased by 1. This ensures that `count` always increments when either `temp[0]` or `lol` is in `same`, or when `temp[0]` is appended to `same`.***
