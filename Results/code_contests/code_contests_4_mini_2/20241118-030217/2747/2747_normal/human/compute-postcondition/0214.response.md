The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `temp` now contains an additional list with elements `order[i]` and `order[len(order) - 1]`; `lol` is updated by appending `temp[0][0]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
