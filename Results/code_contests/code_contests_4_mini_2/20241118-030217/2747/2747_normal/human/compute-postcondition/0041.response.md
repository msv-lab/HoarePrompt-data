The value of `count` is incremented by 1. Since `count` is initially 1, after execution, `count` becomes 2. The states of the other variables (`int(inp[0])` and `c`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is 2, `int(inp[0])` is greater than or equal to 1, `c` is 0.

Output State: **`count` is 2, `int(inp[0])` is greater than or equal to 1, `c` is 0**
