The value of `count` is incremented by 1. Since `count` was less than or equal to `len(order) - 2`, it can now take a value that is at most `len(order) - 1`. The values of `order`, `lol`, and `temp` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `order` contains at least 1 element; `count` is now incremented by 1; `lol` is now an empty list; `temp` is now an empty list.

Output State: **`order` contains at least 1 element; `count` is now incremented by 1; `lol` is now an empty list; `temp` is now an empty list.**
