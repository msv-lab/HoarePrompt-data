The line of code appends a list containing two elements from the `order` list to the `temp` list. The first element is `order[i]`, where `i` is an index that must be defined in the context of the surrounding code. The second element is `order[count]`, and since `count` is equal to `len(order) - 1`, it refers to the last element of the `order` list. 

Since `order` contains at least one element, both `order[i]` and `order[count]` will yield valid elements from the list. The state of the `temp` list will change by having a new list of two elements appended to it. 

The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`order` contains at least 1 element, `count` is equal to `len(order) - 1,` and `temp` is updated with a new entry `[order[i], order[count]]`.**
