The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or the most internal structure we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is less than or equal to `len(order) - 2`, `lol` has a new value with the addition of `temp[0][1]`, and `lol` is appended with `temp[0][0]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
