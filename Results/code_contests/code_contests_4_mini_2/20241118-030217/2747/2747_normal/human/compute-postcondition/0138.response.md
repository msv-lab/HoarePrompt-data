The code `lol.append(temp[0][0])` will append the first element of the sublist `temp[0]` to the list `lol`. Given that `temp` contains one sublist with `order[i]` and `order[0]`, the value of `temp[0][0]` corresponds to `order[i]`. Therefore, after executing the code, `lol` will now contain two elements: the original element it contained (which is `temp[0][1]`) and the new element (`order[i]`).

The output state will reflect the updated contents of `lol`:

Output State: **`count` is 0, the length of `order` is greater than 1, `temp` contains one sublist with `order[i]` and `order[0]`, `lol` contains two elements: temp[0][1] and order[i]**
