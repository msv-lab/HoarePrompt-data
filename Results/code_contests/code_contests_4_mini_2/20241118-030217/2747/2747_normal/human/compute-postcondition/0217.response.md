The code initializes `temp` as an empty list. The previous values of `same` and `lol` are not affected by this initialization, and their states remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is as follows:

Output State: **`same` contains `temp[0]` appended to it; `lol` is updated by appending `temp[0][0]`, and `temp` is an empty list.**
