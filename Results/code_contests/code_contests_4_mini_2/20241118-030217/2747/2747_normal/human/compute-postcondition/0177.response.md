Postcondition: ***If `len(same)` is equal to `int(inp[1])`, then the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, while maintaining that `count` is less than or equal to `len(order) - 2`, and `lol` has been updated by adding `temp[0][1]` and appending `temp[0][0]`. If `len(same)` is not equal to `int(inp[1])`, the program continues iterating without breaking, while the preconditions regarding `count`, `lol`, and `temp` remain unchanged.***
