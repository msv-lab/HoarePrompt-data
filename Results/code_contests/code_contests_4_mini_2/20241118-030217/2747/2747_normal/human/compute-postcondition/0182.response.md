Postcondition: ***`count` is less than or equal to `len(order) - 1`. If `temp[0]` or `lol` is in `same`, then both `temp` and `lol` are emptied, and `count` is incremented by 1. If `len(same)` equals `int(inp[1])`, the loop breaks; otherwise, `temp` is emptied, `lol` is an empty list, and `same` is appended with `temp[0]`, while `count` is incremented by 1.***
