The variable `lol` is assigned an empty list, but it does not affect the previous values of `temp` and `same`, which remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `temp` is an empty list, `same` is unchanged, and `lol` is an empty list.

Output State: **`temp` is an empty list, `same` is unchanged, and `lol` is an empty list**
