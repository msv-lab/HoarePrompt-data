The code initializes `lol` as an empty list. The previous values of `count` and `temp` do not change, and `lol` is now a new empty list. Therefore, the output state is: `count` is less than or equal to `len(order) - 2`, `lol` is an empty list, and `temp` is empty.

Output State: **`count` is less than or equal to `len(order) - 2`, `lol` is an empty list, and `temp` is empty**.
