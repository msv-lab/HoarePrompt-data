The variable `temp` is assigned an empty list. The previous state indicates that `same` is updated by appending `temp[0]`, but since `temp` is now an empty list, `temp[0]` will cause an IndexError if accessed. However, since no specific error handling is indicated, we can state that `temp` is an empty list and that `same` cannot be updated because `temp[0]` does not exist.

Output State: **`temp` is an empty list; `same` cannot be updated due to IndexError on accessing `temp[0]**
