Postcondition: ***`temp` contains additional elements, `lol` is updated by appending `temp[0][1]`, `count` is adjusted to be less than or equal to len(order) - 2, and `lol` is updated by appending `temp[0][0]`. If `temp[0]` or `lol` is in `same`, then `temp` and `lol` are both cleared, and `count` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if the length of `same` equals `int(inp[1])`, the loop breaks; otherwise, `temp[0]` is appended to `same`, `temp` and `lol` are both cleared, and `count` is increased by 1. This means `same` is updated if conditions allow, and `count` is always increased by 1. Additionally, potential edge cases arise if `temp[0]` is not properly indexed, which could lead to an IndexError.***
