The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `order` contains at least 1 element; `count` is less than or equal to `len(order) - 2; `temp` has `order[i]` and `order[count]`; `lol` has `temp[0][1]` appended; `lol` now has `temp[0][0]` appended and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
