The variable `c` is incremented by 1. However, the initial value of `c` is not provided, so we cannot determine its new value. The other variable `count` remains unchanged as well. The output state reflects that `c` has been increased by 1 without specifying its value.

Output State: **`count` is 2; variable `c` is increased by 1**
