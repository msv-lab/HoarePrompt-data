Postcondition: ***`count` is incremented by 1. If `temp[0]` is in `same` or `lol` is in `same`, both `temp` and `lol` are cleared, resulting in empty lists. If neither condition is met and the length of `same` is equal to `int(inp[1])`, the loop breaks. Otherwise, `temp[0]` is appended to `same`, and both `temp` and `lol` are cleared, resulting in empty lists. In all cases, `order` contains at least 2 elements.***
