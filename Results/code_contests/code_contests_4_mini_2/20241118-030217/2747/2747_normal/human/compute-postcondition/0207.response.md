The code appends a list containing two elements to the `temp` list. The first element is `order[i]`, and the second element is `order[count]`. Given that `count` is equal to `len(order) - 1`, `order[count]` refers to the last element of the `order` list. The specific values of `order[i]` and `order[count]` depend on the current index `i` and the content of the `order` list.

However, since the exact values of `order` and `i` are not provided, I can only indicate that two values are being appended to `temp`.

Output State: **`temp` now contains an additional list with elements `order[i]` and `order[len(order) - 1]`**
