According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `count` and the length of `order`. The loop will execute as long as `count` is less than or equal to `len(order) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `count` has been incremented, and it can still execute one more time if `count` is currently less than `len(order) - 1`. 

Since `order` contains at least 1 element, `len(order)` is at least 1, making `len(order) - 1` equal to 0 or greater. 

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `count` is less than `len(order) - 1`. Therefore, if `count` is currently equal to `len(order) - 1`, we need to adjust it to be less than that value. 

As such, we can infer that we need to set `count` to `len(order) - 1` for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`order` contains at least 1 element, `count` is equal to `len(order) - 1`**
