Output State: **if count is less than or equal to int(inp[0]) then after the loop executes count will be int(inp[0]) + 1, i remains 0, and c will be the value after incrementing it based on its prior value (either reset to 0 if it was at the last index of a or incremented by 1 if it was less than len(a) - 1). If count starts greater than int(inp[0]), the loop does not execute, and count remains 0, c retains its initial value, and i stays at 0.**
