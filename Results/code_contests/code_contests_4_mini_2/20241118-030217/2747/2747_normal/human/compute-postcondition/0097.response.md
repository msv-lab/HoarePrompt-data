The variable `lol` is assigned an empty list. The previous value of `lol` was `[order[0], order[0]]`, which is now replaced by the empty list. The other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `order` contains at least 1 element, `count` is 0, `c` is `count % len(order)`, `i` is 0, `temp` is [], `lol` is now an empty list, `same` still contains `temp[0]`, and `lol` is not in `same`.

Output State: **`order` contains at least 1 element, `count` is 0, `c` is `count % len(order)`, `i` is 0, `temp` is [], `lol` is now an empty list, `same` now contains `temp[0]`, and `lol` is not in `same`**
