The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `order` contains at least 1 element; `count` is 0; `c` is `count % len(order)`; `i` is 0; `temp` contains [[order[0], order[0]]]; `lol` contains [order[0], order[0]]; `temp[0]` is not in `same`; `lol` is not in `same`; the length of `same` is equal to the integer value of `inp[1]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
