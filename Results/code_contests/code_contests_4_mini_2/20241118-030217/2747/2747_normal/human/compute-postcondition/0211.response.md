The code assigns an empty list to `lol`, which does not affect the previous value of `temp`. The state of `temp` remains unchanged as it is initialized as an empty list. Therefore, the output state is: `temp` is an empty list, and `lol` is an empty list.

Output State: **`temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list**
