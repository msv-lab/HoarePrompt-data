The assignment `lol = []` assigns an empty list to `lol`. The previous value of `lol` is unknown, but since it is being reassigned to an empty list, its previous state is overridden. The variables `temp` and `count` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, and `count` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, and `count` remains unchanged**
