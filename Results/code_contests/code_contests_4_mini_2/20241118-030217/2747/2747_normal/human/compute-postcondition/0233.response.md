The variable `lol` is assigned an empty list. The variable `temp` remains unchanged as an empty list, and `same` continues to be unchanged due to the IndexError from accessing `temp[0]`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `temp` is still an empty list and `same` cannot be updated.

Output State: **`temp` is an empty list; `same` cannot be updated due to IndexError on accessing `temp[0]**
