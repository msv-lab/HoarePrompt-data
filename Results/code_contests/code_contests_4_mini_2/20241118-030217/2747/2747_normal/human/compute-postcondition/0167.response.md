Postcondition: ***`count` is less than or equal to `len(order) - 2`, if `temp[0]` or `lol` is in `same`, then `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, and `count` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if the length of `same` equals `int(inp[1])`, the loop breaks; otherwise, `temp[0]` is appended to `same`, `temp` is reset to an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, and `count` is incremented by 1.***
