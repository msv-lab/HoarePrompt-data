Postcondition: ***`temp` contains an additional list with elements `order[i]` and `order[len(order) - 1]`; `lol` is updated by appending `temp[0][0]`. If the length of `same` is equal to `int(inp[1])`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. This condition allows for the possibility of `same` being empty or containing elements, and ensures that the program can handle cases where `same` reaches the specified length or does not, without performing any actions in the else part.***
