`count` is incremented by 1. Its previous value is 1, so after execution, `count` becomes 2. The states of `i` and `c` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is 2, `i` is 0, and `c` is either reset to 0 or incremented by 1.

Output State: **`count` is 2, `i` is 0, and `c` is either reset to 0 or incremented by 1**
