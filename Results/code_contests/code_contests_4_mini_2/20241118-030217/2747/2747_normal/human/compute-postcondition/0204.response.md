The value of `count` is incremented by 1, changing it from 0 to 1. The values of the other variables (`temp`, `lol`, and `same`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `count` is 1, `temp` is [], `lol` is [], and `same` contains `temp[0]` which does not exist.

Output State: **`count` is 1, `temp` is [], `lol` is [], and `same` contains `temp[0]` which does not exist**
