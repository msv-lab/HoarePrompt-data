The variable `c` is initialized to 0. The previous values of the affected variables are `count` is 2, and `int(inp[0])` is greater than or equal to 2, but these values do not affect the initialization of `c`. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is 2, `int(inp[0])` is greater than or equal to 2, and `c` is 0.

Output State: **`count` is 2, `int(inp[0])` is greater than or equal to 2, and `c` is 0**
