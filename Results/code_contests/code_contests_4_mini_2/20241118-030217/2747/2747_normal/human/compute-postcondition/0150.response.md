The variable `lol` is assigned an empty list `[]`. The other variables (`count`, `order`, `temp`, `same`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the other variables along with the new state of `lol`.

Output State: **`count` is 0, the length of `order` is greater than 1, `temp` is [], `lol` is [], `temp[0]` is not in `same`, `lol` is not in `same`, and `same` now has one additional element appended.**
