The `pass` statement does not change any variables or perform any operations. The values of `temp`, `lol`, and `count` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, and `count` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, and `count` is increased by 1**
