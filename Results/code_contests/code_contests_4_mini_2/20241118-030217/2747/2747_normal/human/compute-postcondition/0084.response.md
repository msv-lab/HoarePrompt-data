The code appends the second element of the first list in `temp` (which is `temp[0][1]`) to the list `lol`. The value of `temp` is `[[order[0], order[0]]]`, so `temp[0][1]` is equal to `order[0]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `order` contains at least 1 element; `count` is 0; `c` is `count % len(a)`; `i` is 0; `temp` contains [[order[0], order[0]]]; `lol` contains [order[0]].

Output State: **`order` contains at least 1 element; `count` is 0; `c` is `count % len(a)`; `i` is 0; `temp` contains [[order[0], order[0]]]; `lol` contains [order[0]]**
