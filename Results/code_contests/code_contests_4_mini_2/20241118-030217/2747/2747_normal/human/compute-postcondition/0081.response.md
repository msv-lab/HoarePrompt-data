The variable `temp` is assigned an empty list, and the other variables `order`, `count`, `c`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `order` contains at least 1 element, `count` is 0, `c` is `count % len(a)`, `i` is 0, and `temp` is an empty list.

Output State: **`order` contains at least 1 element, `count` is 0, `c` is `count % len(a)`, `i` is 0, and `temp` is an empty list**
