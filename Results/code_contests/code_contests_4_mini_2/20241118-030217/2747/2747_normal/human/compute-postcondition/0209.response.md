The code appends `temp[0][0]` to the list `lol`. The previous state indicates that `temp` contains an additional list with elements `order[i]` and `order[len(order) - 1]`, but the specific values of `temp[0][0]` are not provided. Therefore, the output state reflects that `lol` is updated by appending the value of `temp[0][0]`. 

Output State: **`temp` now contains an additional list with elements `order[i]` and `order[len(order) - 1]`; `lol` is updated by appending `temp[0][0]`**
