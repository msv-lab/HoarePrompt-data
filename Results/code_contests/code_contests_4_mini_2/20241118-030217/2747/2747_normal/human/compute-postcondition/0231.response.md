The code appends `temp[0]` to the list `same`. The previous values of the affected variables are not specified except for `temp`, which contains additional elements. Therefore, the state of `same` will change as an element from `temp` gets appended to it. Other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`same` is updated by appending `temp[0]`**
