The code appends `temp[0][0]` to the list `lol`. Since `temp` contains `[[order[0], order[0]]]`, `temp[0][0]` is equal to `order[0]`. The previous value of `lol` is `[order[0]]`, so after executing the append operation, `lol` will contain two instances of `order[0]`. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`order` contains at least 1 element; `count` is 0; `c` is `count % len(a)`; `i` is 0; `temp` contains [[order[0], order[0]]]; `lol` contains [order[0], order[0]]**
