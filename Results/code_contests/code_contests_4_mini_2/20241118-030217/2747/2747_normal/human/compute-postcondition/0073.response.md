The value of `count` is incremented by 1, so `count` changes from 2 to 3. The variables `i` and `c` remain unaffected, but `c` was stated to be increased by 1 in the initial state. Therefore, after the execution of the code, `c` would now have a value of 2 (assuming it started at 1, since it was only mentioned that it is increased by 1). The output state reflects these changes.

Output State: **`count` is 3, `i` is 0, `c` is increased by 1**
