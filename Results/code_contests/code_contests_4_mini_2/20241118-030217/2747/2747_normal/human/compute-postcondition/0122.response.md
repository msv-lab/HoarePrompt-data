The `pass` statement is a no-operation statement that does nothing at all. It does not change the values of any variables or the state of the program. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`order` contains at least 1 element, `count` is equal to `len(order)`, `temp` is an empty list, and `lol` is now an empty list**
