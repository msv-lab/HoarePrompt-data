The variable `temp` is assigned an empty list `[]`, which means all previous values contained in `temp` are removed. The values of `count`, `lol`, and `same` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `temp`.

Output State: **`count` is 0, `temp` is [], `lol` contains `order[0]` and `temp[0][0]`, and `same` now contains `temp[0]**
