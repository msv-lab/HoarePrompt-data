The line of code `temp = []` assigns an empty list to the variable `temp`. The previous value of `temp` was already an empty list, so there is no change in its state. The other variables `count`, `lol`, and `order` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state remains the same for those variables.

Output State: **`count` is 0, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, and `order` has at least 2 elements**
