Postcondition: ***`temp` contains additional elements, `lol` is updated by appending `temp[0][1]` and `temp[0][0]`, `count` is adjusted to be less than or equal to `len(order) - 2`, and if the length of `same` is equal to `int(inp[1])`, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the length of `same` is not equal to `int(inp[1])`, the program continues executing without any changes to the state related to this condition.***
