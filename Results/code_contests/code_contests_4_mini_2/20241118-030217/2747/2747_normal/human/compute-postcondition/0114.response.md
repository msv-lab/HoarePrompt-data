Postcondition: ***`order` contains at least 1 element; if `temp[0]` is in `same` or `lol` is in `same`, then `temp` and `lol` are both reset to empty lists, and `count` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if the length of `same` equals `int(inp[1])`, execution breaks; if not, `temp[0]` is appended to `same`, and both `temp` and `lol` are reset to empty lists with `count` incremented by 1.***
