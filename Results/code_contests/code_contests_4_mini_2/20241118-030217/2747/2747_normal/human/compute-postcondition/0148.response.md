The code appends `temp[0]` to the list `same`. Since `temp[0]` is confirmed to not be in `same`, this operation will increase the length of `same` by 1. The other variables (`count`, `order`, `lol`, and `inp`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. 

Thus, the output state reflects the updated state of `same` after the append operation. 

Output State: **`count` is 0, the length of `order` is greater than 1, `temp` contains one sublist with `order[i]` and `order[0]`, `lol` contains two elements: `temp[0][1]` and `order[i]`, `temp[0]` is not in `same`, `lol` is not in `same`, and `same` now has one additional element appended.**
