The variable `lol` is initialized as an empty list. The previous state indicates that `same` contains `temp[0]` appended to it, and `lol` is updated by appending `temp[0][0]`. However, since `temp` is an empty list, `temp[0]` does not exist, which means `temp[0][0]` also does not exist. Therefore, the assignment to `lol` does not change anything because it cannot append a value. 

The state of the other variables remains unaffected. Thus, the output state is: `same` contains `temp[0]` appended to it; `lol` is an empty list; `temp` is an empty list.

Output State: **`same` contains `temp[0]` appended to it; `lol` is an empty list; `temp` is an empty list**.
