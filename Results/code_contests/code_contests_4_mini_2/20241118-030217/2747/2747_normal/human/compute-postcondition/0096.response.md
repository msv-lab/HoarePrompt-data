The variable `temp` is assigned an empty list, which means it is cleared of any previous values. The other variables remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `temp` while retaining the other variable values.

Output State: **`order` contains at least 1 element, `count` is 0, `c` is `count % len(order)`, `i` is 0, `temp` is [], `lol` contains [order[0], order[0]], `same` now contains `temp[0]`, and `lol` is not in `same`**
