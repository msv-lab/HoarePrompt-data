Postcondition: ***`count` is incremented by 1. If `c` was equal to `len(a) - 1`, then `c` is reset to 0, indicating that the last element of `a` was processed, and a new element from `a[c]` has been added to `order`. Otherwise, if `c` was less than `len(a) - 1`, `c` is incremented by 1, and a new element from `a[c]` has been added to `order`, while still ensuring that `count` is 1 and `int(inp[1])` is at least `int(inp[1]) + 1`. This handles the case where `count` starts from 0 and ensures that all relevant conditions are met.***
