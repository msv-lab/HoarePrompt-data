Postcondition: ***`count` is 0, `order` is a list with at least 1 element, `temp` contains one list with elements from `order`, `lol` is the sum of the second element and the first element of the first list from `temp`, `same` remains unchanged, and neither `temp[0]` is in `same` nor `lol` is in `same`. If the length of `same` equals the integer value of `inp[1]`, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the length of `same` is not equal to `inp[1]`, the program continues without breaking.***
