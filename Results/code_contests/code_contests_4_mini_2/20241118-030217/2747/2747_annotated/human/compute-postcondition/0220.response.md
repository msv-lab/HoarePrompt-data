Postcondition: ***`count` is equal to `len(order)`, `order` is a list with at least 1 element. If `temp[0]` is in `same` or `lol` is in `same`, then `temp` and `lol` are both empty lists, and `count` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if the length of `same` is equal to `int(inp[1])`, the program breaks out of the loop; otherwise, `same` contains one additional element, `temp[0]`, while `temp` and `lol` are reset to empty lists, and `count` is incremented by 1. This ensures that all elements in `same` are unique and that the process continues until the specified conditions are met.***
