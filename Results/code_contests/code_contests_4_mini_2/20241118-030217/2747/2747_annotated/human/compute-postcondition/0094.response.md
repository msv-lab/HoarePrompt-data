Postcondition: ***`order` has at least 1 element, `c` is less than len(a) and initialized properly, `int(inp[0])` is greater than or equal to 0, `count` is 0, `temp` contains the pair [order[i], order[count]], `lol` contains order[count] with a new element order[i] added to it; `temp[0]` is not in `same`, `lol` is not in `same`, and if the length of `same` is equal to `int(inp[1])`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If the length of `same` is not equal to `int(inp[1])`, the program continues without breaking.***
