The variable `lol` is assigned an empty list `[]`. The previous values of the affected variables are `count` is 0, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` previously contained `temp[0][1]` and included `temp[0][0]`, and either `temp[0]` is in `same` or `lol` is in `same`, with `same` containing its initial state. However, the assignment overwrites `lol` with an empty list, and no other variables are affected.

Output State: **`count` is 0, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, and `same` contains its initial state.**
