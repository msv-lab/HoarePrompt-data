The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `order` has at least 1 element; `c` is less than len(order) and initialized properly; `int(inp[0])` is greater than or equal to 0; `count` is increased by 1 and `count` is less than or equal to len(order) - 1; `lol` now includes the new element `temp[0][0]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
