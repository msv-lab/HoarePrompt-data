The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `order` has at least 1 element; `c` is less than len(order) and initialized properly; `count` is increased by 1 and remains less than or equal to len(order) - 1; `temp` is updated with a new entry containing `order[i]` and `order[count]`; `lol` has a new entry `temp[0][0]` appended to it, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
