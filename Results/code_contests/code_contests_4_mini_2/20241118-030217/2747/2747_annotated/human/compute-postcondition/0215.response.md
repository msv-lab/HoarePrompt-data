Postcondition: ***`count` is equal to `len(order) - 1`, `order` is a list with at least 1 element, `temp` contains a list with elements [order[i], order[count]], and `lol` contains the second character of `order[i]` with the first character of `order[i]` appended to it. If the length of `same` is equal to `int(inp[1])`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues execution without breaking.***
