The variable `temp` is a new list containing `order[i]` and `order[count]`, where `count` is equal to `len(order) - 1`. The value `temp[0][1]` refers to the second element of the first item in the `temp` list. The list `lol` is updated by appending this value. The previous values of `count`, `order`, and `temp` are not directly altered by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `count` is equal to `len(order) - 1`, `order` is a list with at least 1 element, `temp` contains `order[i]` and `order[count]`, and `lol` is updated with `temp[0][1]`.

Output State: **`count` is equal to `len(order) - 1`, `order` is a list with at least 1 element, `temp` contains `order[i]` and `order[count]`, and `lol` is updated with `temp[0][1]`**.
