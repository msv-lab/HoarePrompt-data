The variable `count` is incremented by 1 from its previous value of 0. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `order` includes an element from `a` at index `c`, `count` is now 1, and `c` is 0.

Output State: **`order` includes an element from `a` at index `c`, `count` is now 1, and `c` is 0**
