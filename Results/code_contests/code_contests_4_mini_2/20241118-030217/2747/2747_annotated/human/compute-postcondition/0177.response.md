Postcondition: ***`count` is less than or equal to `len(order) - 1`, `temp` contains one new list with elements from `order[i]` and `order[count]`, `lol` now contains `temp[0][1]`, and `lol` is updated by appending `temp[0][0]`. If the length of `same` equals `int(inp[1])`, we break out of the most internal loop or statement, ensuring that the execution halts under this condition.***
