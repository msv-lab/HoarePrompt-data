The variable `lol` is a list, and the code `lol.append(temp[0][0])` appends the value of `temp[0][0]` to the list `lol`. The value of `temp[0][0]` is not specified, but it is taken from the `temp` list, which is derived from `order[i]` and `order[1]`. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the output state reflects the updated state of `lol` after appending the new value, while the values of `count` and `temp` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`count` is 1, `temp` contains the new list with `order[i]` and `order[1]`, and `lol` now contains the previous elements plus `temp[0][0]`**
