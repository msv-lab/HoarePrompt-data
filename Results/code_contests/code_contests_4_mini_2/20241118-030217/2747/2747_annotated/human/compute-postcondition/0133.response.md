The value of `count` is assigned the value `0`. The previous value of `count` was `len(order) - 1`, but it has now been updated to `0`. The states of the other variables (`temp`, `lol`, and `same`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `count` is 0, `temp` is empty, `lol` is empty, `same` contains its initial state.

Output State: **`count` is 0, `temp` is empty, `lol` is empty, `same` contains its initial state**
