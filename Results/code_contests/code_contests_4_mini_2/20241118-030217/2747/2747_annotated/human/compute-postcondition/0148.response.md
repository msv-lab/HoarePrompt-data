Output State: **`count` is 0, `temp` contains one element which is a list with `order[i]` and `order[0]`, `lol` contains `temp[0][1]`, `temp[0][0]` is appended to `lol`, `temp[0]` is appended to `same`, `lol` is not in `same`, and if the length of `same` equals the integer value of `inp[1]`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the length of `same` is less than `inp[1]`, the program continues execution without breaking.**
