Postcondition: ***`count` is equal to `len(order) - 1`, `order` is a list with at least 1 element, `temp` contains `order[i]` and `order[count]`, `lol` is updated to include `temp[0][0]`, and if the length of `same` is equal to `int(inp[1])`, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the length of `same` is not equal to `int(inp[1])`, the program continues without breaking.***
