The code appends the value of `temp[0][1]` to the list `lol`. The variable `temp` is a list containing one element which is itself a list with `order[i]` and `order[0]`, but the specific values of `order[i]` and `order[0]` are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the exact value appended to `lol` cannot be determined. The other variables (`count` and `same`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`count` is 0, `temp` contains one element which is a list with `order[i]` and `order[0]`, `lol` now contains `temp[0][1]`, `same` contains its initial state**
