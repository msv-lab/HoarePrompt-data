The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is equal to `len(order) - 1`, `order` is a list with at least 1 element, `temp` contains `order[i]` and `order[count]`, and `lol` is updated to include `temp[0][0]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
