The variable `lol` is assigned an empty list, which means it is now initialized as `[]`. The other variables `count`, `temp`, and `same` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `count` is 1, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, and `same` has `temp[0]` appended to it, but since `temp` is empty, this operation does not proceed.

Output State: **`count` is 1, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is [], and `same` has `temp[0]` appended to it but remains unchanged**
