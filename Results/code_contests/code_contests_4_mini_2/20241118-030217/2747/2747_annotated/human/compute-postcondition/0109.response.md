Postcondition: ***`order` has at least 1 element; `c` is less than len(order) and initialized properly; `int(inp[0])` is greater than or equal to 0; `count` is increased by 1 and is less than or equal to len(order) - 1; `lol` now includes the new element `temp[0][0]`. If the length of `same` is equal to `int(inp[1])`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise the program continues execution without breaking.***
