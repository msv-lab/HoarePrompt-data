The variable `lol` is assigned an empty list, which means it now contains no elements. The previous value of `lol` was undefined before this assignment, and the other variables `count` and `temp` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is that `count` is less than or equal to len(order) - 1, `temp` is an empty list, and `lol` is now an empty list.

Output State: **`count` is less than or equal to len(order) - 1, `temp` is an empty list, and `lol` is an empty list**
