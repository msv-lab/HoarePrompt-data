The `append` method is called on the list `lol`, adding the value of `temp[0][1]` to it. The initial state indicates that `temp` contains a new list with `order[i]` and `order[1]`, so the value of `temp[0][1]` is the second element of that list. The variable `count` remains unaffected, and `lol` transitions from an empty list to containing one element. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated state of `lol` while other variables stay unchanged.

Output State: **`count` is 1, `temp` contains the new list with `order[i]` and `order[1]`, `lol` contains `temp[0][1]`, and `len(order)` is greater than or equal to 2**
