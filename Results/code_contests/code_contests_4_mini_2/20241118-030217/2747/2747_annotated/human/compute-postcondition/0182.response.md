Postcondition: ***`count` is less than or equal to `len(order) - 1`, if `temp[0]` is in `same` or `lol` is in `same`, then `temp` and `lol` are both reset to empty lists, and `count` is incremented by 1. If `temp[0]` is not in `same` and `lol` is not in `same`, and if the length of `same` is equal to `int(inp[1])`, the loop breaks; otherwise, `temp[0]` is appended to `same`, and both `temp` and `lol` are reset to empty lists while `count` is incremented by 1. This ensures that `count` is updated correctly and `same` is handled based on the conditions of `temp` and `lol`.***
