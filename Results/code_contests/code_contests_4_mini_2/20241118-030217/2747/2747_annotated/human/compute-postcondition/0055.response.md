The variable `count` is initialized to `0`. The state of the other variable `order`, which includes an element from `a` at index `c`, remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `order` includes an element from `a` at index `c`, and `count` is initialized to 0.

Output State: **`order` includes an element from `a` at index `c`, and `count` is 0**
