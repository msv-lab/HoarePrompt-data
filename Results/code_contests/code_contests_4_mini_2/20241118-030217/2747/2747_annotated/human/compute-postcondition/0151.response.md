The value of `count` is incremented by 1, and since its initial value is 0, the new value of `count` becomes 1. The states of the other variables (`temp`, `lol`, `same`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is 1, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, and `same` is unchanged.

Output State: **`count` is 1, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, and `same` is unchanged**
