The variable `lol` is assigned an empty list `[]`. The other variables are not affected by this assignment, so their states remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`order` has at least 1 element, `c` is less than len(a) and initialized properly, `int(inp[0])` is greater than or equal to 0, `count` is 0, `temp` is [], `lol` is [], `temp[0]` is not in `same`, `lol` is not in `same`, and `temp[0]` is appended to `same`.**
