The variable `temp` is assigned an empty list `[]`, replacing its previous value of empty. The other variables `count`, `lol`, and `same` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `count` is 0, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is empty, `same` contains its initial state.

Output State: **`count` is 0, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is empty, `same` contains its initial state**
