Output State: **`if count is less than or equal to int(inp[0]) then count` is equal to `int(inp[0]) + 1`, `c` will be reset to 0 if it reached the last index of list `a`, otherwise `c` is incremented up to `len(a) - 1`. If count starts at 0, the loop will execute at least once and `count` will eventually equal `int(inp[0]) + 1`. If `int(inp[0])` is less than 0, the loop will not execute and `count` remains 0, while `c` will also remain 0.**
