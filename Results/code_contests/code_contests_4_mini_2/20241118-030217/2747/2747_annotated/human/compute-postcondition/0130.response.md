According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `count` and the length of `order`. The loop can execute again if `count` is less than or equal to `len(order) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `count` is still less than or equal to `len(order) - 1`, which means the loop can continue.

However, since `count` is stated to be less than or equal to `len(order) - 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `count` must remain less than `len(order)`. Thus, `count` should be adjusted to be equal to `len(order) - 1` at the end of the previous iteration.

No other states need to be adjusted since `order` has at least 1 element, and `c` is properly initialized. 

State: **`order` has at least 1 element; `c` is less than len(order); `count` is equal to len(order) - 1**
