Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `l` is a positive integer less than or equal to 10^18, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of string values from user input, `inp` is a list of string values from user input where `inp[1]` is a string representation of a positive integer, `order` contains `a[0]`, `same` is an empty list, `c` is updated to 0 if it was equal to `len(a) - 1`, otherwise `c` is incremented by 1, and `count` is increased by 1 regardless of the condition. Thus, after the execution of the if-else block, `count` is guaranteed to be 1 or greater, and `c` is reset to 0 if it reached the last index of the list `a`.***
