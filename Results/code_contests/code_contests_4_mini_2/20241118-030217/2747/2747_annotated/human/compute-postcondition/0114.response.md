Postcondition: ***`order` has at least 1 element; `c` is less than len(order) and initialized properly; `int(inp[0])` is greater than or equal to 0; `count` is increased by 1 and remains less than or equal to len(order) - 1. If `temp[0]` is in `same` or `lol` is in `same`, both `temp` and `lol` are reset to empty lists. Otherwise, if the length of `same` reaches `int(inp[1])`, the loop breaks; otherwise, `temp[0]` is appended to `same`, and both `temp` and `lol` are reset to empty lists. The postcondition retains the state that `lol` includes the new element `temp[0][0]`.***
