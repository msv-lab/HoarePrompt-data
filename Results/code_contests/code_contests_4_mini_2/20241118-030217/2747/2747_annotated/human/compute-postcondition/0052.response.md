Initial State: `count` is 0, `c` is either reset or incremented, `int(inp[1])` is greater than `i`, and the value of `a[c]` has been appended to `order`.

Code of the loop:
```
while count <= int(inp[0]):
    if c == len(a) - 1:
        c = 0
        count = count + 1
    else:
        c = c + 1
        count = count + 1
```

Output State after loop executes 1 time: `count` is 1. If `c` equals `len(a) - 1`, then `c` is reset to 0, and `count` is incremented by 1. If `c` is less than `len(a) - 1`, then `c` is incremented by 1. In both cases, the value of `a[c]` has been appended to `order`. Additionally, `int(inp[1])` remains greater than `i`.

Output State after loop executes 2 times: `count` is 2. If `c` equals `len(a) - 1`, then `c` is reset to 0, and `count` is incremented to 2. If `c` is less than `len(a) - 1`, then `c` is incremented by 1, and `count` is also incremented to 2. In all cases, `c` will be either 0 (if it was at the last index of `a`) or one value greater than its original value (if it was not at the last index).

Output State after loop executes 3 times: `count` is 3. If `c` equals `len(a) - 1`, then `c` is reset to 0, and `count` is incremented to 3. If `c` is less than `len(a) - 1`, then `c` is incremented by 1, and `count` is also incremented to 3. `int(inp[0])` must be greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to continue, and `c` is either 0 (if it was at the last index of `a`) or one value greater than its original value.

**Potential Edge Cases:**
- If `int(inp[0])` is less than 0, the loop will not execute, and `count` will remain 0.
- If `len(a)` is 0 (i.e., `a` is an empty list), `c` cannot be incremented, and this will likely lead to an index error when trying to access `a[c]`.
- If `c` is initialized to a value greater than or equal to `len(a)`, it may lead to an index error or unexpected behavior.

Output State: **`if int(inp[0]) is greater than or equal to 0 then count is the number of loop executions (up to int(inp[0]) + 1), c is the last value incremented, or reset to 0 if it was at the last index of a. If int(inp[0]) is less than 0, count remains 0 and loop does not execute. If len(a) is 0, accessing a[c] will cause an error. If c starts greater than or equal to len(a), this will also lead to an error.`**
