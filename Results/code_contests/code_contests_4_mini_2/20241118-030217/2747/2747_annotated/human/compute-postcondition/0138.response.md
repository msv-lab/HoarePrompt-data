The code `lol.append(temp[0][0])` adds the first element of the first list in `temp` to the list `lol`. `temp` contains one element which is a list with `order[i]` and `order[0]`. Since `temp` has not been defined in terms of its specific contents, we can only state that `temp[0][0]` is an element from that list. The value of `count`, `temp`, and `same` are not modified by this operation.

Given the initial state, the output state after executing the code would be:

Output State: **`count` is 0, `temp` contains one element which is a list with `order[i]` and `order[0]`, `lol` now contains `temp[0][1]` and `temp[0][0]` is appended to `lol`, `same` contains its initial state**
