The `pass` statement does not change the values of any variables. It serves as a placeholder and allows the program to continue executing without any effect on the current state. Therefore, after executing the code, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`count` is equal to `len(order)`, `order` is a list with at least 1 element, `temp` is [], `lol` is []**
