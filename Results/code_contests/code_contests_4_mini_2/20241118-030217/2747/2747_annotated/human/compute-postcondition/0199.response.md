The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `count` is 0, `order` is a list with at least 1 element, `temp` contains one list with elements from `order`, `lol` is the sum of the second element and the first element of the first list from `temp`, `same` remains unchanged, and neither `temp[0]` is in `same` nor `lol` is in `same`. The length of `same` is equal to the integer value of `inp[1]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
