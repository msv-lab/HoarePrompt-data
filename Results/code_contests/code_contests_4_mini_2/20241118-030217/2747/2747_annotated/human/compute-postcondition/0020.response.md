Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `l` is a positive integer less than or equal to 10^18, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of string values from user input, `inp` is a list of string values from user input, `order` contains `a[0]`, `same` is an empty list, and `count` is equal to `int(inp[0]) + 1`. If `c` was equal to `len(a) - 1`, then `c` is reset to 0. Otherwise, `c` is incremented by 1. In both cases, `count` is incremented by 1.***
