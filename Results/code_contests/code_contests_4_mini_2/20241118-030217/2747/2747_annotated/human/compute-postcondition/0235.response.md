Postcondition: ***`count` is equal to `len(order)` if `temp[0]` or `lol` is in `same`; otherwise, if the length of `same` is equal to `int(inp[1])`, the loop breaks. If neither condition is met, `temp` and `lol` are reset to empty lists, `same` is updated to include `temp[0]`, and `count` is increased by 1. This ensures that all elements of `order` are processed, with `same` storing unique elements from `temp` and `count` indicating the total processed elements.***
