The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of the if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `order` has at least 1 element, `c` is less than len(a) and initialized properly, `int(inp[0])` is greater than or equal to 0, `count` is 0, `temp` now contains the pair [order[i], order[count]], `lol` now contains order[count] with a new element order[i] added to it; `temp[0]` is not in `same`, `lol` is not in `same`, and the length of `same` is equal to `int(inp[1])`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
