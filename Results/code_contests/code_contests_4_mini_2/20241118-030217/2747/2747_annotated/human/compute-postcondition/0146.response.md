The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is 0, `temp` contains one element which is a list with `order[i]` and `order[0]`, `lol` contains `temp[0][1]` and `temp[0][0]` is appended to `lol`, it is false that `temp[0]` is in `same`, `lol` is not in `same`, and the length of `same` is equal to the integer value of `inp[1]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
