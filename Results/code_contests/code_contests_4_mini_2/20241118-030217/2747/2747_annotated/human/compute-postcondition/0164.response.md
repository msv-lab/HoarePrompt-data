The code snippet assigns an empty list to `temp`. This action does not affect the values of the other variables (`count`, `lol`, `same`). Thus, the output state remains unchanged for those variables.

Output State: **`count` is 1, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` contains the previous elements plus `temp[0][0]`, and `same` has `temp[0]` appended to it.**
