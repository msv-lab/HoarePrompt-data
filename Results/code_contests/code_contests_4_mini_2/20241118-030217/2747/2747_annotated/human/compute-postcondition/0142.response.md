The value of `count` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. The values of `temp`, `lol`, and `same` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `count` is 1, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, and `same` contains its initial state.

Output State: **`count` is 1, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, and `same` contains its initial state**.
