The variable `lol` is assigned an empty list, and no other variables are affected. The state of `temp` remains an empty list, and `same` still includes `temp[0]`, which is invalid. Therefore, the output state is: `same` now includes `temp[0]` (which is invalid), `temp` is an empty list, and `lol` is an empty list.

Output State: **`same` now includes `temp[0]` (which is invalid), `temp` is an empty list, and `lol` is an empty list**
