Postcondition: ***`count` is 1. If `c` equals `len(a) - 1`, then `c` is reset to 0 and `count` is incremented by 1. If `c` is less than `len(a) - 1`, then `c` is incremented by 1, and in both cases, the value of `a[c]` has been appended to `order`. Additionally, `int(inp[1])` remains greater than `i`.***
