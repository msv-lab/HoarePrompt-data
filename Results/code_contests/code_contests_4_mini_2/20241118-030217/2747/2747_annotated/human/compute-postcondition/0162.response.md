Postcondition: ***`count` is 1, `temp` contains the new list with `order[i]` and `order[1]`, and `lol` now contains the previous elements plus `temp[0][0]`. If the length of `same` is equal to the integer value of `inp[1]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, indicating that the condition has been satisfied. If the condition is not met, no changes occur within the scope of the if statement.***
