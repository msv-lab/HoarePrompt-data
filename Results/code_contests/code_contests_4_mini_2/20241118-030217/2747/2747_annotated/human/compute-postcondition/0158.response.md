The list `lol` is assigned an empty list, which means all previous elements are removed, and `lol` now contains no elements. The states of the other variables `count` and `temp` remain unchanged, and since `temp` is an empty list, `temp[0][0]` is undefined and does not affect the output. Therefore, the output state is: `count` is 1, `temp` is an empty list, and `lol` is an empty list.

Output State: **`count` is 1, `temp` is an empty list, and `lol` is an empty list**
