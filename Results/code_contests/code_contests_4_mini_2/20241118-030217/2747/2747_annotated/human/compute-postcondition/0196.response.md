The `pass` statement does not change any variables or the program's state. Therefore, the output state reflects that no changes have occurred in the variables.

Output State: **`count` is 1, `order` is a list with at least 1 element, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, and `same` remains unchanged**.
