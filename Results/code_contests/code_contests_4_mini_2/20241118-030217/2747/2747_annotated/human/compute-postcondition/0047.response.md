The value of `count` is incremented by 1. Since the initial value of `count` is 2, after execution, `count` becomes 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is 3, `int(inp[0])` is greater than or equal to 2, `c` is 0.

Output State: **`count` is 3, `int(inp[0])` is greater than or equal to 2, `c` is 0**
