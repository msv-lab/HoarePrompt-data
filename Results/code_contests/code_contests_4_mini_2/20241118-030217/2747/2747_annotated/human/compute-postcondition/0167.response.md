Postcondition: ***`count` is an integer that has been incremented by 1, `temp` is an empty list, and `lol` is also an empty list. If `temp[0]` is in `same` or `lol` is in `same`, the function passes without modifying `same`. Otherwise, if the length of `same` equals `inp[1]`, the loop breaks; otherwise, `temp[0]` is appended to `same`, and both `temp` and `lol` are reset to empty lists while `count` is incremented by 1.***
