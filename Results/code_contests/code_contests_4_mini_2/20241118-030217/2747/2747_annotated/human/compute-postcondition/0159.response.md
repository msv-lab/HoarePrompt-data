The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is 1, so after execution, `count` becomes 2. The states of `temp` and `lol` are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `count` is 2, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list.

Output State: **`count` is 2, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list**
