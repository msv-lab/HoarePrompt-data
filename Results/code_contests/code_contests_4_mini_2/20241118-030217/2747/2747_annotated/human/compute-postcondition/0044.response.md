Postcondition: ***`count` is an integer starting from 1, and if `c` is equal to `len(a) - 1`, then `c` is reset to 0 and `count` is incremented to 2. If `c` is less than `len(a) - 1`, then `c` is incremented by 1 and `count` is also incremented to 2. In all cases, `count` will be 2 after the execution, and `c` will be either 0 (if it was at the last index of `a`) or one value greater than its original value (if it was not at the last index).***
