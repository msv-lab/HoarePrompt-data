Output State: **if count is less than or equal to int(inp[0]), then order includes elements from `a` at indices starting from the initial value of `c` and increments `count` until it reaches int(inp[0]) + 1. If c was equal to the last index of `a` at any point, it resets to 0; otherwise, it increments by 1. If int(inp[0]) is less than 0, the loop does not execute and `count` remains 0, and `c` does not change.**
