The line of code initializes `temp` as an empty list. The previous state indicates that `same` includes `temp[0]`, but since `temp` is now empty, `temp[0]` will not be valid, and the state of `same` will become invalid with respect to its previous dependence on `temp`. However, the initialization of `temp` itself does not affect the contents of `same` directly; it simply defines `temp` as an empty list.

Therefore, the output state reflects the initialization of `temp` while noting the previous relationship with `same`.

Output State: **`same` now includes `temp[0]` (which is invalid), `temp` is an empty list**
