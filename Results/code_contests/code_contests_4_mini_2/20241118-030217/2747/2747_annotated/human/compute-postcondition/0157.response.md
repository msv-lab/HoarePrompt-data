The variable `temp` is assigned an empty list. This action does not affect the values of the other variables, which remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is 1, `temp` is an empty list, and `lol` contains the previous elements plus `temp[0][0]` (which is not defined as `temp` is empty).

Output State: **`count` is 1, `temp` is an empty list, and `lol` contains the previous elements plus `temp[0][0]` (undefined)**
