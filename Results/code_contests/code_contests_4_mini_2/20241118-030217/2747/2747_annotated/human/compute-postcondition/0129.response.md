Postcondition: ***`order` has at least 1 element; `c` is less than len(order) and initialized properly; if `temp[0]` or `lol` is in `same`, then `temp` and `lol` are cleared, and `count` is increased by 1. In the else case, if the length of `same` equals `int(inp[1])`, the execution breaks; otherwise, `temp[0]` is appended to `same`, and both `temp` and `lol` are reset to empty lists, with `count` still being increased by 1 and remaining less than or equal to len(order) - 1.***
