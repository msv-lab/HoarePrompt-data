The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is less than or equal to len(order) - 1, `temp` contains one new list with elements from `order[i]` and `order[count]`, `lol` now contains `temp[0][1]`, and `lol` is updated by appending `temp[0][0]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
