Output State: **`if count is less than or equal to len(order) - 1 then same` contains unique pairs from `order`, and `count` is equal to `len(order)` after processing all elements. If `temp[0]` or `lol` is in `same`, then `same` remains unchanged, and the loop continues until `count` exceeds the length of `order` or the length of `same` reaches `int(inp[1])`. If the initial state has `count` as 0 and `order` with at least 1 element, the loop will execute at least once. If `order` is empty or `len(order)` is 0 initially, the loop will not execute, leaving `count` at 0, `same` unchanged, and both `temp` and `lol` as empty lists.**
