The code assigns an empty list to the variable `lol`. The previous state of `lol` was already empty, so it remains unchanged. The other variables `count`, `temp`, and `same` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `count` is 0, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, `same` contains its initial state.

Output State: **`count` is 0, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, `same` contains its initial state**
