Postcondition: ***`order` has at least 1 element, `c` is less than len(order) and initialized properly, `int(inp[0])` is greater than or equal to 0, and `count` is increased by 1. If `temp[0]` is in `same` or `lol` is in `same`, both `temp` and `lol` are reset to empty lists. If neither condition is met and the length of `same` equals `int(inp[1])`, the program breaks out of the loop; otherwise, `temp[0]` is appended to `same`, while `temp` and `lol` are reset to empty lists. Furthermore, `count` is incremented in either case, ensuring the program maintains its state regarding the elements in `same` and the count of processed pairs.***
