The variable `temp` contains a list with elements `[order[i], order[count]]`. The specific values of `order[i]` and `order[count]` are not explicitly detailed, but `temp[0]` refers to the first element of `temp`, which is `order[i]`. The code `lol.append(temp[0][1])` attempts to append the second character (index 1) of the string `order[i]` to the list `lol`. 

Since `lol` is initially an empty list, it will now contain the second character of `order[i]`. The values of `count` and `order` do not directly change with this operation, but the state of `lol` is updated.

Output State: **`count` is equal to `len(order) - 1`, `order` is a list with at least 1 element, `temp` contains a list with elements [order[i], order[count]], `lol` now contains the second character of order[i]**.
