The code appends a list containing `order[i]` and `order[count]` to the `temp` list. Since `count` is less than or equal to `len(order) - 1`, both `order[i]` and `order[count]` will retrieve valid elements from the `order` list. The previous values of `temp` and `lol` are both empty lists, so they will not affect the output state. 

Therefore, the output state will reflect that `temp` now contains one new list with the elements from `order`.

Output State: **`count` is less than or equal to len(order) - 1, `temp` contains one new list with elements from `order[i]` and `order[count]`, `lol` is an empty list**
