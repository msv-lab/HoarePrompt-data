`lol` is updated by appending the second element (index 1) of the first list (index 0) contained in `temp`. The value of `temp` is derived from `order`, and since `temp` contains one list with elements from `order`, `temp[0][1]` will be the second element of that list. The variables `count` and `same` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the addition of `temp[0][1]` to `lol`.

Output State: **`count` is 0, `order` is a list with at least 1 element, `temp` contains one list with elements from `order`, `lol` now contains the second element of the first list from `temp`, and `same` remains unchanged**.
