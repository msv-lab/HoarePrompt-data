The variable `temp` is assigned a new empty list. This assignment replaces the previous value of `temp`, which was already an empty list. The other variables (`count`, `order`, `lol`, and `same`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `count` is 0, `order` is a list with at least 1 element, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, and `same` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`count` is 0, `order` is a list with at least 1 element, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, and `same` remains unchanged**
