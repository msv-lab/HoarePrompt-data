The variable `temp` is initialized as an empty list. This does not affect any other variables in the initial state, which are still intact. Therefore, the output state is simply that `temp` is now an empty list.

Output State: **`order` has at least 1 element, `c` is less than len(order) and initialized properly, `int(inp[0])` is greater than or equal to 0, `count` is 0, `temp` is [], `lol` contains order[count] and has order[i] added to it. Either the first element of `temp` is in `same`, or `lol` is in `same`.**
