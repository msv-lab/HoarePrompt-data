Output State: **`count` is 0, `order` is a list with at least 1 element, `temp` contains one list with elements from `order`, `lol` is the sum of the second element and the first element of the first list from `temp`, `same` is updated to include `temp[0]`, and the length of `same` is not equal to `inp[1]`, so the program continues without breaking.**
