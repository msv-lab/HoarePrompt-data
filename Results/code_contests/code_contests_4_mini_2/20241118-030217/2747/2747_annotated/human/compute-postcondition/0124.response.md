Postcondition: ***`order` has at least 1 element; `c` is less than len(order) and initialized properly; `count` is increased by 1 and remains less than or equal to len(order) - 1; `temp` is updated with a new entry containing `order[i]` and `order[count]`; `lol` has a new entry `temp[0][0]` appended to it. If the length of `same` equals `int(inp[1])`, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, which indicates that a specific condition has been met.***
