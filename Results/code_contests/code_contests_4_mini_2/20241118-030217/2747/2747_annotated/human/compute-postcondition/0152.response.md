Postcondition: ***`count` is 1, `temp` is an empty list, and `lol` is an empty list. If `temp[0]` is in `same` or `lol` is in `same`, the `pass` statement is executed without changing `same`. Otherwise, if the length of `same` is equal to `int(inp[1])`, the loop is broken; otherwise, `temp[0]` is appended to `same` and then `temp` and `lol` are reset to empty lists, resulting in `same` being potentially modified.***
