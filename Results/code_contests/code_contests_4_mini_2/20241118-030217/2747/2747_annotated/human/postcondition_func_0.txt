The function accepts input through standard input, where it processes two lists: one to determine the order of elements and another to create unique pairs from these elements. It collects unique pairs based on the specified limits, and finally, it outputs the sum of the lengths of the unique pairs and the order list, modulo \(10^9 + 7\). The function does not handle cases where the input lists are empty or when the limits provided could lead to errors, such as division by zero or index out of bounds.
