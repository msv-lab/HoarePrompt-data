n is a positive integer representing the number of blogs (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^5), m is a non-negative integer representing the number of references (0 ≤ m ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^5), arr is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two distinct integers (a, b) representing a reference between blogs (1 ≤ a, b ≤ n), and topic is a list of integers where each integer t_i (1 ≤ t_i ≤ n) represents the desired topic number for the i-th blog.
