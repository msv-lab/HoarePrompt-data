According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `arr`. Since `arr` has at least 3 pairs and the loop iterates over each pair, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that the next pair can be fetched from `arr`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `(a, b)` is the third pair in the list. Therefore, to allow the loop to execute again, we need to adjust the state to reflect that the next pair is the fourth pair in the list. This means `a` and `b` should correspond to the fourth pair in `arr` as well as ensuring that `arr` still has at least 4 pairs.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of pairs with at least 4 pairs, and (a, b) is the fourth pair in the list.**
