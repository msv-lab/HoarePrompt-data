Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a non-negative integer, and `arr` is a list of pairs with at least 2 pairs. If the values at `topic[a - 1]` and `topic[b - 1]` are equal, the function returns -1. If the values are not equal, the function does not return any value, and its behavior is not explicitly defined.***
