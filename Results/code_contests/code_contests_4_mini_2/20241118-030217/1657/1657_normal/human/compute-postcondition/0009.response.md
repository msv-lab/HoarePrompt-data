Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of pairs with at least 3 pairs, and (a, b) is the third pair in the list. If the topics at indices `a - 1` and `b - 1` in the `topic` list are equal, the function returns -1. If they are not equal, there is no return value, and the program continues executing with no changes to `m`, `n`, or `arr`.***
