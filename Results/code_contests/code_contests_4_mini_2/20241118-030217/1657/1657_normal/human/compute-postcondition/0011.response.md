Output State: **If `arr` is a list of pairs with at least one pair, then for each pair (a, b), if the topics at indices `a - 1` and `b - 1` in the `topic` list are equal, the function returns -1, indicating a conflict in topics. If the topics are not equal for all pairs in `arr`, the function does not return any value (implicitly returns None). If `arr` is empty, the loop does not execute, and the values of `n`, `m`, and `arr` remain unchanged.**
