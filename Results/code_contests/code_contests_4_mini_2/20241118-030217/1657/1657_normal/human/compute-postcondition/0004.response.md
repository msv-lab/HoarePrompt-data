According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `arr`. If `arr` has at least two pairs, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` has at least one pair, and since the loop iterates over the pairs in `arr`, for it to execute one more time, `arr` must have at least two pairs. Additionally, the next pair that will be iterated over would be the second one in the list. 

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `arr` has at least two pairs. The values of `n` and `m` do not need to be changed as they are not affected by the loop iterations.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a non-negative integer, and `arr` is a list of pairs with at least 2 pairs**
