The function `func_1` accepts the following parameters: `n`, `m`, `arr`, and `topic`. 

- `n` is a positive integer representing the number of blogs (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^5).
- `m` is a non-negative integer representing the number of references (0 ≤ m ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^5).
- `arr` is a list of pairs of integers representing bidirectional references between blogs (1 ≤ a, b ≤ n).
- `topic` is a list of integers where each integer t_i (1 ≤ t_i ≤ n) represents the desired topic for the i-th blog.

The functionality of the function is as follows:

**Case 1**: If `arr` contains at least one pair, the function checks each pair (a, b) to see if the topics at indices `a - 1` and `b - 1` in the `topic` list are equal. If any topics are equal, the function returns -1, indicating a conflict in topics. If all pairs have different topics, the function does not return any value (implicitly returns None). If `arr` is empty, the function does not execute the loop, and the values of `n`, `m`, and `arr` remain unchanged.

**Case 2**: If `arr` is empty, the function returns a string of numbers from 1 to n, joined by spaces.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, m, arr, and topic. It checks for topic conflicts in the pairs of arr and returns -1 if conflicts exist. If arr is empty, it returns a string of numbers from 1 to n joined by spaces.**
