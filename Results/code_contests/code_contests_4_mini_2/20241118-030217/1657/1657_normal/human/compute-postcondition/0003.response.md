Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a non-negative integer, and `arr` is a list of pairs with at least one pair. If the elements at indices `a - 1` and `b - 1` in the `topic` list are equal, the function returns -1. If they are not equal, the function does not return any value (implicitly returns None). This means that the comparison does not affect the values of `n`, `m`, or the contents of `arr`.***
