The function accepts integers `n` and `m`, a list of pairs `arr`, and a list of `topic`. It checks if any pairs in `arr` reference topics that are the same; if a conflict is found, it returns -1. If no conflicts are found and `arr` is non-empty, it implicitly returns None. If `arr` is empty, the function returns a string of numbers from 1 to `n` joined by spaces.
