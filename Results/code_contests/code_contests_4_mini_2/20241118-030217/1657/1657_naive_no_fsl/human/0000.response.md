Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a fundamental flaw in its logic. It checks only whether any two connected blogs have the same desired topic and returns `-1` if they do, which is insufficient to guarantee that the desired topic order can be achieved according to the constraints laid out in the problem description.

Here's a specific case where the program fails:

Consider the following input:

```
3 3
1 2
2 3
1 3
1 2 3
```

In this case:
- There are 3 blogs with references as follows: Blog 1 references Blog 2, Blog 2 references Blog 3, and Blog 3 references Blog 1. 
- The desired topics for these blogs are 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

According to the problem, Johnny should be able to write these blogs in an order that respects the references while producing the desired topics. 

However, the program will check if the topics of connected blogs are the same and will return `-1` because Blog 1 and Blog 3 both have the same desired topic (1). This is incorrect since it is possible for Johnny to write the blogs in the following order: 1, 2, 3. 

After writing Blog 1 (topic 1), Blog 2 can be written next (topic 2, as it references Blog 1), and finally Blog 3 can be written (topic 3, as it references Blog 2). 

Since the program incorrectly identifies a valid case as invalid, it demonstrates that the code does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description under certain conditions, leading to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
