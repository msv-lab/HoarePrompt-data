Functionality: ** The function accepts four parameters: an integer `n`, an integer `m`, a list of tuples `arr`, and a list `topic`. It checks if any pair of indices in `arr` corresponds to the same topic in `topic` when `m` is greater than 0, returning -1 if found. If `m` is 0, the function does not perform the check and directly returns a string of numbers from 1 to `n`, joined by spaces. If `m` is less than 1, the function behaves as if `m` is 0, returning the same string of numbers. **
