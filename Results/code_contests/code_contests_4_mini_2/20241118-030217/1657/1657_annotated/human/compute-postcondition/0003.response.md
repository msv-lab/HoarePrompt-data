Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 0, `arr` is a list containing at least one pair, and `a` is the first element while `b` is the second element of the first pair in `arr`. If the elements at indices `a - 1` and `b - 1` in the `topic` list are equal, the function returns -1. If they are not equal, the function does not return any value.***
