Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 0, `arr` is a list containing at least two pairs, `a` is the first element of the second pair in `arr`, and `b` is the second element of the second pair in `arr`. If `topic[a - 1]` is equal to `topic[b - 1]`, the function returns -1; otherwise, the function does not return anything, and the state of the program remains unchanged.***
