Output State: **If `m` is greater than 0, the loop will iterate through each pair in `arr`, checking if the topics of blogs `a` and `b` are the same. If they are the same for any pair, the function will return -1. If `m` is 0, the loop does not execute, and no return occurs, leaving the state unchanged with `n` as a positive integer and `m` as 0. In summary, if `m` is at least 1, the loop checks pairs in `arr`, and if any topics are equal, the return value is -1; otherwise, the state remains unchanged after the loop. If `m` is 0, the loop does not execute, and no return occurs.**
