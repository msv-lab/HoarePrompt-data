The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `arr`, and `topic`. 

- `n` is a positive integer representing the number of blogs.
- `m` is a non-negative integer representing the number of references.
- `arr` is a list of pairs of integers, where each pair (a, b) represents a bidirectional reference between blogs a and b.
- `topic` is a list of integers, where each integer t_i denotes the desired topic number for the i-th blog.

After executing the function body, the behavior is defined by two cases:

**Case 1:** 
- If `m` is greater than 0, the function checks the pairs in `arr` to see if any blogs `a` and `b` share the same topic. If any pair has the same topic, the function returns -1. If `m` is 0, no checks are performed, and the state remains unchanged with `n` as a positive integer and `m` as 0.

**Case 2:** 
- If the above condition is not met (i.e., no equal topics were found), the function returns a string of numbers from 1 to `n`, joined by spaces.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept the parameters representing blogs and their topics, and based on the references checked, it either returns -1 if any topics match or a string of numbers from 1 to `n` if they do not. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `arr`, and `topic`. It returns -1 if any pair of blogs has the same topic when `m` is greater than 0; otherwise, it returns a string of numbers from 1 to n joined by spaces if `m` is 0 or no topics match.**
