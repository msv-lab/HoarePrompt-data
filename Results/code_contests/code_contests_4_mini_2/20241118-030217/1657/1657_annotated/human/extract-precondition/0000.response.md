Precondition: **n is a positive integer representing the number of blogs (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^5), m is a non-negative integer representing the number of references (0 ≤ m ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^5), arr is a list of pairs of integers where each pair (a, b) represents a bidirectional reference between blogs a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ n and a ≠ b), and topic is a list of integers where each integer t_i denotes the desired topic number for the i-th blog (1 ≤ t_i ≤ n).**
