The function accepts a 2D list (surface) of 8 strings and two integers (x, y) representing coordinates. It modifies the surface by setting the value at the specified coordinates to 0 and recursively checks horizontally and vertically for neighboring truthy values (non-zero) within a range of 3 units. If found, it recursively calls itself with the new coordinates until no more truthy neighboring values exist. The function does not return a value.
