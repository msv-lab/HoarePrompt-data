To determine the necessary adjustments to the state for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the provided information step by step.

1. **Understanding the Loop Range**: The loop is set to iterate with `i` ranging from `start` to `end`. The loop will execute as long as `start` is less than `end`.

2. **Current State**: 
   - `surface` is a list of 8 strings.
   - `start` is defined and less than `end`.
   - `end` can either be `x + 4` (if `x + 4 < 8`) or `8` (if `x + 4 >= 8`).

3. **Focus on `start` and `end`**: For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `start` is still less than `end` after the current iteration. If `start` is at its maximum allowable value (which is `end - 1`), the loop cannot continue.

4. **Adjusting the State**: 
   - After the last iteration, if `i` was equal to `end - 1`, the next value of `i` would be `end`, which would not satisfy the loop condition since `start` would no longer be less than `end`.
   - Consequently, we must increase `end` to allow one more iteration (which implies adjusting `start` accordingly).

5. **Determining the Value of `end`**: 
   - If `end` is currently `x + 4` and `x + 4 < 8`, then `end` can be increased up to `8` as per the loop condition.
   - If `end` is already `8`, then `start` must be increased (if not already at maximum).

Based on this analysis, the adjustments needed would be:

- If the last value of `i` was `end - 1`, we need to set `start` to `end` and adjust `end` to `8` (if it was previously `x + 4`).

Thus, the adjusted state would reflect `start` being equal to `end`, which allows the loop to execute one more time, provided `end` is also adjusted to allow it.

State: **`surface` is a list of 8 strings, `start` is equal to `end`, `end` is 8**
