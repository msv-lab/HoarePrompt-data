The function `func_1(surface, i, y)` is called with the arguments `surface`, `i`, and `y`. However, the values of `i` and `y` are not provided in the initial state. The variable `surface` remains unchanged as a list of 8 strings. There are no specific calculations or assignments occurring in this line of code, and it does not return any value. Thus, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables involved.

Output State: **`surface` is a list of 8 strings, `start` is equal to `end`, `end` is 8, and the function `func_1` is called with `surface`, `i`, and `y`.**
