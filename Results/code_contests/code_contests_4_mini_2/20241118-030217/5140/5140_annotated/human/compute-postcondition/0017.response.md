To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the conditions under which `start` and `end` are defined.

1. **Understanding `start`:**
   - `start` is defined as `y - 3` if `y - 3 > 0`, otherwise it is `0`. 
   - For the loop to execute, `start` must be less than `end`. 

2. **Understanding `end`:**
   - `end` is defined as `y + 4` if `y + 4 < 8`, otherwise it is `8`. 

3. **Determining the conditions for the execution of the loop:**
   - For `start` to be greater than `0`, we need `y - 3 > 0`, which implies `y > 3`.
   - For `end` to be less than `8`, we need `y + 4 < 8`, which implies `y < 4`.
   - However, both conditions cannot be satisfied simultaneously. Therefore, we must analyze `y` values separately.

   - If `y <= 3`, then `start` will be `0` and `end` will be `y + 4`, which varies based on `y`.
     - For example, if `y = 3`, then `start = 0` and `end = 7`. The loop will execute from `0` to `7`.
     - If `y < 3`, then `end` will still be less than `8`, and the loop will execute.

   - If `y > 3`, then `start` will be `y - 3` and `end` will be `8`. The loop will execute from `y - 3` to `8`.

4. **Conclusion for loop execution:**
   - The loop can execute when `start < end`. The loop will always execute if `y` is `3` or less, as start will be `0` and end will be greater than `0`.
   - If `y` is `4` or more, `start` will be `y - 3` and `end` will be `8`, and the loop will execute provided `y` is at least `4`.

Based on this analysis, we can summarize the necessary state adjustments:

State: **`start` is `0`, `end` is `y + 4` if `y < 4` else `8`, `y` is less than or equal to `4` for loop execution**.
