The function `func_1(surface, x, i)` is called, but without the implementation details of `func_1`, we cannot determine how it impacts the variables or what values it might return. The variables `start`, `end`, and `y` remain unchanged in this context. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of these variables.

Output State: **`start` is 0, `end` is `y + 5`, `y` is between 1 and 4, and the function `func_1(surface, x, i)` is called.**
