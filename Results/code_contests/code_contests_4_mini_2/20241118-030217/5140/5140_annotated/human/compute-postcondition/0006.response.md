Postcondition: ***`surface` is a list of 8 strings, `start` is defined and less than `end`, where `end` is either `x + 4` (if `x + 4 < 8`) or `8` (if `x + 4 >= 8`). If the element at `surface[y][i]` is truthy, the function `func_1` is called with parameters `surface`, `i`, and `y`. If `surface[y][i]` is falsy, no action is taken.***
