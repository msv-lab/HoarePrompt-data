The variable `end` is assigned the value of `x + 4`. The value of `x + 4` is compared to `8`. If `x + 4` is less than `8`, `end` will be that value; otherwise, `end` will be `8`. The value of `x` is not specified, so the exact value of `end` cannot be determined precisely. 

However, we can derive the possible scenarios:
- If `x` is less than `4`, then `x + 4` will be less than `8`, and thus `end` will be equal to `x + 4`.
- If `x` is `4` or greater, then `x + 4` will be `8` or more, meaning `end` will be `8`.

Therefore, the output state can be described as follows, depending on the value of `x`:

Output State: **`surface` is a list of 8 strings; `end` is either `x + 4` (if `x + 4 < 8`) or `8` (if `x + 4 >= 8`).**
