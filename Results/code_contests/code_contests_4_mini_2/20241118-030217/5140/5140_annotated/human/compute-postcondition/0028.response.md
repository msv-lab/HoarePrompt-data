Output State: **`start` is `0`, `end` is `y + 4` if `y` is less than 4 and `end` is `8` if `y` is greater than or equal to 4. If `y` is less than `-3`, the loop does not execute, and `start` is `0`, `end` is `8`. If `y` is `-3`, `start` is `0` and `end` is `4`, and the loop executes from `0` to `4`. If `y` is `4` or greater, `start` is `0` and `end` is `8`, and the loop executes from `0` to `8`. During each iteration, if `surface[i][x]` is true, `func_1(surface, x, i)` is executed; otherwise, no action is taken.**
