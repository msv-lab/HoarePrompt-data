The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `surface`, `x`, and `y`. The parameter `surface` is a list containing 8 strings, with each string consisting of 8 characters that are either '0' or '1', representing the initial state of the plane. The parameters `x` and `y` are integers that represent the coordinates of the bomb to be exploded, with the constraints that both `x` and `y` are between 1 and 8, inclusive. 

The function does not explicitly return output based on the provided information; therefore, we need to deduce the functionality based on the input parameters. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of 8 strings representing the plane's initial state and two integers representing the coordinates of a bomb, potentially modifying the state based on the bomb's explosion but does not explicitly return a value.**
