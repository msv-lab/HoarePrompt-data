The function `func_1(surface, x, i)` is called, but there are no changes to the state of the variables `start`, `end`, or `y` directly from this code snippet. The execution of the function could potentially affect other variables or states, but based on the provided initial state, we do not know the specific behavior of `func_1`. Therefore, the output state reflects the initial values of the variables without any changes.

Output State: **`start` is 0, `end` is `y + 4` if `y < 4` else `8`, `y` is less than or equal to `4`, and the element at position `surface[i][x]` is true.**
