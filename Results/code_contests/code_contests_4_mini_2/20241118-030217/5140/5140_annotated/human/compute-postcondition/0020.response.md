Postcondition: ***`start` is `0`, `end` is `y + 4` if `y < 4` else `8`, and `y` is less than or equal to `4`. If the element at position `surface[i][x]` is true, then `func_1(surface, x, i)` is executed. If the element at `surface[i][x]` is false, no action is taken, and the state of the program remains unchanged.***
