The function `func_1(surface, x, i)` is called, but without any further context about what `func_1` does, we can only analyze the initial state. The values of `start`, `end`, and `y` are not changed by this line of code since it simply calls the function.

Given that `y` is less than `4` and is increased by `1`, we know that `y` will change from its current value (which is less than `4`) to `y + 1`. 

The value of `end` is calculated based on the condition that `y < 4`, which means `end` will be `y + 4 + 1` (as `y` is incremented). 

However, we do not have specific values for `surface`, `x`, or `i`, nor do we know the implementation details of `func_1`, so we cannot determine any changes in them.

The output will reflect the state of `start`, `end`, and `y` after the function call, with `y` incremented by `1`.

Output State: **`start` is 0, `end` is `y + 4`, `y` is less than 4 and increased by 1**
