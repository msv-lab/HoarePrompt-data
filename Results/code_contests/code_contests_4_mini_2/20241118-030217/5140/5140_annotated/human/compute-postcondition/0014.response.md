Output State: **`surface` is a list of 8 strings. If `start` is less than `end`, then the loop iterates from `start` to `end - 1`. For each iteration, if `surface[y][i]` is truthy, `func_1` is called with `surface`, `i`, and `y`. If `start` is equal to or greater than `end`, the loop does not execute, and no calls to `func_1` are made. In cases where `end` is calculated as `x + 4` (if `x + 4 < 8`) or as `8` (if `x + 4 >= 8`), if `x` is less than or equal to `4`, the loop will execute; otherwise, it won't. The values of `start`, `end`, and the elements of `surface` remain unchanged if the loop does not execute.**
