To determine the output state, we need to analyze the given initial state and the provided code snippet.

The initial state indicates that `start` is defined as `y - 3` when `y - 3 > 0`, otherwise, it is `0`. 

Now, let's consider the code snippet:
```
end = y + 4 if y + 4 < 8 else 8
```

This line assigns a value to `end` based on the value of `y`:
- If `y + 4` is less than `8`, then `end` will be assigned the value of `y + 4`.
- If `y + 4` is greater than or equal to `8`, then `end` will be assigned the value `8`.

Since the value of `y` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact values of `end` or `start`. Therefore, we can only describe the relationships and conditions based on the existing variables.

The output state will summarize the conditions of `start` and `end` based on the value of `y`.

Output State: **`start` is `y - 3` if `y - 3 > 0` else `0`; `end` is `y + 4` if `y + 4 < 8` else `8`**
