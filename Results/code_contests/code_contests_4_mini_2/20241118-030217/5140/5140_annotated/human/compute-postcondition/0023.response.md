Postcondition: ***`start` is 0, `end` is `y + 4` if `y` is less than 4 (which will be less than or equal to 8 after being increased by 1), and `y` is increased by 1. If `surface[i][x]` is true, `func_1(surface, x, i)` is executed, indicating that some condition related to the surface has been met; otherwise, no action is taken.***
