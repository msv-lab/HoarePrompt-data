The function `func_1(surface, i, y)` is called, but without the specific implementation of `func_1`, we cannot determine how it affects the state of the variables. The variables involved are `surface`, `i`, and `y`, but their values or effects after the function call are unknown. Therefore, the output state is that the function is invoked with the current values of the variables.

Output State: **`surface` is a list of 8 strings, `start` is equal to 8, `end` is greater than 8, and `func_1` is called with `surface`, `i`, and `y`.**
