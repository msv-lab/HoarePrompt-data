According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the value of `i` is less than `end`. At the end of the last iteration, `start` is equal to `end`, which implies that the loop has already completed its iterations since `i` would equal `end` on the last iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `start` would need to be less than `end`, which means `start` should be adjusted to `end`, and `end` should be adjusted to be greater than `end`.

Since `start` is equal to `end`, it indicates that there are currently no iterations left to perform. To enable the loop to execute again, the states need to be modified accordingly.

State: **`surface` is a list of 8 strings, `start` is equal to 8, `end` is greater than 8**
