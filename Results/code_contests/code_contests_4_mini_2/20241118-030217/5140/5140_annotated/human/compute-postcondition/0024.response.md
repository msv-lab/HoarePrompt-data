According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the values of `start`, `end`, and `i`. The loop will iterate from `start` to `end - 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `start` is 0, `end` is `y + 4` (which, given the condition that `y` is less than 4, can be at most 8), and `y` has been increased by 1. This means that `y` could be at least 0 and at most 3 at the end of the last iteration, leading to possible values of `end` being between 4 and 8.

Now, since `i` starts at `start` and increments up to `end - 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `end - 1`. The last value of `i` in the previous iteration is `end - 1`, which means the loop has just finished its last valid iteration. Therefore, to allow for one more iteration, `end` must be increased by at least 1.

Thus, we need to adjust the states as follows:
1. `end` should be adjusted to be greater than `y + 4` (i.e., `y + 5`).
2. The values of `start` and `y` do not necessarily need to change for the loop to execute again, but we can assume `y` has already increased by 1 and remains in the range of 1 to 4.

State: **`start` is 0, `end` is `y + 5`, `y` is between 1 and 4**
