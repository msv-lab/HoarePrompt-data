To determine the necessary states for the for loop to execute, we need to analyze the given information. The loop iterates over a range defined by `start` and `end`. 

1. The variable `start` must be defined; it should be less than `end` for the loop to execute.
2. The variable `end` is based on the value of `x`. Depending on whether `x + 4` is less than 8 or not, `end` will be set to either `x + 4` or `8`.
3. Since `surface` is a list of 8 strings, it implies that valid indices for `surface` range from 0 to 7.

For the loop to execute:
- We need `start` to be less than `end`.
- If `x + 4 < 8`, then `end` is `x + 4`, and `start` must be less than `x + 4`.
- If `x + 4 >= 8`, then `end` is `8`, and `start` must be less than `8`.

Thus, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `start` has to be defined and should be less than `end`.
- Depending on the value of `x`, we need to ensure that `end` is valid (either `x + 4` or `8`).

State: **`surface` is a list of 8 strings, `start` is defined and less than `end`, `end` is either `x + 4` (if `x + 4 < 8`) or `8` (if `x + 4 >= 8`)**
