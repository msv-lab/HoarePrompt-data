To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the code closely and see if it adheres to the requirements outlined in the problem.

### Program Analysis:
1. The function `func_1(surface, x, y)` is designed to simulate the explosion of bombs on a grid. It marks the bomb at the coordinates `(x, y)` as exploded (setting it to `0`) and then recursively checks the adjacent squares (up to 3 squares away) horizontally and vertically to trigger any adjacent bombs.
   
2. The input is read correctly, with the `surface` being constructed as an 8x8 grid of integers based on the bomb placements provided in the input. 

3. The coordinates for the bomb that explodes first are adjusted from 1-based to 0-based indexing, which is correct for Python list indexing.

4. The output format is also adhered to, where each dataset's result is prefixed with "Data x:".

### Potential Issues:
- The logic for determining the range of indices in the `func_1` function may lead to incorrect behavior. When adjusting the `start` and `end` values for both horizontal and vertical bomb checks, there are potential edge cases:
    - If a bomb is located on the edge (e.g., at `(1,1)`, `(1,8)`, `(8,1)`, or `(8,8)`), the explosion might not correctly propagate to the expected adjacent squares because the code uses `x - 3` and `x + 4`, which can result in indices that are out of bounds or not correctly covering all necessary squares.
    
### Example of Failure Case:
- Consider a bomb placed at `(1, 1)`, which initially explodes:
    - The explosion should affect `(0,1)`, `(1,0)`, `(1,2)`, and `(2,1)`. However, in the current implementation, the explosion may fail to trigger correctly for bombs in those affected squares due to incorrect index calculations.

### Conclusion:
Given the potential issues and the fact that the explosion propagation may not cover all edge cases correctly, we can conclude that the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**.
