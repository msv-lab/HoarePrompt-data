To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the behavior of the program with respect to the rules for bomb explosions described in the problem.

### Problem Analysis
1. The "plane" is represented as an 8x8 grid where:
   - '1' indicates the presence of a bomb.
   - '0' indicates an empty square.
   
2. When a bomb explodes, it affects the squares directly above, below, to the left, and to the right of it, causing any bombs in those squares to explode in turn, leading to a chain reaction.

3. The input specifies the initial state of the grid, as well as the coordinates (X, Y) of the first bomb to explode.

### Code Analysis
The provided code appears to:
- Read the number of datasets.
- For each dataset, read the grid and the coordinates of the bomb to explode.
- Perform a recursive function `func_1` that simulates the explosion and chain reaction.

### Issues in the Code
1. **Incorrect Bomb Removal**: The line `surface[y][x] = 0` marks the bomb at the initial location as exploded (removes it). However, when calculating the blast area, the code incorrectly determines the range:
   - The `start` and `end` indices for the ranges might lead to accessing out-of-bounds areas of the array if not handled properly. Specifically:
     - The `start` index calculation uses `x - 3` or `y - 3`, which can lead to negative indices when `x` or `y` is less than 3, causing unintended behavior.
     - The explosion should affect the direct neighbors: `surface[y][x-1]`, `surface[y][x+1]`, `surface[y-1][x]`, and `surface[y+1][x]`, rather than a larger range.
   
2. **Incorrect Chain Reaction Logic**: The recursive calls within `func_1` may not properly handle all nearby bombs. The way the code is structured, it seems to affect more squares than intended, leading to incorrect explosion behavior:
   - The checks for whether to recursively call `func_1` on adjacent squares (`if surface[y][i]` or `if surface[i][x]`) may not work as intended since it doesn't ensure that it is looking within the bounds of the plane.

### Example of Failure
If we take a simple example:
```
Input:
1

00000000
00001000
00000000
00000000
00000000
00000000
00000000
00000000
2
2
```
Expected Output:
```
Data 1:
00000000
00000000
00000000
00000000
00000000
00000000
00000000
00000000
```
However, due to the flawed logic, the program might not produce the correct output since it does not properly handle the explosion chain reaction.

### Conclusion
Given the identified issues, the program does not correctly implement the bomb explosion logic as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
