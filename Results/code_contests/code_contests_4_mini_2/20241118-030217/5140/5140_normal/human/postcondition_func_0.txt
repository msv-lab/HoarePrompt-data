The function accepts a 2D list `surface` of size 8x8 containing integers (0 or 1) and two integer parameters `x` and `y`, which represent the coordinates of a bomb. It sets the value at the coordinates (y, x) to 0, simulating an explosion effect. The function then checks the horizontal and vertical lines from the bomb's location to trigger recursive calls for any adjacent cells (within a range of 3 cells in both directions) that contain a 1, effectively propagating the explosion effect throughout connected cells. If a cell is 0, it does not trigger further explosions. The function does not handle cases where the coordinates are out of bounds (i.e., less than 0 or greater than 7) since the input parameters are expected to be within the range of 1 to 8, leading to potential errors if used incorrectly.
