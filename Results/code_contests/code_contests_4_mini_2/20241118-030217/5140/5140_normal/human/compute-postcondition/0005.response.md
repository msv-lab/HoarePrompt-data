The function `func_1(surface, i, y)` is called, which will likely perform operations based on the values of `surface`, `i`, and `y`. The initial state indicates that `surface` is a list of 8 lists containing integers (0 or 1), `x` and `y` are integers, `start` is either `x - 3` or `0`, `end` is either `x + 4` or `8`, and `i` is equal to `start`. Additionally, it is given that the value at `surface[y][i]` is 1.

Since the function is called but the specific operations within `func_1` are not provided, we cannot determine any changes to `surface`, `i`, or `y`. The state of the variables remains unchanged from their initial values.

Output State: **`surface` is a list of 8 lists containing integers (0 or 1), `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `start` is either `x - 3` or `0`, `end` is either `x + 4` or `8`, `i` is equal to `start`, and the value at `surface[y][i]` is 1.**
