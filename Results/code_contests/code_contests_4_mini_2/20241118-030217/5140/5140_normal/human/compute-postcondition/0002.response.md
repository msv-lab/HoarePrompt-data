The value of `end` is assigned based on the condition `x + 4 < 8`. If `x + 4` is less than 8, then `end` will be `x + 4`; otherwise, it will be assigned the value 8. The variables `surface`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state depends on the value of `x`.

If `x + 4 < 8`, then `end` is `x + 4`.
If `x + 4 >= 8`, then `end` is 8.

Since we have no specific value for `x`, we cannot determine the exact value of `end`, but we can express the possible outcomes.

Output State: **`surface` is a list of 8 lists containing integers (0 or 1), `x` and `y` are integers, `start` is either `x - 3` or `0`, and `end` is either `x + 4 or 8 depending on the value of x.**
