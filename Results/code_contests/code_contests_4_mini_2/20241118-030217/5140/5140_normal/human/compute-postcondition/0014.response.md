Output State: **`surface` is a list of 8 lists containing integers (0 or 1), `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `start` is either `x - 3` or `0`, `end` is either `x + 4` or `8`, and `i` will take values from `start` to `end - 1`. If `start` is greater than or equal to `end`, the loop does not execute, and no calls to `func_1` are made. If `surface[y][i]` is 1 for any `i` in the range, then `func_1(surface, i, y)` will be executed for those indices; otherwise, it will not be called. This means that if `surface[y][i]` is 0 for all valid `i`, then no function calls occur during the loop.**
