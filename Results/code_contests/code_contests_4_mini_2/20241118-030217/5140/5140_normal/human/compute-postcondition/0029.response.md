The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `surface`, `x`, and `y`. The parameter `surface` is a list containing 8 lists, each with 8 integers (either 0 or 1), representing a plane. The parameters `x` and `y` are integers that represent the coordinates of the first bomb to explode, with the constraints that both `x` and `y` must be between 1 and 8. 

The function processes these inputs and returns different outputs based on the state of the `surface` and the coordinates provided. The exact output is not specified, but it can be inferred that the function is likely simulating some form of explosion or effect based on the bomb's coordinates on the surface.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `surface`, which is a list of 8 lists each containing 8 integers (0 or 1), and two integer parameters `x` and `y` representing coordinates of a bomb (1 <= x <= 8, 1 <= y <= 8). The function processes these inputs to simulate an explosion effect on the surface.**
