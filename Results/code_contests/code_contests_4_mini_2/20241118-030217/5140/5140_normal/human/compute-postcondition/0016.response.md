To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we need to analyze the values involved.

Given:
- `surface` is a list of 8 lists containing integers (0 or 1).
- `x` is an integer (value unknown).
- `y` is an integer (value unknown).
- `start` is calculated as `y - 3` if `y - 3 > 0` else `0`.

Now, the code snippet:
```
end = y + 4 if y + 4 < 8 else 8
```

We will evaluate the effect of this code on the program state:

1. The code checks if `y + 4` is less than 8.
2. If `y + 4 < 8` is true, `end` will be assigned the value of `y + 4`.
3. If `y + 4 >= 8` is true, `end` will be assigned the value of `8`.

Since the values of `y` are unknown, we can express the possible values of `end` based on `y`:
- If `y + 4 < 8`, then `end` is `y + 4`.
- If `y + 4 >= 8`, then `end` is `8`.

Thus, the output state will depend on the value of `y`:

Output State: **`surface` is a list of 8 lists containing integers (0 or 1), `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `start` is either `y - 3` or `0`, and `end` is either `y + 4` or `8` depending on the value of `y.**
