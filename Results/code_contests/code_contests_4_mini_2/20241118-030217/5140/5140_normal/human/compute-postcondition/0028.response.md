Output State: **`surface` is a list of 8 lists containing integers (0 or 1), `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `start` is either `y - 3` (if `y` is at least 3) or `0`, and `end` is either `y + 4` (if `y + 4` is less than or equal to 8) or `8`. The variable `i` will iterate from `start` to `end - 1`. If `y` is less than 3, the loop will start from 0. If `y` is greater than or equal to 4, the loop will include indices up to `y + 4` or 8, whichever is smaller. If `surface[i][x]` is equal to 1, `func_1` will be called with parameters `surface`, `x`, and `i`. If `surface[i][x]` is 0, no action is taken. If `start` is greater than or equal to `end`, the loop does not execute, and no calls to `func_1` occur. In cases where `surface` has no valid rows (if `y` leads to indices outside the range of 0 to 7), the loop also does not execute, and `surface`, `x`, `y`, `start`, and `end` remain unchanged.**
