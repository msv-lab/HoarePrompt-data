Postcondition: ***`surface` is a list of 8 lists containing integers (0 or 1), `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `start` is either `y - 3` or `0`, `end` is either `y + 4` or `8`, and `i` is equal to `start`. If the value of `surface[i][x]` is true (1), then the function `func_1` is called with the parameters `surface`, `x`, and `i`. If `surface[i][x]` is false (0), no action is taken, and the program proceeds without calling `func_1`.***
