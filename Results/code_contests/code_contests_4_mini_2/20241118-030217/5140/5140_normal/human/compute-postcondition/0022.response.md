The function `func_1` is called with the parameters `surface`, `x`, and `i`. The values of `surface`, `x`, and `i` are not altered by this line of code; they are merely passed to the function. As such, the output state will reflect the current values of these variables without any modification or return value being mentioned, as no return is taking place in this line.

Output State: **`surface` is a list of 8 lists containing integers (0 or 1), `x` is an integer, `i` is equal to `start + 1**
