Postcondition: ***`surface` is a list of 8 lists containing integers (0 or 1), `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `start` is either `x - 3` or `0`, `end` is either `x + 4` or `8`, and `i` is equal to `start`. If the value at `surface[y][i]` is 1, then `func_1(surface, i, y)` is executed. If `surface[y][i]` is 0, no action is taken.***
