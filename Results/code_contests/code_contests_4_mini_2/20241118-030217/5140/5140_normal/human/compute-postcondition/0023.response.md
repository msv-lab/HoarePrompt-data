Postcondition: ***`surface` is a list of 8 lists containing integers (0 or 1), `x` is an integer, and `i` is equal to `start + 1`. If `surface[i][x]` evaluates to true (i.e., `surface[i][x]` is 1), then `func_1(surface, x, i)` is executed. If `surface[i][x]` is false (i.e., `surface[i][x]` is 0), then no action is taken. The values of `surface`, `x`, and `i` remain unchanged after the execution of the program fragment.***
