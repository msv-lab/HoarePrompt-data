Postcondition: ***`surface` is a list of 8 lists containing integers (0 or 1), `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `start` is either `x - 3` or `0`, `end` is either `x + 4` or `8`, and `i` is equal to `start + 2`. If `surface[y][i]` evaluates to true (i.e., it is 1), the function `func_1` is called with `surface`, `i`, and `y`. If `surface[y][i]` evaluates to false (i.e., it is 0), then `func_1` is not called. This structure ensures that the function is only executed when the specified condition on the `surface` list is met.***
