To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the provided information. 

1. The loop iterates over a range defined by `start` and `end`. The current value of `i` is `start + 2`, which means that for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `end`. 

2. Since `i` is currently `start + 2`, this indicates that for the next iteration, `i` will increment. Thus, it will become `start + 3` in the next iteration.

3. We need to ensure that `start + 3` is still less than `end` for the loop to continue executing.

4. The condition regarding `surface[i][x]` indicates that it is evaluated during each iteration. However, as per the provided state, we know that it was evaluated in the previous iteration, but without additional context on the values of `surface`, `x`, and `i`, we cannot make specific changes to those states based on the loop execution.

Thus, the only state that requires adjustment to allow the loop to execute one more time is the value of `i`, which should be `start + 3`. Since `i` is dependent on the range defined by `start` and `end`, we will need to ensure that `end` is greater than `start + 3`.

Therefore, the adjusted state would be:

State: **`surface` is a list of 8 lists containing integers (0 or 1), `x` is an integer, `i` is equal to `start + 3`**
