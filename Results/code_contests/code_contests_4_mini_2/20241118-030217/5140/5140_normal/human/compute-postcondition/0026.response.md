Postcondition: ***`surface` is a list of 8 lists containing integers (0 or 1), `x` is an integer, and `i` is equal to `start + 2`. If `surface[i][x]` evaluates to True (1), the function `func_1` is called with `surface`, `x`, and `i` as parameters. If `surface[i][x]` evaluates to False (0), no action is taken and the function is not called.***
