To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the code and its functionality in relation to the expected behavior outlined in the problem description.

### Problem Description Analysis
The task requires simulating a chain reaction of bomb explosions on an 8x8 grid. Each bomb (represented by '1') affects the three squares directly above, below, left, and right of it. When a bomb explodes, it should also trigger any bombs in those affected squares to explode, continuing the chain reaction. The coordinates for the first bomb to explode are provided in a 1-based index format.

### Code Analysis
The provided code reads the grid state and the bomb's coordinates, then invokes the `func_1` function to simulate the explosion:

1. The `func_1` function sets the bomb at the given coordinates to '0', indicating it has exploded.
2. It then checks horizontally and vertically within a range of 3 squares from the bomb's location to find other bombs (indicated by '1') and recursively calls itself for each bomb found to continue the chain reaction.
3. The code appears to handle the explosion propagation correctly within the grid's bounds.

### Edge Cases Consideration
However, there are potential issues:
- The code does not check for bounds when calculating `start` and `end` indices for the explosion range. If the bomb is located near the edges or corners of the grid, the calculations could lead to out-of-bounds access, which would cause an error.
- The recursive calls to `func_1` do not have a condition to prevent infinite recursion due to a bomb being repeatedly triggered.

### Output Hints Analysis
The output hints describe the function's behavior, mentioning that it accepts a 2D list and checks for explosions within a range of 3 cells. It also indicates that the function does not handle out-of-bounds coordinates, which is a significant issue.

### Conclusion
The program does not handle cases where the bomb coordinates are at the edges correctly, as it may attempt to access indices that are out of bounds. This could lead to runtime errors or unexpected behavior, thus violating the problem's requirement to handle all possible inputs correctly.

Therefore, based on the analysis of both the code and the problem description, the conclusion is:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to correctly handle edge cases where bombs are located near the edges of the grid, leading to potential out-of-bounds errors.
