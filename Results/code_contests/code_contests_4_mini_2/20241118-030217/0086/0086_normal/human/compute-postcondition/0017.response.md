Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty input string, `i` is the next index in `s`. If the `stack` is empty or the character at index `i` in `s` is 'S', then the character `s[i]` is appended to `stack`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `stack` is not empty and `s[i]` is not 'S', the state of `stack` remains unchanged, and the loop proceeds to the next iteration.***
