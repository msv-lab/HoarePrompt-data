Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty input string. If the last character of `stack` is 'S', it is removed from `stack`. Otherwise, 'T' (the character at index `i` of `s`) is appended to `stack`. In either case, if `stack` was originally empty or contained 'S', it will not contain 'S' after execution; if `stack` was not empty and did not contain 'S', it will have 'T' added to it.***
