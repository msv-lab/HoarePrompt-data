The `stack.pop()` operation removes the last element from the `stack`, which is currently 'S'. After this operation, the character 'S' will no longer be present in the `stack`. The state of `s` remains unchanged as the pop operation only affects the `stack`. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a non-empty input string, `stack` no longer contains 'S', and the last element of `stack` has been removed.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty input string, `stack` no longer contains 'S', and the last element of `stack` has been removed.**
