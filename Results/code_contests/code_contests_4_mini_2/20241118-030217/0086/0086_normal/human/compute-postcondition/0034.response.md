Functionality: ** The function accepts a string input consisting of characters 'S' and 'T'. It processes the string such that for each 'S' encountered, it is added to a stack, while each 'T' removes the last 'S' from the stack if one exists; otherwise, 'T' is added to the stack. After processing the entire string, the function prints the length of the stack, which represents the count of unmatched 'S' and 'T' characters. The function does not handle any input validation, so it can accept any string, including those without 'S' or 'T'.**
