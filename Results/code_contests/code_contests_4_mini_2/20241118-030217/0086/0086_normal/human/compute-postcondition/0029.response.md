Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty input string, `i` is the next index in `s`, and `stack` is a collection of characters. If `s[i]` is 'T' and the last element of `stack` is 'S', then 'S' is removed from `stack`. If `s[i]` is 'T' and the last element of `stack` is not 'S', the character 'T' is appended to `stack`. If `s[i]` is not 'T', the stack remains unchanged, and if the stack is empty or `s[i]` is 'S', `s[i]` is appended to `stack`. Additionally, if `s[i]` is neither 'T' nor 'S', `stack` remains unchanged, maintaining its previous state.
