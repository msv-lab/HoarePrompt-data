According to the code, the loop will execute again if the index `i` is less than the length of the string `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at a position which allows for the next iteration. Since `s` is a non-empty input string, its length is at least 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to increment `i` by 1. Thus, `i` needs to be adjusted. The length of `s` will remain the same. The loop will continue to process the characters in the string `s`.

State: **`s` is a non-empty input string, `i` is the next index in `s` (i + 1)**
