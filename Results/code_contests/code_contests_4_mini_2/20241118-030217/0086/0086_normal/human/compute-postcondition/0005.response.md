The command `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables do not change, but we skip the remainder of the current loop iteration. Therefore, the output state reflects that we are moving to the next iteration without any changes to the variables.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty input string; `stack` contains the character at index 0 of `s`; `i` is 0 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
