The variable `stack` is appended with the value of `s[i]`. The value of `s` is a non-empty string, and `i` represents a valid index in that string, so `s[i]` will have a specific character from `s`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a non-empty input string, `i` is the next index in `s`, and `stack` now includes the character `s[i]`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty input string, `i` is the next index in `s`, and `stack` now includes the character `s[i]`**
