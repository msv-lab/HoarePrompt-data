According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `s` using the index `i`. The loop continues until `i` is no longer less than the length of `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than the length of `s`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the next index in `s`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, which means it should be adjusted to the current value of `i + 1`. Additionally, since `s` is a non-empty input string, its length remains unchanged.

State: **`s` is a non-empty input string, `i` is the next index in `s`** (which will now be `i + 1`).
