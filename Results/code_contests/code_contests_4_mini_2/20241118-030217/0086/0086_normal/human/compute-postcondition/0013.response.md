Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty input string. If `s[i]` is 'T' and the last character of `stack` is 'S', 'S' is removed from `stack`. If `s[i]` is 'T' and the last character of `stack` is not 'S', 'T' is appended to `stack`. After execution, if `stack` was originally empty or contained 'S', it will not contain 'S'. If `stack` was not empty and did not contain 'S', 'T' will be added to it.***
