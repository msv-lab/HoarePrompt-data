The code appends the character at index `i` of string `s` (which is 'T') to the list `stack`. Since `stack` does not have 'S' as its last element before the execution of this code, the last element of `stack` remains unchanged after the execution. Therefore, the output state reflects that 'T' has been added to the stack.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty input string, `stack` now has 'T' appended to it, and the character at index `i` of `s` is 'T'**
