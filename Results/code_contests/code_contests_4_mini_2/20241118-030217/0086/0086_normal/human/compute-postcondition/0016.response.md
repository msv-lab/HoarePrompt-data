The `continue` statement does not change the values of the variables but causes the program to skip the rest of the current loop iteration and move to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state reflects that the program continues without modifying the state of `s` or `i`. 

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty input string, `i` is the next index in `s`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
