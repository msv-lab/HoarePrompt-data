Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty input string, `i` is the next index in `s`, and `stack` is a collection of characters. If the last element of `stack` is 'S', it is removed from `stack`. If `stack` is empty or `s[i]` is 'S', then `s[i]` is appended to `stack`. If `stack` is not empty and `s[i]` is not 'S', `stack` remains unchanged.***
