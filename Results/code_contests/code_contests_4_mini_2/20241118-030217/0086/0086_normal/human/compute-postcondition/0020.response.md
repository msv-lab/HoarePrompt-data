Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty input string, `i` is the next index in `s`, and the state of `stack` depends on the last character. If the last character in `stack` is 'S', it is removed from `stack`. If the last character is not 'S', then if `stack` is empty or `s[i]` is 'S', the character `s[i]` is appended to `stack`. Otherwise, if `stack` is not empty and `s[i]` is not 'S', the state of `stack` remains unchanged.***
