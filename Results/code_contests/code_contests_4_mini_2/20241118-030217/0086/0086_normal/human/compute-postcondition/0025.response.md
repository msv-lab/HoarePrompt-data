Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty input string, `i` is the next index in `s`, and if the `stack` is empty or the character at index `i` of `s` is 'S', then `s[i]` is appended to `stack` and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `stack` is not empty and `s[i]` is not 'S', then `stack` remains unchanged, but the condition for continuing to the next iteration does not hold.***
