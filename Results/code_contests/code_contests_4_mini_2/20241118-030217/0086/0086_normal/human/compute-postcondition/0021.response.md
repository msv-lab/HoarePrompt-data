Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty input string and `i` is the next index in `s`. If `s[i]` is 'T' and the last character in `stack` is 'S', then the last character is removed from `stack`. If `s[i]` is 'T' and the last character in `stack` is not 'S', then `s[i]` is appended to `stack` if the `stack` is empty or if `s[i]` is 'S'. If `s[i]` is 'T' and `stack` is not empty and `s[i]` is not 'S', then the state of `stack` remains unchanged. If `s[i]` is 'S', the character `s[i]` is appended to `stack`, and the loop continues to the next iteration.***
