Postcondition: ***`X` is a string of even length consisting of an equal number of characters 'S' and 'T', `s` has a length greater than 0, `stack` is an empty list or contains 'S', `i` is 0, the character at index `i` of `s` is 'T', and the stack is either empty or contains characters other than 'S' or has 'T' at the top (i.e., `stack[-1]` is not 'S'). The state of `stack` remains unchanged.***
