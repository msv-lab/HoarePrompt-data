Postcondition: ***`X` is a string of even length consisting of an equal number of characters 'S' and 'T', `s` has a length greater than 0, `i` is 1. If `stack` is empty or `s[i]` is 'S', then `s[1]` is appended to `stack`, which can be either 'S' or 'T', and the loop continues. If `stack` was not empty and did not contain 'S' at the top, 'T' would be appended to `stack`. The state of `stack` reflects these operations accordingly.***
