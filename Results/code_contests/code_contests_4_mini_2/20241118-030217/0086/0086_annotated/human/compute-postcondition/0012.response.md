Postcondition: ***`X` is a string of even length consisting of an equal number of characters 'S' and 'T', `s` has a length greater than 0, `stack` remains unchanged if it was empty or contains 'S'. If `stack` contains 'S' at the top, it is popped off; otherwise, `stack` will contain 'T' after appending the character at index `i` of `s`, which is 'T'.***
