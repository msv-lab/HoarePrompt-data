Functionality: ** The function accepts a string input consisting of characters 'S' and 'T'. It uses a stack to keep track of 'S' characters, and for each 'T' character encountered, it removes the most recent 'S' character from the stack if one exists. At the end of the execution, it prints the length of the stack, which represents the number of unmatched 'S' characters. If the input string is empty, the function will print 0, as there are no characters to process. The function does not return any value. **
