The statement `continue` does not change the values of any variables, but it instructs the program to skip the current iteration of the loop and continue with the next iteration. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged in terms of variable values.

Output State: **`X` is a string of even length consisting of an equal number of characters 'S' and 'T', `s` has a length greater than 0, `stack` contains 'S', `i` is 0 and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
