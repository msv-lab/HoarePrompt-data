Postcondition: ***`X` is a string of even length consisting of an equal number of characters 'S' and 'T', `s` has a length greater than 0, and `i` is 1. If the top element of `stack` is 'S', it is removed from the stack. Otherwise, `s[1]` (which is either 'S' or 'T') is appended to `stack`. In either case, the state of `stack` reflects these operations accordingly, ensuring that if `stack` was not empty and the top element was not 'S', 'T' is added to the stack. The conditions of the input variables are preserved throughout the execution.***
