Postcondition: ***`X` is a string of even length consisting of an equal number of characters 'S' and 'T', `s` has a length greater than 0, and `i` is 1. If `s[i]` is 'T' and the top element of `stack` is 'S', then that 'S' is removed from the stack. If `s[i]` is 'T' and the top element of `stack` is not 'S', then `s[i]` (which is 'T') is appended to `stack`. In both cases, the state of `stack` reflects these operations, and if `stack` was empty initially, no changes occur to it. The conditions of the input variables are preserved throughout the execution.***
