Postcondition: ***`X` is a string of even length consisting of an equal number of characters 'S' and 'T'; `s` has a length greater than 0; `i` is 2; if `stack` is not empty and its top element is 'S', the top element is removed from `stack`. If `stack` is empty or the character `s[2]` is 'S', then `s[2]` is appended to `stack`. If `stack` is not empty and `s[2]` is 'T', then no modifications are made to `stack`.***
