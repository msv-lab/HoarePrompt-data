Postcondition: ***`X` is a string of even length consisting of an equal number of characters 'S' and 'T', `s` has a length greater than 0, `stack` is an empty list or contains 'S', and `i` is 0. If `stack` is empty or `s[i]` is 'S', then 'S' is appended to `stack`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `s[i]` is 'T', the condition is not met, and the loop would not execute the append operation, leaving `stack` unchanged.***
