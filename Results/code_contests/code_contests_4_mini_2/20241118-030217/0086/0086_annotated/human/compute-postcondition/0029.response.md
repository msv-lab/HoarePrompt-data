Postcondition: ***If `s[i]` is 'T' and `stack` is not empty with its top element as 'S', the top element is removed from the `stack`. If `s[i]` is 'T' and `stack` is not empty with its top element not being 'S', the character `s[2]` is appended to `stack`. If `s[i]` is 'T' and `stack` is empty, no modifications occur. In all scenarios where `s[i]` is 'T', if the conditions for popping or appending are not met, then no changes are made to `stack`. The original constraints on `X` ensure that the values of `s` and the state of `stack` are consistent throughout the execution.***
