Postcondition: ***`X` is a string of even length consisting of an equal number of characters 'S' and 'T'; `s` has a length greater than 0; and `i` is 2. If the `stack` is empty or the character at index 2 of `s` is 'S', then the character `s[2]` is appended to `stack`, and the loop continues. If `stack` is not empty and `s[2]` is 'T', no modifications to `stack` occur in this iteration.***
