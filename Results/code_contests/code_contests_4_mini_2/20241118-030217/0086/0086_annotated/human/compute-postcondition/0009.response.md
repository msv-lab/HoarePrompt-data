The `pop()` method removes the last item from the list `stack`, which contains 'S'. The previous state of `stack` is unchanged before the operation, but after `stack.pop()`, the last element 'S' will be removed. The value of `X`, `s`, `i`, and the character at index `i` of `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `X` is a string of even length consisting of an equal number of characters 'S' and 'T', `s` has a length greater than 0, `stack` is an empty list, `i` is 0, and the character at index `i` of `s` is 'T'.

Output State: **`X` is a string of even length consisting of an equal number of characters 'S' and 'T', `s` has a length greater than 0, `stack` is an empty list, `i` is 0, and the character at index `i` of `s` is 'T'**.
