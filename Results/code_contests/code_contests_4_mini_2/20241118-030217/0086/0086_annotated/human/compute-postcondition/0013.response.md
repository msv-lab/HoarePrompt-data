Postcondition: ***`X` is a string of even length consisting of an equal number of characters 'S' and 'T', `s` has a length greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `stack` is either unchanged if it was empty or contained 'S', or modified if it contained 'S' at the top (which is popped off). If `stack` did not contain 'S' at the top, then 'T' is appended to `stack`, resulting in `stack` containing 'T'.***
