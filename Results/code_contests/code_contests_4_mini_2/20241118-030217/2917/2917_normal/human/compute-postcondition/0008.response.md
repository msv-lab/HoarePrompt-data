Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer, and `num` is the first integer in the list. If `num` is less than 0, then `neg` is incremented by 1, indicating that there is one negative number. If `num` is 0 or greater, `neg` remains 0. The values of `num_zeros` and `needed_coins` remain unchanged at 0.***
