The variable `needed_coins` is initialized to 0. This does not affect the previous values of any other variables, which remain `n` as a positive integer input, `numbers` as a list of integers obtained from the input, `neg` as 0, and `num_zeros` as 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer input, `numbers` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `neg` is 0, `num_zeros` is 0, and `needed_coins` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer input, `numbers` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `neg` is 0, `num_zeros` is 0, and `needed_coins` is 0**
