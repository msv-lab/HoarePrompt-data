The expression `needed_coins += abs(num) - 1` modifies the variable `needed_coins`. The value of `num` is less than 0, which means `abs(num)` will be a positive integer. As `needed_coins` is incremented by `abs(num) - 1`, it indicates that `needed_coins` will now reflect this updated value. The values of `n`, `numbers`, `num`, `num_zeros`, and `neg` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer, `num` is the first integer in the list and is less than 0, `neg` is incremented by 1, `num_zeros` is 0, `needed_coins` is updated by adding abs(num) - 1.**
