The variable `num_zeros` is initialized to 0. This does not affect any of the other variables (`n`, `numbers`, or `neg`), which remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of all variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer input, `numbers` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `neg` is 0, `num_zeros` is 0**
