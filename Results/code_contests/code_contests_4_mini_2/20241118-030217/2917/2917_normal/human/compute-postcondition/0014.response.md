According to the code, the loop iterates over `numbers`, which is a list of integers. For the loop to execute one more time, `numbers` must have at least one more integer beyond what has already been processed in the previous iteration. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `num` is the first integer in the list. If there is at least one integer, `num` must be the first element, and we need to update the state to reflect that we are now processing the next integer in the list. Therefore, `num` should be set to the second integer in the list, and the index should reflect that we are moving to the next integer.

Since `numbers` has at least 1 integer, to execute the loop one more time, we can assume that `numbers` must have at least 2 integers, and we can adjust `num` accordingly. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers, and `num` is the second integer in the list.**
