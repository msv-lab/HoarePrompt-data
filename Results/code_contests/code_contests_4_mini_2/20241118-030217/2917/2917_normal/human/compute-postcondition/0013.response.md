Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer, and `num` is the first integer in the list. If `num` is 0, `num_zeros` is incremented by 1, `neg` remains unchanged at 0, and `needed_coins` remains 0. If `num` is greater than 0, `num_zeros` remains 0, `neg` remains unchanged at 0, and `needed_coins` is updated by adding `num - 1`. If `num` is less than 0, `num_zeros` remains 0, `neg` is incremented by 1, and `needed_coins` is updated by adding `abs(num) - 1`.***
