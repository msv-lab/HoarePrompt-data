The variable `neg` is initialized to 0. The values of `n` and `numbers` remain unchanged as this line only assigns a value to `neg`. Therefore, the output state is `n` is a positive integer input, `numbers` is a list of integers obtained from the input, and `neg` is initialized to 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer input, `numbers` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `neg` is 0**
