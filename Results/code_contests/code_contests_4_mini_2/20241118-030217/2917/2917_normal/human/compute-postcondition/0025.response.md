Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 3 integers, and `num` is the third integer in the list. If `num` is 0, then `num_zeros` is increased by 1. If `num` is any positive integer, `needed_coins` is increased by `num - 1`. If `num` is negative, `neg` remains unchanged, and if `num` is positive, `neg` is also unchanged.***
