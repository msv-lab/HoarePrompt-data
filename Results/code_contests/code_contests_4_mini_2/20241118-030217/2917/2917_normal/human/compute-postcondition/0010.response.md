The value of `num_zeros` is incremented by 1, and since its previous value is 0, the new value will be 1. The other variables (`n`, `numbers`, `num`, `neg`, `needed_coins`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer, `num` is 0, `neg` is 0, `num_zeros` is 1, and `needed_coins` remains unchanged at 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer, `num` is 0, `neg` is 0, `num_zeros` is 1, `needed_coins` remains unchanged at 0**
