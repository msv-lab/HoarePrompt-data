According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `numbers` list. The loop will execute if the list contains at least one integer. Since `n` is a positive integer input, it implies that the list `numbers` has been populated with `n` integers. At the start of the loop, `num` will represent the first integer in the `numbers` list.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, we need to confirm that `numbers` is a list of integers with at least one element. The variable `num` will take the value of the first integer in the list, which is essential for the loop to start.

State: **`n` is a positive integer input, `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer, `num` is the first integer in the list, `neg` is 0, `num_zeros` is 0, `needed_coins` is 0**
