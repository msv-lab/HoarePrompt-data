Postcondition: ***`neg` is the count of negative integers in `numbers`, `num_zeros` is the count of zeros in `numbers`, and `needed_coins` is the total of `abs(num) - 1` for all positive integers in `numbers`. The count of negative integers `neg` is odd, and the count of zeros `num_zeros` is equal to 0.***
