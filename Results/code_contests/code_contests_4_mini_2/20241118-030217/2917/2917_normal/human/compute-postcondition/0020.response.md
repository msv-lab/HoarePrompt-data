According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `numbers` list. If the list has at least 3 integers, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `numbers` has at least 2 integers, and `num` is the second integer in the list. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the list must have at least 3 integers, and `num` needs to be updated to the third integer in the list. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 3 integers, `num` is the third integer in the list**
