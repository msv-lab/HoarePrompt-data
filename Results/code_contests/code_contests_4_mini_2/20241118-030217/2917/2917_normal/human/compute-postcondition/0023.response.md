The variable `num_zeros` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `num_zeros` is unknown, and the other variables (`n`, `numbers`, `num`, and `neg`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `num_zeros`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 3 integers, `num` is the third integer in the list, and `num_zeros` is increased by 1**
