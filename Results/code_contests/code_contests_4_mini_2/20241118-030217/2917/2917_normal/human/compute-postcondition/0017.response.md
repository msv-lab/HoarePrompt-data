The variable `num_zeros` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `num_zeros` is unknown, but it is important to note that `neg` is unaffected by this operation since it is related to `num` being negative, zero, or positive. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers, `num` is the second integer in the list, and `num_zeros` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers, `num` is the second integer in the list, and `num_zeros` is increased by 1**
