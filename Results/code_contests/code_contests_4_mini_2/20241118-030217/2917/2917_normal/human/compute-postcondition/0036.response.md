Postcondition: ***`neg` is the count of negative integers in `numbers`, `num_zeros` is the count of zeros in `numbers`, and `needed_coins` is the total of `abs(num) - 1` for all positive integers in `numbers`. If `neg` is odd, `needed_coins` is increased by `num_zeros` if `num_zeros` is greater than 0; otherwise, it is increased by 2. If `neg` is even, `needed_coins` is increased by `num_zeros`. In cases where `numbers` is an empty list, `neg`, `num_zeros`, and `needed_coins` all remain 0.***
