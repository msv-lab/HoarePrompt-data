The value of `needed_coins` is incremented by 2. The values of `neg` and `num_zeros` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `neg` is the count of negative integers in `numbers`, `num_zeros` is 0, and `needed_coins` is increased by 2.

Output State: **`neg` is the count of negative integers in `numbers`, `num_zeros` is 0, and `needed_coins` is increased by 2**
