You are given a programming problem description and a program that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Program:
```
R = 3
C = 3
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
	tc = [[0 for x in range(C)] for x in range(R)]
	tc[0][0] = cost[0][0]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		tc[i][0] = tc[i-1][0] + cost[i][0]
	for j in range(1, n+1):
		tc[0][j] = tc[0][j-1] + cost[0][j]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		for j in range(1, n+1):
			tc[i][j] = min(tc[i-1][j-1], tc[i-1][j], tc[i][j-1]) + cost[i][j]
	return tc[m][n]
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Program:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
  res = tuple(set(test_tup1) & set(test_tup2))
  return (res) 
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
import math
def is_not_prime(n):
    result = False
    for i in range(2,int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            result = True
    return result
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Program:
```
import heapq as hq
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
  largest_nums = hq.nlargest(n, nums)
  return largest_nums
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Program:
```
def count_ways(n):
  A = [0] * (n + 1)
  B = [0] * (n + 1)
  A[0] = 1
  A[1] = 0
  B[0] = 0
  B[1] = 1
  for i in range(2, n+1):
    A[i] = A[i - 2] + 2 * B[i - 1]
    B[i] = A[i - 1] + B[i - 2]
  return A[n] 
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Your task

Problem description: You are given n numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. With a cost of one coin you can perform the following operation:

Choose one of these numbers and add or subtract 1 from it.

In particular, we can apply this operation to the same number several times.

We want to make the product of all these numbers equal to 1, in other words, we want a_1 ⋅ a_2 ... ⋅ a_n = 1. 

For example, for n = 3 and numbers [1, -3, 0] we can make product equal to 1 in 3 coins: add 1 to second element, add 1 to second element again, subtract 1 from third element, so that array becomes [1, -1, -1]. And 1⋅ (-1) ⋅ (-1) = 1.

What is the minimum cost we will have to pay to do that?

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of numbers.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) — the numbers.

Output

Output a single number — the minimal number of coins you need to pay to make the product equal to 1.

Examples

Input


2
-1 1


Output


2

Input


4
0 0 0 0


Output


4

Input


5
-5 -3 5 3 0


Output


13

Note

In the first example, you can change 1 to -1 or -1 to 1 in 2 coins.

In the second example, you have to apply at least 4 operations for the product not to be 0.

In the third example, you can change -5 to -1 in 4 coins, -3 to -1 in 2 coins, 5 to 1 in 4 coins, 3 to 1 in 2 coins, 0 to 1 in 1 coin.
Program:
```

def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    numbers = map(int, raw_input().split())
    neg = 0
    num_zeros = 0
    needed_coins = 0
    for num in numbers:
        if num < 0:
            neg += 1
        if num == 0:
            num_zeros += 1
        else:
            needed_coins += abs(num) - 1
    if neg % 2 != 0:
        if num_zeros > 0:
            needed_coins += num_zeros
        else:
            needed_coins += 2
    else:
        needed_coins += num_zeros
    print(needed_coins)
```
