Postcondition: ***`neg` is the count of negative integers in `numbers`, `num_zeros` is the count of zeros in `numbers`, and `needed_coins` is the sum of `abs(num) - 1` for all positive integers in `numbers`. The count of negative integers `neg` is odd. If `numbers` is an empty list or if `n` is less than 1, then `neg`, `num_zeros`, and `needed_coins` remain 0.***
