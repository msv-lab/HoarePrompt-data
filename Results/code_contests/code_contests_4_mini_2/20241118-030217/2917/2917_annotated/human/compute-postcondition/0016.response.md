Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `numbers` is a list of `n` integers, `num` is the second element of `numbers`, `num_zeros` remains unchanged, and `neg` is increased by 1 if `num` is negative. If `num` is zero or positive, `neg` remains unchanged. The value of `needed_coins` is not affected by this operation.***
