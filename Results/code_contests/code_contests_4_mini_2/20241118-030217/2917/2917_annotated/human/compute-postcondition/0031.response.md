Postcondition: ***`neg` is the count of negative integers in `numbers`, which is odd; `num_zeros` is 0; `needed_coins` is the sum of `abs(num) - 1` for all positive integers in `numbers`. If `numbers` is an empty list or if `n` is less than 1, then `neg`, `num_zeros`, and `needed_coins` remain 0.***
