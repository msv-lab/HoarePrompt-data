The value of `needed_coins` is incremented by `num_zeros`. Since `num_zeros` is greater than 0, the value of `needed_coins` increases by that positive amount. The states of `neg` and `num_zeros` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `neg` is the count of negative integers in `numbers`, `num_zeros` is greater than 0, and `needed_coins` is increased by `num_zeros`.

Output State: **`neg` is the count of negative integers in `numbers`, `num_zeros` is greater than 0, and `needed_coins` is increased by `num_zeros**
