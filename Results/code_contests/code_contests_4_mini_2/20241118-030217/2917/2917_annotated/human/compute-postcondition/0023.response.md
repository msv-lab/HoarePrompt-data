The value of `num_zeros` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `num_zeros` is unknown. The other variables, including `n`, `numbers`, `num`, `neg`, and `needed_coins`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `num` is the second element of `numbers`, `neg` remains unchanged, and `num_zeros` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `num` is the second element of `numbers`, `neg` remains unchanged, and `num_zeros` is increased by 1**.
