Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, and `num` is the second element of `numbers`. If `num` is less than 0, `neg` is increased by 1; otherwise, `neg` remains unchanged. `num_zeros` and `needed_coins` remain unchanged regardless of the value of `num`.***
