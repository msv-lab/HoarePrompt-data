The variable `num_zeros` is initialized to 0. The other variables `n`, `numbers`, and `neg` remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is that `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `numbers` is a list of `n` integers, `neg` is 0, and `num_zeros` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `numbers` is a list of `n` integers, `neg` is 0, and `num_zeros` is 0**
