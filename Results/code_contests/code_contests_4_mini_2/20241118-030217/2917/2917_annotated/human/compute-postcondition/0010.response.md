The code increments `num_zeros` by 1. The previous value of `num_zeros` is 0, so after execution, `num_zeros` becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `numbers` is a list of `n` integers, the first element of `numbers`, `num`, is equal to 0, `neg` remains 0, `num_zeros` is 1, and `needed_coins` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `numbers` is a list of `n` integers, the first element of `numbers`, `num`, is equal to 0, `neg` remains 0, `num_zeros` is 1, and `needed_coins` is 0**
