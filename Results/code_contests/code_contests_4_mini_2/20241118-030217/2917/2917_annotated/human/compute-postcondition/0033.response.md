Postcondition: ***`neg` is the count of negative integers in `numbers`, which is odd; `num_zeros` is the count of zeros in `numbers`, and `needed_coins` is the sum of `abs(num) - 1` for all positive integers in `numbers`. If `num_zeros` is greater than 0, then `needed_coins` is increased by `num_zeros`. If `num_zeros` is 0, then `needed_coins` is increased by 2. In cases where `numbers` is empty or `n` is less than 1, `neg`, `num_zeros`, and `needed_coins` remain 0.***
