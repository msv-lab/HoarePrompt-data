The operation increments `num_zeros` by 1. The initial state indicates that `num_zeros` remains unchanged prior to this operation, so after execution, `num_zeros` will be increased by 1. The values of `n`, `numbers`, `num`, `neg`, and `needed_coins` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `numbers` is a list of `n` integers, `num` is the second element of `numbers`, `num_zeros` is increased by 1, and `neg` remains unchanged, and the value of `needed_coins` is not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `numbers` is a list of `n` integers, `num` is the second element of `numbers`, `num_zeros` is increased by 1, and `neg` remains unchanged, and the value of `needed_coins` is not affected.**
