The value of `needed_coins` is incremented by the value of `num_zeros`. Since `num_zeros` is a non-negative integer, the updated value of `needed_coins` will be at least its previous value. The states of the other variables `neg` and `num_zeros` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `neg` is an even integer, `num_zeros` is a non-negative integer, and `needed_coins` is updated to its previous value plus `num_zeros`.

Output State: **`neg` is an even integer, `num_zeros` is a non-negative integer, `needed_coins` is updated to its previous value plus `num_zeros`**
