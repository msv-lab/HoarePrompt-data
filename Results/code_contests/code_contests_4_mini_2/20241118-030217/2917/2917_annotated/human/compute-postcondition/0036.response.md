Postcondition: ***If `neg` is the count of negative integers in `numbers` and is odd, then if `num_zeros` is greater than 0, `needed_coins` is increased by `num_zeros`; otherwise, it is increased by 2. If `neg` is even, then `needed_coins` is updated to its previous value plus `num_zeros`. In cases where `numbers` is an empty list or if `n` is less than 1, all values (`neg`, `num_zeros`, and `needed_coins`) remain 0.***
