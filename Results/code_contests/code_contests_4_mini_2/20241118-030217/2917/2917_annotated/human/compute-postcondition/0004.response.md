The variable `needed_coins` is initialized to 0, but this does not affect any other variables as they remain unchanged. The previous values of the affected variables are still intact. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `numbers` is a list of `n` integers, `neg` is 0, `num_zeros` is 0, and `needed_coins` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `numbers` is a list of `n` integers, `neg` is 0, `num_zeros` is 0, and `needed_coins` is 0**
