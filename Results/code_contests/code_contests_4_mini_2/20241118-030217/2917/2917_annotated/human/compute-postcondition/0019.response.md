Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `numbers` is a list of `n` integers, `num` is the second element of `numbers`, and `num_zeros` is increased by 1 if `num` is zero. If `num` is positive, `needed_coins` is increased by `abs(num) - 1` while `num_zeros` remains unchanged, and `neg` is unchanged if `num` is non-negative. If `num` is negative, `needed_coins` is updated as well, and `neg` is increased by 1. The value of `needed_coins` is affected only when `num` is non-zero.***
