Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `numbers` is a list of `n` integers. If the first element `num` of `numbers` is 0, then `num_zeros` is incremented by 1, `neg` remains 0, and `needed_coins` is 0. If `num` is greater than 0, then `num_zeros` remains 0, `neg` remains 0, and `needed_coins` is updated to `num - 1`.***
