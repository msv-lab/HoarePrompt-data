The value of `neg` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `neg` is unknown, so the output state reflects that `neg` has changed. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `num` is the second element of `numbers`, `num_zeros` remains unchanged, `needed_coins` remains unchanged, `neg` is increased by 1.
