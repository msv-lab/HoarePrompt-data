Postcondition: ***`neg` is an even integer, `num_zeros` is a non-negative integer, and `needed_coins` is a non-negative integer. If `numbers` is not empty and contains positive integers, `needed_coins` is the sum of `abs(num) - 1` for all positive integers in `numbers`. If `numbers` is an empty list or `n` is less than 1, then `neg`, `num_zeros`, and `needed_coins` remain 0.***
