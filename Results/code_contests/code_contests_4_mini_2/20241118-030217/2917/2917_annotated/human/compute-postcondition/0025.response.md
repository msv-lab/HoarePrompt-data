Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, and `num` is the second element of `numbers`. If `num` is 0, `num_zeros` is increased by 1. If `num` is a positive integer, `needed_coins` is increased by `abs(num) - 1`. If `num` is a negative integer, `needed_coins` remains unchanged, and `num_zeros` remains unchanged as well. In all cases, `neg` remains unchanged.***
