The function accepts no parameters, reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers from user input, counts the number of negative integers and zeros in the list, and calculates the total number of "needed coins" based on the absolute values of the positive integers. If the count of negative integers is odd, it adds either the count of zeros or 2 to the needed coins; if even, it only adds the count of zeros. Finally, it prints the total needed coins. The function does not handle cases where `n` is less than 1 or if the input list is empty, leading to potential inaccuracies in the output.
