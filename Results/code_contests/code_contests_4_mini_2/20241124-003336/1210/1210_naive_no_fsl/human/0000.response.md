To determine the correctness of the given program based on the provided problem description, let's analyze the code and the expected outputs for various inputs.

### Understanding the Code

The program reads an input string that indicates either a specific day of the week or a specific day of the month. It then performs the following logic:

1. It checks if the input string contains "week" (i.e., `s[5] == 'w'`):
   - If true, it calculates the number of candies saved on that day of the week:
     - `52 + (int(s[0]) / -2 == -3)`:
       - The expression `(int(s[0]) / -2 == -3)` evaluates to `True` (1) for Thursday (4) and `False` (0) for other days.
       - Thus, for Thursday, it results in `53`, and for other days, it results in `52`.
   
2. If the input does not contain "week" (i.e., it is of the form "x of month"):
   - The logic is: `12 - (int(s[0]) == 3) - (int(s[:2]) == 31) * 4`
   - This attempts to calculate the number of months that have the specified day:
     - It subtracts `1` for each condition met:
       - `int(s[0]) == 3` checks if it's the 3rd day (February does not have a 30th day).
       - `int(s[:2]) == 31` checks if it's the 31st (only February and certain months).
       - However, it incorrectly subtracts `4` for each occurrence of the 31st, which is not accurate.

### Example Cases

1. **Input: "4 of week"**
   - Expected output: 52 (for Thursday).
   - Program output: 52 (works correctly).

2. **Input: "30 of month"**
   - Expected output: 11 (30th exists in 11 months).
   - Program output: 
     - `12 - (int(s[0]) == 3) - (int(s[:2]) == 31) * 4` 
     - Here, `int(s[0])` is `30` (not `3`), and `int(s[:2])` is `30` (not `31`), so it calculates `12 - 0 - 0 = 12`.
   - Thus, it outputs `12`, which is incorrect.

### Conclusion

The program fails to correctly calculate the number of candies saved for the input "30 of month". It does not handle the case where the input is "30 of month" correctly, as it outputs `12` instead of `11`.

Therefore, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
