To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the logic of the program alongside the specified requirements.

The program intends to calculate the number of candies Limak will save based on two input formats: "x of week" (where x denotes the day of the week) and "x of month" (where x denotes the day of the month).

1. **Handling "x of week":**
   - The program checks if the input string contains 'w' at the 5th position (`s[5] == 'w'`). If true, it calculates the number of occurrences of the specific day of the week in 2016.
   - For any valid week day (1 to 7), there are 52 occurrences, and if the day is Thursday (4), it adds one more occurrence, resulting in 53. The condition `(int(s[0]) / -2 == -3)` is a convoluted way of checking if `int(s[0])` equals 4 (the index for Thursday).
  
2. **Handling "x of month":**
   - If the input string contains 'm' (indicating it is a month), the program attempts to calculate the number of months that have the x-th day.
   - The logic `12 - (int(s[0]) == 3) - (int(s[:2]) == 31) * 4` aims to exclude February (which doesn't have a 30th day) and the months with fewer than 30 days. However, it subtracts 4 for months that have 31 days, which is incorrect. The months with 31 days are January, March, May, July, August, October, and December (7 months), and only April, June, September, and November (4 months) have the 30th.

Based on this analysis, let's identify potential cases where the program fails:

- For the input "4 of week", the output should be 52, which the program correctly computes.
- For the input "30 of month", the program should return 11, but it calculates incorrectly due to the flawed logic. It incorrectly adds up the number of days in months, as it does not accurately account for months with 30 days.

Therefore, since the program fails to handle the "x of month" input correctly, we can conclude:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases, specifically failing the input for "30 of month".
