The function `func` accepts an input which is a string formatted as either "x of week" or "x of month", where `x` is an integer. Specifically, for the "x of week" format, `x` must be between 1 and 7, and for the "x of month" format, `x` must be between 1 and 31. The function processes this input to determine the corresponding day of the week or day of the month based on the given format. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a string input that indicates a specific day either of the week or of the month, based on the specified integer constraints.
