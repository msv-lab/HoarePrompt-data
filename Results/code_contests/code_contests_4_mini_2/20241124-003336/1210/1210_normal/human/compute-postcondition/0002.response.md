The function `func` accepts no parameters. It is designed to process an input string which can be in one of two formats: "x of week" where x is an integer (1 ≤ x ≤ 7) indicating the day of the week, or "x of month" where x is an integer (1 ≤ x ≤ 31) indicating the day of the month. The function is expected to return an appropriate response based on the format and validity of the input string.
