To evaluate the provided code snippet, we first analyze the initial state and the conditions that affect the variable `s`.

Given:
- `s` is a string in one of the following formats: "x of week" or "x of month".

Assuming the possible values for `s`:
1. If `s` is "3 of week":
   - `s[0]` gives '3', which converts to integer 3.
   - `s[5]` gives 'w', so the condition `s[5] == 'w'` is True.
   - The expression `52 + (int(s[0]) / -2 == -3)` simplifies to `52 + (3 / -2 == -3)`. 
   - `3 / -2` equals `-1.5`, which is not equal to `-3`, so it evaluates to False (0).
   - Therefore, the total is `52 + 0`, resulting in `52`.

2. If `s` is "3 of month":
   - `s[0]` gives '3', which converts to integer 3.
   - `s[5]` gives 'm', so the condition `s[5] == 'w'` is False.
   - The expression executes the else part: `12 - (int(s[0]) == 3) - (int(s[:2]) == 31) * 4`.
   - `int(s[0]) == 3` is True (1).
   - `int(s[:2])` evaluates to 3 (not equal to 31), so that part is 0.
   - Thus, the total is `12 - 1 - 0`, resulting in `11`.

Based on the above evaluations, we can summarize the output states:

- If `s` is "3 of week": `s` is "3 of week"; the output is 52.
- If `s` is "3 of month": `s` is "3 of month"; the output is 11.

Thus, the final output states are:

Output State: **`s` is "3 of week"; output is 52**  
Output State: **`s` is "3 of month"; output is 11**
