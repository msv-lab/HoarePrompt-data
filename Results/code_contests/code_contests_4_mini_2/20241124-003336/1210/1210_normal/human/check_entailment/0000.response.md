Let's analyze the provided code and the problem description step by step.

**Problem description:** Limak wants to save candies in 2016 based on a given day of the week or day of the month. The input can either be "x of week" or "x of month". The output should be the total number of candies saved in the year 2016.

1. For "x of week":
   - Days of the week are represented by numbers 1 to 7 (Monday to Sunday).
   - Each day of the week occurs 52 times in a year, and there may be one additional occurrence for certain days (like Thursday).
   
2. For "x of month":
   - The valid days of the month are from 1 to 31.
   - The 30th day occurs in all months except February, which means it occurs in 11 months.

**Code Analysis:**
```python
s = raw_input()
print(52 + (int(s[0]) / -2 == -3)) if s[5] == 'w' else 12 - (int(s[0]) == 3) - (int(s[:2]) == 31) * 4
```
- The code checks if the sixth character (`s[5]`) of the input string is 'w'. 
- If it is 'w', it adds 52 to the result and potentially adds 1 more if it corresponds to Thursday (the 4th day of the week).
- If it is not 'w', it calculates the number of months that have either a 30th day or not, deducing it incorrectly based on whether `s[0]` is '3' or `s[:2]` is '31'.

**Output hints:** The hints suggest that:
- The function evaluates the first two characters and the sixth character of the input.
- It performs calculations based on certain conditions, but it does not handle invalid input formats.

**Edge Cases:**
- The code does not handle the case where the input is malformed (e.g., "8 of week" or "0 of month").
- The calculation for the 30th day is incorrect as it does not account for the proper number of months.
- The calculation for the week days does not correctly account for the extra occurrence of days (like Thursday).

**Conclusion:**
1. The code does not properly handle invalid inputs and may lead to runtime errors.
2. It incorrectly calculates the number of months for the 30th day and does not differentiate correctly for all days of the week.
3. The logic for determining the extra occurrence for the 4th day of the week is not clear and potentially flawed.

Given these observations, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
