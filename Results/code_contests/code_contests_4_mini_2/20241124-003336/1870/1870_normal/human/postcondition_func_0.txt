The function reads three integers from input: `W`, `a`, and `c`. It then computes two additional integers, `b` (which is `a + W`) and `d` (which is `c + W`). The function evaluates conditions involving `b` and `d` to set the value of `ans`: if `b` is less than `c`, `ans` is set to `c - b`; if `d` is less than `a`, `ans` is set to `a - d`; if neither condition holds, `ans` is set to 0. Finally, it prints the value of `ans`. The function does not return a value, and its output solely depends on the input values.
