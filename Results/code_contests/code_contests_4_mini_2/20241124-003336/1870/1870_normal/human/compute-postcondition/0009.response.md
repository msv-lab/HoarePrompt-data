The variable `ans` is assigned the value 0. The previous values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `W` is the input integer, `a` is the input integer, `c` is the input integer, `b` is `a + W`, `d` is `c + W`, and `d` is greater than or equal to `a`; `ans` is 0.
