The variables `W`, `a`, and `c` are assigned values based on the input from `raw_input()`. The input values are split and converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The initial values of `W`, `a`, and `b` are not affected by this line of code directly, but new values are assigned to `W`, `a`, and `c`. The value of `b` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state indicates that `W` and `a` take on new values from the input, and `c` is assigned a value from the input as well.

Output State: **`W` is the input integer, `a` is the input integer, `c` is the input integer, `b` is unchanged**
