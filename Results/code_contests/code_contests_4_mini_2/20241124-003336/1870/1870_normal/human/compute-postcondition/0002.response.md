The variable `d` is assigned the value of `c + W`. The values of `c` and `W` are input integers, and since `b` is defined as `a + W`, it does not affect the calculation of `d`. Therefore, the output state reflects the input integers and the calculated value of `d`.

Output State: **`W` is the input integer, `a` is the input integer, `c` is the input integer, `b` is now `a + W`, and `d` is `c + W`.**
