The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Based on the provided constraints and relationships, the function operates within the limits where W, a, and b are integers satisfying the conditions 1 ≤ W ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^5. However, since the function does not take any input parameters directly, it may rely on internal or external state for its operations, which is not specified in your query. Given that there is no specific output behavior detailed in the output section, we cannot determine the return value of the function.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and the return value cannot be determined based on the provided information.**
