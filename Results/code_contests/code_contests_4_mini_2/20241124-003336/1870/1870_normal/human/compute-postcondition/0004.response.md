The variable `ans` is assigned the value of `c - b`. The initial conditions state that `b` is equal to `a + W` and `d` is equal to `c + W`, with the condition that `b` is less than `c`. Therefore, `c` must be greater than `b` which allows the calculation of `ans`. 

Since `b` is `a + W`, we can express `ans` as `c - (a + W)`. The specific values of `W`, `a`, and `c` are not provided, but we know that `ans` will be calculated based on these expressions.

Thus, the output state includes the initial values of `W`, `a`, and `c`, as well as the computed value of `ans`.

Output State: **`W` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `c` is an integer, `b` is equal to `a + W`, `d` is equal to `c + W`, `b` is less than `c`, and `ans` is equal to `c - (a + W)`**.
