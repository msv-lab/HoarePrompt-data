The code assigns the value of `a + W` to `b`. The previous values of `a`, `W`, and `b` are present, but the exact values of `a`, `W`, and `b` are unknown. Therefore, after execution, `b` will take the value of `a + W`, while the other variables remain unchanged. The output state reflects the new value of `b` based on the sum of `a` and `W`.

Output State: **`W` is the input integer, `a` is the input integer, `c` is the input integer, and `b` is now `a + W`**
