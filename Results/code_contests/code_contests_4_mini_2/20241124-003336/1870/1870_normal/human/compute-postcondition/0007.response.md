The variable `ans` is assigned the value of `a - d`. Given that `d` is less than `a`, the result of `a - d` will be a positive integer. Other variables (`W`, `a`, `c`, `b`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is `W` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `c` is an integer, `b` is an integer equal to `a + W`, `d` is an integer equal to `c + W`, `d` is less than `a`, `b` is greater than or equal to `c`, and `ans` is `a - d`, which is a positive integer.

Output State: **`W` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `c` is an integer, `b` is an integer equal to `a + W`, `d` is an integer equal to `c + W`, `d` is less than `a`, `b` is greater than or equal to `c`, and `ans` is a positive integer**
