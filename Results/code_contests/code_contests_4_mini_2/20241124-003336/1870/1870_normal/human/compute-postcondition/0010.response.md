Postcondition: ***`W`, `a`, `c`, `b`, and `d` are integers. If `d` is less than `a`, then `ans` is calculated as `a - d`, which is a positive integer since `d` is less than `a`. Otherwise, if `d` is greater than or equal to `a`, `ans` is set to 0. Additionally, `b` is always greater than or equal to `c`.***
