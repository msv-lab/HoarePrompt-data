Postcondition: ***`W`, `a`, `c`, `b`, and `d` are integers. If `b` (which is `a + W`) is less than `c`, then `ans` is set to `c - b`. If `d` (which is `c + W`) is less than `a`, then `ans` is set to `a - d`. If neither condition holds, `ans` is set to 0. This covers all cases where either `b` is less than `c`, `d` is less than `a`, or both conditions are false, ensuring all possible relationships between the variables are addressed.***
