The variable `ans` is initialized to 0. The states of the other variables (`W`, `a`, `c`, `b`, and `d`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `ans` is now set to 0 while the other variables maintain their previous values. 

Output State: **`W` is an integer in the range 1 ≤ `W` ≤ 100000, `a` is an integer in the range 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 100000, `c` is an integer, `b` is `a + W`, `d` is `c + W`, and `ans` is 0**.
