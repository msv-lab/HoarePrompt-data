To determine the output state after executing the code snippet, let's analyze the impact of the code on the program based on the initial state.

1. From the initial state, we have:
   - `W` is an integer in the range 1 ≤ `W` ≤ 100000.
   - `a` is an integer in the range 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 100000.
   - `c` is an input integer.
   - `b` is defined as `a + W`.
   - `d` is defined as `c + W`.
   - It is given that `b` is greater than or equal to `c` (i.e., `a + W ≥ c`).
   - It is also given that `d` is less than `a` (i.e., `c + W < a`).

2. The code executes the statement:
   ```
   ans = a - d
   ```
   Here, `ans` will be assigned the value of `a - d`. 

3. Since `d` is defined as `c + W`, we can substitute:
   ```
   ans = a - (c + W)
   ans = a - c - W
   ```

4. The output state will summarize the values of the variables involved:
   - `a` remains unchanged.
   - `c` is an input integer.
   - `W` is unchanged.
   - `ans` is calculated as `a - c - W`.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the relationships and values of the variables after executing the code.

Output State: **`W` is an integer in the range 1 ≤ `W` ≤ 100000, `a` is an integer in the range 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 100000, `c` is an input integer, `b` is `a + W`, `d` is `c + W`, `b` is greater than or equal to `c`, `d` is less than `a`, and `ans` is calculated as `a - c - W`.**
