To analyze the provided code, we need to understand the initial state and how the code affects the variables:

Initial State: `W` is an integer in the range 1 ≤ `W` ≤ 100000, `a` is an integer in the range 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 100000, `c` is an input integer, `b` is equal to `a + W`, `d` is equal to `c + W`, and `b` is less than `c` (which implies `a + W < c`).

1. **Calculate `b`:** Given `b = a + W`, we can express `b` in terms of `a` and `W`.
2. **Calculate `ans`:** The code `ans = c - b` computes the difference between `c` and `b`.

Since `b < c`, the calculation `ans = c - b` will yield a positive result.

- **Final State after executing the code:**
  - `W`, `a`, and `c` remain unchanged.
  - `b` is calculated as `a + W`.
  - `ans` is calculated as `c - (a + W)`.

Therefore, the output state is: `W` is in the range 1 ≤ `W` ≤ 100000, `a` is in the range 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 100000, `c` is an input integer, `b` is equal to `a + W`, `ans` is equal to `c - (a + W)`.

Output State: **`W` is in the range 1 ≤ `W` ≤ 100000, `a` is in the range 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 100000, `c` is an input integer, `b` is equal to `a + W`, `ans` is equal to `c - (a + W)`**
