The value of `d` is assigned the value of `c + W`. The variables `W` and `c` are integers within their respective ranges. Since `W` is known and within the range 1 to 100000, and `c` is an input integer, the value of `d` will be computed based on these values. The previous values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged and do not affect the calculation for `d`. Therefore, the output state is: `W` is an integer in the range 1 ≤ `W` ≤ 100000, `a` is an integer in the range 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 100000, `c` is an input integer, `b` is `a + W`, and `d` is `c + W`.

Output State: **`W` is an integer in the range 1 ≤ `W` ≤ 100000, `a` is an integer in the range 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 100000, `c` is an input integer, `b` is `a + W`, and `d` is `c + W`**.
