Functionality: ** The function accepts three integer inputs, W, a, and c, from user input. It calculates two intermediate values, b (which is a + W) and d (which is c + W). It then determines a value ans based on the comparisons between b, c, and d, and a. If b is less than c, ans is set to c - b. If d is less than a, ans is set to a - d. If neither condition holds, ans is set to 0. The result, ans, is printed. The function covers edge cases regarding the relationships between a, c, and W, ensuring that it computes a result based on their values.**
