The value of `b` is assigned the value of `a + W`. The previous values of `a` and `W` are within the range 1 to 100000, but their specific values are not provided. Therefore, the output state indicates that `b` is calculated based on the sum of `a` and `W`. 

Output State: **`W` is an integer in the range 1 ≤ `W` ≤ 100000, `a` is an integer in the range 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 100000, `c` is an input integer, `b` is `a + W`.**
