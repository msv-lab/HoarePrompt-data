Postcondition: ***`W` is an integer in the range 1 ≤ `W` ≤ 100000, `a` is an integer in the range 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 100000, `c` is an integer, `b` is `a + W`, `d` is `c + W`, and `b` is greater than or equal to `c`. If `d` is less than `a`, then `ans` is calculated as `a - d`, which implies that `c` is such that `c + W < a`. Otherwise, `ans` is 0, indicating that `c` is such that `c + W` is greater than or equal to `a`. This ensures that all edge cases regarding the relationship between `a`, `c`, and `W` are covered.***
