Postcondition: ***`W` is an integer in the range 1 ≤ `W` ≤ 100000, `a` is an integer in the range 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 100000, and `c` is an integer. If `a + W` (which is `b`) is less than `c`, then `ans` is set to `c - (a + W)`. If `c + W` (which is `d`) is less than `a`, then `ans` is set to `a - (c + W)`. Otherwise, `ans` is set to 0, indicating that `c + W` is greater than or equal to `a`, thus covering all possible relationships between `a`, `c`, and `W`.***
