The function `func` does not accept any parameters explicitly in its definition. However, it operates with three implicit parameters: `W`, `a`, and `b`. All three variables are integers with the following constraints: `W` is in the range 1 to 100000, `a` is in the range 1 to 100000, and `b` is in the range 1 to 100000. The function returns a value based on these integer inputs. 

Since there is no specific output description provided, we cannot detail the cases or expected return values based on the operations performed with these integers.

Functionality: **The function accepts implicit integer parameters W, a, and b within specified ranges and returns a value based on these inputs.**
