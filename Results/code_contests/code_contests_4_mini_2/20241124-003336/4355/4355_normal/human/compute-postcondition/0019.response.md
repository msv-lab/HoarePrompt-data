To determine the output state after executing the given code, let's analyze the variables step by step.

1. `prev` is the same as `integer`.
2. The expression `prev - integer` will yield `0` because they are equal.
3. The output of the `print` statement is therefore `0 % 256`, which is `0`.

The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: **`text` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `table` is {'>': 8, '<': 9, '+': 10, '-': 11, '.': 12, ',': 13, '[': 14, ']': 15}, `input` is a string containing at least 3 characters, `c` is the third character of `input`, `prev` is the same as `integer`, `s` is the 8-character binary representation of `c`, `binary` is the reversed binary representation of `c`, `integer` is the integer value of the reversed binary representation of `c`, and the output of the print statement is 0.**
