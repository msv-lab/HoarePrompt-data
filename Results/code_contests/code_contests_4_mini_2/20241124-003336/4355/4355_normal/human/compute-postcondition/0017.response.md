The variable `binary` is assigned the value of `s` reversed. The value of `s` is the 8-character binary representation of `c`, which has not changed, so `binary` will hold the reversed string of that binary representation. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the other variables alongside the new value for `binary`.

Output State: **`text` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `table` is {'>': 8, '<': 9, '+': 10, '-': 11, '.': 12, ',': 13, '[': 14, ']': 15}, `input` is a string containing at least 3 characters, `c` is the third character of `input`, `prev` is the same as `integer`, `s` is the 8-character binary representation of `c`, `binary` is the reversed binary representation of `c`, `integer` is the integer value of the reversed binary representation of `c`, and the output of the print statement is 0.**
