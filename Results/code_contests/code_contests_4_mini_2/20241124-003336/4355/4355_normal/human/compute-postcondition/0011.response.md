The variable `binary` is assigned the reversed value of `s`. The value of `s` is the binary representation of the character `c`, formatted to 8 characters. Therefore, the value of `binary` will be the reverse of that 8-character binary string. The values of the other variables (`text`, `table`, `input`, `c`, `prev`, `integer`) are not affected. 

Output State: **`text` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `table` is {'>': 8, '<': 9, '+': 10, '-': 11, '.': 12, ',': 13, '[': 14, ']': 15}, `input` is a string containing at least 2 characters, `c` is the second character of `input`, `prev` is the same as `integer`, `s` is the binary representation of `c` formatted to 8 characters, `binary` is the reversed binary representation of `c`**
