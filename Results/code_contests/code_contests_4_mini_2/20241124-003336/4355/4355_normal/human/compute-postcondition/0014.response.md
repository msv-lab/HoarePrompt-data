The code assigns the value of `integer` to `prev`. Since `prev` now holds the same value as `integer`, and all other variables remain unchanged, the output state is: `text` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `table` is {'>': 8, '<': 9, '+': 10, '-': 11, '.': 12, ',': 13, '[': 14, ']': 15}, `input` is a string containing at least 2 characters, `c` is the second character of `input`, `prev` is the same as `integer`, `s` is the binary representation of `c` formatted to 8 characters, `binary` is the reversed binary representation of `c`, `integer` is the integer value of the reversed binary representation of `c`, and the output of the print statement is 0.

Output State: **`text` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `table` is {'>': 8, '<': 9, '+': 10, '-': 11, '.': 12, ',': 13, '[': 14, ']': 15}, `input` is a string containing at least 2 characters, `c` is the second character of `input`, `prev` is the same as `integer`, `s` is the binary representation of `c` formatted to 8 characters, `binary` is the reversed binary representation of `c`, `integer` is the integer value of the reversed binary representation of `c`, and the output of the print statement is 0.**
