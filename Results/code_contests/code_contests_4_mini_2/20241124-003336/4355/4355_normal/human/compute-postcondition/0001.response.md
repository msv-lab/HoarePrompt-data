The value of `input` is assigned the value of `sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()`, which reads a line from standard input and removes any trailing whitespace. Since `text` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, inclusive, `input` will also be a string of similar characteristics based on user input. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `text` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `table` remains as {'>': 8, '<': 9, '+': 10, '-': 11, '.': 12, ',': 13, '[': 14, ']': 15}, and `input` is assigned the user input string after stripping whitespace.
