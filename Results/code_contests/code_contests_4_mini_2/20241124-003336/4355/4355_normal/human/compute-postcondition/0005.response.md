The variable `s` holds the binary representation of the character `c`, formatted to 8 characters. The operation `s[::-1]` reverses this binary string. The previous values of the affected variables are `s`, which is the binary representation of `c`, and `binary`, which is assigned the reversed value of `s`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `text` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `table` is {'>': 8, '<': 9, '+': 10, '-': 11, '.': 12, ',': 13, '[': 14, ']': 15}, `input` is a non-empty string, `c` is the first character of `input`, `prev` is 0, `s` is the binary representation of `c` formatted to 8 characters, and `binary` is the reversed binary representation of `c`.
