To determine the output state, we first identify the values of the relevant variables based on the initial state. 

- `integer` is derived from the binary representation of `c`, which is the first character of `input`. 
- The value of `prev` is then assigned the value of `integer`.

Since `prev` is directly assigned the value of `integer`, the other variables remain unchanged. 

Thus, the output state reflects the updated value of `prev` and indicates that `prev` now holds the value of `integer`.

Output State: **`text` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `table` is {'>': 8, '<': 9, '+': 10, '-': 11, '.': 12, ',': 13, '[': 14, ']': 15}, `input` is a non-empty string, `c` is the first character of `input`, `prev` is the same as `integer`, `s` is the binary representation of `c` formatted to 8 characters, `binary` is the reversed binary representation of `c`, `integer` is the integer value of `binary` in base 2**.
