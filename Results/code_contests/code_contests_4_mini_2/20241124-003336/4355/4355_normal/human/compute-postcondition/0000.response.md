The variable `table` is assigned a dictionary that maps specific characters to corresponding integer values. The initial state of `text` remains unaffected by this assignment, as it is a separate variable. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged state of `text` along with the new assignment of `table`.

Output State: **`text` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, inclusive, where each character has an ASCII code between 32 (space) and 126 (tilde), inclusive; `table` is {'>': 8, '<': 9, '+': 10, '-': 11, '.': 12, ',': 13, '[': 14, ']': 15}**
