The variable `integer` is assigned the value of `int(binary, 2)`, which converts the `binary` string (a binary representation of the character `c`) into its corresponding integer value. The values of the other variables are not directly affected. 

Since `binary` is the reversed binary representation of `c`, we need to consider that value to determine `integer`. However, the specific value of `c` and its binary representation are unknown, so `integer` will take on an integer value based on that binary representation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `text` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `table` is {'>': 8, '<': 9, '+': 10, '-': 11, '.': 12, ',': 13, '[': 14, ']': 15}, `input` is a string containing at least 2 characters, `c` is the second character of `input`, `prev` is the same as `integer`, `s` is the binary representation of `c` formatted to 8 characters, `binary` is the reversed binary representation of `c`, and `integer` is the integer value of the reversed binary representation of `c`.
