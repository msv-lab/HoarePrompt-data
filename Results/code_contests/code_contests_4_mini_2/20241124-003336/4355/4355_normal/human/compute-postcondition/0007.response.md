To determine the output state, let's analyze the provided code snippet and the initial state of the variables:

1. **Initial Values**:
   - `text` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters.
   - `table` is `{'>': 8, '<': 9, '+': 10, '-': 11, '.': 12, ',': 13, '[': 14, ']': 15}`.
   - `input` is a non-empty string.
   - `c` is the first character of `input`.
   - `prev` is `0`.
   - `s` is the binary representation of `c` formatted to 8 characters.
   - `binary` is the reversed binary representation of `c`.
   - `integer` is the integer value of `binary` in base 2.

2. **Execution of the Code**:
   - The expression `prev - integer` will be calculated.
   - Since `prev` is `0`, the result will be `0 - integer`.
   - This result will then be taken modulo `256`.

3. **Impact on State**:
   - The values of `text`, `table`, `input`, `c`, `s`, and `binary` remain unchanged.
   - The only output derived is from the calculation involving `prev` and `integer`.

4. **Final Calculation**:
   - The output would be `(-integer) % 256`.

The output state does not provide the specific value of `integer` since it is dependent on the character `c` and its binary representation, but it does highlight the relationship in the calculation.

Output State: **`text` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `table` is {'>': 8, '<': 9, '+': 10, '-': 11, '.': 12, ',': 13, '[': 14, ']': 15}, `input` is a non-empty string, `c` is the first character of `input`, `prev` is 0, `s` is the binary representation of `c` formatted to 8 characters, `binary` is the reversed binary representation of `c`, `integer` is the integer value of `binary` in base 2, and the output of the expression is (-integer) % 256.**
