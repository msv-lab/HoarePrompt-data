According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the `input` string. For the loop to execute, the `input` string must contain at least one character. Given that `text` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, we can deduce that the `input` string must also be non-empty after stripping whitespace. 

At the beginning of the loop, the variable `c` will represent the current character being processed from `input`. Since `prev` is initialized as 0, it can remain unchanged for the loop execution.

Thus, we need to ensure that `input` is not empty, and `c` will be the first character of `input` during the first iteration.

State: **`text` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `table` is {'>': 8, '<': 9, '+': 10, '-': 11, '.': 12, ',': 13, '[': 14, ']': 15}, `input` is a non-empty string (user input after stripping whitespace), `c` is the first character of `input`, `prev` is 0**
