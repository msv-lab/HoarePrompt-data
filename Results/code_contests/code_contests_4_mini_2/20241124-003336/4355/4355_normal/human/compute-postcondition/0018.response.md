The code snippet assigns a new value to the variable `integer` by converting the `binary` string (which is the reversed binary representation of `c`) into its corresponding integer value using base 2. The variables `text`, `table`, `input`, `c`, `prev`, and `s` remain unchanged. The output state will reflect the updated value of `integer`.

Output State: **`text` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `table` is {'>': 8, '<': 9, '+': 10, '-': 11, '.': 12, ',': 13, '[': 14, ']': 15}, `input` is a string containing at least 3 characters, `c` is the third character of `input`, `prev` is the same as `integer`, `s` is the 8-character binary representation of `c`, `binary` is the reversed binary representation of `c`, `integer` is the integer value of the reversed binary representation of `c`, and the output of the print statement is 0.**
