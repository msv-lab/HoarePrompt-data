The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It processes a string `text` that is stated to be between 1 and 100 characters long, where each character falls within the ASCII range of 32 to 126. Based on the output description (which is not provided), we can only infer potential behaviors without specific return cases. 

However, since the output conditions are not specified in your request, I cannot identify any specific return points or cases. Therefore, I will summarize the known information regarding the input and output.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and processes a string `text` that must be between 1 and 100 characters with valid ASCII codes. The specific output behavior is not detailed.**
