The variable `prev` is assigned the value of `integer`, which has been defined previously. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `text` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `table` is {'>': 8, '<': 9, '+': 10, '-': 11, '.': 12, ',': 13, '[': 14, ']': 15}, `input` is a string containing at least 3 characters, `c` is the third character of `input`, `prev` is the same as `integer`, `s` is the 8-character binary representation of `c`, `binary` is the reversed binary representation of `c`, `integer` is the integer value of the reversed binary representation of `c`, and the output of the print statement is 0.
