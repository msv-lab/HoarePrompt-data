The function reads a string input from standard input, which is expected to contain between 1 and 100 characters with valid ASCII codes. It processes each character by computing the difference between the integer value of the reversed binary representation of the current character and the previous character's integer value. The result of this computation is printed for each character. If the input is empty, no processing occurs and the function does not output anything. Note that the function does not accept any parameters.
