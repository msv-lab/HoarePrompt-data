The function processes a string input read from standard input, converting each character to its binary representation, reversing that binary, and then calculating the difference between the current and previous character's integer values, printing the result modulo 256. It does not accept any parameters or return any values. The function operates on non-empty strings with a length between 1 and 100 characters. If the input is empty, it initializes `prev` to 0 and does not execute the loop, leaving `prev` unchanged. However, since there is no handling for an empty input, this case will not be executed, meaning the function will always process a valid non-empty string.
