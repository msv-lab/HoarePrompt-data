To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - The variable `prev` is initialized to 0, which is correct since for the first character, the previous value is treated as 0.

2. **Looping through characters**:
   - For each character `c` in the input:
     - Convert the character to its ASCII value using `ord(c)`.
     - Convert the ASCII value to an 8-bit binary string.
     - Reverse the binary string.

3. **Integer Conversion**:
   - The reversed binary string is converted back to an integer.

4. **Calculating the array value**:
   - The program then calculates the value to be printed as `prev - integer`, but there is an issue here. The line `print(prev - integer) % 256` is incorrect due to misplaced parentheses. The result of the modulo operation is not being printed as intended.
   - Instead, it should be `print((prev - integer) % 256)` to ensure that the result of the subtraction is modulo 256 before being printed.

5. **Updating `prev`**:
   - After printing, `prev` is updated to the current integer value.

### Missing Logic/Edge Cases:
The misplaced parentheses could cause the program to print incorrect values. For example, if the first character's reversed binary integer is greater than `prev`, the subtraction will yield a negative value, which then will be printed as-is (without modulo), resulting in an incorrect output. 

For instance, if the input character is 'H' (ASCII 72), the reversed binary would be 18. Thus:
- `prev = 0`
- The output would be `0 - 18`, which is -18. The program would print this negative value instead of the correct positive equivalent after applying modulo 256.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the required logic due to the issue with the parentheses in the print statement. Since this will lead to incorrect outputs in various cases, we conclude:

Correctness: **False** 

The program fails to produce the correct output for at least one potential case (when the first character results in a negative subtraction).
