To determine the output state, we need to analyze the impact of the provided code snippet on the initial state of the variables.

1. The code calculates `prev - integer`.
2. It then takes the result of that calculation and applies the modulus operation with 256.
3. Both `prev` and `integer` are previously defined variables, where `prev` is 0 and `integer` is the integer value of the reversed binary string of the first character of `input`.

Since `prev` is 0, the expression simplifies to `0 - integer`, which is `-integer`. After that, the `modulus 256` operation is applied.

The resulting value will be in the range of 0 to 255, depending on the value of `integer`.

The output state reflects the unchanged values of `prev` and `integer`, while also indicating that a value has been printed as a result of the calculation. 

Output State: **`text` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `table` is a dictionary mapping `'>': 8, '<': 9, '+': 10, '-': 11, '.': 12, ',': 13, '[': 14, ']': 15, `input` is a non-empty string, `prev` is 0, `c` is the first character of input, `s` is the binary string representation of `c` padded to 8 characters, `binary` is the reversed binary string of `s`, `integer` is the integer value of `binary` converted from base 2, and the printed value is `(0 - integer) % 256`.**
