The code assigns the value of `integer` to `prev`. The value of `prev` will now be equal to `integer`, and since the output of `print(prev - integer) % 256` is 0 before this assignment, that means `prev` and `integer` were equal at that moment. After the assignment, the state of `prev` remains equal to `integer`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `text` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `table` is a dictionary mapping `'>': 8, '<': 9, '+': 10, '-': 11, '.': 12, ',': 13, '[': 14, ']': 15, `input` is a non-empty string with at least 3 characters, `c` is the third character of `input`, `s` is the 8-character binary string representation of `c`, `binary` is the reversed binary string of `s`, `integer` is the integer derived from `binary`, `prev` is now equal to `integer`.
