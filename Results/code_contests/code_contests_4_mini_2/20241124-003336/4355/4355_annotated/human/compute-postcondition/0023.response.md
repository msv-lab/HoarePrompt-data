The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates on a string `text` which is defined by the constraints: `text` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, where each character's ASCII code is between 32 (space) and 126 (tilde), inclusive. The function does not return any value or output as indicated. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to handle a predefined string input without accepting any parameters or returning a value. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.**
