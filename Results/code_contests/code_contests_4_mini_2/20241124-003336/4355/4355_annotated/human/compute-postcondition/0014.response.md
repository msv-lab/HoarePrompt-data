To determine the output state, let's analyze the effect of the code snippet on the initial state:

1. The variable `prev` is assigned the value of `integer`.
2. The previous state of `prev` is an integer derived from the second character of `input`.
3. The value of `integer` was calculated based on the reversed binary string representation of `c`, which is the second character of `input`.

Since `prev` now holds the same value as `integer`, the output state reflects this assignment.

Output State: **`text` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `table` is a dictionary mapping `'>': 8, '<': 9, '+': 10, '-': 11, '.': 12, ',': 13, '[': 14, ']': 15, `input` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters, `prev` is the integer value of the second character of `input, `c` is the second character of `input`, `s` is the 8-character binary string representation of `c`, `binary` is the reversed binary string of `s`, `integer` is the integer derived from `binary`, and `prev` is now equal to `integer`.**
