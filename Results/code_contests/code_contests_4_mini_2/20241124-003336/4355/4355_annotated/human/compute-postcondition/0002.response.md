The variable `prev` is initialized to 0. None of the other variables (`text`, `table`, `input`) are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `prev` while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`text` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters; `table` is a dictionary mapping `'>': 8, '<': 9, '+': 10, '-': 11, '.': 12, ',': 13, '[': 14, ']': 15; `input` is a string derived from `sys.stdin.readline().rstrip(); `prev` is 0**
