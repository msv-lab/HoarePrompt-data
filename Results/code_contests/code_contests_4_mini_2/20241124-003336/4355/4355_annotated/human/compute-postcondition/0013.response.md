To determine the output state, we analyze the given code snippet in relation to the initial state of the variables:

1. The variable `prev` holds the integer value of the second character of `input`.
2. The variable `c` is assigned the second character of `input`.
3. The variable `s` is the 8-character binary string representation of `c`, which is derived from converting `c` to its binary form.
4. The variable `binary` is the reversed version of the binary string `s`.
5. The variable `integer` is the integer value derived from the reversed binary string `binary`.

The code snippet `print(prev - integer) % 256` performs the following operations:
- It calculates the difference between `prev` and `integer`.
- It then takes this difference modulo `256`.
- Finally, it prints the result of this calculation.

The values of `text`, `table`, and other variables are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, we summarize the states of the relevant variables.

Output State: **`text` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `table` is a dictionary mapping `'>': 8, '<': 9, '+': 10, '-': 11, '.': 12, ',': 13, '[': 14, ']': 15, `input` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters, `prev` is the integer value of the second character of `input, `c` is the second character of `input`, `s` is the 8-character binary string representation of `c`, `binary` is the reversed binary string of `s`, `integer` is the integer derived from `binary`, and the output is the result of (prev - integer) % 256.**
