To determine the output state after executing the given code snippet, we need to analyze the impact of the code on the affected variables based on the initial state provided.

1. The variable `binary` is a reversed binary string representation of the character `c`, which is derived from the second character of the `input` string.
2. The variable `integer` is assigned the value of `int(binary, 2)`, which converts the reversed binary string `binary` into its corresponding integer value.

Since `c` is the second character of `input`, its binary representation `s` will be a string of 8 bits, and `binary` will be the reversed version of `s`. The exact values of `c`, `s`, and `binary` depend on the specific second character of the `input`.

Thus, the output state will include:
- `text` remains a string of between 1 and 100 characters.
- `table` remains a dictionary mapping specific characters to integers.
- `input` remains a non-empty string with at least 2 characters.
- `prev` remains equal to the integer value of the second character of `input`.
- `c` remains the second character of `input`.
- `s` is the 8-character binary string representation of `c`.
- `binary` is the reversed binary string of `s`.
- `integer` is the integer value derived from the reversed binary string `binary`.

Since we do not have the specific character of `input`, we denote the character and its binary representation generically.

Output State: **`text` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `table` is a dictionary mapping `'>': 8, '<': 9, '+': 10, '-': 11, '.': 12, ',': 13, '[': 14, ']': 15, `input` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters, `prev` is equal to the integer value of the second character of `input`, `c` is the second character of `input`, `s` is the 8-character binary string representation of `c`, `binary` is the reversed binary string of `s`, `integer` is the integer derived from `binary`.**
