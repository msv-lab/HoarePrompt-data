According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `input`. For the loop to execute, `input` must contain at least one character. The state of `text`, `table`, and `prev` does not directly affect whether the loop will run. However, we need to ensure that `c` refers to the characters in the `input` string.

Assuming `input` is a valid string derived from `sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()`, we must ensure that `input` is not empty. If `input` contains at least one character, `c` will take the value of the first character in that string during the first iteration of the loop.

Thus, the necessary adjustments to the state for the loop to execute are:
- `input` must not be an empty string (it should contain at least 1 character).
- `c` should be the first character of `input` at the start of the loop.

State: **`text` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `table` is a dictionary mapping `'>': 8, '<': 9, '+': 10, '-': 11, '.': 12, ',': 13, '[': 14, ']': 15, `input` is a non-empty string, `prev` is 0, `c` is the first character of input**
