To calculate the output state, we need to consider the effect of the code provided on the initial state of the variables.

1. The variable `binary` is a reversed binary string representation of the first character of `input`, represented by `c`, and `s` is the binary string padded to 8 characters.
2. The code snippet `integer = int(binary, 2)` converts the binary string `binary` into an integer using base 2.

Since `binary` is derived from `s`, which is based on `c`, the exact value of `integer` will depend on the specific character represented by `c` in binary form and its reversal. However, the transformation itself is clear: it takes the reversed binary string and converts it into an integer.

The state of other variables (`text`, `table`, `prev`, `c`, `s`) remains unchanged.

Output State: **`text` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `table` is a dictionary mapping `'>': 8, '<': 9, '+': 10, '-': 11, '.': 12, ',': 13, '[': 14, ']': 15, `input` is a non-empty string, `prev` is 0, `c` is the first character of input, `s` is the binary string representation of `c` padded to 8 characters, `binary` is the reversed binary string of `s`, and `integer` is the integer value of `binary` converted from base 2.**
