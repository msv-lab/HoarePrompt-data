The expression `s = '{0:0>{1}}'.format(bin(ord(c))[2:], 8)` involves formatting a string based on the binary representation of the character `c`. 

1. `ord(c)` converts the character `c` to its corresponding ASCII value.
2. `bin(...)` converts that ASCII value to its binary representation as a string, prefixed with '0b'.
3. `bin(ord(c))[2:]` removes the '0b' prefix, leaving just the binary digits.
4. `'{0:0>{1}}'` formats the binary string to ensure it is right-aligned and padded with zeros to a width of 8.

After evaluating the above steps, we assign the resulting formatted string to `s`.

The state of other variables (`text`, `table`, `input`, `prev`) remains unchanged.

Output State: **`text` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `table` is a dictionary mapping `'>': 8, '<': 9, '+': 10, '-': 11, '.': 12, ',': 13, '[': 14, ']': 15, `input` is a non-empty string, `prev` is 0, `c` is the first character of input, `s` is the binary string representation of `c` padded to 8 characters**
