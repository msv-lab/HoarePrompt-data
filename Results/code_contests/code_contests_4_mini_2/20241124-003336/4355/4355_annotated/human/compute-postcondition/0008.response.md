To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we will analyze the impact of the code on the variables based on the initial state.

1. The variable `prev` is assigned the value of `integer`.
2. The value of `integer` is derived from the binary string representation of `c`, which is the first character of `input`. This value is calculated as the integer form of the reversed binary string of `s`.
3. We do not have the actual value of `integer`, but it will be in the range of 0 to 255 since it is derived from an 8-bit binary representation.

Since `prev` is now equal to `integer`, the output state will reflect the new value of `prev` based on the value of `integer`. The other variables remain unaffected.

Therefore, the output state is: `text` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `table` is a dictionary mapping `'>': 8, '<': 9, '+': 10, '-': 11, '.': 12, ',': 13, '[': 14, ']': 15, `input` is a non-empty string, `prev` is equal to `integer`, `c` is the first character of input, `s` is the binary string representation of `c` padded to 8 characters, `binary` is the reversed binary string of `s`, and `integer` is the integer value of `binary` converted from base 2.

Output State: **`text` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `table` is a dictionary mapping `'>': 8, '<': 9, '+': 10, '-': 11, '.': 12, ',': 13, '[': 14, ']': 15, `input` is a non-empty string, `prev` is equal to `integer`, `c` is the first character of input, `s` is the binary string representation of `c` padded to 8 characters, `binary` is the reversed binary string of `s`, and `integer` is the integer value of `binary` converted from base 2.**
