To evaluate the code snippet, we consider the following:

1. The variable `binary` is a reversed binary string representation of the character `c`, which is the third character of `input`. 
2. The expression `int(binary, 2)` converts the binary string `binary` back into an integer using base 2.
3. This integer value is assigned to the variable `integer`.

Since `prev` was previously equal to `integer`, it will now take the value of the newly computed `integer`.

The output state will reflect the updated value of `integer` and `prev`, while `text`, `table`, `input`, `c`, and `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`text` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `table` is a dictionary mapping `'>': 8, '<': 9, '+': 10, '-': 11, '.': 12, ',': 13, '[': 14, ']': 15, `input` is a non-empty string with at least 3 characters, `c` is the third character of `input`, `s` is the 8-character binary string representation of `c`, `binary` is the reversed binary string of `s`, `integer` is the integer derived from `binary`, `prev` is now equal to `integer`**.
