To analyze the provided code snippet, we need to consider the impact of the line on the variables. 

1. The statement `print(prev - integer) % 256` computes the result of `prev - integer`, which is then taken modulo 256.
2. The variable `prev` is currently equal to `integer`.
3. Therefore, `prev - integer` will be `0`, since they are equal.
4. The modulo operation `0 % 256` results in `0`.

The output state will reflect that the operation is performed, but the values of `prev` and `integer` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`text` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `table` is a dictionary mapping `'>': 8, '<': 9, '+': 10, '-': 11, '.': 12, ',': 13, '[': 14, ']': 15, `input` is a non-empty string with at least 3 characters, `c` is the third character of `input`, `s` is the 8-character binary string representation of `c`, `binary` is the reversed binary string of `s`, `integer` is the integer derived from `binary`, `prev` is now equal to `integer`, and the result of `print(prev - integer) % 256` is 0.**
