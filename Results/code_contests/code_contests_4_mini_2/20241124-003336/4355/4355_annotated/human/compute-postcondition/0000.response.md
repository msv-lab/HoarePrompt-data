The variable `table` is assigned a dictionary that maps specific characters to their corresponding values. The initial state of `text` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `text` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters; `table` is a dictionary mapping `'>': 8, '<': 9, '+': 10, '-': 11, '.': 12, ',': 13, '[': 14, ']': 15`.
