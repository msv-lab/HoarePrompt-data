The variable `binary` is assigned the value of `s` reversed (`s[::-1]`). The value of `s` is an 8-character binary string representation of `c`. Therefore, `binary` will be the reversed version of that 8-character string. Other variables' values are not affected. 

Output State: **`text` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `table` is a dictionary mapping `'>': 8, '<': 9, '+': 10, '-': 11, '.': 12, ',': 13, '[': 14, ']': 15, `input` is a non-empty string with at least 3 characters, `prev` is now equal to `integer`, `c` is the third character of `input`, `s` is the 8-character binary string representation of `c`, `binary` is the reversed binary string of `s`, `integer` is the integer derived from `binary`, `prev` is now equal to `integer`**
