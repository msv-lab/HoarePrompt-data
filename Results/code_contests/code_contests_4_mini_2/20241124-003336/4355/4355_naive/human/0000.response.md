To verify the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program logic step by step.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. The output character's ASCII code is derived from the previous character's ASCII code, which is reversed in binary.
2. The i-th element of the array (the integer to be printed) is calculated using:
   - Previous step result (initially 0) minus the reversed binary integer of the previous character modulo 256.
3. The output should provide the integers used to produce the given text.

### Provided Program Analysis:
```python
table = {'>': 8, '<': 9, '+': 10, '-': 11, '.': 12, ',': 13, '[': 14, ']': 15}
input = sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()
prev = 0
for c in input:
    s = '{0:0>{1}}'.format(bin(ord(c))[2:], 8)  # Get binary representation of ASCII of character
    binary = s[::-1]  # Reverse the binary string
    integer = int(binary, 2)  # Convert reversed binary string back to integer
    print(prev - integer) % 256  # Calculate the integer for the output
    prev = integer  # Update prev to the current integer
```

### Issues Found:
1. The line `print(prev - integer) % 256` is incorrectly structured. The `% 256` operator is applied after the `print` function, so the result is not printed correctly. This could lead to unexpected output since the operation is not performed on the value that gets printed.

2. The program does not handle the initial condition properly because it directly computes `(prev - integer) % 256`. For the first character, `prev` is initialized to `0`, which is expected. However, the current implementation would lead to incorrect behavior for subsequent characters due to the placement of the modulus operator.

### Example of Failure Case:
- If the input is "H", the expected output should be:
    - First character 'H' (ASCII 72): Reversed binary is `00010010` (which is 18).
    - The first integer should be `(0 - 18) % 256 = 238`.
- The program will output `prev - integer % 256` incorrectly, as it does not compute the modulus before printing.

### Conclusion:
Due to the incorrect placement of the modulus operation and the structure of the print statement, it does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential inputs.

Correctness: **False**.
