Correctness: **False**

The program has a significant issue in the way it computes and prints the values based on the specified processing steps. Specifically, the line that prints the result uses incorrect parentheses:

```python
print(prev - integer) % 256
```

This line calculates the value of `prev - integer`, but the modulo operation is not applied to the result of the subtraction before it is printed. As it stands, the code will print the subtraction result without applying the modulo operation, which does not adhere to the problem's description.

To illustrate a potential case where the program does not work correctly, consider the input "H":

1. The ASCII value of 'H' is 72. 
2. The binary representation is `01001000`, which when reversed becomes `00010010`, which is 18 in decimal.
3. The first element of the array is calculated as `(0 - 18) mod 256`, which should yield 238.

However, the program currently prints `prev - integer` without the modulo operation, resulting in an incorrect output. The expected output for the input "H" should be `238`, but the program will print `-18` if the modulo operation is not properly applied.

Thus, since the program fails to correctly implement the modulo operation and does not adhere to the problem description for certain inputs, it is deemed incorrect.
