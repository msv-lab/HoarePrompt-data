Postcondition: ***If `curInv` is less than or equal to `maxInv`, then the function returns a list `ans` containing integers from 1 to `k`, where the element at index `k - 1` is set to `i` and the element at index `i - 1` is set to `k`. If `curInv` is greater than `maxInv`, the function does not return any value.***
