The statement `a[k - 1] = i` assigns the value of `i` to the index `k - 1` of the array `a`. The initial state tells us that `n` is equal to `k + 1` and `i` is `k - 1`. 

Since `i` is `k - 1`, we substitute this into the assignment. The value being assigned to `a[k - 1]` is `k - 1`. 

The other variables `n` and `i` are not affected by this assignment, so their values remain the same.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is equal to `k + 1`, `i` is `k - 1`, and `a[k - 1]` is assigned the value `k - 1`.

Output State: **`n` is equal to `k + 1`, `i` is `k - 1`, and `a[k - 1]` is assigned the value `k - 1`**
