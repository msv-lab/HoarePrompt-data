The value of `ans[i - 1]` is assigned the value `k`. Given that `i` is `k - 1`, we can calculate `i - 1` as follows: 

`i - 1 = (k - 1) - 1 = k - 2`.

Thus, `ans[k - 2]` is assigned the value of `k`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. 

The output state reflects the assignments and the unchanged values of the other variables. Therefore, the output state is: 

`n` is equal to `k + 1`, `i` is `k - 1`, `a[k - 1]` is `k - 1`, `a[k - 2]` is `k`, `a[k]` is `k`, `curInv` is less than or equal to `maxInv`, `ans` is range(1, k + 1), `ans[k - 1]` is `k - 1`, and `ans[k - 2]` is `k`.

Output State: **`n` is equal to `k + 1`, `i` is `k - 1`, `a[k - 1]` is `k - 1`, `a[k - 2]` is `k`, `a[k]` is `k`, `curInv` is less than or equal to `maxInv`, `ans` is range(1, k + 1), `ans[k - 1]` is `k - 1`, and `ans[k - 2]` is `k`.**
