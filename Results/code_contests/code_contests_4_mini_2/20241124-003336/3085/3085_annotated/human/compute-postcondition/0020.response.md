To determine the state adjustments necessary for the loop to execute one more time, we first analyze the for loop statement:

```
for i in xrange(2 * k - n, k):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop iterates with `i` starting from `2 * k - n` and ending before `k`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `k` at the beginning of the next iteration.

Given that the for loop will increment `i` automatically with each iteration, we need to consider what the value of `i` will be at the start of the next iteration.

1. The loop starts with `i` being `2 * k - n`.
2. At the end of the current iteration, `i` will have been incremented by 1, meaning at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `2 * k - n + 1`.

Now we need to ensure that this new value of `i` is still less than `k`:

- `2 * k - n + 1 < k`
- Simplifying this inequality: 
  - `2 * k - n < k - 1`
  - Rearranging gives us `k - n < -1`
  - Thus, `n > k + 1`.

So, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than `k + 1`.

Since the previous state mentions curInv only in terms of whether it's less than or equal to `maxInv`, but does not provide specific values for `curInv`, `maxInv`, `k`, or `n`, we will proceed with the adjustments based on our analysis.

State: **`curInv` is less than or equal to `maxInv`, `n` is greater than `k + 1`, `i` is `2 * k - n + 1`**
