The variable `a[k - 1]` is assigned the value of `i`, where `i` is `2 * k - n + 1`. The values of `curInv`, `maxInv`, `n`, and `k` do not change because this operation only affects the array `a`. 

Thus, after execution, the state of the affected variables is:
- `a[k - 1]` is now `2 * k - n + 1`.
- The other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `curInv` is less than or equal to `maxInv`, `n` is greater than `k + 1`, `i` is `2 * k - n + 1`, and `a[k - 1]` is now `2 * k - n + 1`.

Output State: **`curInv` is less than or equal to `maxInv`, `n` is greater than `k + 1`, `i` is `2 * k - n + 1`, and `a[k - 1]` is now `2 * k - n + 1`**
