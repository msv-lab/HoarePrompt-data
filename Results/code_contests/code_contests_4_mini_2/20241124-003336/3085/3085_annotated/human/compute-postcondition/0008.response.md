The function `func_8` is called with parameters `a` and `n`, where `n` is an integer with the constraint that `k â‰¤ n < 2k` and `n` is either equal to `k + 1` or not. Since the specific values of `a`, `n`, and `k` are not given, we can analyze the outcomes based on the conditions.

1. If `n` is equal to `k + 1`, the function returns a range of integers from 1 to `k` excluding `k - 1`, specifically the list `1, 2, ..., k - 2, k, k - 1`. This means the output will include all integers from 1 to `k` in a specific order.

2. If `n` is not equal to `k + 1`, the function does not return any value.

Since we don't have specific values for `a`, `n`, or `k`, we can't determine the exact output of the function or the output state. 

Therefore, considering both cases, the output state will take into account the varying possibilities of the values:

- If `n` is equal to `k + 1`: `n` is equal to `k + 1`, and the function returns the list from 1 to `k` in the specified order.
- If `n` is not equal to `k + 1`: `n` is not equal to `k + 1`, and the function does not return any value.

Output State: **`n` is either equal to `k + 1` resulting in the list [1, 2, ..., k - 2, k, k - 1] or not equal to `k + 1` resulting in no return value.**
