According to the code, the loop can execute again if the current value of `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `2 * k - n + 1`, and we know that `n` is greater than `k + 1`. This implies that `n` is at least `k + 2`, which leads to `i` being evaluated as follows:

- If we substitute `n` with the smallest possible value that satisfies `n > k + 1`, we get:
  - Letâ€™s say `n = k + 2`, then `i = 2 * k - (k + 2) + 1 = k - 1`.
  
Since `i` is calculated as `2 * k - n + 1` and must be less than `k` for the loop to execute again, it follows that:

- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased by 1, and for that to happen, `n` must be less than `2 * k` to keep `i` below `k`. 

Given that `n` is currently greater than `k + 1`, we need to adjust it to ensure that the loop can execute one more time. Therefore, we must set `n` to be less than `2 * k` while ensuring it is still greater than `k + 1`. A possible adjustment could be `n` being exactly `2 * k - 1` (which is less than `2 * k`).

Thus, the updated states would be:

- `curInv` remains unchanged.
- `n` must be adjusted to `2 * k - 1`.
- `i` will be calculated as `2 * k - (2 * k - 1) + 1`, which equals `2`.

State: **`curInv` is less than or equal to `maxInv`, `n` is 2 * k - 1, `i` is 2, and `a[k - 1]` is now 2**
