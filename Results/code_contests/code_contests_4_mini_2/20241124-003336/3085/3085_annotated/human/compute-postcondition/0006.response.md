Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` and `k` are integers such that `k` ≤ `n` < 2`k`, and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^5. If `n` is equal to `k + 1`, the function returns a range of integers from 1 to `k` excluding `k - 1`, specifically the list [1, 2, ..., k - 2, k, k - 1]. If `n` is not equal to `k + 1`, the function does not return any value. This covers the case where `n` is equal to `k` (which leads to no return) and the edge case when `n` is equal to `k + 1`, ensuring the function behaves as described in all specified scenarios.***
