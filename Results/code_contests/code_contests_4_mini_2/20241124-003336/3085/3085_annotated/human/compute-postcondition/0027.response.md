Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters and returns a range of integers based on the values of `n` and `k` obtained from `func_2()`. If `n` is equal to `k`, it returns the range from 1 to `k`, inclusive. If `n` is equal to `k + 1`, it returns a modified list that includes integers from 1 to `k` but excludes `k - 1`, specifically the list [1, 2, ..., k - 2, k, k - 1]. If `n` is neither equal to `k` nor `k + 1`, no value is returned. Additionally, if the loop executes, it attempts to return a list `ans` that contains integers from 1 to `k`, with the last element modified based on the loop variable `i`, but if the conditions for executing the loop are not met, the function does not return anything.**
