Output State: **If `n` is equal to `k + 1`, the loop will execute for `i` in the range from `2 * k - (k + 1)` to `k`, which simplifies to `k - 1` (inclusive). If `curInv` is less than or equal to `maxInv`, the function returns a list `ans` containing integers from 1 to `k`, where the element at index `k - 1` is set to `i` and the element at index `i - 1` is set to `k`. If `n` is greater than `k + 1` or less than `k + 1`, the loop does not execute, and there is no return value; `a` remains unchanged, and `ans` is undefined. If the loop executes, `curInv` is less than or equal to `maxInv` on each iteration.**
