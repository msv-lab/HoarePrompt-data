The function `func_9` accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `k`. The parameter `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\). The parameters `n` and `k` are integers such that \(k \leq n < 2k\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^5\). The total sum of `k` over all test cases does not exceed \(10^5\).

The functionality of the function is organized into different cases based on the values of `n` and `k`:

- **Case 1**: If `n` is equal to `k`, the function returns a range of integers from 1 to `k`, inclusive.
  
- **Case 2**: If `n` is equal to `k + 1`, the function returns a range of integers from 1 to `k` excluding `k - 1`, specifically the list [1, 2, ..., k - 2, k, k - 1].

- **Case 3**: If `n` is greater than `k + 1`, the function does not return any value. If `n` is less than `k + 1`, it also does not return any value. If `n` equals `k + 1`, the function may return a list `ans` containing integers from 1 to `k`, with specific modifications based on the loop execution conditions.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_9` is to accept the parameters `t`, `n`, and `k`, and return specific ranges of integers based on the conditions of `n` relative to `k`. If none of the specified conditions are met, the function does not return any value. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters t, n, and k and returns a range of integers based on the values of n and k, specifically returning [1, 2, ..., k] if n equals k, returning [1, 2, ..., k - 1, k] if n equals k + 1, or returning no value if n does not meet these conditions.**
