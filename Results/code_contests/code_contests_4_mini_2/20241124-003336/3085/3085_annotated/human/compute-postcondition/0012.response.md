The line `a[k] = k` assigns the value of `k` to the index `k` of the array `a`. 

From the initial state, we know:
- `n` is equal to `k + 1`
- `i` is `k - 1`
- `a[k - 1]` has been assigned the value `k - 1`
- `a[k - 2]` has been assigned the value `k`

Since `a[k]` is being assigned the value `k`, it means the `k` index of the array `a` will now hold the value of `k`. The states of `n`, `i`, `a[k - 1]`, and `a[k - 2]` remain unchanged as a result of this assignment.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is equal to `k + 1`, `i` is `k - 1`, `a[k - 1]` is `k - 1`, `a[k - 2]` is `k`, and `a[k]` is now `k`.

Output State: **`n` is equal to `k + 1`, `i` is `k - 1`, `a[k - 1]` is `k - 1`, `a[k - 2]` is `k`, `a[k]` is `k`**
