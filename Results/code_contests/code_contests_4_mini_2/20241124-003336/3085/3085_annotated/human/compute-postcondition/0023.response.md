`a[k - 1]` is assigned the value of `i`, where `i` is 2. Therefore, `a[k - 1]` now has the value 2. Other variables (`curInv`, `maxInv`, `n`, and `i`) are not affected by this assignment. Thus, the output state is: `curInv` is less than or equal to `maxInv`, `n` is 2 * k - 1, `i` is 2, and `a[k - 1]` is now 2.

Output State: **`curInv` is less than or equal to `maxInv`, `n` is 2 * k - 1, `i` is 2, and `a[k - 1]` is now 2**
