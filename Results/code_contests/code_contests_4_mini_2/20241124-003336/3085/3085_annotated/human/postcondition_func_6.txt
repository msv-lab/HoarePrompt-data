The function accepts a binary indexed tree (BITree), a positive integer `n`, an integer `index`, and an integer `val`. It updates the BITree by adding `val` to the elements at the specified `index` and all subsequent indices determined by the binary indexed tree structure until `index` exceeds `n`. If the initial `index` is greater than `n`, the function does not perform any updates and leaves the BITree unchanged.
