To determine the correctness of the provided program, I will analyze it against the problem description and test cases.

### Analysis of the Program
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads multiple test cases, each with two integers `n` and `k`.
2. **Permutation Logic**: The function `func_9()` is designed to generate the permutation `p` based on the input values `n` and `k`.
3. **Inversion Count**: The function `func_8()` counts the inversions in the array using a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT). The logic for counting inversions appears to be correct.
4. **Building Sequence `a`**: The sequence `a` is built correctly according to the problem description.
5. **Maximizing `b` Lexicographically**: The program attempts to identify a permutation `p` that maximizes `b` while maintaining the total number of inversions.

### Potential Issues
- The logic in `func_9()` for generating `p` based on the conditions when `n` is either equal to `k` or `k + 1` is straightforward. However, the logic for when `k < n < 2k` is complex.
- The loop `for i in xrange(2 * k - n, k)` appears to manipulate the sequence in an attempt to generate a valid permutation, but the handling of indices and the way `a` is modified may not guarantee that the resulting permutation meets the inversion criteria for all cases.

### Testing Edge Cases
1. **Case 1**: For `n = 2`, `k = 2`. 
   - Sequence `a` would be `[1, 2]`. Expected output for `p` is `[1, 2]`. The program correctly outputs this.
   
2. **Case 2**: For `n = 3`, `k = 2`.
   - Sequence `a` would be `[1, 2, 1]`. The expected permutation `p` is `[2, 1]`, resulting in `b = [2, 1, 2]`. The program correctly outputs this.

3. **Case 3**: For `n = 4`, `k = 3`.
   - Sequence `a` would be `[1, 2, 3, 2]`. The expected output for `p` is `[1, 3, 2]`, resulting in `b = [1, 3, 2, 3]`. The program outputs this correctly.

### Conclusion
While the program has complex logic, the provided test cases in the description match the expected outputs. However, due to the complexity and potential oversight in manipulating the indices in `func_9()`, it cannot be definitively stated that the program works for all edge cases. 

After considering the above points, I cannot find a case where the program fails, indicating it may work as intended.

Correctness: **True**
