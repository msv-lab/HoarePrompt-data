The function accepts a Binary Indexed Tree (BITree) and an integer index. It calculates and returns the cumulative sum of elements in BITree up to the specified index. If the index is 0 or less than 1, it returns 0. The function does not handle cases where the index exceeds the bounds of the BITree, which could potentially lead to incorrect results or accessing invalid memory.
