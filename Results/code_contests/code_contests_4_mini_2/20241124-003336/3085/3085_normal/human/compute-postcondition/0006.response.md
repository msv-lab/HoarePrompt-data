Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000). If `n` is equal to `k + 1`, the function returns a range object representing integers from 1 to `k - 2` (inclusive), followed by `k` and `k - 1`. If `n` is not equal to `k + 1`, there is no return value from the function, leading to an undefined output for those cases.***
