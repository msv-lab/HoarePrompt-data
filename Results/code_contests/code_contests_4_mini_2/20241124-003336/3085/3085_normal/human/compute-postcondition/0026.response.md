The function `func_9` accepts no direct parameters as it operates based on predefined test cases. The function handles a number of test cases represented by `t`, which is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000). For each test case, two integers `n` and `k` are provided, satisfying the conditions k ≤ n < 2k and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5. 

Based on the values of `n` and `k`, the function can return different outputs:

**Case 1:** If `n` is equal to `k`, the function returns a range object representing numbers from 1 to `k` (inclusive). 

**Case 2:** If `n` is equal to `k + 1`, the function returns a range object representing integers from 1 to `k - 2` (inclusive), followed by `k` and `k - 1`. 

**Case 3:** If `n` is greater than `k`, the function executes a loop which computes an array `ans` based on the values of `k`, `n`, and a variable `i` that is dependent on the difference between `n` and `k`. If certain conditions are met during the loop execution, it modifies `ans` and returns it. However, if `curInv` is always greater than `maxInv`, or if `n` is equal to `k`, no return occurs, leading to an undefined output.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_9` is to determine the output based on the values of `n` and `k` across multiple test cases, with specific returns for the conditions of equality to `k` and `k + 1`, and conditional returns based on loop execution for cases where `n` exceeds `k`.

Functionality: **The function accepts no direct parameters but processes multiple test cases determined by t, returning a range object for specific values of n relative to k, or an array ans based on loop execution and conditions. If none of the conditions are met, the output is undefined.**
