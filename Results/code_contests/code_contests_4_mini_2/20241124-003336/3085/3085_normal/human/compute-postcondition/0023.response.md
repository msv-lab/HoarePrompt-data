The value of `a[k - 1]` is assigned the value of `i`. Since `i` is equal to `k - 1`, the assignment means that the element at index `k - 1` in the array `a` will now hold the value of `k - 1`. The other variables `t`, `k`, `n`, and `curInv` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000), `k` is a positive integer, `n` is greater than `k + 1`, `i` is equal to `k - 1`, `curInv` is assigned the value returned by `func_8(a, n)`, and `a[k - 1]` is now equal to `k - 1`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000), `k` is a positive integer, `n` is greater than `k + 1`, `i` is equal to `k - 1`, `curInv` is assigned the value returned by `func_8(a, n)`, and `a[k - 1]` is now equal to `k - 1`.**
