The statement `a[k - 1] = i` assigns the value of `i` to the element at the index `k - 1` of the list `a`. The value of `i` is already defined as `2 * k - n + 1`, and since `k` is a positive integer and `n` is greater than `k + 1`, the calculations will yield a valid integer value for `i`. The values of `t`, `k`, `n`, and `curInv` remain unchanged since they are not directly affected by this operation.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000), `k` is a positive integer, `n` is greater than `k + 1`, `i` is equal to `2 * k - n + 1`, `curInv` is assigned the value returned by `func_8(a, n)`, and `a[k - 1]` is assigned the value of `i`.**
