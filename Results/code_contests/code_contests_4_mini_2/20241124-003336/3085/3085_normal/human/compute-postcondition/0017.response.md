The code assigns the value of `k` to the index `i - 1` of the list `ans`. Given that `i` is defined as `2 * k - n`, this means that the assignment will depend on the values of `k` and `n`. The previous value of `ans[k - 1]` is updated to `i`, and now `ans[i - 1]` will be set to `k`. 

Therefore, the output state is: `i` is `2 * k - n`, `ans[k - 1]` is updated to `i`, and `ans[i - 1]` is set to `k`.

Output State: **`i` is `2 * k - n`, `ans[k - 1]` is updated to `i`, and `ans[i - 1]` is set to `k`**
