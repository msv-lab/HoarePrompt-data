The statement `ans[k - 1] = i` assigns the value of `i` to the index `k - 1` of the list or array `ans`. The previous value of `i` is equal to `2 * k - n`. The initial state of `ans` is a range object from `1` to `k`, which means its values are from `1` to `k`, inclusive. 

Since `ans` is a range object, it would need to be converted to a list for assignment to take place. 

After the assignment, the value at the `k - 1` index of `ans` will be updated to the value of `i`.

Therefore, the output state is:
`i` is `2 * k - n`, `ans` is a list where `ans[k - 1]` is updated to `i` and other values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `2 * k - n`, `ans` is a list with `ans[k - 1]` updated to `i`**
