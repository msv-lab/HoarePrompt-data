The code calls the function `func_8` with `a` and `n` as arguments. The variable `a` is defined based on the conditions provided for `k` and `n`. However, since there is no defined output for `a` when `n` is not equal to `k + 1`, we cannot ascertain the value of `a` or the output of `maxInv`. 

Thus, the output state reflects the ambiguity in the value of `a`. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000); `a` is not defined due to the condition on `n` and `k`; `maxInv` is not determined.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000); `a` is not defined due to the condition on `n` and `k`; `maxInv` is not determined.**
