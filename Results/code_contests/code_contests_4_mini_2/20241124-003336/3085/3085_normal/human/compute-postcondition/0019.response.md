Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000), `k` is a positive integer, `n` is greater than `k`, `i` is equal to `2 * k - n`, and `curInv` is assigned the value returned by `func_8(a, n)`. If `curInv` is less than or equal to `maxInv`, the program returns the array `ans` where `ans` contains integers from 1 to `k`, with `ans[k - 1]` set to `i` and `ans[i - 1]` set to `k`. If `curInv` is greater than `maxInv`, the program does not return any value.***
