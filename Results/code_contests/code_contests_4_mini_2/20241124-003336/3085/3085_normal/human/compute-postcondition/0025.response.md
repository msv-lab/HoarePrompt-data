Output State: **If `n` is less than or equal to `k`, the loop does not execute and `a` remains undefined, `maxInv` is not determined. If `n` is greater than `k`, the loop will execute with `i` starting at `2 * k - n` and incrementing until `i` is less than `k`. For each execution, `curInv` is computed from `func_8(a, n)`. If `curInv` is less than or equal to `maxInv`, the program returns an array `ans` with integers from 1 to `k`, modifying `ans[k - 1]` to `i` and `ans[i - 1]` to `k`. The final output state can include values of `t`, `k`, `n`, `i`, `curInv`, and `ans`, depending on the execution count. If the loop executes 1 time, `i` is `2 * k - n`, and if it executes multiple times, `i` will increment accordingly. Edge cases include scenarios where either `n` is equal to `k` (no execution) or if `curInv` is always greater than `maxInv` (no return).**
