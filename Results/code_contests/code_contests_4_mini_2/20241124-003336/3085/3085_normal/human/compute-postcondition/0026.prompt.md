You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for describing the functionality of a Python function. You will be provided with the constraints and relationships between the input parameters, as well as the resulting output of the function based on these inputs. Your task is to organize this information and describe the functionality of the function. Please avoid describing how the function operates or details such as how local variables are initialized—only describe what parameters the function accepts and what it returns. If there are multiple return points in the function we will split them in Cases with an arithmetic counter and remember if one case is fullfilled none of the others are. You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: **functionality**.


Example1:
Parameter constraints and relationships: `number` is an integer.
```
def func(number):
```
Output: `number` is an integer. If `number` is even, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer1:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `number`. `number` is an integer. After executing the function body, if number is even, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `number`, and if `number` is even, it returns True. If `number` is not even, it returns False.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter number, returns `True` if `number` is even. If `number` is not even, it returns `False`.**


Parameter constraints and relationships: `age` is an integer.
```
def func(age):
```
Output: Case_1:`number` is an integer. If `number` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative; 
        Case_2: `number` is an integer. If `number` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult".
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `age`. `age` is an integer. If `age` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative. If `age` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult". Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `age`  and return if the person is a minor or an adult based on the age while handling wrong negative input values.


Your Task:
Parameter constraints: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases; for each test case, n and k are integers such that k ≤ n < 2k and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5.
```
def func_9():
```
Output: Case_1: *`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000). For each test case, if `n` is equal to `k`, the function returns a range object representing numbers from 1 to `k` (inclusive). If `n` is not equal to `k`, there is no return value from the function, and thus the output is undefined for those cases.

Case_2: *`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000). If `n` is equal to `k + 1`, the function returns a range object representing integers from 1 to `k - 2` (inclusive), followed by `k` and `k - 1`. If `n` is not equal to `k + 1`, there is no return value from the function, leading to an undefined output for those cases.

Case_3: If `n` is less than or equal to `k`, the loop does not execute and `a` remains undefined, `maxInv` is not determined. If `n` is greater than `k`, the loop will execute with `i` starting at `2 * k - n` and incrementing until `i` is less than `k`. For each execution, `curInv` is computed from `func_8(a, n)`. If `curInv` is less than or equal to `maxInv`, the program returns an array `ans` with integers from 1 to `k`, modifying `ans[k - 1]` to `i` and `ans[i - 1]` to `k`. The final output state can include values of `t`, `k`, `n`, `i`, `curInv`, and `ans`, depending on the execution count. If the loop executes 1 time, `i` is `2 * k - n`, and if it executes multiple times, `i` will increment accordingly. Edge cases include scenarios where either `n` is equal to `k` (no execution) or if `curInv` is always greater than `maxInv` (no return).

Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?
