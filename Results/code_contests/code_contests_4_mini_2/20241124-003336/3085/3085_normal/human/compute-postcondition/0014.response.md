Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000), `k` is a positive integer, `n` is greater than `k`, `i` is equal to `2 * k - n`, `a[k - 1]` is equal to `i`, `a[k - 2]` is equal to `k`, `a[k]` is equal to `k`, and `curInv` is less than or equal to `maxInv`, where `curInv` is assigned the value returned by `func_8(a, n)`***
