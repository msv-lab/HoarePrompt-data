According to the code, the loop's execution depends on the values of `i` and `k`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `k - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, which means it will become `k`. However, since the loop's condition is `i < k`, `i` cannot be equal to `k` if the loop is to execute again. 

Additionally, we need to consider the starting point of `i`, which is `2 * k - n`. For the loop to execute again, we need to ensure that `2 * k - n` is less than `k`. Since `n` is greater than `k + 1`, it implies that `2 * k - n` will be less than `k` only if `n` is, at the very least, `2 * k - 1`. Thus, we can adjust `n` to be equal to `2 * k - 1` or less.

So, to allow the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust the state such that `i` is `k`, and `n` can remain greater than `k + 1` but should be adjusted to ensure that `2 * k - n` is still valid for the loop condition.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000), `k` is a positive integer, `n` is equal to `2 * k - 1`, `i` is equal to `k`, `curInv` is assigned the value returned by `func_8(a, n)`, and `a[k - 1]` is now equal to `k - 1`.**
