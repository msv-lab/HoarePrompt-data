According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and `k`. The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `k`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we have:
- `i` is equal to `2 * k - n + 1`
- `n` is greater than `k + 1`

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than `k`. Since `i` is currently `2 * k - n + 1`, we need to ensure that `2 * k - n + 1 < k`. 

This inequality can be simplified:
1. Rearranging gives us `2 * k - n + 1 < k`
2. Subtracting `k` from both sides results in `k - n + 1 < 0`
3. This further simplifies to `k < n + 1`, which is already satisfied since `n > k + 1`.

However, we need to check the value of `i`. The current value `i` is `2 * k - n + 1`, and to execute again, it must become `2 * k - n + 1 < k`. This implies we need to adjust `i` to be `k - 1` for the next iteration.

Thus, we need to set:
- `i` to `k - 1`, which means that `n` must be adjusted so that `2 * k - n + 1` can fall below `k`.

Therefore, we can conclude that:
- `i` should be adjusted to `k - 1` to allow for the next iteration.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000), `k` is a positive integer, `n` is greater than `k + 1`, `i` is equal to `k - 1`, `curInv` is assigned the value returned by `func_8(a, n)`, and `a[k - 1]` is assigned the value of `i`.**
