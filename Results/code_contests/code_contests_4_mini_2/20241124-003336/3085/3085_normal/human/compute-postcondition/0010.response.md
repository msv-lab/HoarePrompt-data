The code assigns the value of `i` to the index `k - 1` of the array `a`. Given that `i` is calculated as `2 * k - n`, we can substitute this expression into the assignment. The values of `t`, `k`, and `n` are not affected by this operation, but `a[k - 1]` will now hold the value of `i`. 

Thus, we need to clarify the state of the variables:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000),
- `k` is a positive integer,
- `n` is greater than `k`,
- `i` is equal to `2 * k - n`.

Assuming `a` is an array that has at least `k` elements (since we're accessing `a[k - 1]`), we can summarize the output state.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000), `k` is a positive integer, `n` is greater than `k`, `i` is equal to `2 * k - n`, and `a[k - 1]` is assigned the value of `i`**.
