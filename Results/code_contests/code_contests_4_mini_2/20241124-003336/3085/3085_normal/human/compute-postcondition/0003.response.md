Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000). For each test case, if `n` is equal to `k`, the function returns a range object representing numbers from 1 to `k` (inclusive). If `n` is not equal to `k`, there is no return value from the function, and thus the output is undefined for those cases.***
