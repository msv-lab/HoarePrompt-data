The function accepts a list or array `BITree`, an integer `n`, an integer `index`, and an integer `val`. It updates the elements of `BITree` starting from the specified `index` by adding `val` to each relevant element, following the logic of a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) until the `index` exceeds `n`. If the initial `index` is greater than `n` or if it is less than or equal to 0, the function does not make any modifications to `BITree`.
