To evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the given problem description, let's analyze the requirements and the provided code.

### Problem Requirements:
1. Construct a sequence `a` of size `n` which follows the pattern specified.
2. Generate a permutation `p` of size `k` such that the total number of inversions in the sequence `b = [p[a[i]] for i in range(n)]` does not exceed that of `a`.
3. The permutation `p` must be lexicographically maximum.

### Analyzing the Code:
- The `func_9()` function is responsible for generating the permutation `p` based on the inputs `n` and `k`.
- It handles cases when `n == k` and `n == k + 1` properly, returning the expected permutations.
- The code dynamically builds the sequence `a` and counts inversions using a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) in `func_8()`.
- The way it modifies `a` and checks for inversions is crucial to ensuring that the generated permutation `p` meets the inversion criteria.

### Potential Issues:
1. The way `func_9()` constructs `a` may not cover all cases or edge scenarios as defined in the problem description, particularly for values of `n` and `k` where `n` is very close to `2k`.
2. The `xrange` function is used, which is only valid in Python 2. It should be replaced with `range` for compatibility with Python 3.
3. The logic where it tries to modify `a` to check for inversions might not be correctly validating the required conditions for all permutations.

### Testing Edge Cases:
Let's consider edge cases:
- For `n = 2k - 1` and `k = 3`: The expected behavior is specific, and the inversion count needs careful handling when modifying indices in `a`.
- The output might be incorrect if the permutation does not maintain the required inversion count or if it is not lexicographically maximum.

### Conclusion:
The program could fail for certain edge cases, especially in how it constructs the sequence `a` and derives the permutation `p`. Specifically, it needs to handle the inversion counting and permutation generation carefully.

Thus, given the potential shortcomings and lack of coverage of all edge cases as per the problem description, I conclude:

Correctness: **False**. 

An example case where the program might fail is when `n = 5` and `k = 3`. The expected output should maintain the inversion criteria, but the generated permutation may not satisfy the lexicographic maximum condition for all possible sequences.
