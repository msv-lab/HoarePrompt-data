The value of `r` is assigned to -1. The previous value of `r` was 0, but now it has been updated to -1. The values of the other variables (`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `n`, `s`, `pref_sums`, `u`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x1` and `y1` are non-negative integers, `x2` and `y2` are integers, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `pref_sums` is a list of lists with `n` inner lists, each containing [0, 0], `r` is -1 and `u` remains 0.

Output State: **`x1` and `y1` are non-negative integers, `x2` and `y2` are integers, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `pref_sums` is a list of lists with `n` inner lists, each containing [0, 0], `r` is -1 and `u` remains 0.**
