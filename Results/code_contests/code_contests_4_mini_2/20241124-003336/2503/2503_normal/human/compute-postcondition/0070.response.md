The variables `new_x` and `new_y` are assigned the values based on the expressions `x1 + pref_sums[i][0]` and `y1 + pref_sums[i][1]`, respectively. The value of `i` is 0, and since `n` is greater than 0, we assume `pref_sums` has valid indices. The exact values of `x1`, `pref_sums[i][0]`, `y1`, and `pref_sums[i][1]` are not provided, but we know that `new_x` and `new_y` will be calculated based on these variables.

Thus, the output state reflects the calculated values for `new_x` and `new_y`, but since we lack specific values for `x1`, `y1`, and `pref_sums`, we can only describe their relationship in the output state.

Output State: **`min_dist` remains as the initial value from `dist`, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `new_x` is calculated as `x1 + pref_sums[0][0]`, `new_y` is calculated as `y1 + pref_sums[0][1]`**
