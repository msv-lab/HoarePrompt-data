The variables `new_x` and `new_y` are assigned the values of `x1 + r` and `y1 + u`, respectively. However, the values of `r` and `u` are not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact values of `new_x` and `new_y`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `x1` and `y1` are non-negative integers, `x2` and `y2` are integers, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `pref_sums` is a list of lists with first inner list either [-1, 0] if s[0] is 'L' or [0, 0] if s[0] is neither 'L' nor 'R'; `new_x` is `x1 + r`, `new_y` is `y1 + u`.

Output State: **`x1` and `y1` are non-negative integers, `x2` and `y2` are integers, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `pref_sums` is a list of lists with first inner list either [-1, 0] if s[0] is 'L' or [0, 0] if s[0] is neither 'L' nor 'R'; `new_x` is `x1 + r`, `new_y` is `y1 + u`**
