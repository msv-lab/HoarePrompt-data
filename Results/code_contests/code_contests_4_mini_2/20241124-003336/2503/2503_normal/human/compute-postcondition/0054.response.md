The values of `u` and `r` are both assigned the value `0`, which means they remain unchanged since they were already `0`. The other variables `min_dist`, `i`, and `n` are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `min_dist` is assigned the value of `dist`, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, `u` is 0, `r` is 0.

Output State: **`min_dist` is assigned the value of `dist`, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, `u` is 0, `r` is 0**
