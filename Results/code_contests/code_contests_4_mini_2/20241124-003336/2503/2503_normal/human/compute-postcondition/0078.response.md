According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 0. In order for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must still be greater than 1, and `i` must be updated to 2 for the next iteration.

State: **`min_dist` is the initial value from `dist`, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `new_x` is calculated as `x1 + pref_sums[2][0]`, `new_y` is calculated as `y1 + pref_sums[2][1]`, and `dist` is calculated as `abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - n * cycles - 1**
