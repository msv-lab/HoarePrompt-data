According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop is set to iterate from `i = 1` to `i < n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `n` is greater than 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 4, and `n` must remain greater than 4 for the loop condition to still be satisfied.

Thus, we need to adjust the state of `n` to be greater than 4 and update `i` to 4.

State: **`min_dist` is assigned the value of `dist`, `i` is 4, `n` is greater than 4, `u` is 0, `r` is 0**
