The value of `dist` is calculated based on the absolute differences between `new_x` and `x2`, as well as `new_y` and `y2`, and then adjusted by subtracting `i` and 1. The previous values of `new_x`, `new_y`, `x2`, and `y2` are used for this calculation, while `min_dist`, `i`, and `n` remain unaffected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new calculated value of `dist`.

Output State: **`min_dist` is assigned the value of `dist`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `dist` is calculated as `abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - i - 1`**
