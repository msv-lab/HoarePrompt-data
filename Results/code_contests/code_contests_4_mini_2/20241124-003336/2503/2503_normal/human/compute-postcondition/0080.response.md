According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 1. This means that for the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least 3 so that `i` can be incremented to 3 on the next iteration.

No other states need to be adjusted since `min_dist`, `new_x`, and `new_y` would be recalculated in the loop body, and `dist` would also be recalculated based on those new values.

State: **`min_dist` is the initial value from `dist`, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `new_x` is calculated as `x1 + pref_sums[2][0]`, `new_y` is calculated as `y1 + pref_sums[2][1]`, `dist` is calculated as `abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - n * cycles - 1`**
