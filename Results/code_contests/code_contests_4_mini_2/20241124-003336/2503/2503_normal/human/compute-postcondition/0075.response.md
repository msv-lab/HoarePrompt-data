Postcondition: ***`min_dist` is the initial value from `dist`, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `new_x` is calculated as `x1 + pref_sums[0][0]`, `new_y` is calculated as `y1 + pref_sums[0][1]`, and `dist` is calculated as `abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - n * cycles - 1`. If `dist` is less than or equal to 0, the function prints `res + i + 1` and returns None. If `dist` is greater than 0, no action is taken and the function continues execution.***
