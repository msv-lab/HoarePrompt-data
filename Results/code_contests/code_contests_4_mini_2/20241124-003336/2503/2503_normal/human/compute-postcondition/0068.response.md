Postcondition: ***`min_dist` remains as the initial value from `dist`, `i` is the number of iterations executed, `n` is the length of the string `s`, `u` is the cumulative vertical movement, `r` is the cumulative horizontal movement, and `cycles` is calculated as (abs(x1 - x2) + abs(y1 - y2) - min_dist) // moves_toward. If the sum of the absolute differences between `x1` and `x2`, and `y1` and `y2`, minus `n` multiplied by `cycles` is less than or equal to 0, the program prints `res` and returns; otherwise, no action is taken in the else part. This ensures that if the calculated distance is manageable within the constraints defined by `n` and `cycles`, appropriate output is provided.***
