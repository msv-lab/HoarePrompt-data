To determine the output state, let's analyze the impact of the code provided.

1. The variable `new_x` is defined as `x1 + r` and `new_y` is defined as `y1 + u`. We are not provided with specific values for `r` and `u`, so we treat `new_x` and `new_y` as expressions involving `x1`, `y1`, `r`, and `u`.

2. The variable `dist` is then calculated as:
   \[
   dist = abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - 1
   \]
   Substituting the expressions for `new_x` and `new_y`, we can express `dist` as:
   \[
   dist = abs((x1 + r) - x2) + abs((y1 + u) - y2) - 1
   \]

Since no actual values are given for `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `r`, or `u`, we note that the calculation of `dist` depends on these variables. Therefore, the output state consists of the expressions used for calculating `dist`.

As a result, the output state can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`dist` is calculated as abs((x1 + r) - x2) + abs((y1 + u) - y2) - 1**
