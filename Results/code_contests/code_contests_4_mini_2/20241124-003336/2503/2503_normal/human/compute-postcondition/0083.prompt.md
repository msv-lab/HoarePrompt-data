You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for describing the functionality of a Python function. You will be provided with the constraints and relationships between the input parameters, as well as the resulting output of the function based on these inputs. Your task is to organize this information and describe the functionality of the function. Please avoid describing how the function operates or details such as how local variables are initialized—only describe what parameters the function accepts and what it returns. If there are multiple return points in the function we will split them in Cases with an arithmetic counter and remember if one case is fullfilled none of the others are. You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: **functionality**.


Example1:
Parameter constraints and relationships: `number` is an integer.
```
def func(number):
```
Output: `number` is an integer. If `number` is even, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer1:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `number`. `number` is an integer. After executing the function body, if number is even, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `number`, and if `number` is even, it returns True. If `number` is not even, it returns False.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter number, returns `True` if `number` is even. If `number` is not even, it returns `False`.**


Parameter constraints and relationships: `age` is an integer.
```
def func(age):
```
Output: Case_1:`number` is an integer. If `number` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative; 
        Case_2: `number` is an integer. If `number` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult".
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `age`. `age` is an integer. If `age` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative. If `age` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult". Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `age`  and return if the person is a minor or an adult based on the age while handling wrong negative input values.


Your Task:
Parameter constraints: (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are pairs of non-negative integers representing the initial and destination coordinates of the ship, respectively, where 0 ≤ x1, y1, x2, y2 ≤ 10^9; n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of the wind direction string s; and s is a string of length n consisting only of the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R'.
```
def func_2():
```
Output: Case_1: *`x1` and `y1` are non-negative integers, and `x2` and `y2` are integers. If `x1` is equal to `x2` and `y1` is equal to `y2`, the function prints 0 and returns None. If they are not equal, there is no output or return value specified, leaving the state of the program unchanged.

Case_2: *`dist` is calculated as abs((x1 + r) - x2) + abs((y1 + u) - y2) - 1. If `dist` is less than or equal to 0, the function prints 1 and returns. If `dist` is greater than 0, the function does not return anything and continues execution beyond the if statement.

Case_3: `min_dist` is assigned the minimum distance calculated from the movements encoded in `s`, `i` is the number of iterations executed (from 1 up to n-1), `n` is the length of the string `s`, `u` is the cumulative vertical movement, and `r` is the cumulative horizontal movement. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, the loop does not execute, and `min_dist` remains as the initial value assigned from `dist`. If at any iteration `dist` is less than or equal to 0, the program prints `i + 1` and returns immediately, ending execution. If `dist` is positive, the loop continues and updates `min_dist` accordingly.

Case_4: *`min_dist` remains as the initial value assigned from `dist`, `i` is the number of iterations executed, `n` is the length of the string `s`, `u` is the cumulative vertical movement, `r` is the cumulative horizontal movement, and `moves_toward` is calculated based on the current values of `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, `y2`, `new_x`, and `new_y`. If `moves_toward` is less than or equal to 0, the function prints -1 and returns None, indicating no valid movement is possible. Otherwise, there are no actions taken, and the state of the program remains unchanged.

Case_5: *`min_dist` remains as the initial value from `dist`, `i` is the number of iterations executed, `n` is the length of the string `s`, `u` is the cumulative vertical movement, `r` is the cumulative horizontal movement, and `cycles` is calculated as (abs(x1 - x2) + abs(y1 - y2) - min_dist) // moves_toward. If the sum of the absolute differences between `x1` and `x2`, and `y1` and `y2`, minus `n` multiplied by `cycles` is less than or equal to 0, the program prints `res` and returns; otherwise, no action is taken in the else part. This ensures that if the calculated distance is manageable within the constraints defined by `n` and `cycles`, appropriate output is provided.

Case_6: `min_dist` remains as the initial value from `dist`, `i` is less than `n`, `new_x` is calculated as `x1 + pref_sums[i][0]`, `new_y` is calculated as `y1 + pref_sums[i][1]`, and `dist` is calculated as `abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - n * cycles - 1`. If `dist` is less than or equal to 0, the function prints `res + i + 1` and returns. If `n` is 0 or less, the loop does not execute, and `i` remains 0, with `new_x`, `new_y`, and `dist` not being calculated. Additionally, if `n` is greater than 0 but the loop never meets the condition `dist <= 0`, no action is taken, and the function continues execution without printing or returning.

Case_7: The program returns nothing as the return statement is empty

Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?
