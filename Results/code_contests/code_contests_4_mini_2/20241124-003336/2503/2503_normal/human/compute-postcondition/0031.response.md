The code initializes the variables `u` and `r` to 0. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed, and the states of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the output state is: `min_dist` is assigned the value of `dist`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `u` is 0, `r` is 0.

Output State: **`min_dist` is assigned the value of `dist`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `u` is 0, `r` is 0**
