According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 2. Since `n` is greater than 2, we can conclude that `n` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust `n` to be at least 3, and `i` will be incremented to 3 in the next iteration.

State: **`min_dist` is assigned the value of `dist`, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, `u` is 0, `r` is 0**
