The code assigns the values from the input to the variables `x1` and `y1`. The `map(int, input().split())` function takes input from the user, splits it into separate values, and converts those values to integers. Since no specific values for `x1` and `y1` are provided, we can only state that they will hold the values taken from the input.

Output State: **`x1` and `y1` are assigned values from input as non-negative integers**.
