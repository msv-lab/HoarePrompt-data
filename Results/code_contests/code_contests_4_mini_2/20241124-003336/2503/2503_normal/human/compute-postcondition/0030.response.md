According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The for loop starts from `1` and goes up to `n - 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least `2`. Additionally, the variable `i` should be initialized to `1` at the start of the loop. The value of `min_dist` does not affect the execution of the loop. 

State: **`min_dist` is assigned the value of `dist`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1**
