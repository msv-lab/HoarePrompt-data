Output State: **`min_dist` is assigned the minimum distance calculated from the movements encoded in `s`, `i` is the number of iterations executed (from 1 up to n-1), `n` is the length of the string `s`, `u` is the cumulative vertical movement, and `r` is the cumulative horizontal movement. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, the loop does not execute, and `min_dist` remains as the initial value assigned from `dist`. If at any iteration `dist` is less than or equal to 0, the program prints `i + 1` and returns immediately, ending execution. If `dist` is positive, the loop continues and updates `min_dist` accordingly.**
