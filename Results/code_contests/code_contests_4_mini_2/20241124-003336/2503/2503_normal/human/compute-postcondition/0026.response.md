The code executes a print statement which outputs the value `1`. The calculation of `dist` is not affected by this operation, and its previous state remains unchanged. The output state reflects the unchanged value of `dist` and the new output from the print statement.

Output State: **`dist` is calculated as abs((x1 + r) - x2) + abs((y1 + u) - y2) - 1, and `dist` is less than or equal to 0; the output is 1**
