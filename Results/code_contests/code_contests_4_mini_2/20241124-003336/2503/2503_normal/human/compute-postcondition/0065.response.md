Postcondition: ***`min_dist` remains as the initial value assigned from `dist`, `i` is the number of iterations executed, `n` is the length of the string `s`, `u` is the cumulative vertical movement, `r` is the cumulative horizontal movement, `moves_toward` is calculated based on the current values of `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, `y2`, `new_x`, and `new_y`, `cycles` is calculated as (abs(x1 - x2) + abs(y1 - y2) - min_dist) // moves_toward; `x1` and `y1` are updated to `x1 + cycles * pref_sums[-1][0]` and `y1 + cycles * pref_sums[-1][1]` respectively, and the sum of the absolute differences (abs(x1 - x2) + abs(y1 - y2)) minus `n * cycles` is less than or equal to 0.***
