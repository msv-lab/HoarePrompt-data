The code assigns values to `new_x` and `new_y`. The values of `new_x` and `new_y` are computed based on the current values of `x1`, `y1`, and the elements of `pref_sums[i]`. The value of `pref_sums[i][0]` is added to `x1` to determine `new_x`, and the value of `pref_sums[i][1]` is added to `y1` to determine `new_y`. The initial values of `x1` and `y1` are not provided, but `pref_sums[i]` is updated based on the value of `s[i]`.

Since the initial state does not affect the calculation directly, the output state reflects the calculations made for `new_x` and `new_y`:

Output State: **`min_dist` is assigned the value of `dist`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `pref_sums[i]` is updated based on the value of `s[i]`, `new_x` is calculated as `x1 + pref_sums[i][0]`, `new_y` is calculated as `y1 + pref_sums[i][1]`**.
