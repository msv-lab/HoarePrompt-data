The variables `u` and `r` are both assigned the value `0`. The previous values of `min_dist`, `i`, and `n` are not changed by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the new values of `u` and `r`, while the others remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`min_dist` is assigned the value of `dist`, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `u` is 0, `r` is 0**
