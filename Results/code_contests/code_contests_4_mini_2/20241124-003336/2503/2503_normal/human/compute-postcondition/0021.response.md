Postcondition: ***`x1` and `y1` are non-negative integers, `x2` and `y2` are integers, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, and `pref_sums` is a list of lists with `n` inner lists, each containing [0, 0]. If the first character of `s` is 'L', then `r` is set to -1 and `u` remains 0. If the first character of `s` is neither 'L' nor 'R', the values of `r` and `u` remain unchanged at 0.***
