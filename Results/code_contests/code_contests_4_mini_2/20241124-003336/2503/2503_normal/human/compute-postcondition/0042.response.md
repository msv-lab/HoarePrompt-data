The variable `r` is assigned the value of `-1`. The previous value of `r` was 0, and the other variables (`min_dist`, `i`, `n`, `s[i]`, and `u`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_dist` is assigned the value of `dist`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `s[i]` is 'L', `u` remains 0, and `r` is -1.

Output State: **`min_dist` is assigned the value of `dist`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `s[i]` is 'L', `u` remains 0, and `r` is -1**
