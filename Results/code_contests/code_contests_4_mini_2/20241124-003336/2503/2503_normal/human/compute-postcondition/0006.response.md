The code assigns the value of `n` to be the integer conversion of the input received. Since this operation does not affect any other variables, and no additional conditions or outputs are specified for the previous state of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`, the output state will reflect the input state with the new variable `n`.

Output State: **`x1` and `y1` are non-negative integers, `x2` and `y2` are integers, and `n` is an input integer**
