The code executes the print statement, which outputs the value of `i + 1`. Given that `i` is initially 1, the calculation yields `1 + 1 = 2`. The values of `min_dist`, `n`, and `dist` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `min_dist` is assigned the value of `dist`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, and `dist` is less than or equal to 0, and the print statement outputs 2.

Output State: **`min_dist` is assigned the value of `dist`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `dist` is less than or equal to 0, and the print statement outputs 2**.
