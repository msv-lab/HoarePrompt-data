The value of `u` is assigned the value `1`. The previous value of `u` was `0`, so after execution, `u` becomes `1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_dist` is assigned the value of `dist`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `u` is 1, `r` is 0, and the element at index `i` of `s` is 'U'.

Output State: **`min_dist` is assigned the value of `dist`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `u` is 1, `r` is 0, and the element at index `i` of `s` is 'U'**.
