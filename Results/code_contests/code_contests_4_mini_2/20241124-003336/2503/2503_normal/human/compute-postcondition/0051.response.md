In the given for loop, the variable `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 with each iteration until it is no longer less than `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 1
- `n` is greater than 1

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`. Given that `i` is currently 1 and `n` is greater than 1, the loop can continue executing. However, we need to adjust the values of `i` and ensure the condition regarding `n` holds true for the next iteration.

After the current iteration:
- `i` will increment to 2 in the next iteration.
- To ensure that the loop can execute again, `n` must be at least 3, which is the minimum for `i` (now 2) to still be less than `n`.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be adjusted to 2.
- `n` should be adjusted to be greater than 2.

State: **`min_dist` is assigned the value of `dist`, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2**
