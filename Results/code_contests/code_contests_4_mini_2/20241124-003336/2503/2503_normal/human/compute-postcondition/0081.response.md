Output State: **`min_dist` remains as the initial value from `dist`, `i` is less than `n`, `new_x` is calculated as `x1 + pref_sums[i][0]`, `new_y` is calculated as `y1 + pref_sums[i][1]`, and `dist` is calculated as `abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - n * cycles - 1`. If `dist` is less than or equal to 0, the function prints `res + i + 1` and returns. If `n` is 0 or less, the loop does not execute, and `i` remains 0, with `new_x`, `new_y`, and `dist` not being calculated. Additionally, if `n` is greater than 0 but the loop never meets the condition `dist <= 0`, no action is taken, and the function continues execution without printing or returning.**
