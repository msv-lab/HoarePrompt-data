The function `func_2` accepts four parameters: `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` which are pairs of non-negative integers representing the initial and destination coordinates of the ship, respectively, with constraints that 0 ≤ x1, y1, x2, y2 ≤ 10^9; `n` which is a positive integer representing the length of the wind direction string `s`, constrained by 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; and `s`, a string consisting solely of the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R' with a length of `n`.

The function has several cases for output and return values:
- Case 1: If `x1` equals `x2` and `y1` equals `y2`, the function prints `0` and returns `None`. If they are not equal, there is no output or return value specified, leaving the state of the program unchanged.
- Case 2: If the calculated distance `dist` is less than or equal to `0`, the function prints `1` and returns. If `dist` is greater than `0`, the function does not return anything and continues execution.
- Case 3: If `n` is less than or equal to `1`, the loop does not execute, and `min_dist` remains as initially assigned from `dist`. If at any iteration `dist` is less than or equal to `0`, the program prints `i + 1` and returns immediately. If `dist` is positive, the loop continues and updates `min_dist`.
- Case 4: If `moves_toward` is less than or equal to `0`, the function prints `-1` and returns `None`, indicating no valid movement is possible. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.
- Case 5: If certain conditions regarding `cycles` and distances are met, the program prints `res` and returns; otherwise, no action is taken.
- Case 6: If `dist` is less than or equal to `0`, the function prints `res + i + 1` and returns. If the conditions for the loop are not met, the function continues execution without printing or returning.
- Case 7: The program returns nothing as the return statement is empty.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) as pairs of non-negative integers representing coordinates, a positive integer n representing the length of a directional string s, and the string s itself. The function prints various outputs and handles movement calculations based on the given parameters while potentially returning None or maintaining the program state unchanged.**
