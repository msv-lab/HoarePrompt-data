Postcondition: ***`min_dist` is assigned the value of `dist`, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1. If `s[i]` is 'L', then `r` is set to -1, `u` remains 0. If `s[i]` is 'R', then `u` remains 0 and `r` is set to 1. If `s[i]` is 'D', then `u` is set to -1 and `r` remains 0. If `s[i]` is neither 'L', 'R', nor 'D', both `u` and `r` remain 0.***
