Postcondition: ***`min_dist` remains as the initial value assigned from `dist`, `i` is the number of iterations executed, `n` is the length of the string `s`, `u` is the cumulative vertical movement, `r` is the cumulative horizontal movement, and `moves_toward` is less than or equal to 0, computed based on the current values of `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, `y2`, `new_x`, and `new_y`.***
