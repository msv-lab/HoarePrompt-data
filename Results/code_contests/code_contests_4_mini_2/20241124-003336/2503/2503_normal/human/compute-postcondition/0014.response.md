The value of `u` is assigned the value `-1`, which changes its previous state. The states of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `x1` and `y1` are non-negative integers, `x2` and `y2` are integers, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `pref_sums` is a list of lists with `n` inner lists, each containing [0, 0]; `u` is -1, `r` is 0; the first character of `s` is 'D'.
