According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The loop variable `i` will start from 0 and increment by 1 up to `n - 1`. 

In the context provided, `min_dist` remains as the initial value from `dist`, which does not affect loop execution. The state of `i` before the loop starts should be initialized to 0, indicating the first iteration. 

To ensure that the loop executes, `n` must be greater than 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute correctly, we need to set the following states:

State: **`min_dist` remains as the initial value from `dist`, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0**
