The variables `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from the input, which are converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The values of `x1` and `y1` remain unchanged as they were assigned values from input previously. Therefore, the output state incorporates the new values of `x2` and `y2`, while `x1` and `y1` retain their original values.

Output State: **`x1` and `y1` are assigned values from input as non-negative integers; `x2` and `y2` are assigned values from a new input as integers.**
