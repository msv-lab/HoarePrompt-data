The code initializes a list of lists called `pref_sums`, where the outer list has a length of `n`. Each inner list contains two zeros. The variables `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `n`, and `s` are not affected by this operation. The only change is the creation of `pref_sums`. The value of `n` determines the number of inner lists, but it does not affect the other variables.

Output State: **`x1` and `y1` are non-negative integers, `x2` and `y2` are integers, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, and `pref_sums` is a list of lists with `n` inner lists, each containing [0, 0]**
