According to the code, the loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0, which means the loop can execute again. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Since `n` is greater than 0, it implies that `i` will be less than `n` after this increment.

No other states need to be adjusted as `min_dist`, `new_x`, `new_y`, and `dist` do not change until the loop body is executed. 

State: **`min_dist` is the initial value from `dist`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `new_x` is calculated as `x1 + pref_sums[1][0]`, `new_y` is calculated as `y1 + pref_sums[1][1]`, and `dist` is calculated as `abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - n * cycles - 1`.**
