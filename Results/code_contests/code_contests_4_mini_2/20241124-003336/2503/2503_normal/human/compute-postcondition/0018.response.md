Postcondition: ***`x1` and `y1` are non-negative integers, `x2` and `y2` are integers, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `pref_sums` is a list of lists with `n` inner lists, each containing [0, 0]. If the first character of `s` is 'R', then `r` is set to 1 while `u` remains 0. If the first character of `s` is not 'R', the value of `r` remains 0 and `u` also remains 0.***
