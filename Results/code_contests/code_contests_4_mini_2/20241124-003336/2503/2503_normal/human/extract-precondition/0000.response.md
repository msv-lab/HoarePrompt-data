Precondition: **(x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are pairs of non-negative integers representing the initial and destination coordinates of the ship, respectively, where 0 ≤ x1, y1, x2, y2 ≤ 10^9; n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of the wind direction string s; and s is a string of length n consisting only of the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R'.**
