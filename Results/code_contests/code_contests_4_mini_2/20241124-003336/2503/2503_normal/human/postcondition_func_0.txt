The function accepts two integers `x` and `y`, and returns their greatest common divisor (GCD). If `y` is initially 0, the function immediately returns `x`, as the GCD of any number and 0 is the number itself. The function uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the GCD, iterating until `y` becomes 0, at which point `x` will hold the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`.
