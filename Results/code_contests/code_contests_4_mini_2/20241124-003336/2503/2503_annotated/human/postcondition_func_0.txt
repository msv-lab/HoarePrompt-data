The function accepts two integer parameters `x` and `y`, and returns the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `x` and `y`. If `y` is initially 0, it will return the unchanged value of `x`, which is consistent with the mathematical definition of gcd. The function effectively handles cases where either `x` or `y` is zero, returning the other value as appropriate.
