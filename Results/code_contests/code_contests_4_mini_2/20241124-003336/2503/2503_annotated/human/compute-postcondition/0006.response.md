The value of `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects that `n` is now an input integer while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x1` is an integer, `y1` is an integer, `x2` is an integer, `y2` is an integer, `n` is an input integer**
