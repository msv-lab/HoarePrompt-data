Postcondition: ***`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are integers, `n` is greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `pref_sums` is a list of length `n` containing `n` inner lists each with two zeros, `min_dist` is assigned the value of `dist`, `i` is 1. If the character at index `i` of the string `s` is 'R', then `r` is set to 1 and `u` remains unchanged. For any other character at index `i`, both `u` and `r` retain their prior values. This ensures that the modifications to `r` only occur when 'R' is present, while all other characters leave `r` and `u` unchanged.***
