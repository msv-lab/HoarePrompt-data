To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the provided state and the loop structure.

1. The loop is defined with `for i in range(1, n)`. This means that for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1. If `n` is 0 or 1, the loop will not run at all.
2. The loop variable `i` starts from 1, so its initial value at the beginning of the first iteration will be 1.

Given these points, we can conclude:

- `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute.
- The initial state of `i` is not explicitly given before the loop, but it will be 1 when the loop starts.

Thus, the necessary adjustments to the state before the loop execution must include that `n` is greater than 1 and that `i` is initialized to 1 (though it will be set by the loop's range).

State: **`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are integers, `n` is greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `pref_sums` is a list of length `n` containing `n` inner lists each with two zeros, `min_dist` is assigned the value of `dist`, `i` is 1**
