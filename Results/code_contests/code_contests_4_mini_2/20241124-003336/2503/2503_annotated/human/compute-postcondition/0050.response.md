Postcondition: ***`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are integers; `n` is greater than 1; `s` is an input string; `pref_sums` is a list of length `n` containing `n` inner lists each with two zeros; if `dist` is less than or equal to 0, the program prints `i + 1` (which evaluates to 2) and returns. If `dist` is greater than 0, no action is taken.***
