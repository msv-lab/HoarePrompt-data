According to the code, the loop will execute for values of `i` starting from 1 and going up to `n-1`. To execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be less than `n-1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is such that it must have reached `1` (since it starts from `1`), and the loop can execute while `i < n`. If `n` is greater than `1`, then the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `n-1`.

If the loop has executed for `i = 1`, then for the next iteration, `i` would be incremented to `2`. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than `2` (so that `i` can still be less than `n`).

Also, since `dist` impacts the flow of the program, we need to ensure that `dist` > 0 in order for the loop not to prematurely terminate.

State: **`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are integers; `n` is greater than 2; `s` is an input string; `pref_sums` is a list of length `n` containing `n` inner lists each with two zeros; `dist` is greater than 0; `i` is 2**
