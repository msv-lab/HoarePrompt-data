According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. The range function `range(1, n)` indicates that the loop starts from `1` and goes up to `n - 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, and `n` is greater than 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to `4`. Additionally, since `n` is greater than 3, it allows for `i` to take the value of `4` while still being less than `n`.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments for the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop are:
- `i` needs to be updated to `4`.

Other variables (`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `s`, `pref_sums`, `dist`, `u`, `r`) do not need any changes since they are not affected by the loop control.

State: **`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are integers; `n` is greater than 3; `s` is an input string; `pref_sums` is a list of length `n` containing `n` inner lists each with two zeros; `dist` is greater than 0; `i` is 4; `u` is 0, `r` is 0**
