Postcondition: ***`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, and `n` are defined variables; `n` is greater than 0, and the absolute distance between `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` exceeds `n * cycles`. If the calculated `dist` is less than or equal to 0, the function prints `res + i + 1` and returns. Otherwise, the function does not execute any action and effectively returns None, as there is no specified return value.***
