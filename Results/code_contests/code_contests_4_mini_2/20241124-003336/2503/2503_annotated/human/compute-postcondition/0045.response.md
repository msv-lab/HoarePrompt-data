The values of `new_x` and `new_y` are assigned based on the calculations involving `x1`, `y1`, and the updated `pref_sums` list. Specifically, `new_x` is calculated as `x1 + pref_sums[i][0]`, and `new_y` is calculated as `y1 + pref_sums[i][1]`. The values of `pref_sums[i][0]` and `pref_sums[i][1]` are derived from the previous `pref_sums[i - 1]` values, which are the sums of `r` and `u` added to the respective elements of `pref_sums[i - 1]`. 

Therefore, after execution, the output state reflects the values of `new_x` and `new_y` based on the computations involving `x1`, `y1`, and the previous sums.

Output State: **`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are integers; `n` is greater than 1; `s` is an input string; `pref_sums` is a list of length `n` containing `n` inner lists each with two zeros; `min_dist` is assigned the value of `dist`; `i` is 1; `new_x` is `x1 + pref_sums[1][0]`; `new_y` is `y1 + pref_sums[1][1]`**
