The value of `u` is assigned -1. Other variables (`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `n`, `s`, `pref_sums`, `min_dist`, `i`, `r`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are integers, `n` is greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `pref_sums` is a list of length `n` containing `n` inner lists each with two zeros, `min_dist` is assigned the value of `dist`, `i` is 1, the character at index `i` of the string `s` is 'D', `u` is -1, and `r` remains unchanged.
