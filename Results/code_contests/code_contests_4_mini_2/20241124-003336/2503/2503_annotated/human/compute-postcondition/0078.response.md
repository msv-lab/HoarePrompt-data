According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `n` is greater than `i + 1`, which implies that `i` is currently less than `n - 1`. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `i + 1`, and we need to ensure that `n` remains greater than this new value of `i`. 

As a result, we adjust the state for the next iteration as follows:
- `n` must still be greater than the updated value of `i`, which will be `i + 1`.
- The values of `new_x` and `new_y` remain valid as they are based on `x1`, `y1`, and `pref_sums[i][0]`, `pref_sums[i][1]`, which do not change due to the loop's continuation.

Therefore, the only necessary adjustment is to increment `i` by 1 in our state representation.

State: **`x1` is defined, `y1` is defined, `x2` is defined, `y2` is defined, `n` is greater than `i + 2`, `new_x` is `x1 + pref_sums[i][0]`, `new_y` is `y1 + pref_sums[i][1]`**
