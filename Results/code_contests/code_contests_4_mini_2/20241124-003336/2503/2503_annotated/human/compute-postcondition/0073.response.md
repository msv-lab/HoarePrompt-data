Output State: **`x1` and `y1` are updated; `x2` and `y2` are defined; `n` is greater than 0; the absolute distance between `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` is greater than `n * cycles`; `i` is 0; `new_x` is `x1 + pref_sums[0][0]`; `new_y` is `y1 + pref_sums[0][1]`; `dist` is less than or equal to 0; and the output is `res + i + 1`.**
