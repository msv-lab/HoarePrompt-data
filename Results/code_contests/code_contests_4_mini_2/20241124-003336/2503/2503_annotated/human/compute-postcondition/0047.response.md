Postcondition: ***`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are integers; `n` is greater than 1; `s` is an input string; `pref_sums` is a list of length `n` containing `n` inner lists each with two zeros; `min_dist` is assigned the value of `dist`; `i` is 1; `new_x` is `x1 + pref_sums[1][0]`; `new_y` is `y1 + pref_sums[1][1]`; `dist` is less than or equal to 0.***
