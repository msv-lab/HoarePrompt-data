The code `print(0)` outputs the value `0` to the console but does not change the state of any variables. The values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are integers; `x1` is equal to `x2` and `y1` is equal to `y2`, and the value 0 is printed.

Output State: **`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are integers; `x1` is equal to `x2` and `y1` is equal to `y2`, and the value 0 is printed.**
