Postcondition: ***`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are integers, `n` is greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `pref_sums` is a list of length `n` containing `n` inner lists each with two zeros, `min_dist` is assigned the value of `dist`, `i` is 1. If the character at index `i` of the string `s` is 'L', then `r` is set to -1; otherwise, if `s[i]` is not 'L', the values of `r` and `u` remain unchanged. This ensures that `r` is modified only when the character is 'L' while all other characters leave `r` and `u` in their prior state.***
