The function `func_2` accepts the following parameters: `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, which are integers representing the initial and destination coordinates of the ship; `n`, which is an integer representing the length of the direction string; and `s`, which is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R'. 

The function includes several cases for its execution:

- **Case 1:** If `x1` is equal to `x2` and `y1` is equal to `y2`, it prints `0` and returns `None`. If they are not equal, no action is taken, and the function proceeds without returning any value.
  
- **Case 2:** If the distance `dist` is less than or equal to `0`, it prints `1` and returns `None`. If `dist` is greater than `0`, no further action is taken.

- **Case 3:** If `n` is less than `2`, the function does not execute the loop, and `pref_sums` remains unchanged. If `n` is `2` or greater and `dist` is less than or equal to `0` after the first iteration, it prints `2` and returns. If `dist` is greater than `0`, the loop continues, updating `pref_sums` and recalculating `dist`.

- **Case 4:** If `moves_toward` is less than or equal to `0`, the function prints `-1` and returns `None`. If `moves_toward` is greater than `0`, the program continues executing.

- **Case 5:** It calculates `res` based on `n` and `cycles`, and if the absolute distance between the current position and destination is less than or equal to `n * cycles`, it prints `res` and returns. Otherwise, it continues execution without output.

- **Case 6:** If `n` is less than or equal to `0`, no output is generated. If `n` is greater than `0`, after the loop executes, `new_x` and `new_y` are calculated. If `dist` is less than or equal to `0` during the iterations, it prints `res + i + 1` and returns. If not, it effectively returns `None`.

- **Case 7:** The function will return `None` after execution, with `new_x` and `new_y` reflecting their final computed values if `n` is greater than `0`; otherwise, there is no output generated.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` (integers for coordinates), `n` (an integer for the length of the direction string), and `s` (a string of directions). It performs various checks and prints specific values based on conditions, returning `None` in multiple cases without producing further output.**
