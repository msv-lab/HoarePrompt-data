To evaluate the impact of the code on the program, we need to calculate the values of `new_x` and `new_y` based on the initial state and the string `s`. 

1. We have the initial positions `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` which are integers.
2. The variable `s` is an input string that affects the values of `r` and `u`.
3. `r` is set to -1 and `u` is set to 0 if the first character of `s` is 'L'. Otherwise, `r` and `u` remain unchanged.
4. `new_x` is computed as `x1 + r` and `new_y` as `y1 + u`.
5. The `dist` variable is calculated using the formula `abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - 1`.

Depending on whether the first character of `s` is 'L' or not, we will have different values for `new_x` and `new_y`. 

If `s[0]` is 'L':
- `new_x = x1 - 1`
- `new_y = y1 + 0` (which is simply `y1`)

If `s[0]` is not 'L':
- `new_x = x1`
- `new_y = y1`

Now we compute `dist` for both cases:
- For `s[0]` being 'L': 
  - `dist = abs((x1 - 1) - x2) + abs(y1 - y2) - 1`
  
- For `s[0]` not being 'L': 
  - `dist = abs(x1 - x2) + abs(y1 - y2) - 1`

Since we do not have specific values for `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, or `s`, the output will reflect that there are two possible scenarios depending on the first character of `s`.

Output State: **`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are integers; `n` is an integer; `s` is an input string; `pref_sums` is a list of length `n` containing `n` inner lists, each with two zeros; if the first character of `s` is 'L', `new_x` is `x1 - 1`, `new_y` is `y1`; if not, `new_x` is `x1`, `new_y` is `y1`; `dist` is either `abs((x1 - 1) - x2) + abs(y1 - y2) - 1` or `abs(x1 - x2) + abs(y1 - y2) - 1`.**
