The values of `u` and `r` are both assigned the value of `0`. Since they were both already `0`, their values remain unchanged. The other variables (`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `n`, `s`, `pref_sums`, `dist`, `i`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are integers; `n` is greater than 3; `s` is an input string; `pref_sums` is a list of length `n` containing `n` inner lists each with two zeros; `dist` is greater than 0; `i` is 3; `u` is 0, `r` is 0.
