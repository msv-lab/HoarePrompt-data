The values of `x1` and `y1` are updated based on the current values of `x1`, `y1`, `cycles`, and the last element of `pref_sums`. Specifically, `x1` is incremented by `cycles * pref_sums[-1][0]`, and `y1` is incremented by `cycles * pref_sums[-1][1]`. The initial state does not specify the values of `x1`, `y1`, `cycles`, or `pref_sums`, but we know `res` is calculated as `n * cycles`. Therefore, the output state reflects the changes made to `x1` and `y1`.

Output State: **`x1` is updated to `x1 + cycles * pref_sums[-1][0]`, `y1` is updated to `y1 + cycles * pref_sums[-1][1]`, and `res` is calculated as `n * cycles`**.
