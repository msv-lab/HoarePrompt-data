The value of `r` is assigned `-1`, which changes its previous value. Other variables (`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `n`, `s`, and `pref_sums`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are integers, `n` is an integer, `s` is an input string, `pref_sums` is a list of length `n` containing `n` inner lists, each with two zeros, `r` is -1, and `u` remains 0.
