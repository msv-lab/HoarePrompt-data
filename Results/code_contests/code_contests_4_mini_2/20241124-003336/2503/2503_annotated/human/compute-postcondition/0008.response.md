The code creates a list of lists called `pref_sums`, where each inner list contains two zeros. The outer list has a length of `n`, which is an input integer. The previous values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, and `s` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `x1` is an integer, `y1` is an integer, `x2` is an integer, `y2` is an integer, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, and `pref_sums` is a list of length `n` containing `n` inner lists, each with two zeros.

Output State: **`x1` is an integer, `y1` is an integer, `x2` is an integer, `y2` is an integer, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, and `pref_sums` is a list of length `n` containing `n` inner lists, each with two zeros.**
