The variable `res` is assigned the value of `n * cycles`. The values of `n` and `cycles` are used directly in the multiplication. The previous values of `moves_toward`, `cycles`, and `n` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects that `res` has been calculated based on the existing values of `n` and `cycles`.

Output State: **`res` is calculated as n * cycles**
