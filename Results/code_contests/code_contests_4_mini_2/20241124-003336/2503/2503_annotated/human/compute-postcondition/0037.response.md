Postcondition: ***`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are integers, `n` is greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `pref_sums` is a list of length `n` containing `n` inner lists each with two zeros, `min_dist` is assigned the value of `dist`, `i` is 1. If the character at index `i` of the string `s` is 'D', then `u` is set to -1 and `r` remains unchanged. If `s[i]` is not 'D', then `u` remains unchanged and `r` also remains unchanged. This ensures that the values of `u` and `r` are only modified if the specific condition for 'D' is met, while for any other character, they retain their prior values.***
