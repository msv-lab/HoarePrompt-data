Output State: **`x1` is updated to `x1 + cycles * pref_sums[-1][0]`, `y1` is updated to `y1 + cycles * pref_sums[-1][1]`, `res` is calculated as `n * cycles`, and the sum of the absolute differences `abs(x1 - x2) + abs(y1 - y2)` is less than or equal to `n * cycles`, and the function prints `res`.**
