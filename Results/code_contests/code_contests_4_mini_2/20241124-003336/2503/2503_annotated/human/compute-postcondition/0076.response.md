According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0. Since `i` starts at 0 and increments with each iteration, to execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be less than `n`. 

Assuming the last value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration is `i`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Thus, `i` will now be `i + 1`. 

The state of `n` remains unchanged, but `i` needs to be adjusted to reflect that it has been incremented. 

State: **`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, and `n` are defined variables; `n` is greater than `i + 1`**
