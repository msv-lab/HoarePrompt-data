Postcondition: ***`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are integers; `n` is an integer; `s` is an input string; `pref_sums` is a list of length `n` containing `n` inner lists, each with two zeros. If `dist` is less than or equal to 0, the program prints 1 and returns None. If `dist` is greater than 0, the program does not execute any further action as there is no else part specified.***
