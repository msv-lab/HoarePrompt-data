Postcondition: ***`moves_toward` is calculated based on the absolute differences between the coordinates and the value of `n`. If `moves_toward` is less than or equal to 0, the function prints -1 and returns None. If `moves_toward` is greater than 0, the program does not perform any action and continues executing beyond this block.***
