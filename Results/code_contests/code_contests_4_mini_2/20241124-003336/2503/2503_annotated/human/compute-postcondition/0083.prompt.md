You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for describing the functionality of a Python function. You will be provided with the constraints and relationships between the input parameters, as well as the resulting output of the function based on these inputs. Your task is to organize this information and describe the functionality of the function. Please avoid describing how the function operates or details such as how local variables are initialized—only describe what parameters the function accepts and what it returns. If there are multiple return points in the function we will split them in Cases with an arithmetic counter and remember if one case is fullfilled none of the others are. You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: **functionality**.


Example1:
Parameter constraints and relationships: `number` is an integer.
```
def func(number):
```
Output: `number` is an integer. If `number` is even, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer1:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `number`. `number` is an integer. After executing the function body, if number is even, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `number`, and if `number` is even, it returns True. If `number` is not even, it returns False.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter number, returns `True` if `number` is even. If `number` is not even, it returns `False`.**


Parameter constraints and relationships: `age` is an integer.
```
def func(age):
```
Output: Case_1:`number` is an integer. If `number` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative; 
        Case_2: `number` is an integer. If `number` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult".
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `age`. `age` is an integer. If `age` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative. If `age` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult". Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `age`  and return if the person is a minor or an adult based on the age while handling wrong negative input values.


Your Task:
Parameter constraints: (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are integers representing the initial and destination coordinates of the ship, respectively, where 0 ≤ x1, y1, x2, y2 ≤ 10^9; n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; and s is a string of length n consisting only of the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R'.
```
def func_2():
```
Output: Case_1: *`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are integers. If `x1` is equal to `x2` and `y1` is equal to `y2`, the function prints 0 and returns None. If `x1` is not equal to `x2` or `y1` is not equal to `y2`, no action is taken and the function proceeds without returning any value.

Case_2: *`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are integers; `n` is an integer; `s` is an input string; `pref_sums` is a list of length `n` containing `n` inner lists, each with two zeros. If `dist` is less than or equal to 0, the program prints 1 and returns None. If `dist` is greater than 0, the program does not execute any further action as there is no else part specified.

Case_3: If n is less than 2, the loop does not execute, and `pref_sums` remains a list of length `n` with all inner lists as [0, 0]. If n is 2 or greater and dist is less than or equal to 0 after the first iteration, it prints 2 and returns. If dist is greater than 0, the loop continues updating `pref_sums` and recalculating `dist` based on the directions provided in `s`. After the loop executes, `pref_sums` contains the cumulative sums of movements based on `s`, `dist` reflects the current distance to (x2, y2) minus the loop index and one, and `min_dist` is updated if a smaller distance is found.

Case_4: *`moves_toward` is calculated based on the absolute differences between the coordinates and the value of `n`. If `moves_toward` is less than or equal to 0, the function prints -1 and returns None. If `moves_toward` is greater than 0, the program does not perform any action and continues executing beyond this block.

Case_5: *`x1` and `y1` are updated based on the cycles and the last values in `pref_sums`, and `res` is calculated as `n * cycles`. If the absolute distance between `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` is less than or equal to `n * cycles`, the function prints `res` and returns without any output. If the condition is not met, the function does not execute the print statement or return, effectively continuing execution without any output.

Case_6: `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, and `n` are defined variables; if `n` is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute and no output is generated. If `n` is greater than 0, after executing the loop up to `n` times, `new_x` will be the cumulative sum of `x1` and the first `n` elements from the first column of `pref_sums`, while `new_y` will be the cumulative sum of `y1` and the first `n` elements from the second column of `pref_sums`. If at any iteration `dist` is less than or equal to 0, the function will print `res + i + 1` and return. Otherwise, after completing the loop without meeting the condition, the function will effectively return None, and `new_x`, `new_y` will reflect their final computed values after the loop execution.

Case_7: The program returns None, with new_x and new_y reflecting their cumulative sums after the loop execution, if n is greater than 0; otherwise, there is no output generated.

Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?
