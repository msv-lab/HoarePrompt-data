The code snippet prints the value of `i + 1`. Given that the initial state specifies `i` is 1, we can calculate `i + 1` as follows:

1. The previous value of `i` is 1.
2. Therefore, `i + 1` equals `1 + 1`, which is `2`.

The output does not change the values of any other variables, so the output state only reflects the printed value. 

Output State: **`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are integers; `n` is greater than 1; `s` is an input string; `pref_sums` is a list of length `n` containing `n` inner lists each with two zeros; `min_dist` is assigned the value of `dist`; `i` is 1; `new_x` is `x1 + pref_sums[1][0]`; `new_y` is `y1 + pref_sums[1][1]`; `dist` is less than or equal to 0, and the output is 2**
