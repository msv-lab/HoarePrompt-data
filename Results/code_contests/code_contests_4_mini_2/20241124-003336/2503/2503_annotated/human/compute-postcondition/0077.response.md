The variables `new_x` and `new_y` are assigned the values based on the current values of `x1`, `y1`, and the elements of the `pref_sums` list indexed by `i`. The value of `new_x` becomes `x1 + pref_sums[i][0]`, and `new_y` becomes `y1 + pref_sums[i][1]`. The values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x1` is defined, `y1` is defined, `x2` is defined, `y2` is defined, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `new_x` is `x1 + pref_sums[i][0]`, `new_y` is `y1 + pref_sums[i][1]`.

Output State: **`x1` is defined, `y1` is defined, `x2` is defined, `y2` is defined, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `new_x` is `x1 + pref_sums[i][0]`, `new_y` is `y1 + pref_sums[i][1]`**
