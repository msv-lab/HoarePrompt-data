Postcondition: ***`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are integers; `n` is an integer; `s` is an input string; `pref_sums` is a list of length `n` containing `n` inner lists, each with two zeros; `dist` is less than or equal to 0. If the first character of `s` is 'L', then `new_x` is `x1 - 1` and `new_y` is `y1`; otherwise, `new_x` is `x1` and `new_y` is `y1`.***
