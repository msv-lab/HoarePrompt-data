Output State: **`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are integers, `n` is greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `pref_sums` is a list of length `n` containing `n` inner lists each with two zeros, `min_dist` is assigned the value of `dist`, `i` is 1, and `pref_sums[i]` is updated to `[pref_sums[i - 1][0] + r, pref_sums[i - 1][1] + u]` based on the values of `r` and `u`.**
