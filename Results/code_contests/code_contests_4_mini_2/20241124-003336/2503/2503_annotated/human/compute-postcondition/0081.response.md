Output State: **`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, and `n` are defined variables; if `n` is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute and no output is generated. If `n` is greater than 0, after executing the loop up to `n` times, `new_x` will be the cumulative sum of `x1` and the first `n` elements from the first column of `pref_sums`, while `new_y` will be the cumulative sum of `y1` and the first `n` elements from the second column of `pref_sums`. If at any iteration `dist` is less than or equal to 0, the function will print `res + i + 1` and return. Otherwise, after completing the loop without meeting the condition, the function will effectively return None, and `new_x`, `new_y` will reflect their final computed values after the loop execution.**
