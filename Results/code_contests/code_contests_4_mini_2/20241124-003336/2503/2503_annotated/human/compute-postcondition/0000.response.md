The code assigns the values obtained from `input().split()` converted to integers to the variables `x1` and `y1`. Since `input()` accepts user input, the specific values for `x1` and `y1` will be determined by the user at runtime. Other variables, such as `x2`, `y2`, `n`, and `s`, remain unaffected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects the new values of `x1` and `y1`, which are integers based on user input.

Output State: **`x1` is an integer from input, `y1` is an integer from input**
