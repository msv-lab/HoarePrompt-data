Postcondition: ***`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are integers, `n` is greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `pref_sums` is a list of length `n` containing `n` inner lists each with two zeros, `min_dist` is assigned the value of `dist`, `i` is 1, if the character at index `i` of the string `s` is 'U', then `u` is set to 1 and `r` remains 0; otherwise, `u` remains 0 and `r` remains unchanged.***
