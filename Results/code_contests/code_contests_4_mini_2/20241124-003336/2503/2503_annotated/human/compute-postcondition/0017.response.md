The value of `r` is assigned the value `1`. The initial state indicates that `r` was previously `0`, and now it changes to `1`. Other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `r` while maintaining the previous values of the other variables.

Output State: **`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are integers, `n` is an integer, `s` is an input string, `pref_sums` is a list of length `n` containing `n` inner lists, each with two zeros, the first character of `s` is 'R', `u` remains 0, and `r` is 1.**
