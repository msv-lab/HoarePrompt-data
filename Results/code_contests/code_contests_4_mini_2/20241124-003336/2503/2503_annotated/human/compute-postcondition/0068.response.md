Postcondition: ***`x1` and `y1` are updated based on the cycles and the last values in `pref_sums`, and `res` is calculated as `n * cycles`. If the absolute distance between `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` is less than or equal to `n * cycles`, the function prints `res` and returns without any output. If the condition is not met, the function does not execute the print statement or return, effectively continuing execution without any output.***
