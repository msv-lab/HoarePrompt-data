Postcondition: ***`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are integers, `n` is an integer, `s` is an input string, and `pref_sums` is a list of length `n` containing `n` inner lists, each with two zeros. If the first character of `s` is 'L', then `r` is set to -1 and `u` remains 0. If the first character of `s` is not 'L', `r` remains unchanged and `u` also remains unchanged.***
