The values of `r` and `u` are determined based on the first character of the string `s`. If the first character of `s` is 'L', then `r` is assigned the value -1 and `u` is assigned the value 0. If the first character is not 'L', `r` and `u` remain unchanged.

The variables `new_x` and `new_y` are then calculated as follows:
- `new_x` is assigned the value `x1 + r`
- `new_y` is assigned the value `y1 + u`

Since the initial state only specifies that `r` and `u` may change depending on the character in `s`, we can summarize the output state accordingly. If `s` starts with 'L', then `r` is -1 and `u` is 0, leading to changes in `new_x` and `new_y`. If `s` does not start with 'L', `new_x` and `new_y` will be equal to `x1` and `y1` respectively.

Output State: **`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are integers; `n` is an integer; `s` is an input string; `pref_sums` is a list of length `n` containing `n` inner lists, each with two zeros; `new_x` is `x1 + r` and `new_y` is `y1 + u`, where `r` is -1 and `u` is 0 if the first character of `s` is 'L', otherwise `r` and `u` remain unchanged.**
