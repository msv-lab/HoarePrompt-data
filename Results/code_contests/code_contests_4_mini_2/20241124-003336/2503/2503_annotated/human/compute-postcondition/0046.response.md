The variable `dist` is assigned the value calculated as `abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - i - 1`. The values of `new_x` and `new_y` depend on `x1`, `y1`, and the values in `pref_sums`. The variable `i` is equal to 1. The other variables (`x2`, `y2`, `min_dist`) are not affected directly by this assignment. 

Since `new_x` is calculated as `x1 + pref_sums[1][0]` and `new_y` is calculated as `y1 + pref_sums[1][1]`, we can denote that `new_x` and `new_y` can take specific integer values based on `x1`, `y1`, and the corresponding values in `pref_sums`.

Thus, the output state will include the newly calculated value of `dist`, while other values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are integers; `n` is greater than 1; `s` is an input string; `pref_sums` is a list of length `n` containing `n` inner lists each with two zeros; `min_dist` is assigned the value of `dist`, `i` is 1; `new_x` is `x1 + pref_sums[1][0]`; `new_y` is `y1 + pref_sums[1][1]`; `dist` is assigned the value `abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - 1`**.
