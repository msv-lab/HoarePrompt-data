The variable `min_dist` is assigned the value of `dist`. The previous value of `dist` determines the value of `min_dist`, but since we are not provided with that value, we can only state that `min_dist` is assigned `dist`. The other variables remain unaffected, so the output state is: `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are integers; `n` is an integer; `s` is an input string; `pref_sums` is a list of length `n` containing `n` inner lists, each with two zeros; `min_dist` is assigned the value of `dist`.
