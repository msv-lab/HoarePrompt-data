According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop iterates while `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, we have `n` is greater than `i + 2`. This means that `i` must be less than `n` for the loop to execute one more time.

Since `n` is greater than `i + 2`, it implies that `i` is at least `n - 2` at the end of the last iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, which means `i` should be adjusted to `i + 1`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be incremented by 1, making it `i + 1`.
- `n` remains unchanged, but we can specify that it is still greater than this new value of `i`.

Thus, the adjusted state will reflect that `i` is now `i + 1`.

State: **`x1` is defined, `y1` is defined, `x2` is defined, `y2` is defined, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `new_x` is `x1 + pref_sums[i][0]`, `new_y` is `y1 + pref_sums[i][1]`**
