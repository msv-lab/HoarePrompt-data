Postcondition: ***`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are integers, `n` is an integer, `s` is an input string, and `pref_sums` is a list of length `n` containing `n` inner lists, each with two zeros. If `s` starts with 'D', then `u` is set to -1 and `r` remains 0. If `s` starts with any other character, `u` remains 0 and `r` remains 0.***
