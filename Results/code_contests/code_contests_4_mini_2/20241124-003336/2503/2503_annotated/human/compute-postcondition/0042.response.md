The value of `r` is assigned -1, and since it was previously unchanged, we can conclude that `r` is now -1. The other variables (`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `n`, `s`, `pref_sums`, `min_dist`, `i`, `u`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are integers, `n` is greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `pref_sums` is a list of length `n` containing `n` inner lists each with two zeros, `min_dist` is assigned the value of `dist`, `i` is 1, `s[i]` is 'L', and `r` is -1.
