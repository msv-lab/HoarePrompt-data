According to the code, the for loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. The variables `x1` and `y1` are updated based on the cycles and the last values in `pref_sums`, and `res` is calculated as `n * cycles`. The condition checks the absolute distance between `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`. If this absolute distance is less than or equal to `n * cycles`, the function will print `res` and return, preventing the loop from executing. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, the condition must not be satisfied.

To ensure that the loop starts executing, we need to verify that `n` is greater than 0 and that the absolute distance between `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` is greater than `n * cycles`. The variable `i` should also be initialized to 0 at the start of the loop. 

State: **`x1` and `y1` are updated, `x2` and `y2` are defined, `n` is greater than 0, the absolute distance between `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` is greater than `n * cycles`, `i` is 0**
