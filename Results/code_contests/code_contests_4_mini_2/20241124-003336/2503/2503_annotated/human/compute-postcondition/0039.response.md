The value of `r` is assigned the value `1`. The previous value of `r` is not specified, but it is stated that `r` remains unchanged. Therefore, we can conclude that `r` is now `1`. The other variables (`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `n`, `s`, `pref_sums`, `min_dist`, `i`, `u`) are not affected by this assignment. 

Output State: **`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are integers, `n` is greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `pref_sums` is a list of length `n` containing `n` inner lists each with two zeros, `min_dist` is assigned the value of `dist`, `i` is 1, the character at index `i` of the string `s` is 'R', `u` remains unchanged, and `r` is 1**
