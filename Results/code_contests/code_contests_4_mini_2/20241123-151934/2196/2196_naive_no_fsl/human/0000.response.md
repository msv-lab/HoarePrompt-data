To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we will analyze the logic implemented against the problem description and the provided test cases.

The problem states that an N-sided polygon can be drawn if the longest side is strictly shorter than the sum of the lengths of the other N-1 sides. This is validated using the theorem mentioned in the problem description.

Let's break down the program:

1. It reads an integer `N` which represents the number of sides of the polygon.
2. It collects the lengths of the sides into a list `listL`.
3. It finds the maximum length `maxL` from `listL`.
4. It calculates the sum of all lengths and then subtracts `maxL` from this sum to get the sum of the other lengths.
5. Finally, it checks if `maxL` is less than the calculated sum of the other lengths and prints `Yes` or `No` accordingly.

Now, let's check if the program handles all cases correctly:

- The program uses `raw_input()`, which is not defined in Python 3. It should use `input()`.
- The condition for checking if a polygon can be drawn is implemented correctly according to the theorem.
- The program handles the input as specified, collecting lengths into a list and correctly calculating the maximum and the necessary sum.

However, we need to check edge cases:

1. If `N = 3` (the minimum number of sides), we can test the smallest valid triangle.
   - Input: `3` followed by `1 1 3` (which cannot form a triangle).
   - The program should return `No`, indicating that a polygon cannot be formed. 
   - The program would correctly return `No`, since `3` is not less than `1 + 1 = 2`.

2. Input with all equal lengths:
   - Input: `3` followed by `5 5 5` (which can form a triangle).
   - The program should return `Yes`, as `5 < 5 + 5`.

3. Checking for a case where the longest side equals the sum of the others:
   - Input: `4` followed by `3 3 3 9` (which cannot form a polygon).
   - The program should return `No`, because `9` is not less than `3 + 3 + 3 = 9`.

4. A case where there are more sides but still manageable:
   - Input: `5` followed by `1 1 1 1 5` (which cannot form a polygon).
   - The program should return `No`, because `5` is not less than `1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4`.

Since the program logic correctly implements the theorem and handles various cases as expected, we conclude that we cannot find any potential case where the program fails to follow the problem description.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
