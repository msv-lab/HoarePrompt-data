To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code carefully.

### Code Analysis:
```python
def func():
    N = int(input())
    listL = [int(i) for i in raw_input().split()]
    maxL = max(listL)
    sum = 0
    for i in range(N):
        sum = sum + listL[i]
        
    # State of the program after the for loop has been executed: `sum` is equal to the sum of all integers in `listL`, `i` is `N - 1`, and `listL` contains exactly `N` integers.
    sum = sum - maxL
    if (maxL < sum):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
    # State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`sum` is equal to the sum of all integers in `listL` minus `maxL`, `i` is `N - 1`, and `listL` contains exactly `N` integers. If `maxL` is less than `sum`, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. This covers the case where `maxL` is equal to `sum` as well as when `maxL` is greater than `sum`.
```

### Comments on the Annotations:
The annotations in the comments correctly describe the state of the program after the for loop and after the if-else block. The logic flow appears to cover the necessary conditions for determining if a polygon can be formed using the given side lengths.

### Verification Against the Problem Statement:
The theorem states that a polygon can be formed if the longest side (`maxL`) is strictly less than the sum of the other sides (i.e., `sum - maxL`). 

1. The program calculates:
   - The maximum length of the sides using `maxL`.
   - The total sum of all side lengths using the variable `sum`.
   
2. It then subtracts `maxL` from `sum` to get the sum of the other sides.

3. The program checks if `maxL < sum`, printing 'Yes' if true and 'No' otherwise, which aligns with the theorem provided.

### Edge Cases to Consider:
- **Minimum Values:** If `N = 3` and the sides are `1, 1, 1`, the output should be 'Yes' (equilateral triangle).
- **Maximum Values:** If `N = 10` and the sides are all equal to `100`, the output should be 'Yes' (decagon with equal sides).
- **Testing an Invalid Case:** If `N = 4` and the sides are `1, 2, 3, 7`, the output should be 'No' since `7` is not less than `1 + 2 + 3` (which equals `6`).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to determine if an N-sided polygon can be formed based on the provided theorem. All potential edge cases and the problem description have been adequately addressed.

Thus, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**
