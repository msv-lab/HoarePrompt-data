According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `N`. The loop iterates while `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `N` is an integer such that 3 <= `N` <= 10. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 1, and since `N` remains the same, it still satisfies the condition 1 < N (where N is at least 3). Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are the value of `i` to 1.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= `N` <= 10, `i` is 1, and `sum` is updated by adding `listL[1]` to its previous value.**
