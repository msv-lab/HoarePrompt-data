The code assigns `sum` the value of `sum - maxL`. Here, `maxL` represents the maximum value in `listL`. Since `sum` was initially equal to the sum of all integers in `listL`, the new value of `sum` will be the total sum minus the maximum integer. The other variable `i` remains unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `sum`.

Output State: **`sum` is equal to the sum of all integers in `listL` minus maxL, `i` is N - 1, and `listL` contains exactly N integers**
