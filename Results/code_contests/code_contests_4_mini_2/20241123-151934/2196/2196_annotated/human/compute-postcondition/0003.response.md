The variable `sum` is initialized to 0. Since no other variables are affected by this line of code, the output state reflects the current values of `N`, `listL`, and `maxL` as previously defined, along with the new value of `sum`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= `N` <= 10; `listL` is a list of integers containing `N` values from the input; `maxL` is the maximum value from `listL`; `sum` is 0**
