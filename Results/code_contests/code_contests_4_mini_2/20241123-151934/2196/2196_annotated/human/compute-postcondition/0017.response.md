Postcondition: ***`sum` is equal to the sum of all integers in `listL` minus `maxL`, `i` is `N - 1`, and `listL` contains exactly `N` integers. If `maxL` is less than `sum`, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. This covers the case where `maxL` is equal to `sum` as well as when `maxL` is greater than `sum`.***
