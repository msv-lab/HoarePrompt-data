`maxL` is assigned the maximum value from `listL`, which contains `N` integers. Since `N` is between 3 and 10, `listL` will have at least 3 and at most 10 integers, each ranging from 1 to 100. Therefore, `maxL` will be the highest integer present in `listL`. The previous state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= `N` <= 10; `listL` is a list of integers containing `N` values from the input; `maxL` is the maximum value from `listL`.**
