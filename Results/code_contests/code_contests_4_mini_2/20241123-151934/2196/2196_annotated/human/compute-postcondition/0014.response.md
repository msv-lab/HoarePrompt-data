The code snippet executes a print statement that outputs the string 'Yes'. The variables `sum`, `i`, `listL`, and `maxL` are not affected by this print statement. Therefore, the output state retains their previous values.

Output State: **`sum` is equal to the sum of all integers in `listL` minus `maxL`, `i` is `N - 1`, `listL` contains exactly `N` integers, and `maxL` is less than `sum`, and it prints 'Yes'**
