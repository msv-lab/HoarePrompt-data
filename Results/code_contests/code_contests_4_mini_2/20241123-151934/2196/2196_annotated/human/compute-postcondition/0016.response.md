The code snippet prints 'No', which means that the program outputs this string directly. The values of the variables `sum`, `i`, `listL`, and `maxL` do not change as a result of this operation. Therefore, the output state includes the current values of the variables along with the printed output.

Output State: **`sum` is equal to the sum of all integers in `listL` minus `maxL`, `i` is N - 1, `listL` contains exactly N integers, `maxL` is greater than or equal to `sum`, and the output is 'No'**
