The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in the provided definition. However, it operates under the constraints that `N` is an integer such that \(3 \leq N \leq 10\), and `L_1, L_2, \ldots, L_N` are integers such that \(1 \leq L_i \leq 100\) for all \(i\) from \(1\) to \(N\). The output of the function is not specified in the problem statement, so it cannot be determined what the function returns based on the provided information. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters directly in its definition but operates with constraints on N and L_i, which are not passed as parameters. The return value is not defined in the provided information.**
