The variable `sum` is updated by adding `listL[i]` to its previous value. The value of `i` is 2, so `sum` is updated to `sum + listL[2]`. The initial values of `N`, `i`, and `sum` are not specified beyond their constraints, and we don't have the value of `listL`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `sum` is updated but does not provide specific values for the other variables.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= `N` <= 10, `i` is 2, `sum` is updated by adding `listL[2]` to its previous value.**
