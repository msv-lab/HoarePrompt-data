The variable `N` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input that must be an integer between 3 and 10 (inclusive). The initial state indicates that `N` is an integer in that range, but the exact value is not specified. Therefore, the output state reflects that `N` will now hold the input integer, while the values of `L_1, L_2, ..., L_N` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= `N` <= 10, and `L_1`, `L_2`, ..., `L_N` are integers such that 1 <= `L_i` <= 100 for all i from 1 to `N`.**
