According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `N`. Since `N` is an integer such that 3 <= `N` <= 10, the loop will execute for values of `i` ranging from 0 to `N-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` will be equal to `N - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `N` must be within the specified bounds, and `i` must start at 0.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= `N` <= 10, `i` is 0**
