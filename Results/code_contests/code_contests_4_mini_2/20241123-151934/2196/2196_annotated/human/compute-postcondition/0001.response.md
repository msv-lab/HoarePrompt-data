The list `listL` is assigned the values from the input, where `raw_input()` accepts a string of space-separated values and `int(i)` converts each value to an integer. The previous values of `L_1, L_2, ..., L_N` are not directly affected, but `listL` will contain integers corresponding to the input provided. Since `N` is an integer between 3 and 10, and each `L_i` is an integer between 1 and 100, `listL` will have `N` integers in the specified range.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= `N` <= 10; `listL` is a list of integers containing `N` values from the input, each between 1 and 100**
