The function accepts an integer input `N` which indicates the number of integers to be read from the user. It then reads `N` integers into a list, computes the sum of these integers, and identifies the maximum integer from the list. It checks if the maximum integer is less than the sum of the rest of the integers (total sum minus the maximum). If this condition holds true, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function does not return any value but outputs the result directly. It does not handle cases where the input might not be valid or where `N` is zero, which could lead to potential errors or unexpected behavior.
