To assess the correctness of the provided program, we will analyze it based on the given problem description and the theorem regarding the conditions under which an N-sided polygon can be drawn.

### Problem Analysis:

The program is supposed to determine if an N-sided polygon can be drawn given the lengths of its sides. The theorem states that an N-sided polygon can be drawn if the longest side is strictly shorter than the sum of the lengths of the other N-1 sides.

### Program Analysis:

The program reads an integer N (the number of sides) and a list of integers representing the lengths of the sides. It calculates the maximum length (`maxL`) and the total sum of the lengths. It then subtracts `maxL` from the total sum to get the sum of the remaining sides. Finally, it checks if `maxL` is less than this sum and prints "Yes" or "No" accordingly.

### Potential Issues:

1. **Input Handling:** The program uses `raw_input()` which is not valid in Python 3. It should use `input()` instead.
2. **Incorrect Logic:** The logic for calculating the sum of the other sides is correct, but there is a potential issue with the input range. If the input contains sides that are all equal, for example, `3, 3, 3`, the program would output "No" even though it is possible to form a triangle with equal sides.
3. **Edge Case:** Consider the input where all side lengths are equal, such as `3, 3, 3`. The longest side (3) is not shorter than the sum of the other sides (3 + 3 = 6), yet a polygon can be formed with such lengths.

### Conclusion:

Since the program does not correctly handle cases where all sides are equal or potentially other edge cases, it does not meet the requirements stated in the problem description. In particular, the case where all sides are equal shows that the program fails to account for the possibility of forming a polygon.

Correctness: **False**.
