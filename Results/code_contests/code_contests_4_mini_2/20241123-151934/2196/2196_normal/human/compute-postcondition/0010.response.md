According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `N` must be greater than 2. Since `N` is already defined as being at least 3, it satisfies this condition. However, `i` needs to be incremented for the next iteration of the loop.

So, to prepare for the next iteration:
- `i` should be adjusted to 3.

The other states (`L`, `maxL`, and `sum`) do not need to be modified, as they are not affected by the loop's execution condition in this context.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10, `L` is a list of N integers where each `L[i]` satisfies 1 <= `L[i]` <= 100, `maxL` is the maximum integer from `L`, `sum` is equal to `L[0] + L[1] + L[2]`, `i` is 3**
