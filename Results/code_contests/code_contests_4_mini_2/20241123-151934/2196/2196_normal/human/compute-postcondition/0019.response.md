Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer input N (where 3 <= N <= 10) and a list of N integers (each between 1 and 100). It calculates the sum of the integers in the list and subtracts the maximum integer from that sum. Finally, it prints 'Yes' if the maximum integer is less than the adjusted sum, otherwise it prints 'No'. The function does not directly accept parameters but relies on user input for its execution. **
