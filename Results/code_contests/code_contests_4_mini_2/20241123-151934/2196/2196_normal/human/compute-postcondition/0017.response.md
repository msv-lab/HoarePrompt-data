Postcondition: ***`sum` is equal to the sum of all elements in `L` minus `maxL`, `N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10, `L` is a list of N integers where each `L[i]` satisfies 1 <= `L[i]` <= 100, and `maxL` is the maximum integer from `L`. If `maxL` is less than `sum`, the function prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, if `maxL` is greater than or equal to `sum`, the function prints 'No'.***
