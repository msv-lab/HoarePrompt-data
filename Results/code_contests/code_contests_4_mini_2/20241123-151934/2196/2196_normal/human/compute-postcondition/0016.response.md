The code snippet contains a print statement that outputs the string 'No'. It does not alter the values of any variables. The initial state contains the variables `sum`, `N`, `L`, and `maxL`, which remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of these variables along with the printed output.

Output State: **`sum` is equal to the sum of all elements in `L` minus `maxL`, `N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10, `L` is a list of N integers where each `L[i]` satisfies 1 <= `L[i]` <= 100, `maxL` is the maximum integer from `L`, and `maxL` is greater than or equal to `sum`, and the output is 'No'**
