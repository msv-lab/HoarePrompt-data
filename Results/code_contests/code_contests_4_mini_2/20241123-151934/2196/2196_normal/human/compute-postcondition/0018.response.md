The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, as indicated by the empty parentheses in the function definition. However, it operates on two constraints: `N`, an integer, which must be between 3 and 10, and `L`, a list containing `N` integers, where each integer must be between 1 and 100. The specific output of the function is not provided in the prompt. 

Without further details on the output, we cannot specify the exact return values. However, we can summarize the constraints on the inputs. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to work with a fixed-size integer `N` and a list `L` of integers, ensuring that these follow the specified constraints.

Functionality: **The function operates on an integer N (3 <= N <= 10) and a list L of N integers (1 <= L[i] <= 100), but does not accept parameters directly in its definition.**
