The variable `sum` is updated by adding the value of `L[i]` to it. Since `i` is 2, we take the value `L[2]` from the list `L`. The previous value of `sum` is `L[0] + L[1]`. Therefore, after executing the code, `sum` will be equal to `L[0] + L[1] + L[2]`. Other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10, `L` is a list of N integers where each `L[i]` satisfies 1 <= `L[i]` <= 100, `maxL` is the maximum integer from `L`, `sum` is equal to `L[0] + L[1] + L[2]`, `i` is 2**
