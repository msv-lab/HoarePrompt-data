The code outputs the string 'Yes' to the console. The values of the variables `sum`, `N`, `L`, and `maxL` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `sum` is equal to the sum of all elements in `L` minus `maxL`, `N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10, `L` is a list of N integers where each `L[i]` satisfies 1 <= `L[i]` <= 100, `maxL` is the maximum integer from `L`, and `maxL` is less than `sum`.

Output State: **`sum` is equal to the sum of all elements in `L` minus `maxL`, `N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10, `L` is a list of N integers where each `L[i]` satisfies 1 <= `L[i]` <= 100, `maxL` is the maximum integer from `L`, and `maxL` is less than `sum`, and the function prints 'Yes'**.
