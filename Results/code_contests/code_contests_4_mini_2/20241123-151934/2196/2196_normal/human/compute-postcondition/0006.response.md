According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the value of `N`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10. Since `N` is at least 3, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `N`.

To prepare for the next iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 1. The other states, such as `N`, `L`, `maxL`, and `sum`, do not need to be adjusted as they remain unchanged for the next iteration.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10, `L` is a list of N integers where each `L[i]` satisfies 1 <= `L[i]` <= 100, `maxL` is the maximum integer from `L`, `sum` is equal to `L[0]`, and `i` is 1**
