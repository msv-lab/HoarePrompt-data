The code assigns the value of `sum + listL[i]` to `sum`. The current value of `sum` is 0, and `listL[i]` refers to the first element of the list `L` (since `i` is 0). The value of `listL[0]` is within the range of 1 to 100, as per the problem statement. Therefore, the new value of `sum` will be equal to the first element of the list `L`.

Consequently, the output state is: `N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10, `L` is a list of N integers where each `L[i]` satisfies 1 <= `L[i]` <= 100, `maxL` is the maximum integer from `L`, `sum` is equal to `L[0]`, and `i` is 0.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10, `L` is a list of N integers where each `L[i]` satisfies 1 <= `L[i]` <= 100, `maxL` is the maximum integer from `L`, `sum` is equal to `L[0]`, and `i` is 0.**
