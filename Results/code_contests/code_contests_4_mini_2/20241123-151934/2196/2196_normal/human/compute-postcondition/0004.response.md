According to the code, the loop will execute a number of times equal to the value of `N`. Given the constraints that `N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10, the loop will definitely execute since `N` is guaranteed to be at least 3.

Before the loop starts, the variable `i` should be initialized to 0 for the first iteration. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute correctly, the state should reflect that `i` is set to 0. The values of `L`, `maxL`, and `sum` do not affect the execution of the loop itself, but they may be relevant within the loop body.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10, `L` is a list of N integers where each L[i] satisfies 1 <= L[i] <= 100, `maxL` is the maximum integer from `L`, `sum` is 0, `i` is 0**
