The variable `sum` is updated by adding the value of `listL[i]` to it. Since `i` is currently 1, the value being added is `listL[1]`. The previous value of `sum` is `L[0]`, which is the first element of the list `L`. Therefore, the new value of `sum` becomes `L[0] + L[1]`. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10, `L` is a list of N integers where each `L[i]` satisfies 1 <= `L[i]` <= 100, `maxL` is the maximum integer from `L`, `sum` is equal to `L[0] + L[1]`, and `i` is 1**
