The code creates a new list `listL` by converting the input from `raw_input()` into integers. The variable `N` is an integer that determines the length of the list `L`, which contains `N` integers. The input taken is expected to fulfill the condition of `N` being between 3 and 10. The values of `L[i]` are each between 1 and 100.

After the execution of the code, `listL` will hold the integers provided by the user via input. The values of `N` and `L` remain unchanged, but the new list `listL` will contain the integers inputted.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10, `L` is a list of N integers where each L[i] satisfies 1 <= L[i] <= 100, and `listL` is a list of integers obtained from user input.**
