The variable `sum` is initialized to 0. The values of the other variables (`N`, `L`, and `maxL`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10; `L` is a list of N integers where each L[i] satisfies 1 <= L[i] <= 100; `maxL` is the maximum integer from `listL`; and `sum` is 0.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10; `L` is a list of N integers where each L[i] satisfies 1 <= L[i] <= 100; `maxL` is the maximum integer from `listL`; and `sum` is 0**.
