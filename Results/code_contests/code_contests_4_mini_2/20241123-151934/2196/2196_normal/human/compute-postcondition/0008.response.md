According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `N`. The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10. Since `i` (1) is less than `N`, the loop can execute again.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2, and we need to ensure that `N` remains at least 3 since `N` is not affected by the loop execution. The other variables do not require adjustments.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10, `L` is a list of N integers where each `L[i]` satisfies 1 <= `L[i]` <= 100, `maxL` is the maximum integer from `L`, `sum` is equal to `L[0] + L[1]`, and `i` is 2**
