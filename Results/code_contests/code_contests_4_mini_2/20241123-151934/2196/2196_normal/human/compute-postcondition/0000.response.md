The variable `N` is assigned the value `int(input())`, which means it will take an input and convert it to an integer. The value of `N` is still constrained between 3 and 10, and it does not affect the list `L` directly. Therefore, the output state is that `N` is an integer within the specified range, and `L` remains a list of N integers.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 3 <= N <= 10, `L` is a list of N integers where each L[i] satisfies 1 <= L[i] <= 100**
