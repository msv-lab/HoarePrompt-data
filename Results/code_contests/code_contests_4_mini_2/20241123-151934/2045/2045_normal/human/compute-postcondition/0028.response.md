The code appends the sum of the absolute differences between each element `k` in the list `l` and the middle element `med` to the list `af`. The previous values of `l` and `med` are used in the calculation. 

Output State: **`le` is a list with one less string, `n` is the integer value from the original last element of `le`, `zorg` is still `n + 1`, `l` is a list of differences between indices from the original list, `med` is the middle element of `l`, and `af` is updated with the sum of absolute differences from `l` to `med`.**
