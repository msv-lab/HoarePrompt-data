Output State: **`le` is a list reduced by the number of strings popped during the loop execution, `af` contains the sum of absolute differences from the median of `l` for each iteration where `l` is non-empty, otherwise it contains 0 for iterations where `l` is empty. `zorg` is the integer value of the last popped string from `le`, `n` is the integer value from the last string in `le` before it was popped, and `l` is a list of indices of '*' characters in the string processed during each iteration. If `le` is empty before the loop starts, the loop will not execute, leaving `le` empty and `af` as an empty list. If `le` has fewer than two elements, the loop may not execute enough times to produce expected results, depending on the initial state of `le`.**
