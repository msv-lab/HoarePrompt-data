Postcondition: ***`le` is a list with one string removed, `af` is updated to include the sum of absolute differences between the elements of `l` and the median `med` if `l` is non-empty; otherwise, `af` includes 0. The variable `zorg` retains its value as `n`, which is the integer value from the popped string, and `l` is the new list containing the differences between indices and values. If `l` is empty, the function handles this case by appending 0 to `af`, ensuring all edge cases are addressed.***
