The value `0` is appended to the list `af`, which was previously an empty list. Other variables `le`, `zorg`, `n`, and `l` remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `le` is a list with one less string, `af` is now a list containing one element `0`, `zorg` is the integer value of the previous last string in `le`, `n` is the integer value of the last string in `le` before it was popped, and `l` is an empty list.

Output State: **`le` is a list with one less string, `af` is now a list containing one element 0, `zorg` is the integer value of the previous last string in `le`, `n` is the integer value of the last string in `le` before it was popped, and `l` is an empty list.**
