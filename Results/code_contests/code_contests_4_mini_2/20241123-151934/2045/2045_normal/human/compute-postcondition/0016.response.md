The list comprehension `l = [k for k in range(n) if l[k] == '*']` is creating a new list `l` containing the indices `k` from `0` to `n-1` where the corresponding elements in the original list `l` are equal to `'*'`. Since `l` is being reassigned, its previous contents will be replaced by the new list generated by the comprehension. 

Given that `n` is the integer value derived from the previously popped string and `l` is the popped string, the output state will reflect the new state of `l`. The previous values of `le` and `af` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`le` is a list with one string removed, `af` is unchanged, `zorg` is `n`, `n` is the integer value from the popped string, and `l` is the new list of indices where `l[k]` is '*'**.
