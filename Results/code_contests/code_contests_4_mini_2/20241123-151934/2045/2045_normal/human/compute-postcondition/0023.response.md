The value of `le` is a list containing at least one string representing an integer greater than `n`, which means after executing `le.pop()`, the last element of `le` will be removed and returned as a string. Then, `int()` converts that string to an integer and assigns it to `n`. The value of `zorg` remains unchanged as `n + 1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `le` is a list with at least one string representing an integer greater than the new `n`, `n` is the integer value from the last element of the original `le`, and `zorg` is still `n + 1`.

Output State: **`le` is a list with at least one string representing an integer greater than the new `n`, `n` is the integer value from the last element of the original `le`, and `zorg` is still `n + 1`**
