Postcondition: ***`le` is a list with one less string, `af` is a list that contains the sum of absolute differences from the median of `l` if `l` is non-empty, otherwise it contains a single element 0. `zorg` is the integer value of the previous last string in `le`, and `n` is the integer value of the last string in `le` before it was popped, while `l` is either a non-empty list (in which case `med` is the middle element of `l`), or an empty list.***
