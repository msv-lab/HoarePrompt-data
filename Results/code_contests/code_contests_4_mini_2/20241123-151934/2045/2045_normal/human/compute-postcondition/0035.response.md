Functionality: ** The function reads a number of test cases and for each case evaluates a string composed of '.' and '*' characters. It calculates the sum of absolute differences of the indices of '*' characters from their median index. If there are no '*' characters, it appends 0 for that test case. The results are printed, one for each test case. The function assumes that the input format is valid and does not handle cases where there are not enough lines to process all test cases. **
