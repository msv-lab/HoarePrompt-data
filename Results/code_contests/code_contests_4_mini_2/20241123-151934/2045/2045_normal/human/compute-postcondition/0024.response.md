The variable `l` is assigned the last element of the list `le` by using the `pop()` method, which removes that element from the list. Consequently, the list `le` will now contain one less element, and the value of `n` remains unchanged as it is based on the original last element of `le`. The value of `zorg` also remains unchanged because it is defined as `n + 1`, where `n` has not been altered. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of `le`, `n`, and `zorg`.

Output State: **`le` is a list with one less string, `n` is the integer value from the original last element of `le`, `zorg` is still `n + 1`**
