The value of `n` is assigned the value of `int(le.pop())`. This means the last string in the list `le` is removed and converted to an integer, which becomes the new value of `n`. The previous value of `n` is not directly specified, but it is noted that `n` is the adjusted value (one greater than the previous `n`). The list `le` will now be one element shorter, but we do not know its contents before the pop operation. The state of `af` and `zorg` remains unaffected.

Output State: **`le` is a list with one string removed, `af` is unchanged, `zorg` is `n`, and `n` is now the integer value from the popped string from `le`**.
