The variable `af` is initialized as an empty list. The state of `le`, which is a list of strings from standard input reversed, remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the initialization of `af` and the unchanged state of `le`.

Output State: **`le` is a list of strings from standard input reversed; `af` is an empty list**
