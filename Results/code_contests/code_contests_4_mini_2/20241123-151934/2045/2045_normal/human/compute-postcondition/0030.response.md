Postcondition: ***`le` is a list with one less string, `n` is the integer value from the original last element of `le`, `zorg` is still `n + 1`, and `l` is a list of differences between indices from the original list. If `l` is not empty, `med` is the middle element of `l`, and `af` is updated with the sum of absolute differences from each element in `l` to `med`. If `l` is empty, `af` contains an additional element `0`.***
