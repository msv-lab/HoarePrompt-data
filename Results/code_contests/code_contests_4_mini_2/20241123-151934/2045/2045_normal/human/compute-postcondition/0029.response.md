The code `af.append(0)` adds the integer `0` to the end of the list `af`. The initial state does not provide any information about the variable `af`, but it is assumed that `af` is a list that exists in the context. The other variables (`le`, `n`, `zorg`, and `l`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`le` is a list with one less string, `n` is the integer value from the original last element of `le`, `zorg` is still `n + 1`, `l` is a list of differences between indices from the original list, and `af` now contains an additional element `0`.**
