The variable `l` is assigned the value of the last string from the list `le`, which is then popped from `le`. As a result, `le` is reduced by one string, and the value of `zorg` and `n` are not affected by this operation. The previous values of `zorg` and `n` remain the same. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated state of `le` and the assigned value of `l`.

Output State: **`le` is a list with one less string, `af` is an empty list, `zorg` is the integer value of the previous last string in `le`, `n` is the integer value of the last string in `le` before it was popped, and `l` is the last string that was popped from `le`.**
