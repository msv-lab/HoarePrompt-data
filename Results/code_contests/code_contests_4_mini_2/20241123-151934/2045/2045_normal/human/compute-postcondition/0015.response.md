The code `l = le.pop()` removes the last element from the list `le` and assigns it to the variable `l`. The value of `n` is now the integer value from the popped string (which was the last element in `le`). The list `le` will now have one less element, while `af` remains unchanged. 

Since `le` had one string removed and now `n` is assigned the integer value from the popped string, the output state will reflect the updated list `le`, the unchanged variable `af`, the integer value assigned to `n`, and the value of `l` which is the popped string.

Output State: **`le` is a list with one string removed, `af` is unchanged, `zorg` is `n`, `n` is the integer value from the popped string, `l` is the popped string**
