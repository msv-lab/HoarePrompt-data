The code calculates the sum of the absolute differences between each element `k` in the list `l` and the middle element `med`. This sum is then appended to the list `af`. The variables `le`, `zorg`, `n`, and `l` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by this operation.

The output state will include the unchanged values of `le`, `zorg`, `n`, `l`, and `med`, along with the new state of `af` which now contains the calculated sum.

Output State: **`le` is a list with one less string, `af` is a list containing the sum of absolute differences, `zorg` is the integer value of the previous last string in `le`, `n` is the integer value of the last string in `le` before it was popped, `l` is a non-empty list, `med` is the middle element of `l`**
