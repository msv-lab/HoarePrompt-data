The value of `n` is assigned the integer value of the last string in `le` after popping it. This means that `le` will be modified by removing its last element, and `n` will hold the integer equivalent of that string. The variable `af` and `zorg` remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `le` is a list of strings with at least 1 string, `af` is an empty list, `zorg` is the integer value of the previous last string in `le`, and `n` is the integer value of the last string in `le` before it was popped.

Output State: **`le` is a list of strings with at least 1 string, `af` is an empty list, `zorg` is the integer value of the previous last string in `le`, and `n` is the integer value of the last string in `le` before it was popped.**
