The value `0` is appended to the list `af`, which means `af` will now include an additional element `0`. The previous values of the other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables and the updated state of `af`.

Output State: **`le` is a list with one string removed, `af` is updated to include 0, `zorg` is `n`, `n` is the integer value from the popped string, and `l` is the new list containing differences between indices and values.**
