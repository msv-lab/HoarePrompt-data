The variable `med` is assigned the value of the middle element of the list `l`, which is determined by the expression `len(l) // 2`. The length of `l` is non-zero, ensuring that the middle index is valid. The states of the other variables (`le`, `af`, `zorg`, `n`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `le` is a list with one less string, `af` is an empty list, `zorg` is the integer value of the previous last string in `le`, `n` is the integer value of the last string in `le` before it was popped, `l` is a non-empty list, and `med` is the middle element of `l`.

Output State: **`le` is a list with one less string, `af` is an empty list, `zorg` is the integer value of the previous last string in `le`, `n` is the integer value of the last string in `le` before it was popped, `l` is a non-empty list, and `med` is the middle element of `l`.**
