According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `zorg` and the list `le`. The loop will execute as long as `zorg` is less than the integer value obtained from `le.pop()`, which indicates the upper limit of the loop.

At the end of the last iteration, `zorg` retains its value as `n`, which is the integer value from the popped string. The list `le` has one string removed, so we need to ensure that there is still a valid integer for the loop to continue executing.

For the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:

1. The integer value obtained from `le.pop()` should be at least `n + 1`, as `zorg` is equal to `n` after the last iteration.
2. `zorg` should be incremented to `n + 1` for the next iteration of the loop.

Therefore, the adjusted states should reflect that `le` must contain at least one integer greater than `n` after popping the current value, and `zorg` should be updated to `n + 1`.

State: **`le` is a list with at least one string representing an integer greater than `n`, `zorg` is `n + 1`**
