The code `af.append(0)` adds the integer `0` to the list `af`. The variable `af` is updated by appending `0` to it, but the previous state of `af` is not specified. The other variables `t`, `n`, `l`, and `zorg` remain unaffected by this operation. 

Therefore, the output state is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the integer value obtained from `le.pop(); `l` is a list of index differences; `zorg` is 2; `af` is updated to include 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the integer value obtained from `le.pop(); `l` is a list of index differences; `zorg` is 2; `af` is updated to include 0**.
