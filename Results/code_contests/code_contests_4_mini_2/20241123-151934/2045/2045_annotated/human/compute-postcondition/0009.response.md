The code appends to the list `af` the result of the sum of the absolute differences between each element `k` in `l` and the middle element `med` of `l`. The values of `t`, `n`, `zorg`, and `med` are not directly changed, but the list `af` is modified.

Since `med` is the middle element of `l`, and `l` has been updated, the result of the sum will depend on the current state of `l` and `med`. The variable `af` will have a new value after appending the calculated sum.

Therefore, the output state after running the code will reflect the updated state of `af` along with the unchanged states of `t`, `n`, `zorg`, and `med`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the new last element of `l`, `l` is updated based on the calculation, `zorg` is 0, `med` is the middle element of `l`, and `af` is updated with the sum of absolute differences.**
