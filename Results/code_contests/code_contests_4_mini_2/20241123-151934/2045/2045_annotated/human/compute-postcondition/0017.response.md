The list `l` is updated with the result of the list comprehension, where each element is computed as `(b - a)` for each pair `(a, b)` obtained from the enumeration of `l`. The previous values of `l` affect the new values but since `l` is not explicitly provided, we can't determine its specific values. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `zorg`, `af`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the integer value obtained from `le.pop()`, `l` is updated based on the calculation `(b - a)`, `zorg` is 1, and `af` remains unchanged as the sum of absolute differences.
