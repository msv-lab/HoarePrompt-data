The statement `med = l[len(l) // 2]` assigns the value of the median of the list `l` to the variable `med`. The median is determined by accessing the middle element of the list `l` after calculating its length. The previous values of the affected variables are `l` (which has been updated based on the calculation `(b - a)`) and the length of `l`, which is used to find the median.

Since `l` is updated and its contents are not specified, we can only state that `med` will be the middle value of `l`. The other variables `t`, `n`, `zorg`, and `af` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the integer value obtained from `le.pop()`, `l` is updated based on the calculation `(b - a)`, `zorg` is 1, `af` remains unchanged as the sum of absolute differences, and `med` is the median of `l`.**
