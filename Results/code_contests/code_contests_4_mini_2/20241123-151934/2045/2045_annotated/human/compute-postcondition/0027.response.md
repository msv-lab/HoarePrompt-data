The value of `med` is assigned the value of the middle element of the list `l`. The expression `len(l) // 2` calculates the index of the middle element of `l`, which is used to get `med`. The variables `t`, `n`, `zorg`, and `af` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment and the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the integer value obtained from `le.pop(); `l` is a list of index differences; `zorg` is 2; `af` is updated; `med` is the middle element of the list `l`.**
