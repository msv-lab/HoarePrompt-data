The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly as the function signature indicates no parameters are defined. However, it operates based on predefined constraints of `t`, `n`, and a string representing the level consisting of '.' and '*'. For each test case, if the string contains sheep ('*'), the function calculates the result based on the configuration of the sheep and empty spaces. 

Based on the provided output description, we can outline the following cases:

Case_1: If the level string is empty or does not contain any sheep ('*'), the function returns a specific result indicating the absence of sheep.

Case_2: If the level string contains sheep ('*'), the function processes the positions of sheep and returns a calculated value based on the arrangement of sheep and empty spaces.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to process a series of test cases regarding the positions of sheep and empty spaces in a given string, returning results based on the presence and arrangement of sheep.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases based on a string representing sheep and empty spaces. It returns results based on the presence and arrangement of sheep in the string.**
