The operation `l = le.pop()` assigns the value obtained from `le.pop()` to `l`. The variable `n` is already assigned the value from `le.pop()`, which means `l` now holds that same value. The previous state of `l` is not specified, but it is important to note that `le` will lose its last element after this operation. The variable `zorg` remains unchanged at 1, and `af` also remains unchanged as it is dependent on the state of `l` before the operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the integer value obtained from `le.pop()`, `l` is the last element of `le`, `zorg` is 1, and `af` remains unchanged as the sum of absolute differences.**
