Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; if `le` contains at least one element, the loop executes `zorg` times (where `zorg` is the loop index), `n` is the integer value obtained from `le.pop()` on each iteration, `l` is a list of index differences calculated from the positions of '*' in the string obtained from `le.pop()`, and `af` is updated with either the sum of absolute differences from the median of `l` or 0 if `l` is empty. If `le` is empty before the loop starts, the loop does not execute, and `af` remains an empty list.**
