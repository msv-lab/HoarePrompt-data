Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the new last element of `l`, `l` is updated based on the calculation, `zorg` is 0; if `l` is not empty, `med` is the middle element of `l` and `af` is updated with the sum of absolute differences between each element in `l` and `med`. If `l` is empty or false, `af` contains 0.***
