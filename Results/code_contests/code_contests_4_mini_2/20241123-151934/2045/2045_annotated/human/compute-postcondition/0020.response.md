The statement `af.append(0)` adds the integer `0` to the list `af`. This does not affect any of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `zorg`), but it modifies the list `af` by adding a new element. The value of `af` now includes an additional `0` at the end.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the integer value obtained from `le.pop()`, `l` is updated based on the calculation `(b - a)`, `zorg` is 1, `af` is the original list plus an additional 0**.
