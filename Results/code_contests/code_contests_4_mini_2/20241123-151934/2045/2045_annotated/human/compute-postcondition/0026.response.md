The code snippet assigns a new list to `l`, where each element is calculated as the difference between the indices `b` and `a` from the `enumerate(l)`. The value of `l` will be updated based on the original list of indices where elements were `'*'`. Other variables (`t`, `n`, `zorg`, `af`) remain unchanged.

Since `l` is updated to contain the differences of indices based on its previous state, the output state will reflect this change.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the integer value obtained from `le.pop(); `l` is a list of index differences; `zorg` is 2; `af` is updated.**
