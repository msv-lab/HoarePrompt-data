`n` is assigned the value of the last element popped from the list `le`. The previous value of `n` is unknown since it is being updated. The list `le` will lose its last element, and `zorg` remains unchanged at 0. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `n` and the modified state of `le`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the last element of `le`, `le` has one less element, `zorg` is 0**
