The code appends the value of the sum of the absolute differences between each element `k` in the list `l` and the middle element `med`. The variable `af` is updated to include this new sum. The values of `t`, `n`, `zorg`, and the list `l` remain unchanged by this operation. Thus, the output state reflects the updated list `af`. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the integer value obtained from `le.pop(); `l` is a list of index differences; `zorg` is 2; `af` is updated to include the sum of abs(k - med) for k in l; `med` is the middle element of the list `l`.**
