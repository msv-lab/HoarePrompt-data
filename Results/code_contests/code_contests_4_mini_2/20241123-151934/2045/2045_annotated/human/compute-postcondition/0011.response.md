The code `af.append(0)` appends the value `0` to the list `af`. Since the initial state does not provide any previous value for `af`, we can assume that it was either initialized as an empty list or is unaffected by the current operation. The values of `t`, `n`, `l`, and `zorg` remain unchanged.

Now, let's summarize the output state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4
- `n` is the new last element of `le`
- `l` is false or empty
- `zorg` is 0
- `af` now has `0` appended to it

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the new last element of `le`, `l` is false or empty, `zorg` is 0, `af` now contains `0`**
