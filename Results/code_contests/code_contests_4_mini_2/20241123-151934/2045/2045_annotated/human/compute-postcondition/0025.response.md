The variable `l` is assigned a new list that is created using a list comprehension. It includes elements `k` from the range `n` where the corresponding values in `l` are equal to `'*'`. The initial state indicates that `l` is being modified based on the condition involving its own previous values. Therefore, the output state reflects the changes made to `l` based on the condition and the fact that `l` is now a list of indices where the elements are `'*'`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the integer value obtained from `le.pop(); `l` is a list of indices where elements were `'*'`; `zorg` is 2; `af` is updated.**
