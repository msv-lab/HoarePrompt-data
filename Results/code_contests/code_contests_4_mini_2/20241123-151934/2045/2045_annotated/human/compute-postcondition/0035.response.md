Functionality: ** The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a string representing positions of sheep ('*') and empty spaces. For each test case, it calculates the sum of absolute differences of the indices of sheep from the median index of sheep, and stores the result. If there are no sheep in a test case, it records a result of 0. Finally, it prints the results for all test cases. The function does not accept any parameters directly, and it expects input from standard input.**
