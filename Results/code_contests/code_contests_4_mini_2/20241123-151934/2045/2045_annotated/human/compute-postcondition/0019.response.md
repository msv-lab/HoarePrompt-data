The code appends a new value to the list `af`, which is the sum of the absolute differences between each element `k` in the list `l` and the median value `med`. The previous values of `l` and `med` are used for this calculation. The variable `af` is updated with the new sum, but the values of `t`, `n`, `zorg`, and the unchanged state of `af` before the append operation remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the integer value obtained from `le.pop()`, `l` is updated based on the calculation `(b - a)`, `zorg` is 1, `af` includes the sum of absolute differences before the append, and the new sum of absolute differences is appended to `af`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the integer value obtained from `le.pop()`, `l` is updated based on the calculation `(b - a)`, `zorg` is 1, `af` includes the previous sum of absolute differences, and a new sum is appended to `af`.**
