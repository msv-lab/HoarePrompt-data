Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the integer value obtained from `le.pop()`, `l` is updated based on the calculation `(b - a)`, `zorg` is 1, and `af` is updated. If `l` is non-empty, the median value of `l` is used to calculate the sum of absolute differences from each element in `l`, which is appended to `af`. If `l` is empty, 0 is appended to `af`.***
