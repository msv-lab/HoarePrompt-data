The code `l = le.pop()` removes the last element from the list `le` and assigns it to the variable `l`. The variable `n` is currently the last element of `le` before this operation, so after the pop operation, `n` will no longer be the last element of `le`. The variable `zorg` remains unchanged. 

Therefore, the output state is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the new last element of `le`, `l` is the last element that was removed from `le`, and `zorg` is 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is the new last element of `le`, `l` is the last element that was removed from `le`, `zorg` is 0**
