Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is the integer value obtained from `le.pop(); `l` is a list of index differences; `zorg` is 2; if `l` is non-empty, `af` is updated to include the sum of absolute differences between each element `k` in `l` and `med`, where `med` is the middle element of the list `l`. If `l` is empty, `af` is updated to include 0.***
