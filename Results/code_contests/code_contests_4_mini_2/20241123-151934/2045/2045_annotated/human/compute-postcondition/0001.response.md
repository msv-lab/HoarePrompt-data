The variable `af` is initialized as an empty list. The previous values of the affected variables (`t`, `n`, and `le`) remain unchanged; they retain their initial states. The output state reflects that `af` is now an empty list, and the other variables are unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6 for each test case; `le` is a list of strings representing the levels, read from standard input and reversed; `af` is an empty list**.
