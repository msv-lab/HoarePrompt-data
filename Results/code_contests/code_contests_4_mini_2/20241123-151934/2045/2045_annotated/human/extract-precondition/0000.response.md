Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 for each test case, and the string representing the level is of length n consisting only of the characters '.' (empty space) and '*' (sheep). The total length of all strings across test cases does not exceed 10^6.**
