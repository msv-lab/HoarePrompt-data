To execute the provided code snippet, we first analyze the initial state and the impacts of the code.

Initial State:
- `a` is an input integer
- `b` is an input integer
- `h` is an input integer
- `m` is an input integer
- `t1` is calculated as radians of `(h % 12 * 30 + m * 0.5)`

The code:
```
t2 = radians(m % 60 * 6)
```

Step by Step Analysis:
1. The code computes `t2` by taking the modulo of `m` with 60, multiplying the result by 6, and then converting it to radians using the `radians` function.
2. The value of `m` is provided as an input integer, which will determine the specific value of `t2`.
3. The value of `t1` remains unchanged as the new assignment does not affect it.

Since `t2` is dependent on the input value of `m`, we note that the output state will include the new value of `t2` calculated as `radians(m % 60 * 6)`.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `h` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `t1` is radians of (h % 12 * 30 + m * 0.5), `t2` is radians of (m % 60 * 6)**
