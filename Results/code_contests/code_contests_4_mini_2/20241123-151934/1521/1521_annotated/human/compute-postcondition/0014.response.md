The function `func` reads four integers from standard input: `a`, `b`, `h`, and `m`. These integers represent the lengths of the hour and minute hands of a clock (`a` and `b`), the hour (`h`), and the minute (`m`). It then calculates the coordinates of the endpoints of the hour and minute hands based on their respective angles derived from `h` and `m`. Finally, it computes and prints the Euclidean distance between the two endpoints of the hands.

The function does not return any value; it directly prints the calculated distance. Additionally, the function has no error handling for invalid inputs, such as non-integer values or values outside the expected ranges.

Functionality: ** The function accepts four integers `a`, `b`, `h`, and `m`, representing the lengths of the hour and minute hands and the current time, respectively. It calculates and prints the Euclidean distance between the tips of the hour and minute hands on a clock face based on the given time. The function does not handle input validation or errors. **
