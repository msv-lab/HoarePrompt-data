The function `func` accepts three parameters: `A`, `B`, `H`, and `M`. `A` and `B` are integers in the range [1, 1000], `H` is an integer in the range [0, 11], and `M` is an integer in the range [0, 59]. The function does not return any specific output in the provided information. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept three integers `A`, `B`, and a time represented by `H` and `M`, but the specific return value or action is not provided in the output information. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters A, B, H, and M, where A and B are integers in the range [1, 1000], H is an integer in the range [0, 11], and M is an integer in the range [0, 59]. The return value is not specified.**
