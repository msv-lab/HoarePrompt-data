The value of `x2` is assigned the calculation `-b * sin(-t2)`. The values of `b` and `t2` are known based on the input integers. The calculation `sin(-t2)` is dependent on the value of `t2`, which is defined as `radians of (m % 60 * 6)`. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state includes the values of `a`, `b`, `h`, `m`, `t1`, `t2`, `x1`, and the newly calculated `x2`.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `h` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `t1` is radians of (h % 12 * 30 + m * 0.5), `t2` is radians of (m % 60 * 6), `x1` is calculated as `-a * sin(-t1)`, `x2` is calculated as `-b * sin(-t2)`**
