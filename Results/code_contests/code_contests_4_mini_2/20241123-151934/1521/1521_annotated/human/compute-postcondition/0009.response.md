The value of `y1` is assigned the value of `a * cos(-t1)`. The previous value of `a` is an input integer and `t1` is calculated as radians of (h % 12 * 30 + m * 0.5). The variable `t1` will affect the value of `y1` through the cosine function. Therefore, the output state will include the new value of `y1` based on the provided values of `a` and `t1`.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `h` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `t1` is radians of (h % 12 * 30 + m * 0.5), `t2` is radians of (m % 60 * 6), `x1` is calculated as `-a * sin(-t1)`, and `y1` is calculated as `a * cos(-t1)`**
