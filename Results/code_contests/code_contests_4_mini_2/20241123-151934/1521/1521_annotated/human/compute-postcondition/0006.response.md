The value of `t1` is assigned the result of the expression `radians(h % 12 * 30 + m * 0.5)`. The input values for `h` and `m` will determine the calculation. Since `h` is an input integer representing hours, and `m` is an input integer representing minutes, the calculations depend on these values. The output state reflects the current values of the affected variables and the computed value of `t1`.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `h` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, and `t1` is radians of (h % 12 * 30 + m * 0.5)**
