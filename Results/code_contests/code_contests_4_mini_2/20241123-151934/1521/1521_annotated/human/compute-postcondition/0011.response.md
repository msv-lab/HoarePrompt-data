The variable `y2` is assigned the value of `b * cos(-t2)`. The previous values of the affected variables are `b`, which is an input integer, and `t2`, which is calculated as radians of `(m % 60 * 6)`. Therefore, the output state reflects the values of the variables before this assignment.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `h` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `t1` is radians of (h % 12 * 30 + m * 0.5), `t2` is radians of (m % 60 * 6), `x1` is calculated as `-a * sin(-t1)`, `x2` is calculated as `-b * sin(-t2)`, `y2` is calculated as `b * cos(-t2)`**
