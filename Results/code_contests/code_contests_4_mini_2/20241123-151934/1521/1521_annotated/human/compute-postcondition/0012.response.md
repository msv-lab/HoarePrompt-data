To calculate the output state after running the provided code, we need to consider the impact of the `print` statement on the variables involved.

1. The variables `x1`, `x2`, and `y2` are already defined based on the initial state.
2. `y1` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its value.

The formula used in the `print` statement calculates the Euclidean distance between two points in a 2D plane based on the coordinates `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`.

Since `y1` is unknown, we cannot compute the final distance. Therefore, the output state reflects the known and unknown variables.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `h` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `t1` is radians of (h % 12 * 30 + m * 0.5), `t2` is radians of (m % 60 * 6), `x1` is calculated as `-a * sin(-t1)`, `x2` is calculated as `-b * sin(-t2)`, `y2` is calculated as `b * cos(-t2)`, and `y1` is undefined.`
