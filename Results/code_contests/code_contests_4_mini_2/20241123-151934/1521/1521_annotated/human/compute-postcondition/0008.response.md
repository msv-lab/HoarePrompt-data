The value of `x1` is assigned the expression `-a * sin(-t1)`. The variables `a` and `t1` are defined as input integers and a calculated radian value, respectively. The output state will reflect the assignment of `x1` based on the input values of `a` and `t1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `h` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `t1` is radians of (h % 12 * 30 + m * 0.5), `t2` is radians of (m % 60 * 6), and `x1` is calculated as `-a * sin(-t1)`.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `h` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `t1` is radians of (h % 12 * 30 + m * 0.5), `t2` is radians of (m % 60 * 6), and `x1` is calculated as `-a * sin(-t1)`**
