The code snippet assigns values to the variables `a`, `b`, `h`, and `m` by reading input from standard input and converting each part into an integer. The variables `A` and `B` are integers in the range [1, 1000], while `H` and `M` are also integers within their specified ranges. Since the code reads input and assigns values to `a`, `b`, `h`, and `m`, the previous values of `A`, `B`, `H`, and `M` are not directly affected as they remain unchanged.

However, the output state will reflect the new values assigned to `a`, `b`, `h`, and `m`. Since the actual input is not provided, we can only say that `a`, `b`, `h`, and `m` will take on the integer values inputted by the user.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `h` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer**
