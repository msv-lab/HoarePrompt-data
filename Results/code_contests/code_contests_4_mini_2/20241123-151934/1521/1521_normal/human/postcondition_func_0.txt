The function reads four integer values from standard input: `a`, `b`, `h`, and `m`. It computes the Cartesian coordinates of two points based on the angles represented by the hour and minute hands of a clock, using the lengths `a` and `b`. It then calculates and prints the distance between these two points. The function does not accept parameters directly, and it handles input values where `a` and `b` are between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `h` is between 0 and 11 (inclusive), and `m` is between 0 and 59 (inclusive).
