The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters as defined in the function signature. However, based on the constraints provided, it is implied that the function utilizes the variables `A`, `B`, `H`, and `M` which are defined elsewhere in the code. 

- `A` and `B` are integers between 1 and 1000 (inclusive).
- `H` is an integer between 0 and 11 (inclusive).
- `M` is an integer between 0 and 59 (inclusive).

The output of the function is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact return value or behavior based on the constraints alone.

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters directly but operates on integers A and B between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), H between 0 and 11 (inclusive), and M between 0 and 59 (inclusive). The exact return value or behavior of the function is not specified.**
