The variable `t2` is assigned the value `radians(m % 60 * 6)`. The value of `m` is currently `M`, so we need to calculate `m % 60 * 6`. The output state will reflect the new value of `t2` based on this calculation, while the other variables remain unchanged. 

The calculation for `t2` is as follows:
- `m % 60` will give a value that is `M % 60`.
- Then, multiplying that result by `6` gives `(M % 60) * 6`.
- Finally, the `radians` function will convert this value into radians.

Thus, the output state will include the new value of `t2` and the unchanged values of `a`, `b`, `h`, and `m`.

Output State: **`a` is A, `b` is B, `h` is H, `m` is M, `t1` is radians(h % 12 * 30 + m * 0.5), `t2` is radians(M % 60 * 6)**
