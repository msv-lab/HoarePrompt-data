The variable `y2` is assigned the value of `b * cos(-t2)`. The initial state provides the value of `b` as B and `t2` is defined as `radians(M % 60 * 6)`. Since the values of `M` and `B` are not specified, `y2` will depend on those undefined variables. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Thus, the Output State is: `a` is A, `b` is B, `h` is H, `m` is M, `t1` is radians(h % 12 * 30 + m * 0.5), `t2` is radians(M % 60 * 6), `x1` is -A * sin(-t1), `y1` is A * cos(-t1), `x2` is -B * sin(-t2), and `y2` is B * cos(-t2).

Output State: **`a` is A, `b` is B, `h` is H, `m` is M, `t1` is radians(h % 12 * 30 + m * 0.5), `t2` is radians(M % 60 * 6), `x1` is -A * sin(-t1), `y1` is A * cos(-t1), `x2` is -B * sin(-t2), `y2` is B * cos(-t2)**
