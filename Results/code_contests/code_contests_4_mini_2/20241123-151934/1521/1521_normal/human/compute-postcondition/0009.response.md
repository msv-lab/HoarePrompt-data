The variable `y1` is assigned the value `a * cos(-t1)`. The initial value of `a` is `A`, and `t1` is defined as `radians(h % 12 * 30 + m * 0.5)`. Therefore, `y1` is calculated as `A * cos(-t1)`. The other variables `b`, `h`, `m`, and `t2`, as well as `x1`, remain unaffected. 

The output state is: `a` is A, `b` is B, `h` is H, `m` is M, `t1` is radians(h % 12 * 30 + m * 0.5), `t2` is radians(M % 60 * 6), `x1` is -A * sin(-t1), and `y1` is A * cos(-t1).

Output State: **`a` is A, `b` is B, `h` is H, `m` is M, `t1` is radians(h % 12 * 30 + m * 0.5), `t2` is radians(M % 60 * 6), `x1` is -A * sin(-t1), `y1` is A * cos(-t1)**
