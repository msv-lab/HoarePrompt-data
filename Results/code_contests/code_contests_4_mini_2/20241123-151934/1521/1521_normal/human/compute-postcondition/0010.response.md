The code assigns a new value to `x2`, which is calculated as `-b * sin(-t2)`. The previous value of `b` is B and `t2` is `radians(M % 60 * 6)`. Since `b` is not directly modified, the only change is the assignment of `x2`. Therefore, the output state reflects the values of `a`, `b`, `h`, `m`, `t1`, `t2`, `x1`, and the newly computed `x2`.

Output State: **`a` is A, `b` is B, `h` is H, `m` is M, `t1` is radians(h % 12 * 30 + m * 0.5), `t2` is radians(M % 60 * 6), `x1` is -A * sin(-t1), `y1` is A * cos(-t1), `x2` is -B * sin(-t2)**
