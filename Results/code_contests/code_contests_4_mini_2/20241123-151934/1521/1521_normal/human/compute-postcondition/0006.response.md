To calculate the value of `t1`, we first need to evaluate the expression `radians(h % 12 * 30 + m * 0.5)`.

1. The value of `h` is H.
2. The value of `m` is M.
3. Calculate `h % 12`, which gives us the hour in a 12-hour format.
4. Multiply the result of `h % 12` by 30 to convert the hour into degrees (since each hour represents 30 degrees on a clock).
5. Calculate `m * 0.5`, which converts the minutes into degrees (since each minute represents 0.5 degrees on a clock).
6. Add the two results together: `h % 12 * 30 + m * 0.5`.
7. Use the `radians()` function to convert the total degrees into radians.

At this point, we do not have specific values for `h` and `m`, so we cannot compute a numerical result for `t1`. However, we can describe how `t1` is derived from `h` and `m`.

Output State: **`a` is A, `b` is B, `h` is H, `m` is M, and `t1` is radians(h % 12 * 30 + m * 0.5)**
