The variables `a`, `b`, `h`, and `m` are assigned the values obtained from the input, which consists of four integers split by spaces. The values of `A` and `B` will be assigned to `a` and `b`, while `H` and `M` will be assigned to `h` and `m`, respectively. The specific values for these variables are determined by the input. Other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`a` is A, `b` is B, `h` is H, `m` is M** (where A, B, H, and M are the integer values provided by the input).
