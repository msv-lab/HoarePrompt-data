Output State: **`a` is A, `b` is B, `h` is H, `m` is M, `t1` is radians(h % 12 * 30 + m * 0.5), `t2` is radians(M % 60 * 6), `x1` is -A * sin(-t1), `y1` is A * cos(-t1), `x2` is -B * sin(-t2), `y2` is B * cos(-t2), and the output is the distance between the two points: ((x2 - x1) ** 2 + (y2 - y1) ** 2) ** 0.5.**
