Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not properly handle the construction of the network based on the problem description. The logic used to determine the maximum distance between the two most distant exit-nodes can lead to incorrect results in certain cases.

For example, consider the input:

```
n = 5, k = 2
```

The expected output would have the minimum possible distance between the two exit-nodes as `2` with the connections being:

```
1 2
1 3
3 4
3 5
```

However, the program is designed to calculate the maximum distance primarily based on the division of nodes among the exit-nodes and does not guarantee that it will result in an optimal layout that minimizes the distance between the exit nodes.

In particular, the logic for calculating `maxDistance` does not account for all configurations of the network, especially when `k` is significantly smaller than `n`. This can lead to cases where exit-nodes end up being farther apart than necessary, resulting in incorrect outputs.

Thus, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem for all potential cases, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
