Output State: **If branchLength is greater than 1, the loop will execute branchLength - 1 times, printing pairs of indices starting from startIndex to startIndex + branchLength - 2. If branchLength is 1 or less, the loop does not execute, and there is no output. In that case, n remains an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, k remains an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n - 1, startIndex is a valid index, and branchLength is 1 or less.**
