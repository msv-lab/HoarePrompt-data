The code prints a formatted string with the values `1` and `startIndex`. The value of `startIndex` is not provided in the initial state, so it remains unspecified. The other variables `n` and `k` are not affected by this print statement. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `n` and `k`, along with the printed statement.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n - 1; and the function prints '1' and `startIndex`.**
