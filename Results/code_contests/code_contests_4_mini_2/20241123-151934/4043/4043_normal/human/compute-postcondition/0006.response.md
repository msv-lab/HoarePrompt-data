The code prints the formatted string with the values of `i` and `i + 1`. The variable `i` is defined as `startIndex + branchLength - 1`. Since `startIndex` is a valid index and `branchLength` is greater than 2, `i` will have a specific integer value based on these inputs. The output is generated without altering the values of any variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n - 1, `startIndex` is a valid index, `branchLength` is greater than 2, `i` is `startIndex + branchLength - 1`, and the output is '{0} {1}' where {0} = i and {1} = i + 1**
