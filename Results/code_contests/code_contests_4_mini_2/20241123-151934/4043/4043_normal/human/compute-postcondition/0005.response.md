According to the code, the loop iterates over the range defined by `startIndex` and `branchLength`. Specifically, it will execute as long as `i` is less than `startIndex + branchLength - 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `startIndex + branchLength - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `startIndex + branchLength - 1`. Thus, we need to adjust `i` to be `startIndex + branchLength - 1`, and we also need to ensure that `branchLength` is increased by at least 1 so that the loop can continue to have a valid range.

The only necessary adjustment is to ensure that `i` is less than `startIndex + branchLength - 1`. Since `branchLength` is greater than 1, we can increment it, leading to `branchLength` being at least 2.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n - 1, `startIndex` is a valid index, `branchLength` is greater than 2, `i` is `startIndex + branchLength - 1`, and the output is '{0} {1}' where {0} = i and {1} = i + 1.**
