To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the variables involved in the for loop statement. The loop iterates over the variable `i`, starting from `startIndex` and ending at `startIndex + branchLength - 1`. 

1. **Understanding the loop boundaries**: 
   - The loop will execute if the starting index `startIndex` and the calculated ending index `startIndex + branchLength - 1` are valid. 
   - The loop will run as long as `startIndex` is less than `startIndex + branchLength - 1`.

2. **Conditions for execution**:
   - For the loop to execute at least once, we need `startIndex` to be less than `startIndex + branchLength - 1`, which simplifies to `branchLength` must be greater than 1.
   - Additionally, `startIndex` should be a valid index that does not exceed `n`.

3. **Required states**:
   - We need to ensure that `branchLength` is at least 2 so that the loop can iterate.
   - We also need to ensure that `startIndex` is a valid index (i.e., `0 ≤ startIndex < n`).

Given the provided state information:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n - 1, `startIndex` is a valid index, `branchLength` is greater than 1**.
