The code prints a formatted string using the value of `i` and `i + 1`. However, the initial state does not provide a value for `i`. Therefore, the output will indicate that the values of `i` and `i + 1` are not defined.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n - 1, `startIndex` is a valid index, `branchLength` is greater than 1, and `i` is not defined.**
