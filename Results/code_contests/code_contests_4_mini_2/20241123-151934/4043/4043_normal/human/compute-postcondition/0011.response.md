Functionality: ** The function accepts two parameters, `startIndex` and `branchLength`. It prints pairs of indices starting from `startIndex` up to `startIndex + branchLength - 2` if `branchLength` is greater than 1. If `branchLength` is 1 or less, no pairs are printed. The function always returns the sum of `startIndex` and `branchLength`, which results in `startIndex + 1` if `branchLength` is 1, or `startIndex` if `branchLength` is 0. **
