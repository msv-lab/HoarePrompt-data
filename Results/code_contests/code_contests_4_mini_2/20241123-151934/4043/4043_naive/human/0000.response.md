To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze whether it appropriately constructs a network of `n` nodes with `k` exit-nodes such that the distance between the two most distant exit-nodes is minimized.

Upon reviewing the provided code, the following points are important:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two integers `n` and `k`, which represent the total number of nodes and the number of exit-nodes, respectively.

2. **Distance Calculation**: The code calculates the minimum possible distance between the two most distant exit-nodes with the formula:
   ```
   maxDistance = minLength * 2 + (2 if r >= 2 else r)
   ```
   where `minLength` is derived from the integer division of the remaining nodes after accounting for exit-nodes and `r` represents the remainder. This calculation seems to attempt to ensure that the distance is minimized based on how the exit-nodes can be arranged.

3. **Wire Connections**: The function `func_1` is responsible for printing the connections between nodes. It connects nodes starting from a given index, ensuring that the connections are made sequentially.

4. **Output Requirements**: The program prints the maximum distance followed by the connections between the nodes.

### Potential Issues

- **Branching Logic**: The program assumes that the exit-nodes can be connected in a certain way that may not always result in the minimum possible distance. Specifically, the logic that calculates `maxDistance` does not consider all possible configurations of the nodes and could yield incorrect results for certain configurations of `n` and `k`.

- **Edge Cases**: For instance, if `n = 4` and `k = 2`, the program should ideally produce a configuration that minimizes the distance (e.g., a straight line). However, the branching logic might not handle all node configurations correctly and could potentially lead to an incorrect calculation of the distances for certain arrangements.

### Example Case to Illustrate the Issue

Consider the case where `n = 4` and `k = 2`:
- The expected output would ideally represent the two exit-nodes connected directly to one another with minimum distance.
- However, the program's logic may lead to a configuration that has a higher distance due to how connections are printed or calculated.

Given the analysis and the potential for incorrect outputs based on the branching logic and distance calculations, the program does not guarantee correctness for all inputs.

Correctness: **False**.
