According to the code, the loop is set to execute while `i` is less than `startIndex + branchLength - 1`. The loop will execute again if `i` is still less than `startIndex + branchLength - 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `startIndex + branchLength - 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `startIndex + branchLength - 1`. This means that `i` will equal `startIndex + branchLength - 1`, which is the loop's upper limit, thus the loop cannot execute again.

Therefore, to allow for another iteration, `i` needs to be adjusted to `startIndex + branchLength - 1`, and we also need to ensure that this condition holds true that `i` is less than `startIndex + branchLength - 1`.

State: **`i` is `startIndex + branchLength - 1`**
