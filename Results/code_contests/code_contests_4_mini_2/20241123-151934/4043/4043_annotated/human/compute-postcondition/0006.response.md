The code prints the formatted string with values `i` and `i + 1`. The value of `i` is `startIndex + branchLength - 2`. Since `branchLength` is greater than 1, `i` will be at least `startIndex` (because `branchLength - 2` is at least `-1`).

The printed output will consist of the two values, `i` and `i + 1`. Therefore, the output state is dependent on the value of `i` which can be expressed as `startIndex + branchLength - 2`.

Output State: **`i` is `startIndex + branchLength - 2`; printed output is '{0} {1}'.format(i, i + 1)**
