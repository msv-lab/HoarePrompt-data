The code snippet is a print statement that formats and outputs two values: `1` and `startIndex`. The variable `startIndex` is not defined in the initial state or the provided code, so we cannot determine its value. The value of `n` is provided in the range of integers, but it is not directly used in this print statement. 

Therefore, based solely on the information given, the output state reflects the fact that `1` will be printed along with an undefined `startIndex`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `k` is an integer where 2 ≤ k ≤ n - 1; and print outputs '1' and the value of startIndex which is undefined**.
