The code snippet uses the `print` function to format and display two values: `i` and `i + 1`. However, in the provided context, there is no information about the current value of `i`, and thus it remains unknown. Since `n`, `k`, `startIndex`, and `branchLength` do not directly affect the output of this print statement, their values are not relevant to the output state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `k` is an integer where 2 ≤ k ≤ n - 1, `startIndex` is defined and in the range [0, n - 1], `branchLength` is an integer where branchLength ≥ 2, and the function prints '{0} {1}' formatted with unknown `i` and `i + 1`.**
