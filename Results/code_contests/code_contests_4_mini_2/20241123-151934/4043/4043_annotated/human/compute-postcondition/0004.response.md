The code prints the values of `i` and `i + 1`. The variable `i` is calculated as `startIndex + branchLength - 1`. Given the initial state of `n`, `k`, `startIndex`, and `branchLength`, the value of `i` can be derived based on those variables.

Since `i` is defined as `startIndex + branchLength - 1`, the specific output will depend on the values of `startIndex` and `branchLength`. However, since `i` is guaranteed to be a valid index in the range [0, n - 1], the output will be two consecutive integers starting from `i`.

The output state will include both `i` and `i + 1` based on their computed values.

Output State: **`i` is computed as `startIndex + branchLength - 1`, and the function prints the values of `i` and `i + 1`.**
