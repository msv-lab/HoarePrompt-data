To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the given problem description, we need to analyze the program and its logic.

The problem requires constructing a network of `n` nodes with `k` exit-nodes such that:
1. Each exit-node is connected to exactly one other node.
2. All other nodes must be connected to at least two nodes.
3. The goal is to minimize the maximum distance between any two exit-nodes.

The provided code snippet shows a function `func_1` that seems to print connections based on the parameters `startIndex` and `branchLength`. However, we lack the full context of how this function is utilized within the application that implements the complete solution to the problem.

### Issues identified in the code:

1. **Functionality**: The code only prints a specific set of connections based on the input parameters without any apparent logic to ensure that the overall requirements of the problem are met. Specifically, it does not handle the case of ensuring that all nodes are connected as required by the problem.
  
2. **Connection Logic**: The code does not specify how to handle the remaining nodes after defining the connections for exit nodes, nor does it ensure that non-exit nodes are connected to at least two other nodes.

3. **Distance Calculation**: The program does not compute or minimize the maximum distance between exit-nodes as specified in the problem statement. It only appears to establish a single branch of connections without considering the overall network topology.

### Example where the program fails:

Consider the case where `n = 5` and `k = 3`. The expected output requires that there be a network configuration where three exit nodes are connected in such a way that the distance between the two most distant exit-nodes is minimized. 

If `func_1` were called with parameters that do not form a valid network (e.g., connecting nodes in a straight line or not connecting all nodes correctly), the program would not satisfy the requirements of the problem. For instance, if it only prints connections like `1-2`, `2-3`, but does not include `4` and `5` correctly as exit nodes or ensure they are connected properly, then the output would be invalid.

### Conclusion:

Given the lack of complete logic in the program to handle all aspects of the problem and the potential for incorrect configurations based on the input parameters, we can conclude that the program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
