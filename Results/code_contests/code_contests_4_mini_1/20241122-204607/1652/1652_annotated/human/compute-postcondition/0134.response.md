Postcondition: ***`idx` is incremented by 1, `list_divisors` contains at least 5 elements, and `d` is the fifth element in the list. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a`, and `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is assigned the value of `d`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a` but not divisible by `a`, the value of `a` remains unchanged. If `d` is less than `a`, there is no change to the value of `a`.***
