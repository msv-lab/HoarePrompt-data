Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 128, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is a positive integer, `list_divisors` has at least 4 elements, `a` and `b` are updated based on the value of `d` (which is `list_divisors[3]`). If `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, and `d` is divisible by `b`, then `b` is updated to `d`. If `d` is not divisible by `b` but is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`. After these checks, `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`. If `d` is less than `b` but greater than or equal to `a`, and if `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`. Otherwise, if `d` is less than both `a` and `b`, both `a` and `b` remain unchanged. In all cases, `d` retains its value as `list_divisors[3]`.***
