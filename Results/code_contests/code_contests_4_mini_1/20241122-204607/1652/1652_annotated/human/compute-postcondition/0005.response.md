The code assigns the first and second elements from `list_divisors` to the variables `a` and `b`, respectively. Given that `list_divisors` is a mapped object of integers, `a` and `b` will take on the values of the first two integers from this object. The initial state of `n`, `nb_test`, and `idx` does not change with this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 128, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is a positive integer not equal to 0, `a` is the first integer from list_divisors, `b` is the second integer from list_divisors**
