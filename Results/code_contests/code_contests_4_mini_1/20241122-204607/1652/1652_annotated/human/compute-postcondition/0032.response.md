Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 128, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 3, and `list_divisors` is a list with at least 4 elements. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a` and `d` is a multiple of `a`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a` but not a multiple of `a`, the value of `a` remains unchanged. If `d` is less than `a`, the value of `a` also remains unchanged.***
