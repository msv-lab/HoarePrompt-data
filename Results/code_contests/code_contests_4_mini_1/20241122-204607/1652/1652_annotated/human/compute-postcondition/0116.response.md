To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we analyze the provided state at the end of the previous iteration:

- `idx` has been incremented by 1.
- The conditions regarding `a`, `b`, and `d` have been processed based on the logic described.
- `list_divisors` contains at least 3 elements, and `d` is the third element.

The loop iterates over `list_divisors[2:]`, which means it starts from the third element in the list (index 2) and continues to the end of the list. 

To execute the loop again, we need to ensure that the next value of `d` (the fourth element in `list_divisors`) exists. Therefore, it is necessary that `list_divisors` has at least 4 elements.

Considering the information:
- `d` currently is the third element, so we need to set it to the fourth element in the next iteration.
- Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `list_divisors` must contain at least 4 elements.

State: **`idx` is incremented by 1, `list_divisors` contains at least 4 elements, `d` is the fourth element in the list**.
