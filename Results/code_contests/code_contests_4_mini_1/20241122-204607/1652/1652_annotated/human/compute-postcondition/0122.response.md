The variable `a` is assigned the value of `d`, which is the fourth element in the `list_divisors`. The `idx` variable is incremented by 1, but this does not affect the assignment of `a`. The state of `list_divisors` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `idx` is incremented by 1, `list_divisors` contains at least 4 elements, and `a` is assigned the value of `d`.

Output State: **`idx` is incremented by 1, `list_divisors` contains at least 4 elements, and `a` is assigned the value of `d**
