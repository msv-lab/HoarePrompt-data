Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 128, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is a positive integer, `list_divisors` has at least 4 elements, `a` is either `list_divisors[0]` or `d`, `b` is either updated to `d` if `d` is divisible by previous `b`, or remains as `list_divisors[1]`, and `d` is `list_divisors[3]`. The values of `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`, otherwise they remain unchanged.**
