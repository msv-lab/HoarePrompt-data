Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 128, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is a positive integer not equal to 0, `a` is either equal to `d` if `d` is divisible by the previous value of `a`, or remains unchanged if `d` is not divisible by the previous value of `a`. The list `list_divisors` contains at least 3 elements, `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, and `d` is not divisible by `b`.***
