Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 128, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is a positive integer, `list_divisors` has at least 4 elements, if `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`, while `b` remains as `list_divisors[1]`, and `d` is still `list_divisors[3]`. If `d` is not divisible by `a`, `a` retains its original value.***
