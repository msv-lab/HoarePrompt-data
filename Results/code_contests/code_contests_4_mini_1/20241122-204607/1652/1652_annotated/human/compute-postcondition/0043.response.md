Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 128, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 3, `list_divisors` is a list with at least 5 elements, and `d` is the fifth element in `list_divisors`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, and `d` is divisible by `b`, then `b` is updated to the value of `d`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `b` but not divisible by `b`, and `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`. After these evaluations, the values of `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`. If `d` is less than `b` but greater than or equal to `a`, and `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`. If neither condition for updating `a` nor `b` is met, their values remain unchanged. In all cases, the values of `n`, `nb_test`, `idx`, and `list_divisors` remain unchanged.***
