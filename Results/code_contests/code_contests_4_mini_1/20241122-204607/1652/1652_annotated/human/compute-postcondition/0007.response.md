According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `list_divisors`. The loop iterates over elements starting from the index 2 of the `list_divisors`. For the loop to execute at least once, `list_divisors` must have at least 3 elements (indices 0, 1, and 2). 

The states that need to be adjusted are:
1. `list_divisors` must contain at least 3 elements.
2. The variable `d` will start at `list_divisors[2]`, which means it will be the third element in the list.

The other variables `n`, `nb_test`, `idx`, `a`, and `b` do not directly impact whether the loop can execute, but they need to remain as they are since they do not influence the execution of the loop.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 128, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is a positive integer not equal to 0, `a` is either less than or equal to `b` or `b` is less than `a`, and they are swapped if `a` was greater than `b`, `list_divisors` is a list with at least 3 elements, `d` is `list_divisors[2]`**
