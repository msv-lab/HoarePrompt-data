Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 128, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is a positive integer, and `list_divisors` has at least 3 elements for the loop to execute. If `list_divisors` has fewer than 3 elements, the loop does not execute and both `a` and `b` retain their initial values as `list_divisors[0]` and `list_divisors[1]`, respectively. After the loop executes, `a` and `b` will be updated based on the values of the divisors in `list_divisors` starting from the third element. If no divisors meet the conditions for updates, `a` and `b` may remain unchanged. If divisors do meet the conditions, `a` will always be less than or equal to `b` at the end of the execution.**
