Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 128, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is a positive integer not equal to 0, and `list_divisors` is a list with at least 3 elements, where `d` is `list_divisors[2]` and `d` is greater than or equal to `b`. If `d` is divisible by `b`, then `b` is updated to `d`. If `d` is not divisible by `b` but is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`; otherwise, `a` remains unchanged. The values of `a` and `b` will reflect these updates based on the divisibility conditions.***
