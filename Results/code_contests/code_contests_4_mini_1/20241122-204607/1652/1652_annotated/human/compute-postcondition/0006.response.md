The code snippet swaps the values of `a` and `b` if `a` is greater than `b`. Since the initial state does not specify the specific values of `a` and `b`, we can only determine their relationship based on the condition.

If `a` is greater than `b`, after execution `a` will be assigned the value of `b` and `b` will be assigned the value of `a`. If `a` is not greater than `b`, their values remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the relationship between `a` and `b`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 128, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is a positive integer not equal to 0, `a` is either less than or equal to `b` or `b` is less than `a`, and they are swapped if `a` was greater than `b`.**
