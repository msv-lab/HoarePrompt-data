Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 128, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is a positive integer not equal to 0, `a` is either less than or equal to `b` or `b` is less than `a` (and they are swapped if `a` was greater than `b`), `list_divisors` is a list with at least 3 elements, `d` is `list_divisors[2]`, `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, `d` is not divisible by `b`, and `d` is divisible by `a` (i.e., `d % a == 0`).***
