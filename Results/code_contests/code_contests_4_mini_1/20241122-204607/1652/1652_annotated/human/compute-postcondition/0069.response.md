Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 128, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is a positive integer, `list_divisors` has at least 3 elements, `a` is initially `list_divisors[0]`, `b` is initially `list_divisors[1]`, and `d` is `list_divisors[2]`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, and if `d` is divisible by `b`, then `b` is updated to `d`. If `d` is not divisible by `b` but is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`. Afterward, `a` and `b` are assigned values such that `a` is less than or equal to `b`. If `d` is less than `b` but greater than or equal to `a`, and if `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`. Otherwise, `a` remains unchanged, and both `b` and `d` retain their original values. All updates ensure that `a` is less than or equal to `b` at the end of the execution.***
