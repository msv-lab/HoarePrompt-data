According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as there are lines available in `sys.stdin`. At the end of the last iteration, `idx` has been increased by 1, meaning it has a new value, which we will denote as `idx + 1`. The variables `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and since the loop reads from `sys.stdin`, it will execute again as long as there is another line to read.

We need to ensure that `sys.stdin` still has at least one more line to read for the loop to execute one more time. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `idx` to reflect the current line being processed.

State: **`idx` is `idx + 1`, `a` is unchanged, `b` is unchanged**
