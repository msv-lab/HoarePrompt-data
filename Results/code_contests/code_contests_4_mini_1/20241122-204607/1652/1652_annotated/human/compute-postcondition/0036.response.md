`a` is assigned the value of `d`, which is the fifth element in the `list_divisors`. The value of `d` is known, being `list_divisors[4]`. Other variables are not affected, so the output state reflects the values of `n`, `nb_test`, `idx`, `list_divisors`, and the new assignment of `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 128, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 3, `list_divisors` is a list with at least 5 elements, `d` is the fifth element in the list_divisors, and `a` is equal to `d`**.
