The value of `b` is assigned the value of `d`. Since `d` is known to be greater than or equal to `b` and `d` is divisible by `b`, this means that `b` will take on the value of `d`. The states of the other variables (`n`, `nb_test`, `idx`, `a`, `list_divisors`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 128, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is a positive integer, `a` is the first element of `list_divisors`, `b` is now equal to `d`, `list_divisors` has at least 3 elements, `d` is the third element of `list_divisors`, and `d` is greater than or equal to `b` and divisible by `b`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 128, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is a positive integer, `a` is the first element of `list_divisors`, `b` is now equal to `d`, `list_divisors` has at least 3 elements, `d` is the third element of `list_divisors`, and `d` is greater than or equal to `b` and divisible by `b`.**
