Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 128, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is a positive integer, `list_divisors` has at least 4 elements, `a` is initially `list_divisors[0]`, `b` is initially `list_divisors[1]`, and `d` is `list_divisors[3]`. If `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`. If `d` is not divisible by `a`, the value of `a` remains unchanged.***
