The variable `list_divisors` is assigned the result of `map(int, line.strip().split(' '))`. This line takes a `line` of input, removes any leading or trailing whitespace using `strip()`, splits the line into substrings by spaces using `split(' ')`, and converts each substring to an integer using `map(int, ...)`. 

Since `n` is defined as an integer between 2 and 128, we can assume that the input line contains `n` positive integers. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment of `list_divisors` to a mapped object of integers derived from the line of input.

The other variables (`n`, `nb_test`, and `idx`) remain unaffected by this operation. Thus, the output state is as follows:

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 128, the list contains `n` positive integers, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is a positive integer not equal to 0, and `list_divisors` is a mapped object of integers from the input line.**
