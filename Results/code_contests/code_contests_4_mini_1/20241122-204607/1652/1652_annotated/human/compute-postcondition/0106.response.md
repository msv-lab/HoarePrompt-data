Postcondition: ***`idx` is incremented by 1, `a` is set to `d` if `d` is divisible by `a`, otherwise `a` remains either swapped or unchanged. `b` is either swapped or unchanged, `list_divisors` contains at least 3 elements, `d` is the third element in `list_divisors`, `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, and `d` is not divisible by `b` (i.e., `d % b != 0`).***
