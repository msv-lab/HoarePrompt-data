According to the code, the loop reads lines from `sys.stdin`, which will continue until there are no more lines to read. The variable `idx` indicates the current index, and `nb_test` is set to 0, which suggests that no tests have been processed yet. 

Since `n` is an integer between 2 and 128, it may not directly affect the loop execution, but `idx` needs to be considered to ensure it reflects the state accurately for the next iteration. The loop will continue as long as there are more lines in `sys.stdin`. 

To adjust the state for the next iteration:
1. `idx` should be incremented, as it represents the current line being processed, and we need to prepare for the next line.
2. There is no need to change `nb_test`, `n`, `a`, or `b` based on the information provided.

Thus, the updated state should reflect that `idx` is now the next positive integer (incremented by 1).

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 128, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is a positive integer, and the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.**
