The variable `a` is assigned the value of `d`, which is the fourth element in the `list_divisors`. The increment of `idx` does not affect the value of `a`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `idx` is incremented by 1, `list_divisors` contains at least 4 elements, and `a` is equal to `d`.

Output State: **`idx` is incremented by 1, `list_divisors` contains at least 4 elements, and `a` is equal to `d**
