The value of `idx` is incremented by 1, but since the previous value of `idx` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact new value. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged as the execution does not proceed into the if block. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 128, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is a positive integer not equal to 0, and the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 128, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is a positive integer not equal to 0, and the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.**
