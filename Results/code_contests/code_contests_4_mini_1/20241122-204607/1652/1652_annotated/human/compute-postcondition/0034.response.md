To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the for loop, we examine the provided information:

1. **State at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `n` is an integer between 2 and 128.
   - `nb_test` is 0.
   - `idx` is 3.
   - `list_divisors` is a list with at least 4 elements.

2. **For loop statement**:
   ```
   for d in list_divisors[2:]:
       # the loop body is omit
   ```

### Step-by-step Analysis:

- **Understanding the for loop**: The loop iterates over the elements of `list_divisors` starting from the third element (index 2) to the end of the list. Given that `list_divisors` has at least 4 elements, the starting index is valid.

- **Current state of the loop**: The variable `d` takes values from `list_divisors[2]`, `list_divisors[3]`, and so forth.

- **Current Index**: The current value of `idx` is 3, which means that in the last iteration, `d` was equal to `list_divisors[3]`.

- **Next State of `d`**: For the loop to execute one more time, `d` needs to take the next value in `list_divisors`, which would be `list_divisors[4]`. This is only possible if `list_divisors` has more than 4 elements.

### Conclusion:

- To prepare for the next execution of the loop, we need to ensure that `list_divisors` contains at least 5 elements. Thus, we adjust the state of `list_divisors` accordingly.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 128, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 3, `list_divisors` is a list with at least 5 elements, `d` is the fifth element in the list_divisors (list_divisors[4])**.
