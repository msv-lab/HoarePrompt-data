Postcondition: ***`idx` is incremented by 1, `list_divisors` contains at least 4 elements, and `d` is the fourth element in the list. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a` and `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`. If `d` is less than `a`, then `a` remains unchanged. Additionally, if `d` is greater than or equal to `a` but not divisible by `a`, `a` also remains unchanged.***
