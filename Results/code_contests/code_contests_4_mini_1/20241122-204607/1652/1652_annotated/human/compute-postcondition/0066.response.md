`a` is assigned the value of `d`. The value of `d` is greater than or equal to `a`, less than `b`, and is divisible by `a`. Therefore, after the assignment, `a` takes on the value of `d`, while the other variables remain unchanged. Hence, the output state is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 128, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is a positive integer, `a` is equal to `d`, `b` is an element of `list_divisors`, and `d` is an element of `list_divisors`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 128, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is a positive integer, `a` is equal to `d`, `b` is an element of `list_divisors`, and `d` is an element of `list_divisors**.
