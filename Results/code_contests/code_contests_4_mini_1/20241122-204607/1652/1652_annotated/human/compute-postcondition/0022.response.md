Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 128, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is a positive integer not equal to 0, and `list_divisors` is a list with at least 3 elements. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a`, then if `d` is divisible by `a`, `a` is updated to the value of `d`; otherwise, `a` remains unchanged. The variable `b` is either greater than or equal to `a` or `a` is less than or equal to `b`. Additionally, `d` is less than `b` and greater than or equal to `a`.***
