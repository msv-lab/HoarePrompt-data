Postcondition: ***`idx` is incremented by 1, `list_divisors` contains at least 5 elements, and `d` is the fifth element in the list. If `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, and `d` is divisible by `b`, then `b` is assigned the value of `d`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `b` but not divisible by `b`, then `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`, otherwise they remain unchanged. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a`, and `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is assigned the value of `d`. If `d` is less than both `a` and `b`, there is no change to the values of `a` and `b`. Thus, after the execution, `a` and `b` retain their values unless modified by the conditions described.***
