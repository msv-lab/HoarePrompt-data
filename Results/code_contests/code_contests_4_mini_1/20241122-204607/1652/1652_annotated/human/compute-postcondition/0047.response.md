Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 128, `nb_test` is 0, and `idx` is a positive integer not equal to 0. If `idx` is not 0, `list_divisors` contains at least 3 positive integers, and after processing the divisibility conditions, the variables `a` and `b` will be updated accordingly based on the values in `list_divisors`. Specifically, the smallest of those divisors that is divisible by the largest will be assigned to `b`, and the next smallest that is divisible by the second largest will be assigned to `a`. Finally, the values of `a` and `b` are outputted. If `idx` is 0, the execution does not proceed into the if block, and the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.***
