Postcondition: ***`idx` is incremented by 1, `list_divisors` contains at least 5 elements, and `d` is the fifth element in the list. If `d` is divisible by `b`, then `b` is assigned the value of `d`. If `d` is not divisible by `b` but is divisible by `a`, then `a` is assigned the value of `d`. If `d` is not divisible by either `a` or `b`, then the values of both `a` and `b` remain unchanged.***
