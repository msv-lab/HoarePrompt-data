The code initializes `list_divisors` using `map` to convert each element of the stripped and split `line` into an integer. The initial state indicates that `idx` is incremented by 1, but we do not have specific values for `a` and `b`. The existing variables' states remain unchanged, and there is no return value from this operation.

Output State: **`idx` is `idx + 1`, `a` is unchanged, `b` is unchanged, and `list_divisors` is created from the integers in `line`.**
