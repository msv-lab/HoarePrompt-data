The variable `a` is assigned the value of `d`. Given the initial state, `d` is defined to be an element of `list_divisors` that satisfies multiple conditions, including being between `a` and `b` and being divisible by `a`. Therefore, after the assignment, `a` will take on the value of `d`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 128, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is a positive integer not equal to 0, `a` is now equal to `d`, `b` is either greater than or equal to `a` or `a` is less than or equal to `b`, `list_divisors` is a list with at least 3 elements, `d` is less than `b`, `d` is greater than or equal to `a`, and `d` is divisible by `a`.**
