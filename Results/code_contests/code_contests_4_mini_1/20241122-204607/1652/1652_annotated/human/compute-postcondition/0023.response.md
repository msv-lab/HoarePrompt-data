Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 128, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is a positive integer not equal to 0, and `list_divisors` is a list with at least 3 elements. If `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, then if `d` is divisible by `b`, `b` is updated to the value of `d`. If `d` is not divisible by `b` but is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`. After this, `a` and `b` are either swapped if `a` is greater than `b`, or remain unchanged if `a` is less than or equal to `b`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a` but less than `b`, then if `d` is divisible by `a`, `a` is updated to the value of `d`; otherwise, `a` remains unchanged. In all cases, `d` is bounded by `a` and `b`, ensuring that after execution, the relationships between `a`, `b`, and `d` are maintained, and `b` is always greater than or equal to `a`.***
