`a` is assigned the value of `d`, and `d` is the fifth element in the `list_divisors`. The `idx` variable is not affected by this assignment, and the `list_divisors` remains unchanged with at least 5 elements. Therefore, the output state is: `idx` is incremented by 1, `list_divisors` contains at least 5 elements, `d` is the fifth element in the list, and `a` is assigned the value of `d`.

Output State: **`idx` is incremented by 1, `list_divisors` contains at least 5 elements, `d` is the fifth element in the list, and `a` is assigned the value of `d`**.
