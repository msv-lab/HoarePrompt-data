The code uses `map(int, line.strip().split(' '))` to create an iterable that converts each element in a list of strings (obtained by splitting `line` on spaces and stripping whitespace) into an integer. This does not change the values of the variables `n`, `nb_test`, `idx`, `a`, and `b`. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of these variables while indicating that `list_divisors` is now an iterable of integers derived from `line`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 128, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is a positive integer, and the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged; `list_divisors` is an iterable of integers derived from `line`.**
