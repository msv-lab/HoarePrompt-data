The value of `a` is assigned the value of `d`. Since `d` is already defined as `list_divisors[3]`, `a` will now have the value of whatever is present at that index in `list_divisors`. The values of `n`, `nb_test`, `idx`, `list_divisors`, and `b` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the updates to `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 128, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is a positive integer, `list_divisors` has at least 4 elements, `a` is `list_divisors[3]`, `b` is initially `list_divisors[1]`, and `d` is `list_divisors[3]**
