Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 128, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 3, and `list_divisors` is a list with at least 4 elements. If `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, and if `d` is a multiple of `b`, then `b` is updated to the value of `d`. If `d` is not a multiple of `b` but is a multiple of `a`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`. After this, the values of `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`. If `d` is less than `b` but greater than or equal to `a`, and if `d` is a multiple of `a`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`. If none of these conditions hold, the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged. In all cases, the values of `a` and `b` are adjusted only if the respective conditions are satisfied, ensuring they reflect the current value of `d` where applicable.***
