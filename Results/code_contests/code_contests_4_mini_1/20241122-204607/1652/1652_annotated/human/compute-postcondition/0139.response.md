Postcondition: ***`idx` is incremented by 1, `a` and `b` remain unchanged if `idx` is 0. If `idx` is not 0 and `list_divisors` contains at least 3 elements, `a` and `b` are updated based on the conditions checked in the loop and printed; otherwise, if `list_divisors` has fewer than 3 elements, `a` and `b` remain unchanged and are printed as their original values.***
