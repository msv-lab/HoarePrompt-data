Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 128, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is a positive integer, and `list_divisors` has at least 5 elements. If `d` (which is `list_divisors[4]`) is divisible by `b`, then `b` is updated to `d`. If `d` is not divisible by `b` but is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`. If neither condition is met, `a` remains unchanged while `b` is still updated to `d`.***
