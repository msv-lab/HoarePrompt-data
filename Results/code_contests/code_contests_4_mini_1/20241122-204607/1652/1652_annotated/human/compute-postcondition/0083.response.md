Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 128, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is a positive integer, and `list_divisors` has at least 5 elements. If `d` is equal to `list_divisors[4]` and `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`. Otherwise, `a` remains unchanged. The value of `b` is updated based on the new value of `d`, which is `list_divisors[4]`, regardless of whether the condition is met or not.***
