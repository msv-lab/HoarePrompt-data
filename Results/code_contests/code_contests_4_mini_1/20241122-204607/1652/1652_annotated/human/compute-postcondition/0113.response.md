Postcondition: ***`idx` is incremented by 1. If `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`. The values of `b` may remain unchanged or be swapped. The list `list_divisors` contains at least 3 elements, where `d`, the third element, satisfies the conditions of being less than `b` and greater than or equal to `a`. If `d` is not divisible by `a`, then the value of `a` remains unchanged.***
