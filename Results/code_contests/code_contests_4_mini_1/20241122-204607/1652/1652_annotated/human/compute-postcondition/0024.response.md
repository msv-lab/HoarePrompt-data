To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the provided state information and the loop statement. 

1. We know that `list_divisors` is a list with at least 3 elements. Since the loop iterates through `list_divisors[2:]`, it will start iterating from the third element (index 2) of the list.
2. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements in `list_divisors` starting from index 2 onward.
3. Given that `list_divisors` has at least 3 elements, we can deduce that at the end of the previous iteration, the loop has processed elements up to the second index. 
4. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure there is at least one more element in `list_divisors` beyond the current index.

Since `d` is iterating over `list_divisors[2:]`, if `idx` is currently 2 (the index of the first element being processed), then for the loop to execute again, `idx` should be incremented to 3, and `d` should correspond to the next element in `list_divisors`.

Assuming the list has at least 4 elements, if `list_divisors` has 4 or more elements, we can state that:

- The next value of `d` will be `list_divisors[3]`.
- The index `idx` should be updated to 3.

Thus, the new state at the start of the next iteration will reflect that `d` is now the fourth element of `list_divisors`, and `idx` has been updated accordingly.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 128, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 3, and `list_divisors` is a list with at least 4 elements.**
