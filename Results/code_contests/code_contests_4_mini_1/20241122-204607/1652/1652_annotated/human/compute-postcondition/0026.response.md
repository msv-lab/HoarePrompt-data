The variable `a` is assigned the value of `d`. However, the value of `d` is not defined in the initial state, and therefore it cannot be assigned. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Thus, the output state indicates that `a` is assigned an undefined value.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 128, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 3, `list_divisors` is a list with at least 4 elements, and `a` is assigned an undefined value.**
