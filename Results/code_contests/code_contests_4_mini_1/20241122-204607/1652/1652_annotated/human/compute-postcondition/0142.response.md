Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 128, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, and if `idx` is 1, `a` and `b` remain unchanged. If `idx` is greater than 1 and `list_divisors` contains at least 3 elements, `a` and `b` are updated based on the divisibility conditions checked in the loop. If `list_divisors` contains fewer than 3 elements, `a` and `b` remain unchanged. If `idx` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `a` and `b` remain unchanged.**
