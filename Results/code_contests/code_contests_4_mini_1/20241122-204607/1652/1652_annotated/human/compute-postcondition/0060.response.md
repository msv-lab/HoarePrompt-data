Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 128, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is a positive integer, `list_divisors` has at least 3 elements, `a` is equal to `d` if `d` is divisible by `a`, otherwise `a` remains unchanged. `b` is the second element of `list_divisors`, and `d` is the third element of `list_divisors`, which is not divisible by `b` and is greater than or equal to `b`.***
