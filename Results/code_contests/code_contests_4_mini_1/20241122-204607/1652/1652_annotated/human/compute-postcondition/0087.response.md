Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 128, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is a positive integer, and `list_divisors` has at least 5 elements. If `d` (which is `list_divisors[4]`) is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`. If `a` is not divisible by `d`, `a` remains unchanged. The value of `b` is also updated based on the new value of `d`, although the specific update logic for `b` is not provided in the fragment.***
