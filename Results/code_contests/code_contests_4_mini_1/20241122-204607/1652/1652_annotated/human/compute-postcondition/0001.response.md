The variable `idx` is assigned the value `0`. The initial state of other variables, including `n`, the list of integers, and `nb_test`, remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of all relevant variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 128 (inclusive), the list contains n positive integers where each integer is a divisor of either x or y, with values between 1 and 10,000; `nb_test` is 0; `idx` is 0**
