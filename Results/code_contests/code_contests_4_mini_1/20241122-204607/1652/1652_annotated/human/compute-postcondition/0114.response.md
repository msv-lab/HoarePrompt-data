Postcondition: ***If `d` is greater than or equal to `a`, and `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a` but not divisible by `a`, then `a` remains unchanged. The values of `b` may remain unchanged or be swapped. The list `list_divisors` contains at least 3 elements, where `d` is the third element and is less than `b`.***
