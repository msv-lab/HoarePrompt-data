Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 128, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is a positive integer not equal to 0, `a` is either equal to `d` if `d` is divisible by `a`, or remains unchanged if `d` is not divisible by `a`. `b` is either greater than or equal to `a`, or `a` is less than or equal to `b`. `list_divisors` is a list with at least 3 elements, `d` is less than `b`, and `d` is greater than or equal to `a`.***
