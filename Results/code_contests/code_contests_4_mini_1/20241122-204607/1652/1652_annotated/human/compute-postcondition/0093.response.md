Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 128, `nb_test` is 0, and `idx` is a positive integer. If `idx` is not equal to 0, then `list_divisors` has at least 3 elements, `a` is assigned the first element of `list_divisors`, `b` is assigned the second element, and after processing the remaining elements in `list_divisors`, the values of `a` and `b` will be adjusted based on their divisibility conditions. The final output will be written as '%d %d\n' % (a, b), representing the updated values of `a` and `b`. The values of `a` and `b` will be such that `a <= b`. The unchanged values of `a` and `b` will also satisfy the constraints derived from the input list. If `idx` is equal to 0, no changes are made to `a` or `b` and no output occurs.***
