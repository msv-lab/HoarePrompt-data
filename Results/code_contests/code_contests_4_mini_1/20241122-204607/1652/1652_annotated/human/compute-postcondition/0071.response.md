The value of `b` is assigned the value of `d`. Since `d` is initially `list_divisors[3]`, `b` now takes on that value. The states of the other variables (`n`, `nb_test`, `idx`, `list_divisors`, `a`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 128, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is a positive integer, `list_divisors` has at least 4 elements, `a` is initially `list_divisors[0]`, `b` is now `list_divisors[3]`, and `d` is `list_divisors[3]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 128, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is a positive integer, `list_divisors` has at least 4 elements, `a` is initially `list_divisors[0]`, `b` is now `list_divisors[3]`, `d` is `list_divisors[3]`**
