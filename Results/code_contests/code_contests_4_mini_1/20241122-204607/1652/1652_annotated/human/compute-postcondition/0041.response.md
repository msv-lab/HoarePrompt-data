Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 128, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 3, `list_divisors` is a list with at least 5 elements, and `d` is the fifth element in the list_divisors. If `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is assigned the value of `d`. If `d` is not divisible by `a`, then the value of `a` remains unchanged.***
