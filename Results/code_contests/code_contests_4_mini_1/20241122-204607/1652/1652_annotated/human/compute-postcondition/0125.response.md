Postcondition: ***`idx` is incremented by 1, `list_divisors` contains at least 4 elements, and `d` is the fourth element in the list. If `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, and if `d` is divisible by `b`, then `b` is updated to `d`. If `d` is not divisible by `b` but is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`. After these updates, the values of `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` was greater than `b`. If `d` is less than `b` but greater than or equal to `a`, and if `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`. If `d` is less than both `b` and `a`, then both `a` and `b` remain unchanged. In all cases, the relationships among the values of `a`, `b`, and `d` are preserved according to the conditions stated.***
