Postcondition: ***`idx` is `idx + 1`, `a` is either swapped or unchanged, `b` is either swapped or unchanged, `list_divisors` has at least 3 elements, `d` is the third element in `list_divisors`, `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, `d` is not divisible by `b`, and `d` is divisible by `a` (i.e., `d % a == 0`)***
