Postcondition: ***`idx` is incremented by 1, `list_divisors` contains at least 4 elements, and `d` is the fourth element in the list. If `d` is divisible by `b`, then `b` is assigned the value of `d`. If `d` is not divisible by `b` but is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`. If `d` is not divisible by either `b` or `a`, the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.***
