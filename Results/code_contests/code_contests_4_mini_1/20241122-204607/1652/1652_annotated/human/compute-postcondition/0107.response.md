Postcondition: ***`idx` is incremented by 1. If `d` is divisible by `b`, then `b` is updated to the value of `d`, while `a` remains either swapped or unchanged. If `d` is not divisible by `b` but is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`, while `b` remains either swapped or unchanged. The list `list_divisors` contains at least 3 elements, `d` is the third element in `list_divisors`, and `d` is greater than or equal to the previous value of `b`. In summary, after the execution of the program fragment, either `b` equals `d` if `d` is divisible by `b`, or `a` equals `d` if `d` is divisible by `a`, with both remaining conditions of `a` and `b` being either swapped or unchanged.***
