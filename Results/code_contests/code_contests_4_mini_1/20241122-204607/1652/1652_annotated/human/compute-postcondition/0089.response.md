Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 128, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is a positive integer, and `list_divisors` has at least 5 elements. If `d` (which is `list_divisors[4]`) is greater than or equal to `b`, then if `d` is divisible by `b`, `b` is updated to `d`; if not, and if `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`. After these checks, `a` and `b` are assigned based on the condition where `a > b`. If `d` is less than `b` but greater than or equal to `a`, and if `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`. If `d` is less than both `a` and `b`, then both `a` and `b` remain unchanged.***
