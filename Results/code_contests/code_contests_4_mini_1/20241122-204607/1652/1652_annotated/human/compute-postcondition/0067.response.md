Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 128, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is a positive integer, `a`, `b`, and `d` are elements of `list_divisors` with at least 3 elements. If `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`. Otherwise, `a` remains unchanged, while `b` and `d` retain their original values, ensuring that `d` is greater than or equal to `a` and less than `b`.***
