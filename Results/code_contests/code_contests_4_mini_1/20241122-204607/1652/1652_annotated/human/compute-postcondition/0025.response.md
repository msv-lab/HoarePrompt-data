The variable `b` is assigned the value of `d`. However, the value of `d` is not defined or specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine the value of `b`. The states of the other variables (`n`, `nb_test`, `idx`, and `list_divisors`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `b` is assigned an undefined value.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 128, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 3, `list_divisors` is a list with at least 4 elements, and `b` is assigned an undefined value from `d`.**
