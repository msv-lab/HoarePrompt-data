The statement `a = d` assigns the value of `d` to `a`. Initially, `a` is the first element of `list_divisors`, and `d` is the third element of `list_divisors`. Since `d` is greater than or equal to `b` and is divisible by `a`, the value of `a` will now be replaced by the value of `d`. The values of `n`, `nb_test`, `idx`, `b`, and `list_divisors` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 128, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is a positive integer, `a` is now equal to `d`, `b` is the second element of `list_divisors`, `list_divisors` has at least 3 elements, and `d` is the third element of `list_divisors`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 128, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is a positive integer, `a` is now equal to `d`, `b` is the second element of `list_divisors`, `list_divisors` has at least 3 elements, and `d` is the third element of `list_divisors`.**
