The variable `nb_test` is assigned the value 0. The values of `n` and the list of integers are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `nb_test` while keeping the other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 128 (inclusive), the list contains n positive integers where each integer is a divisor of either x or y, with values between 1 and 10,000; `nb_test` is 0**
