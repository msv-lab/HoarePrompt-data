The values of `a` and `b` are assigned from the first two elements of `list_divisors`, which is created from the integers in `line`. The state of `idx`, `a`, and `b` will be updated accordingly. However, without knowing the specific contents of `list_divisors`, I can only state that `a` will take the value of the first element and `b` will take the value of the second element of `list_divisors`. The values of `a` and `b` will change based on the contents of `list_divisors`, but their specific values are unknown.

Output State: **`idx` is `idx + 1`, `a` is the first element of `list_divisors`, `b` is the second element of `list_divisors`**
