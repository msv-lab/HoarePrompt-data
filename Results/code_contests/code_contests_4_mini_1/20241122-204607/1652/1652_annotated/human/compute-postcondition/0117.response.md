`b` is assigned the value of `d`, and since `d` is the fourth element in `list_divisors`, its value is taken from that element. The state of `idx` and `list_divisors` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `idx` is incremented by 1, `list_divisors` contains at least 4 elements, `d` is the fourth element in the list, and `b` is assigned the value of `d`.

Output State: **`idx` is incremented by 1, `list_divisors` contains at least 4 elements, `d` is the fourth element in the list, and `b` is assigned the value of `d`.**
