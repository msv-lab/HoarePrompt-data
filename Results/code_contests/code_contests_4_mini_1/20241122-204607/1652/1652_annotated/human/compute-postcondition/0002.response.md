According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there is input available from `sys.stdin`. The variables `n`, `nb_test`, and `idx` are not directly influencing the execution of the loop since it is dependent on the availability of input lines. However, at the start of the loop, `idx` should represent the current index of the line being processed, starting from 0, and `nb_test` is likely to count the number of lines processed.

For the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `sys.stdin` has at least one line of input available. Since `n` is already between 2 and 128, it does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, but it does imply that the list of integers is prepared.

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to indicate that input is available. The relevant variables would be `idx`, which starts at 0, and `nb_test` which could be 0 at the start.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 128, the list contains n positive integers, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 0, there is at least 1 line of input in sys.stdin**
