Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 128, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is a positive integer, `list_divisors` has at least 3 elements, `a` and `b` are the first and second elements of `list_divisors` respectively, and `d` is the third element of `list_divisors` which is greater than or equal to `b`. If `d` is divisible by `b`, then `b` is updated to `d`. If `d` is not divisible by `b` but is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`. If `d` is not divisible by either `b` or `a`, then `a` remains unchanged and `b` remains as the second element of `list_divisors`, while `d` is greater than or equal to `b`.***
