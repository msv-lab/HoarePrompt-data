Postcondition: ***`idx` is incremented by 1. If `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, and `d` is divisible by `b`, then `b` is updated to `d`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `b` but not divisible by `b`, and `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`. After these checks, `a` and `b` are either swapped or remain unchanged based on their previous values. If `d` is less than `b` but greater than or equal to `a`, and `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`. If `d` is less than `b` and less than `a`, then both `a` and `b` remain unchanged. The list `list_divisors` contains at least 3 elements, where `d` is the third element.***
