The value of `idx` is incremented by 1, but since the previous value of `idx` is unknown, we cannot determine its exact new value. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and since `idx` is now increased, we cannot conclude anything about the state regarding the output. Therefore, the output state is that `idx` has been increased by 1 without affecting `a` and `b`.

Output State: **`idx` has been increased by 1; `a` and `b` remain unchanged**
