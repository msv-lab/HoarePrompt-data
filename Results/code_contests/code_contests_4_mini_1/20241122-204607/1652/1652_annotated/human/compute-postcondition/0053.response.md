According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `list_divisors`. The loop iterates over the elements starting from the third element in `list_divisors`, which means that `list_divisors` must have at least 3 elements for the loop to execute. The current values of `n`, `nb_test`, `idx`, `a`, and `b` do not affect the execution of the loop directly, but they should remain unchanged.

To ensure the loop executes:
1. `list_divisors` must have at least 3 elements.
2. The variable `d` will take the value of the third element in `list_divisors`, which corresponds to `list_divisors[2]` on the first iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 128, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is a positive integer, `a` is list_divisors[0], `b` is list_divisors[1], `list_divisors` has at least 3 elements, `d` is list_divisors[2]**
