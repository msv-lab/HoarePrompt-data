Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 128, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is a positive integer, and `list_divisors` contains at least 3 elements. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a`, and if `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a` but not divisible by `a`, then `a` remains unchanged. In either case, `b` and `d` retain their original values, ensuring that `d` is less than `b`.***
