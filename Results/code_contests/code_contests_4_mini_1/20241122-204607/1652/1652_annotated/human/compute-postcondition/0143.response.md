The function `func` accepts a parameter `n`, which is an integer between 2 and 128 (inclusive). Additionally, it accepts a list containing `n` positive integers, where each integer is a divisor of either `x` or `y`, with values ranging from 1 to 10,000. However, the specific return value of the function is not provided in the output details. Therefore, based on the provided information, we can summarize the functionality as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (between 2 and 128 inclusive) and a list of `n` positive integers (each a divisor of either `x` or `y`, with values between 1 and 10,000).**
