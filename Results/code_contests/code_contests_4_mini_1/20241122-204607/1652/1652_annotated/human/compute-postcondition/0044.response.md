To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the provided information and how it relates to the loop.

1. **Understanding the loop**: The loop iterates over `list_divisors[2:]`, which means it starts from the third element in `list_divisors` (index 2) and continues until the end of the list. The variable `idx` is currently 3, which means the loop has processed up to the fourth element (index 3) of `list_divisors` in the previous iteration.

2. **State of `idx`**: Since `idx` is currently 3, this means that in the next iteration of the loop, `d` will take the value of the element at index 4 (the fifth element) of `list_divisors`. 

3. **Length of `list_divisors`**: The state mentions that `list_divisors` has at least 5 elements. Therefore, there is still at least one more element (the sixth element) after the current one, provided that the list has more than 5 elements. 

4. **Conditions for further execution**: For the loop to execute one more time after the current iteration, `list_divisors` must have at least 6 elements, so that `d` can take the value of the sixth element in the next iteration.

5. **Adjusting the state**: We need to ensure that `list_divisors` has at least 6 elements for the loop to be able to continue. The value of `idx` will also need to be incremented to reflect the next position in the next iteration.

Considering all of the above, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `list_divisors` has at least 6 elements, and the index should be updated to 4 (the next index).

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 128, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 4, `list_divisors` is a list with at least 6 elements, and `d` is the sixth element in `list_divisors`.**
