The variable `a` is assigned the value of `d`, which is currently defined as `list_divisors[2]`. The initial state indicates that `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, `d` is not divisible by `b`, and `d` is divisible by `a`. 

Since `d` is assigned to `a`, the value of `a` will be equal to `d`. The values of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 128, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is a positive integer not equal to 0, `a` is equal to `d`, `list_divisors` is a list with at least 3 elements, `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, `d` is not divisible by `b`, and `d` is divisible by the previous value of `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 128, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is a positive integer not equal to 0, `a` is equal to `d`, `list_divisors` is a list with at least 3 elements, `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, `d` is not divisible by `b`, and `d` is divisible by the previous value of `a`.**
