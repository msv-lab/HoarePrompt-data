To determine the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the provided information step by step.

1. **Current state analysis**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `idx` has been incremented by 1.
   - `list_divisors` contains at least 5 elements.
   - `d` is the fifth element in the list.

2. **Loop iteration**: The loop is defined as `for d in list_divisors[2:]:`, which means it will iterate over the elements of `list_divisors` starting from the third element (index 2) to the end of the list.

3. **Determining the next state**:
   - Since `d` is currently the fifth element, the next value of `d` in the next iteration will be the sixth element in `list_divisors`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `list_divisors` must have at least 6 elements. 

4. **Adjustments to the state**:
   - Since `list_divisors` already contains at least 5 elements, we need to ensure it has at least 6 elements for the next loop iteration.
   - The value of `d` will need to be updated to reflect the next element in the list, which will be the sixth element.
   - The value of `idx` will also need to be incremented again since it progresses with each loop iteration.

Thus, the adjusted state must reflect that `list_divisors` contains at least 6 elements, `d` is now the sixth element in the list, and `idx` has been incremented.

State: **`idx` is incremented by 1, `list_divisors` contains at least 6 elements, `d` is the sixth element in the list.**
