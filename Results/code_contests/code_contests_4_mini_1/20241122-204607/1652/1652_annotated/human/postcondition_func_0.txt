The function reads multiple lines of input, each containing space-separated integers. For each line after the first, it identifies two smallest integers from the input (denoted as `a` and `b`) and updates them based on the divisibility of subsequent integers in the line. It outputs the final values of `a` and `b` for each line processed. If there are fewer than three integers in the line, the values of `a` and `b` are not updated and remain unchanged. The function does not have any parameters and uses standard input for reading data.
