The function processes lines of input from standard input, each containing a list of integers that represent the divisors of two positive integers. For each line after the first, it identifies and updates two variables `a` and `b` based on the divisors, specifically looking for the largest divisors that are multiples of the smallest ones. Finally, it outputs the resulting values of `a` and `b`. If there are fewer than two divisors in the input line, `a` and `b` may not be updated, and the function does not handle any exceptions or validate the input. If no lines are provided, the function does nothing.
