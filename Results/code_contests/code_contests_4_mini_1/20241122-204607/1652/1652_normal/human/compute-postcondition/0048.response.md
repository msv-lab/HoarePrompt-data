The value of `idx` is incremented by 1, but since the previous value of `idx` is not specified, we cannot determine its new value. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged from their initial values as the code only affects `idx`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `idx` has been incremented.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 128, `idx` is not equal to 0 and has been incremented by 1; `a` and `b` remain unchanged from their initial values.**
