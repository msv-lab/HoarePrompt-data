According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the input from `sys.stdin`. The loop continues to process lines from standard input until there are no more lines to read.

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 128\), `idx` has been incremented by 1 (meaning it is now at least 1), and `a` and `b` remain unchanged. Since the loop reads lines from standard input, for the loop to execute one more time, there must be another line available to read from `sys.stdin`.

Since we don't have information about the number of lines available in `sys.stdin`, we can only assert that for the loop to execute again, there must be at least one more line available. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` do not need to change, but `idx` needs to reflect that the loop has processed an additional line.

Thus, we need to adjust `idx` to account for the next line being read. If `idx` was incremented by 1 during the last iteration, we now set it to be one more than its previous value.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 128, `idx` is equal to its previous value plus 1, `a` remains unchanged, `b` remains unchanged**
