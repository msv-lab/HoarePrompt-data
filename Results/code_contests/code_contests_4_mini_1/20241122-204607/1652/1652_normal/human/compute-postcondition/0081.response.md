The variable `b` is assigned the value of `d`. Since `d` has a value assigned from `list_divisors[3]`, `b` now takes that value. The other variables (`n`, `idx`, `list_divisors`, `a`) remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `b`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `idx` is equal to its previous value plus 1, `list_divisors` has at least 5 elements, `a` is assigned the value of `list_divisors[0]`, `b` is assigned the value of `d`, and `d` is assigned the value of `list_divisors[3]**
