Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `idx` is equal to its previous value plus 1, `list_divisors` has at least 4 elements, `b` is assigned the value of `list_divisors[1]`, and if `d` (which is `list_divisors[3]`) is divisible by `a` (which is `list_divisors[0]`), then `a` is updated to the value of `d`; otherwise, `a` remains unchanged.***
