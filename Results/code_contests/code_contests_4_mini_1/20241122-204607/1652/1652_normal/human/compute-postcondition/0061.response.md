Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `idx` is equal to its previous value plus 1, `list_divisors` has at least 3 elements, `a` is assigned the value of `list_divisors[0]`, and `b` is assigned the value of `list_divisors[1]`. If `d` (the third element in `list_divisors`) is divisible by `b`, then `b` is updated to `d`. If `d` is not divisible by `b` but is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`. If `d` is neither divisible by `b` nor `a`, `a` remains equal to its previous value (which is `list_divisors[0]`). In all cases, `d` is greater than or equal to `b`.***
