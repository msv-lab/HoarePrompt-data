`a` is assigned the value of `d`, and since `d` is the fourth element in `list_divisors`, its value is defined and does not change. The states of the other variables (`n`, `idx`, and `list_divisors`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `idx` is greater than 1, `list_divisors` has at least 4 elements, and `d` is the fourth element in `list_divisors`; `a` is the value of `d`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `idx` is greater than 1, `list_divisors` has at least 4 elements, `d` is the fourth element in `list_divisors`, and `a` is the value of `d`**
