Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `idx` is greater than 1, `list_divisors` has at least 3 elements, `d` is the third element in `list_divisors`, and `d` is less than `b`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a`, then if `d` is divisible by `a`, `a` is updated to `d`; otherwise, the value of `a` remains unchanged. If `d` is less than `a`, the value of `a` remains unchanged.***
