In the provided context, we need to determine the necessary adjustments to the states to allow the loop to execute one more time.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `n` is at least 3, which means `list_divisors` has at least 3 elements.
- `list_divisors` contains at least 5 integers, which means `d` can be the fifth integer or greater.
- `d` is currently the fifth integer in `list_divisors`.

The loop iterates over `list_divisors[2:]`, which means it starts from the third element (index 2) and goes to the end. The current value of `d` is at index 4 since it is the fifth integer. 

To execute the loop one more time, we need to ensure that:
1. The current index (which corresponds to `d`) is incremented to the next element in the list.
2. The loop continues as long as there are more elements in `list_divisors` after the current one.

Given that `d` is currently at index 4, to allow the loop to execute again, `list_divisors` must contain at least 6 integers (so it can access index 5). 

Thus, the necessary adjustments are:
- `list_divisors` must contain at least 6 integers.
- `d` must be updated to the sixth integer in `list_divisors`.
  
Based on these observations and requirements, the adjusted state will be:

State: **`n` is at least 3, `list_divisors` contains at least 6 integers, and `d` is the sixth integer in `list_divisors`.**
