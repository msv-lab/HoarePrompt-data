Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `idx` is greater than 1, `list_divisors` has at least 5 elements, and `d` is the fifth element in `list_divisors`. If `d` is divisible by `b`, then `b` is assigned the value of `d`. If `d` is not divisible by `b` but is divisible by `a`, then `a` is assigned the value of `d`. If `d` is not divisible by either `b` or `a`, the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.***
