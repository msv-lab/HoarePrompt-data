Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `idx` is equal to its previous value plus 1, and `list_divisors` has at least 4 elements. If `d` (which is `list_divisors[3]`) is divisible by `b` (which is `list_divisors[1]`), then `b` is updated to the value of `d`. If `d` is not divisible by `b` but is divisible by `a` (which is `list_divisors[0]`), then `a` is updated to the value of `d`. If neither condition is met, both `a` and `b` remain unchanged.***
