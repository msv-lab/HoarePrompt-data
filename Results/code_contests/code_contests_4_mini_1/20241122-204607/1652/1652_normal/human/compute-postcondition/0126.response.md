According to the code, the loop will execute again as long as there are more elements in `list_divisors` starting from index 2. 

At the end of the last iteration, `list_divisors` has at least 4 elements, and `d` is the fourth element in `list_divisors`. This means the loop has processed the elements at indices 2 and 3 and is currently at index 4. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `list_divisors` must have at least 5 elements, and `d` needs to be updated to the fifth element in `list_divisors`. 

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `list_divisors` must have at least 5 elements.
- `d` should be updated to the fifth element in `list_divisors`.
- `idx` remains greater than 1, as it does not need adjustment.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `idx` is greater than 1, `list_divisors` has at least 5 elements, and `d` is the fifth element in `list_divisors`.**
