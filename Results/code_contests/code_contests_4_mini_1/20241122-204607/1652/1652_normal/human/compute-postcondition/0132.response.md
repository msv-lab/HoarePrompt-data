`a` is assigned the value of `d`, and since `d` is the fifth element in `list_divisors`, `a` takes on that value. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `idx` is greater than 1, `list_divisors` has at least 5 elements, and `d` is the fifth element in `list_divisors`; `a` is the same as `d`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `idx` is greater than 1, `list_divisors` has at least 5 elements, `d` is the fifth element in `list_divisors`, and `a` is the same as `d`**.
