According to the code, the loop execution depends on the input from `sys.stdin`. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are more lines to read from the standard input. 

At the end of the last iteration, `idx` is greater than 0 and has been increased by 1. This indicates that `idx` is now at least 1. The variable `n` is within the range of 2 to 128, but this does not directly affect the loop execution since the loop itself is dependent on the input lines.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state assuming there is at least one more line available in `sys.stdin`. Since `idx` is already greater than 0 and has been incremented, we need to capture the new state of `idx` which would be `idx` is greater than 1.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 128, `idx` is greater than 1, `a` is a value from `list_divisors`, `b` is a value from `list_divisors`**
