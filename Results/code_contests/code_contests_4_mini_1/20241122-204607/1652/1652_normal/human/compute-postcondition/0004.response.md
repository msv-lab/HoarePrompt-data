The code assigns the value of `list_divisors` to the result of `map(int, line.strip().split(' '))`, which processes a line of input by stripping any leading or trailing whitespace, splitting the line into separate components based on spaces, and then converting each component to an integer. Since `n` is an integer and `list_divisors` will contain `n` integers, the state of `list_divisors` is now a map object containing `n` integers derived from the input line.

The other variables, `nb_test` and `idx`, are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 128, `list_divisors` contains `n` integers derived from the input line, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is not equal to 0**
