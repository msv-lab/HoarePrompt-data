The variable `a` is assigned the value of `d`, which means that `a` will take on whatever value `d` currently holds. The values of `n`, `idx`, and `list_divisors` are not affected by this assignment. Previous values indicate that `d` is assigned from `list_divisors[3]`, but the specific value of `d` is not provided.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `idx` is equal to its previous value plus 1, `list_divisors` has at least 5 elements, `a` is assigned the value of `d`, and `d` is equal to `list_divisors[3]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `idx` is equal to its previous value plus 1, `list_divisors` has at least 5 elements, `a` is assigned the value of `d`, and `d` is equal to `list_divisors[3]`.**
