The values of `a` and `b` are assigned the first and second elements of `list_divisors`, respectively. Since `list_divisors` contains `n` integers, `a` will take the value of `list_divisors[0]` and `b` will take the value of `list_divisors[1]`. The previous states of `n`, `list_divisors`, `nb_test`, and `idx` are not affected. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment of `a` and `b` from `list_divisors`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 128, `list_divisors` contains `n` integers derived from the input line, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is not equal to 0, `a` is list_divisors[0], `b` is list_divisors[1]**
