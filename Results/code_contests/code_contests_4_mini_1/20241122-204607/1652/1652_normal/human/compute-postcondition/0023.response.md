Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 3, `list_divisors` contains at least 3 integers, and `d` is the third integer in `list_divisors`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, and if `d` is divisible by `b`, then `b` is updated to `d`. If `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`. After these checks, `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`. If `d` is less than `b` and greater than or equal to `a`, `a` is updated to `d` if `d` is divisible by `a`. If `d` is less than both `a` and `b`, both `a` and `b` remain unchanged. This covers all edge cases related to the comparisons and divisibility of `d`, `a`, and `b`.***
