The variable `nb_test` is initialized to 0. Since there are no other variables affected or modified by the code snippet provided, the output state reflects the initial assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 128; the list of divisors contains n integers d_i where 1 ≤ d_i ≤ 10^4; `nb_test` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 128; the list of divisors contains n integers d_i where 1 ≤ d_i ≤ 10^4; `nb_test` is 0**
