Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `idx` is greater than 1, `list_divisors` has at least 5 elements, and `d` is the fifth element in `list_divisors`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a`, and `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is set to the value of `d`. Otherwise, the value of `a` remains unchanged.***
