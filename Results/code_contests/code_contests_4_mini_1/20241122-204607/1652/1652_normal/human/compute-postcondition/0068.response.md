Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `idx` is equal to its previous value plus 1, `list_divisors` has at least 3 elements, `a` is assigned the value of `list_divisors[0]`, `b` is assigned the value of `list_divisors[1]`, and `d` is the third element in `list_divisors` (list_divisors[2]) with `d` less than `b`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a` and is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`; otherwise, `a` remains unchanged. If `d` is less than `a`, the value of `a` also remains unchanged.***
