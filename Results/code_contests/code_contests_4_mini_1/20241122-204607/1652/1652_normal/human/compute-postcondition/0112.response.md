`a` is assigned the value of `d`. Given that `d` is defined as the third element in `list_divisors`, and it meets the conditions specified (i.e., `d` is less than `b`, `d` is greater than or equal to `a`, and `d` is divisible by `a`), the value of `a` will now be equal to `d`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 128, `idx` is greater than 1, `list_divisors` has at least 3 elements, `d` is the third element in `list_divisors`, `d` is less than `b`, `d` is greater than or equal to `a`, and `d` is divisible by `a`; `a` is equal to `d`.**
