According to the code, the loop iterates over `list_divisors` starting from the third element (index 2) onward. For the loop to execute, `list_divisors` must have at least 3 elements. The provided state indicates that `n` is an integer between 2 and 128, and `idx` is greater than 1, but it does not give us any information about the length or contents of `list_divisors`. 

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to confirm that `list_divisors` contains at least 3 elements. Additionally, since `d` is iterating over `list_divisors[2:]`, `d` will be the value at index 2 in `list_divisors` during the first iteration of the loop.

Thus, for the loop to execute, we need to state that `list_divisors` has at least 3 elements, and `d` is the value of the third element in `list_divisors`. The initial states `n` and `idx` do not directly impact the execution of the loop, but we keep them for context.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 128, `idx` is greater than 1, `list_divisors` has at least 3 elements, `d` is the third element in `list_divisors`**
