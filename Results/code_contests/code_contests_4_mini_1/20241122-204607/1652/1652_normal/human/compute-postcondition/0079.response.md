Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `idx` is equal to its previous value plus 1, and `list_divisors` has at least 4 elements. The variables `a` and `b` are assigned the values of `list_divisors[0]` and `list_divisors[1]` respectively, while `d` is assigned the value of `list_divisors[3]`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, and `d` is divisible by `b`, then `b` is updated to `d`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, but not divisible by `b`, and `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`. After these conditions, `a` and `b` are swapped if `a > b`. If `d` is less than `b` but greater than or equal to `a`, and `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`. If `d` is less than both `a` and `b`, or does not meet the divisibility conditions for either, then both `a` and `b` remain unchanged. This ensures that the final values of `a` and `b` reflect all conditions applied to `d`, covering each edge case.***
