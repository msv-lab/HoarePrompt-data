According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the input from `sys.stdin`. The loop will execute as long as there are lines to read from the standard input. Since `n` is specified to be an integer between 2 and 128, and `divisors` contains `n` integers, we need to ensure that there are lines available in the standard input for the loop to execute.

Before the loop starts, `nb_test` is 0 and `idx` is 0, which indicates that no tests have been processed yet. For the loop to execute, we need at least one line of input from `sys.stdin`. 

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that there is at least one line of input available.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 128, list of divisors contains n integers d_i where 1 ≤ d_i ≤ 10^4, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is 0, there is at least one line in sys.stdin**
