Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 128, `idx` is equal to its previous value plus 1, `a` is assigned the value of `list_divisors[0]`, `b` is assigned the value of `list_divisors[1]`, `list_divisors` has at least 3 elements, `d` is the third element in `list_divisors` (list_divisors[2]), `d` is not divisible by `b`, and `d` is divisible by `a`.***
