The code `list_divisors = map(int, line.strip().split(' '))` does not modify the values of `n`, `idx`, `a`, or `b`. Instead, it processes the string `line`, stripping whitespace and splitting it into separate components, and then converts those components into integers using `map`. Since the initial state does not provide or affect the value of `line`, we cannot determine the resulting values of `list_divisors`. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 128, `idx` is equal to its previous value plus 1, `a` remains unchanged, `b` remains unchanged**
