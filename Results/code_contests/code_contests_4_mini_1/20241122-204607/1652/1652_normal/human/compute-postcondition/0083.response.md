Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `idx` is equal to its previous value plus 1, `list_divisors` has at least 5 elements, `a` is assigned the value of `d`, `b` remains equal to `list_divisors[1]`, and if `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to the current value of `d`. If `d` is not divisible by `a`, `a` retains its previous value.***
