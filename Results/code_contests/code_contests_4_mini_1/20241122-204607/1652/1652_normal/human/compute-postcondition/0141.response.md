According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the input provided via `sys.stdin`. The loop continues to read lines from standard input until there are no more lines to read. 

At the end of the last iteration, `idx` is greater than 1 and has been incremented by 1, meaning it is now at least 2. The variable `n` is an integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 128`, but it does not affect the continuation of the loop as the loop depends on the availability of lines in `sys.stdin`.

To prepare for the next iteration, we only need to consider the state of `idx`. Since `idx` has been incremented by 1, it must be adjusted to reflect the next value, which would be `idx + 1`.

Thus, the necessary adjustments are:
- The value of `idx` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `idx` is greater than 2, `a` and `b` are values from `list_divisors`**
