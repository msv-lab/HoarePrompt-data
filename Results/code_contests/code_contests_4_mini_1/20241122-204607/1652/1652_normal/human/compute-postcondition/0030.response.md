`a` is assigned the value of `d`, and `d` is the fourth integer in `list_divisors`. Since `d` is already defined, the value of `a` will be equal to that of `d`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 3, `list_divisors` contains at least 4 integers, `d` is the fourth integer in `list_divisors`, and `a` is assigned the value of `d`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `list_divisors` contains at least 4 integers, `d` is the fourth integer in `list_divisors`, and `a` is assigned the value of `d`**
