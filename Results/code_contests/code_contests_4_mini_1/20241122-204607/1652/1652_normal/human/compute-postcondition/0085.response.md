The code performs a conditional swap of the values of `a` and `b` based on their comparison. If `a` is greater than `b`, `a` and `b` are swapped. If `a` is not greater than `b`, their values remain unchanged. Since the values of `a` and `b` are not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine their exact values post-execution. Therefore, we only know that the values of `a` and `b` may change depending on their initial values.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`, otherwise, they remain unchanged.**
