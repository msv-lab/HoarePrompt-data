The variable `a` is assigned the value of `d`. Previously, `a` held the value of `list_divisors[0]`, and now it takes on the value of `d`. Since `d` is divisible by `a` (which was `list_divisors[0]`), and `d` is not divisible by `b` (which is `list_divisors[1]`), the assignment changes the value of `a`. Other variables remain unaffected.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 128, `idx` is equal to its previous value plus 1, `b` is assigned the value of `list_divisors[1]`, `list_divisors` has at least 3 elements, and `d` is equal to `list_divisors[2]` and is not divisible by `b`, but `a` is now equal to `d`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 128, `idx` is equal to its previous value plus 1, `b` is assigned the value of `list_divisors[1]`, `list_divisors` has at least 3 elements, `d` is equal to `list_divisors[2]`, `d` is not divisible by `b`, but `a` is now equal to `d`.**
