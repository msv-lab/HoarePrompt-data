The variables `a` and `b` are assigned new values based on their current values. If `a` is greater than `b`, they are swapped; otherwise, they remain in their current order. The initial values of `a` and `b` are derived from `list_divisors`, and since `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 128, `a` and `b` are guaranteed to be integers from this list. 

The output state will depend on the initial comparison of `a` and `b`. If `a` is greater than `b`, their values will be swapped; if not, they will remain unchanged. Therefore, after this operation, the output state reflects the new values of `a` and `b` based on their initial comparison.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 128, `list_divisors` contains `n` integers derived from the input line, `nb_test` is 0, `idx` is not equal to 0, `a` and `b` are either swapped or remain the same based on their initial values.**
