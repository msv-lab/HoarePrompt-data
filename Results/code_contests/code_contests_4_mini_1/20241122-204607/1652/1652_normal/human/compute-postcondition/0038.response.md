Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 3, `list_divisors` contains at least 5 integers, and `d` is the fifth integer in `list_divisors`. If `d` is divisible by `b`, then `b` is set to the value of `d`. If `d` is not divisible by `b` but is divisible by `a`, then `a` is set to the value of `d`. If `d` is not divisible by either `b` or `a`, the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.***
