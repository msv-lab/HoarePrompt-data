The value of `idx` is incremented by 1. Since the previous value of `idx` is greater than 0, it means the program has executed a block that assigned values to `a` and `b`. However, the specific values of `a` and `b` are not provided. Therefore, the output state will reflect the change in `idx` and mention that the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 128, `idx` is greater than 0, `a` is a value from `list_divisors`, `b` is a value from `list_divisors`, and `idx` is increased by 1.**
