Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `idx` is greater than 1, `list_divisors` has at least 4 elements, and `d` is the fourth element in `list_divisors`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, and `d` is divisible by `b`, then `b` is updated to the value of `d`. If `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`. After the inner conditions, `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`, otherwise they remain unchanged. If `d` is less than `b` but greater than or equal to `a`, and if `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`. If none of these conditions hold, the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.***
