The variable `b` is assigned the value of `d`, and `d` is the fourth element in `list_divisors`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `idx` is greater than 1, `list_divisors` has at least 4 elements, and `d` is the fourth element in `list_divisors`; `b` is equal to `d`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `idx` is greater than 1, `list_divisors` has at least 4 elements, `d` is the fourth element in `list_divisors`, and `b` is equal to `d`**
