The value of `idx` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `idx` is greater than 1. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged since the code snippet does not affect them directly. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `idx` is greater than 1, `a` and `b` are values from `list_divisors`, and `idx` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `idx` is greater than 1, `a` and `b` are values from `list_divisors`, and `idx` is incremented by 1.**
