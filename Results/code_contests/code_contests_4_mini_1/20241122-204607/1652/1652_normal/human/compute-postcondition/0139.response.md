Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `idx` is greater than 1, and `a` and `b` are values from `list_divisors`. If `idx` is not 0, `list_divisors` is parsed from the input, and the first two elements are assigned to `a` and `b` (with their order adjusted if `a` is greater than `b`). The loop iterates over any additional divisors; if they are greater than or equal to `b`, `b` is updated if divisible by `d`, and `a` is updated if `d` is divisible by `a`. If the divisor is greater than or equal to `a`, `a` may be updated if divisible by `d`. Finally, the current values of `a` and `b` are printed. If `list_divisors` contains fewer than 2 elements, the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.***
