The variable `idx` is initialized with the value `0`. This does not affect any other variables in the initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the other variables and the new assignment to `idx`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 128; the list of divisors contains n integers d_i where 1 ≤ d_i ≤ 10^4; `nb_test` is 0; `idx` is 0**
