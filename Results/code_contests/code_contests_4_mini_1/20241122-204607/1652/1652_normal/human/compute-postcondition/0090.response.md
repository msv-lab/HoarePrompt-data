To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Understanding the Loop**: The for loop iterates over `list_divisors` starting from the third element (index 2). The loop continues as long as there are elements in the slice `list_divisors[2:]`.

2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `n` is between 2 and 128.
   - `idx` has been incremented by 1.
   - `list_divisors` has at least 5 elements.
   - `a` is `list_divisors[0]`.
   - `b` is `list_divisors[1]`.
   - `d` is `list_divisors[3]` from the previous iteration.

3. **Next Iteration Requirements**: For the loop to execute one more time, `d` in the next iteration must be assigned the next element from `list_divisors`, specifically `list_divisors[4]`. This means that `list_divisors` must have at least 5 elements, and since we know that `list_divisors` has at least 5 elements, we will check if `list_divisors` has more than 4 elements to ensure the loop can continue.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since `d` was previously `list_divisors[3]`, for the next iteration, `d` should be updated to `list_divisors[4]`.
   - The conditions for `a` and `b` may also need to be considered depending on the value of `d`.

5. **Conclusion on State Adjustments**: 
   - `d` must be updated to `list_divisors[4]` to ensure the loop can continue.
   - No changes are necessary for `a` and `b` at this point as they were not directly impacted by `d` in terms of the loop's execution condition.

Based on this analysis, the updated state for the start of the next iteration of the loop should reflect that `d` is now the next element in `list_divisors`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `idx` is equal to its previous value plus 1, `list_divisors` has at least 5 elements, `a` is assigned the value of `list_divisors[0]`, `b` is assigned the value of `list_divisors[1]`, and `d` is assigned the value of `list_divisors[4]`**
