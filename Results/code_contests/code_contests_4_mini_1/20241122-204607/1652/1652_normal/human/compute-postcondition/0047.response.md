Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 128, and `idx` is not equal to 0. The list of divisors contains `n` integers `d_i` where 1 ≤ `d_i` ≤ 10^4. The integers `a` and `b` are initialized to the first two values of the list of divisors, arranged in non-decreasing order. If `idx` is not 0, the values of `a` and `b` may be updated based on the divisors in the list. After processing, `a` is the largest divisor that is less than or equal to the second smallest value of the list, and `b` is the largest divisor that is greater than or equal to the second smallest value, ensuring that both `a` and `b` retain their relationships established during the iteration. If no divisors meet the criteria for modification, `a` and `b` remain unchanged from their initial values.***
