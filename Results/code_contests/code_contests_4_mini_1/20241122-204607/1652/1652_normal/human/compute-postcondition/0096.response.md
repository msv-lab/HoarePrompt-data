The variable `list_divisors` is assigned the value of `map(int, line.strip().split(' '))`, which converts the result of `line.strip().split(' ')` into a map of integers. The variables `n`, `idx`, `a`, and `b` remain unaffected as they are not involved in this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the new assignment of `list_divisors`, while the other variables retain their previous state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 128, `idx` is greater than 1, `a` is a value from `list_divisors`, `b` is a value from `list_divisors`, and `list_divisors` is a map of integers from the line input.**
