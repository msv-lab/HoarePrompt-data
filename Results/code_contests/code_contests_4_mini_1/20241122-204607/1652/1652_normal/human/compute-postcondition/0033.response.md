Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 3, `list_divisors` contains at least 4 integers, and `d` is the fourth integer in `list_divisors`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, and if `d` is divisible by `b`, then `b` is updated to `d`. If `d` is not divisible by `b` but is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`. After evaluating these conditions, `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`. If `d` is less than `b` but greater than or equal to `a`, and if `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`. In all other cases, both `a` and `b` remain unchanged.***
