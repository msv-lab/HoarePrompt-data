Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `idx` is equal to its previous value plus 1, and `list_divisors` has at least 5 elements. If `d` is divisible by `b`, then `b` is updated to the current value of `d`. If `d` is not divisible by `b` but is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to the current value of `d`. If neither condition is satisfied, `a` remains equal to its previous value and `b` retains its value as `list_divisors[1]`.***
