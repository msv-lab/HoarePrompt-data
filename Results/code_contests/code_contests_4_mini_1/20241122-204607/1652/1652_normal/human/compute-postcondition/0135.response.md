Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `idx` is greater than 1, `list_divisors` has at least 5 elements, and `d` is the fifth element in `list_divisors`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, and if `d` is divisible by `b`, then `b` is updated to `d`. If `d` is not divisible by `b` but is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`. After these checks, `a` and `b` may be swapped if `a` is greater than `b`. If `d` is less than `b` but greater than or equal to `a`, and `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`. If none of these conditions are met, both `a` and `b` remain unchanged. In all cases, the values of `a` and `b` reflect the adjustments made based on the divisibility checks involving `d`.***
