Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 3, `list_divisors` contains at least 3 integers, `d` is the third integer in `list_divisors`, `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, and `d` is not divisible by `b`. If `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to equal `d`. If `d` is not divisible by `a`, the value of `a` remains unchanged.***
