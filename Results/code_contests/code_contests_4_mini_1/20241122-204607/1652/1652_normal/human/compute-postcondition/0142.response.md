Output State: **`if idx is 0, the loop does not execute; `a` and `b` remain unchanged from their initial values. If idx is at least 1, `a` and `b` are values from `list_divisors` obtained after the first iteration, `idx` is incremented accordingly. The final values of `a` and `b` depend on the conditions met by the divisors in the list. If there are fewer than 2 divisors in `list_divisors`, the inner loop may not execute, and `a` and `b` will not be updated.**
