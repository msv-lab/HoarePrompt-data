Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `idx` is equal to its previous value plus 1, `list_divisors` has at least 4 elements, `a` is assigned the value of `list_divisors[0]`, `b` is assigned the value of `list_divisors[1]`, and `d` is the fourth element in `list_divisors`. If `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to the value of `d`; otherwise, the value of `a` remains unchanged.***
