The variable `b` is assigned the value of `d`. Since `d` is the fourth integer in `list_divisors`, `b` will take that value. The values of other variables `n` and `list_divisors` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `list_divisors` contains at least 4 integers, `d` is the fourth integer in `list_divisors`, and `b` is assigned the value of `d`**.
