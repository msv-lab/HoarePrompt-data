Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `idx` is greater than 1, `list_divisors` has at least 3 elements, and `d` is the third element in `list_divisors`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, then if `d` is divisible by `b`, `b` is updated to `d`; if `d` is divisible by `a`, `a` is updated to `d`. After this, `a` and `b` are either unchanged or swapped depending on their initial values. If `d` is less than `b` but greater than or equal to `a`, and if `d` is divisible by `a`, `a` is updated to `d`; otherwise, `a` remains unchanged. If `d` is less than both `a` and `b`, both `a` and `b` remain unchanged.***
