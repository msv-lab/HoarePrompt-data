According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `list_divisors`. The loop iterates over `list_divisors[2:]`, which means it starts from the third element of the `list_divisors`. For the loop to execute, `list_divisors` must have at least 3 elements (since indexing starts at 0). 

The initial state indicates that `n` is between 2 and 128, which means `list_divisors` can contain up to 128 integers. As long as `n` is at least 3, the loop will execute. Given that `nb_test` is 0 and `idx` is not equal to 0, these variables do not affect the loop execution directly.

To ensure that the loop executes, we can adjust the state to reflect that `list_divisors` has at least 3 integers and specify the values for `d`, which will be the third integer in the `list_divisors`.

State: **`n` is at least 3, `list_divisors` contains at least 3 integers, `d` is the third integer in `list_divisors`**
