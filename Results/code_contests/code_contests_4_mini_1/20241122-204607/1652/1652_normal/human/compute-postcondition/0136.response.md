According to the code, the loop will execute again for the next element in `list_divisors`, starting from the third element (index 2) onward. At the end of the last iteration, `d` is the fifth element in `list_divisors`. 

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state of `d` to reflect the next element in `list_divisors`. Since `list_divisors` has at least 5 elements, there are additional elements available for the loop to iterate over.

Therefore, we need to set `d` to the sixth element in `list_divisors`. The index `idx` is greater than 1, so we can keep it unchanged. We also need to confirm that `list_divisors` still has at least 5 elements, which is satisfied as it has at least 6 elements after the last iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `idx` is greater than 1, `list_divisors` has at least 6 elements, and `d` is the sixth element in `list_divisors`.**
