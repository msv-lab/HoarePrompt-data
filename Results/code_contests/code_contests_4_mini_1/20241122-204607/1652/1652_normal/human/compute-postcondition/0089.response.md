Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `idx` is equal to its previous value plus 1, `list_divisors` has at least 5 elements, `a` is assigned the value of `list_divisors[0]`, `b` is assigned the value of `list_divisors[1]`, and `d` is assigned the value of `list_divisors[3]`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, and `d` is divisible by `b`, then `b` is updated to `d`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `b` but not divisible by `b`, and if `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`. After this, `a` and `b` are swapped if `a` is greater than `b`. If `d` is less than `b` but greater than or equal to `a`, and `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is updated to `d`. Otherwise, both `a` and `b` remain unchanged. All possible conditions have been considered, including cases where `d` is equal to `a` or `b`, and cases where `d` is less than both.***
