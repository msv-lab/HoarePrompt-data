Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 128, `idx` is greater than 0. If `idx` is not equal to 0, `a` is assigned the value of the first element of `list_divisors`, and `b` is assigned the value of the second element of `list_divisors`. The function then writes the values of `a` and `b` to stdout. Throughout the execution, if any subsequent divisors in `list_divisors` modify `a` or `b`, they will maintain the order such that `a` is always less than or equal to `b`. If `idx` is 0, the program does not execute the block and the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.***
