Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `idx` is greater than 1, and `list_divisors` has at least 5 elements with `d` being the fifth element. If `d` is divisible by `a`, then `a` is assigned the value of `d`. If `d` is not divisible by `a`, the value of `a` remains unchanged.***
