The value of `b` is assigned the value of `d`, which is the fourth element in `list_divisors`. The previous value of `b` was `list_divisors[1]`, and `d` is `list_divisors[3]`. Therefore, after execution, `b` will now hold the value of `d`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 128, `idx` is equal to its previous value plus 1, `list_divisors` has at least 4 elements, `a` is assigned the value of `list_divisors[0]`, `b` is now equal to `list_divisors[3]`, and `d` is `list_divisors[3]`.**
