Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 3, `list_divisors` contains at least 5 integers, and `d` is the fifth integer in `list_divisors`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `b`, then if `d` is divisible by `b`, `b` is updated to `d`; if `d` is divisible by `a`, `a` is updated to `d`. After these checks, `a` and `b` may be swapped based on their values. If `d` is less than `b` but greater than or equal to `a`, then if `d` is divisible by `a`, `a` is updated to `d`, otherwise, `a` remains unchanged. If `d` is less than both `a` and `b`, both `a` and `b` remain unchanged.***
