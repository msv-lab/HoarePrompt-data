To determine the output state after executing the provided Python code, we need to analyze the initial state and the code snippet.

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`; `ai` are integers such that -1000 ≤ `ai` ≤ 1000 for each `i` in range(`n`); `r` is defined as a lambda function that maps input to integers; `a` and `b` are assigned the values returned by the lambda function `r()`.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```
print - sum(sorted(r())[:b])
```

1. The lambda function `r()` is called, which returns a list of integers. Let's denote this list as `list_r`.
2. The list `list_r` is then sorted in ascending order, resulting in `sorted_r`.
3. The first `b` elements of `sorted_r` are taken (i.e., `sorted_r[:b]`).
4. The sum of these `b` elements is computed.
5. The negative of this sum is printed.

Since `a` and `b` are defined as the values returned by the lambda function `r()`, we assume `b` is well-defined and falls within the range specified (1 ≤ `b` ≤ `n`).

However, the exact values of `a`, `b`, and the contents of `list_r` depend on the implementation of `r()`, which is not provided. Therefore, we cannot compute specific numerical results, but we can describe the output state in general terms.

The output state will reflect that the function prints the negative sum of the smallest `b` sorted elements from the output of `r()`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`; `ai` are integers such that -1000 ≤ `ai` ≤ 1000 for each `i` in range(`n`); `a` and `b` are integers returned by the lambda function `r()`; the code prints the negative sum of the smallest `b` sorted integers returned by `r()`**.
