Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`; `ai` are integers such that -1000 ≤ `ai` ≤ 1000 for each `i` in range(`n`); `r` is defined as a lambda function that maps input to integers; `a` and `b` are assigned the values returned by the lambda function `r()`.**
