The function `func` reads input values and processes them to compute a result. It uses a lambda function to read integers from user input, where it expects two values `a` and `b`. It then reads an additional set of integers and computes the sum of the `b` smallest integers from that set. The result is printed as a negative value of this sum.

However, there are several aspects to consider:
- The function does not explicitly define what happens if the input does not meet the expected conditions (e.g., if fewer integers are provided than expected, or if `b` is greater than the number of integers read).
- The function does not handle exceptions that may arise from invalid input (such as non-integer values).
- The function effectively does not return any value; it only prints the result.

Given these points, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: ** The function reads two integers from input, then reads a list of integers and prints the negative sum of the `b` smallest integers from that list. It does not handle input errors or define behavior for unexpected input scenarios. **
