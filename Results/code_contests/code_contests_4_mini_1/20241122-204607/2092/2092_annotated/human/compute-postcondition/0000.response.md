The code defines `r` as a lambda function that maps the input from `raw_input()` (which is expected to be a space-separated string of integers) to integers. It does not change the values of `n`, `m`, or any `ai` as these variables are not modified or affected by this line. The output state reflects the unchanged values of `n`, `m`, and the range of `ai`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, and `ai` are integers such that -1000 ≤ `ai` ≤ 1000 for each `i` in range(`n`); `r` is defined as a lambda function that maps input to integers.**
