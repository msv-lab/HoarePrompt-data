The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters as its signature shows no input parameters. However, the constraints suggest that there are inputs related to integers `n`, `m`, and a list of integers `ai`. The output is not specified in the provided details, so we will focus on the constraints and relationships.

Based on the constraints:
- `n` is an integer that must be between 1 and 100 (inclusive).
- `m` is an integer that must be between 1 and `n` (inclusive).
- `ai` are integers that can take values from -1000 to 1000 for each index `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`.

Since the output is not provided, we cannot determine the exact return value of the function. Therefore, we will summarize the function based on the accepted constraints.

Functionality: **The function implicitly works with parameters n, m, and a list a of integers ai, where n is between 1 and 100, m is between 1 and n, and each ai is an integer between -1000 and 1000. The specific return value of the function is not defined.**
