To determine the output state, we first need to analyze the impact of the provided code snippet on the initial state.

1. The lambda function `r()` produces a list of integers, which is assigned to `a`.
2. The variable `b` is also assigned a value from the output of the lambda function `r()`, which indicates that `b` is a non-negative integer such that `1 ≤ b ≤ n`.
3. The `sum(sorted(r())[:b])` expression computes the sum of the smallest `b` integers from the sorted list `r()` (which is effectively the same as the list assigned to `a`).
4. The `print -` statement negates the computed sum and prints the result.

Since `r()` produces values that affect both `a` and `b`, we can conclude that the output state will reflect the values of `n`, `m`, and the computed result of the print statement.

Thus, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `m` is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n, `a` is the sorted list of integers from `r`, `b` is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ n, and the result is -sum(sorted(r())[:b]).**
