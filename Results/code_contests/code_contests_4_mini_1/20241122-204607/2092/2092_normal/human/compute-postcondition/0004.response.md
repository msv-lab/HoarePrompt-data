Functionality: ** The function reads a sequence of integers from user input, where the first two integers are `a` and `b`. It then calculates and prints the negative sum of the smallest `b` integers from a subsequent list of `a` integers. The function does not validate input for the specified constraints, so it may not handle cases where inputs do not meet the expected ranges. Additionally, the function does not return any values; it only prints the result. **
