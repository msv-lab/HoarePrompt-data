The code assigns a lambda function to `r`, which is defined to take no arguments and returns the result of `map(int, raw_input().split())`. This function will read a line of input, split it into components, and convert each component to an integer. However, the variables `n`, `m`, and `a` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state remains focused on the definition of the lambda function and the state of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `m` is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer ai is in the range of -1000 to 1000, and `r` is a lambda function that maps input to integers.**
