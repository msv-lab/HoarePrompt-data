The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `a`. The parameter `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `m` is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `ai` is in the range of -1000 to 1000. 

The output of the function is not specified in detail, but based on the constraints, the functionality of the function handles a list of integers and performs operations based on the values of `n` and `m`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer n (1 to 100), a non-negative integer m (1 to n), and a list a of n integers (each between -1000 and 1000).**
