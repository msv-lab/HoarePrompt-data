To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the logic of the code and the requirements.

The problem description outlines that Mr. Funt has a total income `n` and must pay taxes based on how he splits his income. The tax is calculated as the maximum divisor of `n` that is not equal to `n`. The overall goal is to minimize the total tax he has to pay by optimally splitting `n` into parts greater than or equal to 2.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Function `func_7(n)`**: This function checks if `n` is prime. The logic is flawed because it returns `False` for `n` if there is any divisor found in the range, but it does not handle the case where `n` is prime correctly as it does not return `True` for prime numbers. The condition `n != i` is unnecessary in the context of checking primality.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - If `n` is prime, the output should be `1` because the only way to split a prime number is to take it as a whole, and the maximum divisor less than `n` is `1`.
   - If `n` is even, the output should be `2`, which is correct because the maximum divisor of any even number is `n/2`.
   - If `n` is odd and not prime, the check `elif func_7(n - 2):` attempts to see if `n - 2` is prime. If it is, then splitting into two parts (2 and `n-2`) is optimal, which would yield a tax of `2`. However, if `n - 2` is not prime, the program defaults to outputting `3`.

### Potential Case:
- Let's consider `n = 9`. The program would:
  - Determine that `9` is not prime (it is actually composite, as it is divisible by `3`).
  - The program would then check if `n - 2 = 7` is prime, which it is.
  - Therefore, it would output `2`.

However, if we think about splitting `9` into three parts, like `3 + 3 + 3`, the maximum divisor would be `3`, which is a lower tax compared to `2` when taking `n = 9` as a whole.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not handle the case correctly for all potential inputs, specifically when `n` is odd and composite. Therefore, the program does not fully comply with the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.
