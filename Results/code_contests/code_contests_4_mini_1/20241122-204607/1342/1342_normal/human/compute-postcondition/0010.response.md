According to the code, the loop will execute while `i` is less than the upper limit `int(n ** 0.5 + 100)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4. Given that `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, we need to ensure that `i` is less than the upper limit for the loop to execute again.

To determine the necessary adjustments:
1. The current value of `i` is 4.
2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 5.
3. The upper limit for `i` is `int(n ** 0.5 + 100)`. For the loop to execute again, `5` must be less than this upper limit.

Since `n` is greater than or equal to 2, let's check the conditions:

- The smallest `n` that satisfies `int(n ** 0.5 + 100) > 5` is when `n` is at least 25 (because `int(5 + 100)` will be 105, which is greater than 5).
- Therefore, `n` needs to be at least 25 for the loop to execute with `i` equal to 5.

Thus, we adjust:
- `n` to be at least 25
- `i` to be 5

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 25, `i` is 5**
