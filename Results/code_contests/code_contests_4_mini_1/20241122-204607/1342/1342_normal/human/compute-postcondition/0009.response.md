Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and `i` is 4. If `n` is divisible by `i` and `n` is not equal to `i`, the function returns False. If `n` is equal to `i`, the function does not return anything; otherwise, if `n` is not divisible by `i`, it also does not return anything.***
