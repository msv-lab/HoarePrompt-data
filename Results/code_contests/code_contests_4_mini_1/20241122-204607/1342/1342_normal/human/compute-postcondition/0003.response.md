Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, and the upper limit is at least 102. If `n` is divisible by `i` and `n` is not equal to `i`, the function returns False, indicating that `n` is not a prime number. If `n` is equal to `i` or not divisible by `i`, the function does not return any value.***
