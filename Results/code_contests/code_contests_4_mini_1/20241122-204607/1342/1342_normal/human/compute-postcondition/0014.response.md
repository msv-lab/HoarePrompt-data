Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (greater than or equal to 2) and checks whether it is a prime number. It returns False if `n` is divisible by any integer `i` (from 2 to the square root of `n` plus 100, excluding `n` itself), indicating that `n` is not prime. If no divisors are found, it returns True, indicating that `n` is a prime number. However, for the specific case when `n` is 2, the function does not explicitly return a value, which leads to an implicit return of None instead of confirming that 2 is a prime number. Therefore, the function does not handle this edge case correctly, as it should return True for 2.**
