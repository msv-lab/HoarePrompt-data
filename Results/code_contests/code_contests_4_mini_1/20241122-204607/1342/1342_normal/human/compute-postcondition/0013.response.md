The function `func_7` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is an integer that is greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^9. 

- Case 1: If `n` is divisible by any integer `i` from 2 to at least 102, the function returns `False`, indicating that `n` is not a prime number. If `n` is equal to `i`, it does not return anything. If `n` is not divisible by `i`, it also does not return anything. Specifically, for `n` equal to 2, the function will return nothing, indicating that 2 is prime.
  
- Case 2: If `n` is not divisible by any integer `i` in the specified range, the function returns `True`, indicating that `n` is a prime number.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_7` is to accept an integer `n` and determine if it is a prime number, returning `True` if it is prime and `False` if it is not, while handling the special case of `n` equal to 2 by returning nothing. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, returns False if n is not a prime number, and returns True if n is a prime number. For n equal to 2, it returns nothing, indicating that 2 is prime.**
