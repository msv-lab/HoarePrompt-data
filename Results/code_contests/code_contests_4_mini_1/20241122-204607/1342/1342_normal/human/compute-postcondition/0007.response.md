According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range defined by `i`. The loop iterates over a range starting from 2 up to `int(n ** 0.5 + 100)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3. 

To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to check the next value of `i`, which would be 4. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be less than `int(n ** 0.5 + 100)`.

The current state is:
- `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, which means `n` could be any value starting from 2.
- `i` is currently 3.

Now, we need to ensure that `i` can increment to 4 and still be less than `int(n ** 0.5 + 100)`. 

Since `n` is greater than or equal to 2, the smallest value for `n` is 2. Using this value:
- `int(n ** 0.5 + 100)` would be at least `int(2 ** 0.5 + 100)`, which equals `int(1.414 + 100) = 101`.

This means that `i` can increment beyond 3 as long as it's less than 101, which it will be since the next value of `i` is 4.

Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment is the increment of `i` to 4.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 4**
