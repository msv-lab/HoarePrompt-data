According to the code, the loop iterates over a range starting from 2 up to `int(n ** 0.5 + 100)`. For the loop to execute, the starting value (2) and the upper limit (`int(n ** 0.5 + 100)`) must be considered. Given that `n` is at least 2, the expression `int(n ** 0.5 + 100)` will also yield a value greater than or equal to 102, since the minimum value of `n` (which is 2) gives `int(âˆš2 + 100)` which is effectively 101.

Thus, for the loop to execute, it is necessary that `i` starts at 2 and the upper limit is at least 102. The variable `i` will take the values from 2 to `int(n ** 0.5 + 100) - 1`.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, and the upper limit is at least 102**
