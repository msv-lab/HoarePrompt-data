Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and `i` is 3. If `n` is divisible by `i` and `n` is not equal to `i`, the function returns False. If `n` is equal to `i` or not divisible by `i`, the function does not return any value. This ensures that for any integer `n` that is greater than or equal to 2, the function correctly identifies whether `n` is a multiple of 3, except when `n` is 3 itself.***
