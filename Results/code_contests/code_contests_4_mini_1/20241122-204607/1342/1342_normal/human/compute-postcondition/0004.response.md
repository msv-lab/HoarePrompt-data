According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the current value of `i` and the upper limit of the loop, which is `int(n ** 0.5 + 100)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2. The upper limit is at least 102, meaning the loop can execute for values of `i` starting from 2 up to at least 101.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, the new value of `i` will be 3. The upper limit does not need to be adjusted since it is already greater than 102.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 3, upper limit is at least 102**
