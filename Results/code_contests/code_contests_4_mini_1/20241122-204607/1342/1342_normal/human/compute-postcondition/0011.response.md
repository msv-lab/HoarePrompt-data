Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` iterates from 2 to at least 102. If `n` is divisible by any `i` (where `i` is not equal to `n`), the function returns False, indicating that `n` is not a prime number. If `n` is equal to `i`, it does not return anything. If `n` is not divisible by `i`, it also does not return anything. The loop will not execute if `n` is less than 2, but since `n` is guaranteed to be at least 2 in the initial state, the loop will always execute at least once. If `n` is 2, the loop will execute but will not find any divisors within the range, resulting in no return statement. Hence, for `n` equal to 2, the function will return nothing, indicating that 2 is prime.**
