The function accepts a list of integers and returns the product of all integers in the list. If the list is empty, it will result in an error due to the use of `eval`, which may not handle the case correctly, potentially leading to unintended behavior. The function does not handle non-integer values or non-numeric types in the list, which could also lead to errors.
