To assess the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description and the accompanying output hints, we will analyze the code and the hints step by step.

### Problem Description:
- Mr. Funt has to pay taxes based on his total income `n` as the maximum divisor of `n` that is not equal to `n`. 
- He can split `n` into parts `n1 + n2 + ... + nk = n` such that each part `ni` is at least 2.
- We need to find the minimum possible tax he has to pay.

### Functions Analysis:
1. **Function 1** (`func_1`): Reads input as a string. No issues here since we don't rely on this for the main computation.
2. **Function 2** (`func_2`): Reads input as an integer but lacks validation for the input range (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9). This could lead to invalid returns if improper values are provided.
3. **Function 3** and **Function 4**: Read input but are not directly related to the main functionality. They also lack validation.
4. **Function 5**: Outputs a number but does not affect the tax calculation.
5. **Function 6**: Attempts to calculate the product of a list of integers but is not utilized in the tax calculation.
6. **Function 7**: Checks if `n` is prime. This function has a flaw regarding the edge case of `n = 2`, as it does not return True explicitly for 2, leading to potentially incorrect handling.

### Main Logic:
- If `n` is prime, it returns 1 (indicating the tax for a single part).
- If `n` is even, it returns 2 (indicating he can split it into two parts).
- If `n` is odd and can be expressed as `n-2` being prime, it also returns 2.
- Otherwise, it returns 3.

### Edge Cases:
1. **When `n = 2`**: The function should return 1 since the maximum divisor (1) is the only valid tax. However, the prime check fails to return True, which leads to undefined behavior (implicitly returning None).
  
2. **When `n = 3`**: Should return 1 since it is prime.

3. **When `n = 4`**: Returns 2, which is correct.

4. **When `n = 27`**: The function correctly identifies that it cannot be split into two valid parts as both 9 and 18 are not prime, thus returning 3.

### Output Hints Analysis:
The output hints state that the program lacks handling for edge cases such as `n = 2`. This aligns with our findings that `func_7` does not correctly handle prime determination for the number 2, leading to incorrect tax calculations.

### Conclusion:
The program does not cover every potential case correctly. Specifically, the handling of `n = 2` is flawed due to the implicit None return from `func_7`. 

Correctness: **False**.
