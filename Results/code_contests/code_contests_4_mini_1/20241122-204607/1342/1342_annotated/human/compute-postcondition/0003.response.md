Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^9 and `i` is 2. If `n` is even and not equal to 2, the function returns False, indicating that `n` is not a prime number. If `n` is equal to 2 or an odd integer, the function does not return False, implying that `n` may be a prime number or is being evaluated further.***
