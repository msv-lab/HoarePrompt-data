According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the upper limit `int(n ** 0.5 + 100)`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than this upper limit.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4. The range for the loop is from 2 to `int(n ** 0.5 + 100)`. Since `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^9, we need to calculate the upper limit. 

1. If `n` is 4, then `int(n ** 0.5 + 100)` equals `int(2 + 100)`, which is 102. The loop can execute again since `i` is 4, which is less than 102.
2. If `n` is greater than 4, for example, if `n` is 16, then `int(n ** 0.5 + 100)` equals `int(4 + 100)`, which is 104. The loop can still execute as `i` (4) is less than 104.
3. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than `int(n ** 0.5 + 100)`.

Since `i` is currently 4, it can potentially increment to 5 at the start of the next iteration. Thus, to adjust the state for the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^9, `i` is 5**
