Output State: **If n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9, the loop checks for factors of n starting from i = 2. If n is even and not equal to 2, the function returns False, indicating n is not a prime number. If n is equal to 2, the loop does not execute, and the function does not return False. If n is odd and greater than 2, the loop continues checking odd integers starting from 3. If n is divisible by any i and n is not equal to i, the function returns False. If n is a prime number, the loop completes without returning False. If n is less than 2, the loop will not execute, and n remains unchanged.**
