According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `int(n ** 0.5 + 100)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. Given the condition for executing the loop, we need to determine the necessary adjustments to `i` and ensure that the upper limit is set appropriately.

Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented to 3. We also need to ensure that the upper limit `int(n ** 0.5 + 100)` allows for at least one more iteration. 

1. `i` currently is 2.
2. After the next iteration, `i` will become 3.

The upper limit `int(n ** 0.5 + 100)` must be greater than 3 for the loop to continue executing. Since `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^9\), `n` can be adjusted to ensure that the square root plus 100 is greater than 3. However, since `n` can be any valid integer in that range, it is sufficient to maintain the condition that allows the loop to check the next odd integer.

Thus, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^9, `i` is 3**
