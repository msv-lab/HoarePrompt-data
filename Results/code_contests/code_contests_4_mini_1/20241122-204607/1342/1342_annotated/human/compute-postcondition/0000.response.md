According to the code, the loop is executed based on the variable `n`. The range for `i` starts at 2 and goes up to `int(n ** 0.5 + 100)`. For the loop to execute, the starting value of `i` (which is 2) must be less than the ending value `int(n ** 0.5 + 100)`. 

Since `n` is guaranteed to be at least 2 (the lower bound given), the value of `int(n ** 0.5 + 100)` will always be greater than 2, allowing the loop to execute.

To summarize:
- `i` starts at 2.
- The loop will execute as long as `int(n ** 0.5 + 100)` is greater than 2.

Thus, for the loop to be executed, the state can remain as is because `n` being at least 2 ensures the loop will execute.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9, `i` is 2**
