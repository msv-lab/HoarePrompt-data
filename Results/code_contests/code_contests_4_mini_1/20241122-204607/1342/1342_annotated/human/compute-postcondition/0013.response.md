The function `func_7` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9. 

- Case 1: If `n` is even and not equal to 2, the function returns `False`, indicating `n` is not a prime number. If `n` is equal to 2, the loop does not execute, and the function does not return `False`. If `n` is odd and greater than 2, the loop checks for factors starting from 3. If `n` is divisible by any integer `i` (where `i` is not equal to `n`), the function returns `False`. 
- Case 2: If `n` is a prime number, the loop completes without returning `False`, and the function returns `True`, indicating that `n` is a prime number.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_7` is to accept an integer `n` and determine if it is a prime number, returning `True` if it is prime and `False` if it is not. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n and returns `False` if n is not a prime number; otherwise, it returns `True` if n is a prime number.**
