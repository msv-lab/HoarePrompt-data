According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and the upper limit defined by `int(n ** 0.5 + 100)`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, which will make it 4. 

The upper limit for `i` is `int(n ** 0.5 + 100)`. Since `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, the value of `int(n ** 0.5 + 100)` will always be greater than or equal to 12 (for n=2, the upper limit is approximately 101). 

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `i` is less than this upper limit. Since `i` is currently 3, and we want to execute the loop again, we can adjust the state accordingly.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^9, `i` is 4**
