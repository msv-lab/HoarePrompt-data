Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^9 and `i` is 4. If `n` is divisible by 4 and `n` is not equal to 4, the function returns False; otherwise, the function does not return any value. This means that for the case where `n` equals 4, the function does not return False, and for any odd integer or integer not divisible by 4, the function also does not return a value.***
