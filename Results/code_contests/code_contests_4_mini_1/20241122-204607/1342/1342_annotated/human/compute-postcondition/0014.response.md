Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` and returns `False` if `n` is an even number greater than 2 or if `n` has any divisors other than 1 and itself, indicating that `n` is not a prime number. If `n` is equal to 2 or if `n` is a prime number, the function returns `True`. However, the function does not handle cases where `n` is less than 2 explicitly, and it will return `True` in those cases as well, which is not a correct behavior for prime checking. Therefore, the function does not accurately determine if `n` is a prime number for all possible integer values. **
