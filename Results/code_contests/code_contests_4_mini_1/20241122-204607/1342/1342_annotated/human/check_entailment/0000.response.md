To determine whether the provided Python program is correct according to the problem description, let's analyze the code and its logic.

### Analyzing the Code:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The code includes several functions for reading input, but it does not actually contain a main function or logic that processes the input `n` according to the problem requirements. The functions seem to be incomplete or unrelated to solving the problem.

2. **Prime Check**:
   - The function `func_7(n)` checks if `n` is a prime number. However, the problem does not require us to check if `n` is prime. It specifically asks for the maximum divisor of `n` (not equal to `n`), which is a different requirement.

3. **Tax Calculation Logic**:
   - There is no implementation for calculating the tax based on the maximum divisor of `n`. The problem states that Mr. Funt wants to minimize his tax, but the code provided does not contain any logic for splitting `n` or calculating the minimum tax based on the provided conditions.

4. **Output**:
   - There is no output function that prints the result based on the computed tax. The function `func_5(x)` writes a string representation of `x` to stdout, but it is not connected to any computation based on the input `n`.

### Missing Logic and Edge Cases:
The entire calculation logic for determining the minimum tax based on the maximum divisor of `n` is missing. The code does not handle the problem as described, leading to the following issues:
- The program does not correctly compute the tax based on the maximum divisor.
- It does not account for cases where `n` could be split into parts, as required by the problem statement.
- There is no handling for edge cases or the input constraints.

### Conclusion:
Since the code does not implement any logic that satisfies the problem description and does not produce the expected results for any input, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
