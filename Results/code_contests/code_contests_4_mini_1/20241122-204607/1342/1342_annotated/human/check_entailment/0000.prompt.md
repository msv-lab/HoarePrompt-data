You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
We have added some annotations within the code to help you understand the code and its logic. The annotations are in the form of comments and are inserted automatically so double check whether the annotations are correct or not and describe the code correctly.
If the annotations are correct use them along with the code to determine the correctness of the code. If the annotations are incorrect then you can ignore them and just use the code to determine the correctness.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Mr. Funt now lives in a country with a very specific tax laws. The total income of mr. Funt during this year is equal to n (n ≥ 2) burles and the amount of tax he has to pay is calculated as the maximum divisor of n (not equal to n, of course). For example, if n = 6 then Funt has to pay 3 burles, while for n = 25 he needs to pay 5 and if n = 2 he pays only 1 burle.

As mr. Funt is a very opportunistic person he wants to cheat a bit. In particular, he wants to split the initial n in several parts n1 + n2 + ... + nk = n (here k is arbitrary, even k = 1 is allowed) and pay the taxes for each part separately. He can't make some part equal to 1 because it will reveal him. So, the condition ni ≥ 2 should hold for all i from 1 to k.

Ostap Bender wonders, how many money Funt has to pay (i.e. minimal) if he chooses and optimal way to split n in parts.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the total year income of mr. Funt.

Output

Print one integer — minimum possible number of burles that mr. Funt has to pay as a tax.

Annotated Program:
```
#Function 1:
def func_1():
    return str(stdin.readline())
    #The program returns the string input received from standard input

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    return int(raw_input())
    #The program returns an integer value entered by the user through raw_input()

#Function 3:
def func_3():
    return map(int, raw_input().split())
    #The program returns a map object containing the integers from the input provided by raw_input()

#Function 4:
def func_4():
    return [int(i) for i in raw_input().split()]
    #The program returns a list of integers from the input provided via raw_input()

#Function 5:
def func_5(x):
    return stdout.write(str(x))
    #The program returns the string representation of the integer n written to standard output

#Function 6:
def func_6(list):
    return eval('*'.join(str(item) for item in list))
    #The program returns the product of all items in the list

#Function 7:
def func_7(n):
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5 + 100)):
        if n % i == 0 and n != i:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: If n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9, the loop checks for factors of n starting from i = 2. If n is even and not equal to 2, the function returns False, indicating n is not a prime number. If n is equal to 2, the loop does not execute, and the function does not return False. If n is odd and greater than 2, the loop continues checking odd integers starting from 3. If n is divisible by any i and n is not equal to i, the function returns False. If n is a prime number, the loop completes without returning False. If n is less than 2, the loop will not execute, and n remains unchanged.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that n is a prime number.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
