The function accepts no parameters and returns a map object that contains integers parsed from a space-separated string input taken from the user via `raw_input()`. However, since `raw_input()` may return an empty string, the resulting map object could potentially be empty if no input is provided. Additionally, if the input contains non-integer values, a ValueError will be raised when attempting to convert those values to integers.
