To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the code and see if it adheres to the requirements outlined.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. The tax Mr. Funt has to pay is the maximum divisor of `n` that is not equal to `n` itself.
2. He can split `n` into parts where each part must be at least 2.
3. The goal is to minimize the total tax paid after splitting the income optimally.

### Code Analysis:
The program contains a function `func_7(n)` which is intended to check if `n` is prime. The output logic is as follows:
- If `n` is prime, it prints `1`.
- If `n` is even, it prints `2`.
- If `n` is odd and `n-2` is prime, it prints `2`.
- Otherwise, it prints `3`.

### Test Cases:
We can analyze the expected output based on the problem description and compare it with the actual output from the program.

1. **n = 4 (even)**:
   - Maximum divisor not equal to `n` is `2`.
   - Expected output: `2` (correct)
   - Code output: `2` (correct)

2. **n = 27 (odd)**:
   - Maximum divisor not equal to `27` is `9`.
   - Expected output: `9` (incorrect, the code outputs `3`)

3. **n = 10 (even)**:
   - Maximum divisor not equal to `10` is `5`.
   - Expected output: `5` (incorrect, the code outputs `2`)

4. **n = 9 (odd)**:
   - Maximum divisor not equal to `9` is `3`.
   - Expected output: `3` (incorrect, the code outputs `3`, but the logic is flawed)

5. **n = 15 (odd)**:
   - Maximum divisor not equal to `15` is `5`.
   - Expected output: `5` (incorrect, the code outputs `3`)

### Conclusion:
The code fails to correctly calculate the minimum possible tax Mr. Funt has to pay in several cases, particularly for odd composite numbers and even numbers beyond 4. The program does not handle all cases as specified in the problem description correctly.

Correctness: **False**
