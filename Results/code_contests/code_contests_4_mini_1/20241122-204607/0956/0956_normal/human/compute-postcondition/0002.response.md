The variable `n` is assigned the value obtained from `int(input())`, which accepts input and converts it to an integer. The initial state of `n` satisfies the condition of being between 3 and 100,000 and divisible by 3, but the exact integer value of `n` is now to be determined by user input. The values of `t` and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000; `n` is an input integer that satisfies 3 ≤ `n` < 10^5 and `n` is divisible by 3; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'T' and 'M'.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000; `n` is an input integer that satisfies 3 ≤ `n` < 10^5 and `n` is divisible by 3; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'T' and 'M'**
