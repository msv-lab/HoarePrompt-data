According to the code, the loop executes based on the variable `t`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `_` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` remains unchanged, and we need to consider how many times the loop has executed. Since the loop variable `_` is not directly referenced in the state provided, we need to infer that if the loop has executed `t` times, then for it to execute one more time, `t` must be adjusted to be greater than the number of executions so far.

Since the state does not provide the current iteration count, we can assume the loop has executed `t` times, which means we need to adjust `t` to be greater than the previous count, which was `t`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is greater than the previous `t`, `m` remains unchanged, `arr` remains unchanged, `poss` is either True or False**
