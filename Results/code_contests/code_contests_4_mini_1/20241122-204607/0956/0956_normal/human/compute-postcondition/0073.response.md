According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `t`. The loop will iterate `len(t) // 2` times, and at the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `arr` has been initialized with zeros. Since `t` has one less element, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must have at least 2 elements (which allows for a `len(t) // 2` value of at least 1). Therefore, `len(t)` must be adjusted to indicate that `t` has at least 2 elements. 

At the start of the next iteration, `i` will increment by 1, so it will be 1 after the current iteration. 

Thus, the states need to be adjusted to reflect that `len(t)` is at least 2, `i` is now 1, and `arr[1]` will be assigned the next value from `m.popleft()`.

State: **`t` has at least 2 elements, `m` is unchanged, `poss` is updated based on the comparison, `arr` is a list of length `len(t) // 2`, `i` is 1, and `arr[1]` is assigned the value from `m.popleft()`**
