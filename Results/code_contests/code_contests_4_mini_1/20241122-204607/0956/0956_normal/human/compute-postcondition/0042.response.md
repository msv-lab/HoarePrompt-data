According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `arr` list. If `arr` has more elements, the loop will execute once more. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` contains at least 3 values, `i` is the third element in `arr`, and `len(t)` is at least 3. 

To execute the loop one more time, the variable `i` needs to be updated to the next element in `arr`, which would be the fourth element. Thus, `arr` must contain at least 4 values, and `i` should be the fourth element in `arr`.

State: **`len(t)` is at least 3, `arr` contains at least 4 values, `i` is the fourth element in `arr`**
