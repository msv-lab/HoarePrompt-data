Output State: **`t` is a deque containing the indices of all 'T' characters in the string `s`, `m` is a deque containing the indices of all 'M' characters. The variable `n` satisfies 3 â‰¤ `n` < 10^5 and is divisible by 3, and `s` is a string of length `n`. If `s` is an empty string or does not meet the length requirements, the loop does not execute, and `t` and `m` remain empty.**
