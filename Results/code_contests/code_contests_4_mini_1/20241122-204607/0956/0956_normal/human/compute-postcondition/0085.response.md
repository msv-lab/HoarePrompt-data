According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the contents of `arr`. If `arr` has at least one more element, the loop will execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` contains the first `len(t) // 2 + 1` values popped from `m`, and `i` is currently pointing to one of those elements. 

Since `arr` was filled with the values from `m`, for the loop to execute one more time, `m` should still have at least one more element to pop into `arr`. 

Thus, we need to ensure that `m` has at least `len(t) // 2 + 2` elements so that there is one more value to pop into `arr`. The value of `i` should also be updated to reflect the next iteration, which would be the next value in `arr`.

State: **`len(t)` is at least 2, `m` has at least `len(t) // 2 + 2` elements, `arr` contains the first `len(t) // 2 + 2` values popped from `m`, `i` is `len(t) // 2 + 1`, and `poss` is updated based on the comparison `i < t.popleft()`**
