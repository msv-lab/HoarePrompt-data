Postcondition: ***`t` is a deque containing the indices of all 'T' characters in the string `s`, `m` is a deque containing the indices of all 'M' characters, and `poss` is either True or False based on the condition len(m) * 2 == len(t). If `poss` is True and `len(t) >= 2`, then `arr` contains the first `len(t) // 2` indices from `m`, and `poss` is updated based on whether each element of `arr` is less than the corresponding element popped from `t`. If `len(t) < 2`, `arr` is empty, `poss` remains True, and no elements are removed from `t` or `m`. After execution, if `poss` remains True, it indicates the conditions for the indices have been satisfied; otherwise, it may indicate some conditions were violated during the comparisons.***
