Output State: **If the length of `t` is at least 2, then after the loop executes `len(t) // 2` times, `t` has at least `len(t) - len(t) // 2` elements remaining, `arr` contains the first `len(t) // 2` elements from `m`, and `poss` reflects whether all comparisons were true. If the length of `t` is less than 2, the loop does not execute, `t` remains unchanged, `m` remains unchanged, `arr` is a list of zeros with length `0`, and `poss` remains True.**
