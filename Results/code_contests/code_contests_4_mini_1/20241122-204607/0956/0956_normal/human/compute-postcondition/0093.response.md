The variable `s` is assigned the value obtained from `input()`, which can be any string input by the user. The values of `t`, `m`, `arr`, and `poss` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is greater than the previous `t`, `m` remains unchanged, `arr` remains unchanged, `poss` is either True or False, and `s` is an input string.

Output State: **`t` is greater than the previous `t`, `m` remains unchanged, `arr` remains unchanged, `poss` is either True or False, and `s` is an input string**.
