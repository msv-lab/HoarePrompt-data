The line `t = deque()` initializes `t` as a new deque object, which is a type of collection in Python. The previous state of `t` being greater than the previous `t` indicates that it had a value before this line was executed, but now it has been reset to an empty deque. The variables `m`, `arr`, `poss`, and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is an empty deque, `m` remains unchanged, `arr` remains unchanged, `poss` is either True or False, and `s` is an input string.

Output State: **`t` is an empty deque, `m` remains unchanged, `arr` remains unchanged, `poss` is either True or False, and `s` is an input string**
