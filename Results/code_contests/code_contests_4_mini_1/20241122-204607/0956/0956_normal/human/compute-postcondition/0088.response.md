Output State: **If `len(t)` is at least 2, then `len(t)` is reduced by `len(t) // 2`, `m` is reduced by `len(t) // 2`, `arr` contains the first `len(t) // 2` values popped from `m`, `i` is `len(t) // 2 - 1`, and `poss` reflects whether all values in `arr` were less than the values popped from `t`. If `len(t)` is less than 2, then `t` and `m` remain unchanged, `arr` is an empty list, `poss` remains True, and the loop does not execute.**
