Postcondition: ***`t` is a deque, `n` is an integer satisfying 3 â‰¤ `n` < 10^5 and divisible by 3, `s` is a string of length `n`, `m` is a deque that contains the value 0 if `si` (the first character of `s`) is not equal to 'T'; otherwise, `m` remains empty. If `si` is equal to 'T', then `t` contains the value 0; otherwise, `t` remains unchanged.***
