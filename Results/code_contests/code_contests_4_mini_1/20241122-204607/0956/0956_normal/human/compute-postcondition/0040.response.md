According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the contents of `arr`. If `arr` has at least 3 elements, the loop will execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` contains at least 2 values, and `i` is the second element in `arr`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `arr` must have at least 3 values, and `i` needs to be updated to the third element in `arr`.

State: **`len(t)` is at least 3; `arr` contains at least 3 values; `i` is the third element in `arr`; `poss` is updated based on the condition `i < t.popleft()`**
