The statement initializes an array `arr` with a size that is half the length of the deque `t`. Since it's given that the length of `m` multiplied by 2 is equal to the length of `t`, it follows that the length of `t` is even. Therefore, `len(t) // 2` will yield a non-negative integer. 

The initial values of `t`, `m`, and `poss` do not change due to this operation. The array `arr` is now created with all elements initialized to `0` and its length is `len(t) // 2`.

Output State: **`t` is a deque containing the indices of all 'T' characters in the string `s`, `m` is a deque containing the indices of all 'M' characters, `poss` is True, and `arr` is an array of length `len(t) // 2` initialized to zeros.**
