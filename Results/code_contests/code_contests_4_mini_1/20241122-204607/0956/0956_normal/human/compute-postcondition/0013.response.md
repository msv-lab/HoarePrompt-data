The code appends the value of `i` to the deque `t`. The previous value of `i` is known but not specified in the given state. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `i` has been added to `t`.

Output State: **`t` is a deque with `i` appended, `n` is an integer satisfying 3 â‰¤ `n` < 10^5 and divisible by 3, `s` is a string of length `n`, `m` is a deque containing 0 if `si` is not equal to 'T'; otherwise, `m` remains empty, `i` is the previous index, `si` is the next character in `s` at index `i + 1**
