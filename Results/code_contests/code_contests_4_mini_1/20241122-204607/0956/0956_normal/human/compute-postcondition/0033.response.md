The value of `arr[i]` is assigned the value from the left end of the deque `m`, which is modified by the `popleft()` operation. The state of `m` is affected as one element is removed from it. The array `arr` at index `i` is updated with the new value. The previous values of `t`, `poss`, and `arr[1]` remain unchanged based on the provided initial state.

Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an array of length at least 3 after popping one element, `m` is updated by removing the leftmost element, `poss` is updated based on the comparison, `arr[1]` remains updated from `m`, and `arr[i]` is now the value that was at the left end of `m`.

Output State: **`t` is an array of length at least 3 after popping one element, `m` is updated by removing the leftmost element, `poss` is updated based on the comparison, `arr[1]` remains updated from `m`, and `arr[i]` is updated from `m.popleft()`**.
