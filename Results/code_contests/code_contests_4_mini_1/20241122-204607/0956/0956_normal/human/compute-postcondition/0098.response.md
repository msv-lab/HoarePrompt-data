The code appends the value of `i`, which is currently 0, to the deque `t`. Since `t` is initially empty, after this operation, `t` will contain the value 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `t` contains 0, `m` is an empty deque, `arr` remains unchanged, `poss` is either True or False, `s` is a non-empty string, `i` is 0, `si` is the first character of `s`, and `si` is equal to 'T'.

Output State: **`t` contains 0, `m` is an empty deque, `arr` remains unchanged, `poss` is either True or False, `s` is a non-empty string, `i` is 0, `si` is the first character of `s`, and `si` is equal to 'T'**
