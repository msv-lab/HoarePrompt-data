The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The other variables (`t`, `m`, and `poss`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is `t` is a deque containing indices of at least 1 'T' character, `m` is a deque containing the indices of all 'M' characters, `poss` is either True or False based on the condition len(m) * 2 == len(t), and `n` is an input integer.

Output State: **`t` is a deque containing indices of at least 1 'T' character, `m` is a deque containing the indices of all 'M' characters, `poss` is either True or False based on the condition len(m) * 2 == len(t), and `n` is an input integer**
