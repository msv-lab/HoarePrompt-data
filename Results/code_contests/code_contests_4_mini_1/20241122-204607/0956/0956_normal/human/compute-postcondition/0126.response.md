To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the conditions specified for the variable `t`. 

1. The loop will execute if the length of `t` is at least 2. 
2. If the length of `t` is 2 or more, the loop will iterate `len(t) // 2` times.
3. The loop body will operate based on comparisons of elements popped from `t` and will update `arr` using elements from `m`.
4. After the loop, the state of `t`, `m`, `arr`, and `poss` will change based on the outcomes of the comparisons and the operations performed in the loop.

Given these insights, the necessary states to ensure the loop executes are:

- `t` must have at least 2 elements.
- `arr` must be initialized to hold `len(t) // 2` elements, which means it should not be a list of zeros but should be able to store the results of the operations in the loop.
- `i` should initially be set to the first element of `arr` for the loop to start executing.

Thus, the modified state should reflect these requirements:

State: **`t` has at least 2 elements, `arr` has length `len(t) // 2`, `i` is the first element of `arr`, `poss` is True**
