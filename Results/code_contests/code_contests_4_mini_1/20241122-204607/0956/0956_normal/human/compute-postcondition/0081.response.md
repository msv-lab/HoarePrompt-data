To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we must consider the conditions outlined in the provided state before the loop starts.

1. The loop statement indicates that the loop iterates over `arr`. For the loop to execute, `arr` must contain elements. According to the given state, `arr` is filled with the first `len(t) // 2` values popped from `m`. Therefore, `len(t)` must be at least 2 for `arr` to have elements since the length of `arr` is calculated as `len(t) // 2`.

2. If `len(t)` is at least 2, then `len(t) // 2` will yield a value of at least 1, which means `arr` will have at least one element.

3. The value of `i` is calculated as `len(t) // 2 - 1`, which means `i` will be `0` when `len(t)` is exactly 2. 

4. The values of `poss` and the lists `t` and `m` will also need to be adjusted to reflect that `t` has elements that can be popped and that `m` is sufficiently populated to provide the first `len(t) // 2` values.

In summary, to allow the loop to execute:
- `len(t)` must be at least 2,
- `arr` must contain the first `len(t) // 2` values from `m`, which means `m` must have at least `len(t) // 2` elements,
- After the loop executes, `i` will be `len(t) // 2 - 1`.

Thus, the adjusted state is as follows:

State: **`len(t)` is at least 2, `m` has at least `len(t) // 2` elements, `arr` contains the first `len(t) // 2` values popped from `m`, `i` is `len(t) // 2 - 1`**
