Output State: **`t` is a deque containing the indices of characters in `s` that are 'T', `m` is a deque containing the indices of characters in `s` that are not 'T'; `n` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty string, `poss` is either True or False. If `s` is empty, the loop does not execute and both `t` and `m` remain empty; however, this case does not occur as `s` is stated to be non-empty.**
