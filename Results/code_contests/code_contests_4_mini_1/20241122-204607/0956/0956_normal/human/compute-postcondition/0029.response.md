The variable `poss` is updated based on the comparison of the value popped from `t` with the first element of `m`. The operation `t.popleft()` removes and returns the first element of the array `t`. The comparison checks if this value is less than `m[0]`, and the result of this comparison updates `poss` using the logical AND operator (`&=`). The states of the other variables, including `arr`, `i`, and the remaining elements in `t` and `m`, are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an array of length at least 2 after popping the first element, `m` is unchanged, `poss` is updated based on the comparison, `arr` is an array of length at least 1 initialized to zeros, `i` is 1, and `arr[1]` is assigned a value from `m.popleft()`**.
