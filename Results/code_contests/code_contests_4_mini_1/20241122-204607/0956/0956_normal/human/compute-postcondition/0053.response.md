The code appends the value of `i` to the deque `t`. The initial value of `i` is 0, so `t` will now contain the value 0. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is a deque containing 0, `m` is an empty deque, `poss` is either True or False, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty string, and `i` is 0.

Output State: **`t` is a deque containing 0, `m` is an empty deque, `poss` is either True or False, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty string, `i` is 0**
