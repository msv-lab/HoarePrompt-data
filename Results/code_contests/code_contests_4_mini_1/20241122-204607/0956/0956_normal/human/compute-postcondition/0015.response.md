Postcondition: ***`t` is a deque containing the index `i` if `si` (the character at index `i + 1` of string `s`) is equal to 'T'. If `si` is not equal to 'T', then `i` is appended to deque `m`. The integer `n` satisfies 3 â‰¤ `n` < 10^5 and is divisible by 3, and `s` is a string of length `n`. The deque `m` will contain 0 if `si` is not equal to 'T'; otherwise, `m` remains empty. The variable `i` represents the previous index.***
