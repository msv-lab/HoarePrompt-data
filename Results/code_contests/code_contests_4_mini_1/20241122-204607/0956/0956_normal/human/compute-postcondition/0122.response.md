The code `poss &= t.popleft() < m[0]` performs several operations. First, `t.popleft()` removes and returns the first element from the deque `t`. The comparison checks if this value is less than the first element of `m`. The result of this comparison (a boolean value) is then combined with the current value of `poss` using the bitwise AND operator (`&=`).

As per the initial state:
- `t` is a deque with at least 2 elements remaining, so `t.popleft()` will successfully remove and return an element.
- `m` is unchanged, and its first element is available for comparison.
- `poss` is updated based on the result of the comparison.
- The value of `s` remains a non-empty string, and `i` is 1.
- `arr[0]` is updated with the first element of `m`.

The output state will reflect the updates to `poss` and the state of `t` after the `popleft()` operation, along with the unchanged values of `s`, `i`, and `arr[0]`.

Output State: **`t` has one less element, `poss` is updated based on the comparison, `m` is unchanged, `s` is a non-empty string, `i` is 1, and `arr[0]` is updated with the first element of `m`.**
