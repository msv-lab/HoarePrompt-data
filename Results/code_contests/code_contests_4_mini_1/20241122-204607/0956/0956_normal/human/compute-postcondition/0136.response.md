According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `t`. The loop will execute as long as there are elements in `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is a deque containing indices of characters in `s`, and since the loop has executed, it is likely that an element has been removed from `t` during the loop body.

To allow the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still contain elements. Therefore, the condition for the loop to execute again requires that `t` has more elements after the last iteration. 

Assuming that one element was removed from `t` during the last iteration, we need to adjust the state of `t` to ensure it has at least one element remaining. Hence, we can specify that `t` should have at least one element left.

No other states need to be adjusted since `m`, `arr`, `poss`, and the return value do not affect the loop's control condition.

State: **`t` is a deque with at least 1 element, `m` is a deque containing indices of characters in `s`, `arr` is a list initialized with zeros of length `len(t) // 2`, `poss` is True and remains True**
