Output State: **`t` is a deque containing the indices of all characters in `s` that are 'T', `m` is a deque containing the indices of all characters in `s` that are not 'T', `arr` remains unchanged, `poss` is either True or False, `s` is a non-empty string. If `s` is an empty string, the loop does not execute and both `t` and `m` remain empty.**
