The value of `i` is appended to the deque `m`. The initial state indicates that `i` is 0, so after execution, `m` will contain the value 0. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is a deque, `n` is an input integer satisfying 3 ≤ `n` < 10^5 and divisible by 3, `s` is an input string of length `n`, `m` contains the value 0, `i` is 0, `si` is the first character of `s`, and `si` is not equal to 'T'.

Output State: **`t` is a deque, `n` is an input integer satisfying 3 ≤ `n` < 10^5 and divisible by 3, `s` is an input string of length `n`, `m` contains the value 0, `i` is 0, `si` is the first character of `s`, and `si` is not equal to 'T'**.
