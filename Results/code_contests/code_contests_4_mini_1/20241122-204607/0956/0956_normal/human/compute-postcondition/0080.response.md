Output State: **If `len(t)` is at least 2, the loop executes `len(t) // 2` times. After the loop, `t` has `len(t) - len(t) // 2` elements, `m` has `len(m) - len(t) // 2` elements, `poss` reflects whether all popped values from `t` were less than the first value from `m` during the iterations, `arr` contains the first `len(t) // 2` values popped from `m`, and `i` is `len(t) // 2 - 1`. If `len(t)` is less than 2, the loop does not execute, `t` and `m` remain unchanged, `poss` is still True, and `arr` is still an empty list of length `len(t) // 2`.**
