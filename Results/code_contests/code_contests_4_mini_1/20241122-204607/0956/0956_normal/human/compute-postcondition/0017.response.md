The code `t.append(i)` adds the current value of `i` to the deque `t`. The initial state indicates that `i` is incremented to its next index, and `t` contains the index `i` if `si` is equal to 'T'. Therefore, the value of `i` is added to the deque `t`. Other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`t` is a deque with the previous indices, and `i` is the next index added to `t`**.
