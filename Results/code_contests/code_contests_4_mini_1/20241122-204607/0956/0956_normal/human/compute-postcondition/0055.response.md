The code `m.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the end of the deque `m`. Since `i` is initially 0, after execution, `m` will contain the value 0. The other variables (`t`, `poss`, `n`, `s`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an empty deque, `m` contains 0, `poss` is either True or False, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty string, and `i` is 0.

Output State: **`t` is an empty deque, `m` contains 0, `poss` is either True or False, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty string, and `i` is 0**
