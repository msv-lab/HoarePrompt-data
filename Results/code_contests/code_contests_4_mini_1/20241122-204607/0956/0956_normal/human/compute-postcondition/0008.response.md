The code appends the value of `i` to the deque `t`. The initial state indicates that `i` is 0, so `t` will now contain the value 0. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is a deque containing 0, `n` is an integer satisfying 3 â‰¤ `n` < 10^5 and divisible by 3, `s` is a string of length `n`, `m` is an empty deque, `i` is 0, `si` is the first character of `s`, and `si` is equal to 'T'**.
