The value of `i` is compared with the result of `t.popleft()`, which removes and returns the first element of `t`. Since `len(t)` is at least 3, we know that `t` has elements to pop. The logical operation `poss &=` updates the value of `poss` based on the result of the comparison `i < t.popleft()`. The values of `arr` and `len(t)` remain unchanged, as well as the previous values of `i` and `poss`.

Output State: **`len(t)` is at least 3, `arr` contains the first `len(t) // 2` values from `m`, `i` is the first element in `arr`, and `poss` is updated based on the condition `i < t.popleft()`**.
