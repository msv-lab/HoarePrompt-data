According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `arr`. If `arr` has at least 2 elements, the loop will execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` has length `len(t) // 2`, and `i` is the first element of `arr`. 

To prepare for the next iteration, we need to adjust `arr` to reflect one iteration of the loop. Since `i` is the first element of `arr`, after this iteration, `i` must now be the second element of `arr` for the loop to continue. 

Simultaneously, we need to ensure that `arr` still has elements left for the loop to execute again. Given that `arr` originally had length `len(t) // 2`, and one element (the first one) will be removed in this iteration, `arr` will now have a length of `len(t) // 2 - 1`. For the loop to execute again, `arr` needs to have at least 1 element remaining, which requires that `len(t) // 2 - 1` is at least 1. Hence, `len(t)` must be at least 4.

So, to summarize:

- `arr` needs to have at least 2 elements before the next iteration, which means `len(t)` must be at least 4.
- `i` should be updated to the second element of `arr`.

State: **`t` has at least 4 elements remaining, `arr` has length at least 2, `i` is the second element of `arr`, `poss` is updated to the result of `True AND (i < t.popleft())`**
