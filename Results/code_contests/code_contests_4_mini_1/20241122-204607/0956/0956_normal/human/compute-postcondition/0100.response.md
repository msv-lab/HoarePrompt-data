The code appends the value of `i` to the deque `m`. Since `i` is currently 0, `m` will now contain the value 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is an empty deque, `m` contains 0, `arr` remains unchanged, `poss` is either True or False, `s` is a non-empty string, and `i` is 0.

Output State: **`t` is an empty deque, `m` contains 0, `arr` remains unchanged, `poss` is either True or False, `s` is a non-empty string, `i` is 0**
