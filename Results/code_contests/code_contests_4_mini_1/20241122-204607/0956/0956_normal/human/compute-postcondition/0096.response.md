According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If the string `s` has at least 1 character, the loop will execute. At the beginning of the loop, `i` should start from 0, and `si` should be the first character in the string `s`. 

Therefore, for the loop to be executed, the string `s` must not be empty, and the initial values would be `i` is 0 and `si` is the first character of `s`.

State: **`t` is an empty deque, `m` is an empty deque, `arr` remains unchanged, `poss` is either True or False, `s` is a non-empty string, `i` is 0, `si` is the first character of `s`**
