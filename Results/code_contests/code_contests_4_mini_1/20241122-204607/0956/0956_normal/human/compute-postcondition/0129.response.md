The expression `poss &= i < t.popleft()` updates the value of `poss` based on the result of the comparison `i < t.popleft()`. The `popleft()` method removes and returns the first element from `t`, which reduces its length by 1. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` has at least 4 elements remaining (let's denote the first element of `t` as `t[0]`).
- `arr` has length at least 2, and `i` is the second element of `arr` (denote this as `arr[1]`).
- `poss` is some boolean value that will be updated.

The operation `t.popleft()` retrieves and removes the first element of `t`, which we will denote as `t[0]`. The comparison `i < t[0]` will determine whether `True` or `False` is returned. The value of `poss` will then be updated to the result of `poss AND (i < t[0])`. 

Since we don't have specific values for `poss`, `i`, or `t`, we can only describe the output state in general terms.

Output State: **`t` has at least 3 elements remaining, `i` is the second element of `arr`, and `poss` is updated to `poss AND (i < t[0])`**.
