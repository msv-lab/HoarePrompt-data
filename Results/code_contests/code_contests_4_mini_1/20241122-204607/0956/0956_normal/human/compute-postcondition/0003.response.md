The variable `s` is assigned the value of `input()`, which accepts a string input from the user. The length of `s` will be `n`, which is given to be an integer satisfying the conditions specified in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000; `n` is an input integer that satisfies 3 ≤ `n` < 10^5 and `n` is divisible by 3; `s` is an input string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'T' and 'M'.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000; `n` is an input integer that satisfies 3 ≤ `n` < 10^5 and `n` is divisible by 3; `s` is an input string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'T' and 'M'**
