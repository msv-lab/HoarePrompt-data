Postcondition: ***`t` and `m` are deques containing indices of characters in `s` that are 'T' and not 'T', respectively. If `poss` is True, the length of `t` is even and at least 2, then `arr` contains the first half of the values popped from `m`, `len(t)` and `m` are each reduced by `len(t) // 2`, and `poss` reflects whether all values in `arr` are less than the values popped from `t`. If `len(t)` is less than 2, `t`, `m`, and `arr` remain unchanged, and `poss` remains True. All values in `arr` are from `m` and are less than the corresponding values popped from `t` if `poss` is updated to False during the loop.***
