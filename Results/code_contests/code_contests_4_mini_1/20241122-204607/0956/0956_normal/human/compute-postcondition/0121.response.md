According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `t`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than half the length of `t`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `t` has at least 1 element remaining. Therefore, the length of `t` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute again (to ensure that `len(t) // 2` is at least 1). 

Since `t` has at least 1 element remaining, for the loop to execute one more time, the length of `t` must be updated to at least 2. The value of `i` should also be incremented to 1, as it will be updated in the next iteration.

State: **`t` is a deque with at least 2 elements remaining, `m` is unchanged, `poss` is updated based on the comparison of the element popped from `t` and the first element of `m`, `s` is a non-empty string, `i` is 1, and `arr[0]` is updated with the first element of `m`.**
