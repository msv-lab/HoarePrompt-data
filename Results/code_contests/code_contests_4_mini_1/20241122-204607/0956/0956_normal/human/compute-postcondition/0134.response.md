Postcondition: ***`t` and `m` are deques containing indices of characters in `s`. If `poss` is True, `arr` is a list initialized with zeros of length `len(t) // 2`, which contains the first `len(t) // 2` elements from `m`. The variable `poss` reflects whether all comparisons between elements from `t` and `m` were true. If `len(t)` is less than 2, the loop does not execute, leaving `t`, `m`, and `arr` unchanged, and `poss` remains True. This ensures that `len(m)` is equal to `len(t) // 2` for `poss` to be True initially, and all elements of `arr` are taken from `m` while maintaining their order. Any edge cases with the smallest values of `len(t)` are handled by the conditions set in the loop, ensuring that if `poss` was initially True, it only remains so if all comparisons yield true.***
