The expression `poss &= t.popleft() < m[0]` has the following impacts:

1. `t.popleft()` removes and returns the leftmost element from the deque `t`.
2. The returned value from `t.popleft()` is compared to the first element of the deque `m[0]`.
3. The result of the comparison (`True` or `False`) is used to update the value of `poss` using the bitwise AND assignment (`&=`). If `poss` was already `True`, it will remain `True` only if the comparison is `True`; otherwise, it will become `False`.
4. The other variables (`arr`, `i`, and `m`) are not affected by this operation.

The output state should reflect the changes in `poss` based on the comparison, as well as the removal of one index from `t`.

Output State: **`t` has one less index, `m` is unchanged, `poss` is updated based on the comparison, `arr` is an array of length `len(t) // 2` initialized to zeros, `i` is 0**.
