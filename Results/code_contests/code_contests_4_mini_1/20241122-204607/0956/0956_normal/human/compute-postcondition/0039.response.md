The expression `poss &= i < t.popleft()` updates the variable `poss` based on the condition `i < t.popleft()`. The value of `t.popleft()` removes and returns the first element of `t`, and we know that `len(t)` is at least 3, so `t` has at least one element to remove. The variable `i` is the second element in `arr`, and `arr` contains at least 2 values.

Since `poss` is being updated using the bitwise AND operator `&=`, its value will depend on both its previous value and the result of the comparison `i < t.popleft()`. The specific previous value of `poss` is not provided, so we cannot determine its final value after the operation.

Therefore, the output state is: `len(t)` is at least 3; `arr` contains at least 2 values; `i` is the second element in `arr`; `poss` is updated based on whether `i` is less than the element removed from `t`.

Output State: **`len(t)` is at least 3; `arr` contains at least 2 values; `i` is the second element in `arr`; `poss` is updated based on the condition `i < t.popleft()`**
