The variable `m` is assigned a new empty `deque`, which means `m` is now an empty deque. The values of `t`, `arr`, `poss`, and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is an empty deque, `m` is an empty deque, `arr` remains unchanged, `poss` is either True or False, and `s` is an input string.

Output State: **`t` is an empty deque, `m` is an empty deque, `arr` remains unchanged, `poss` is either True or False, and `s` is an input string**
