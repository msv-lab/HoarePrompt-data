To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the provided variables and the loop structure.

1. The loop iterates using `i` from `0` to `len(t) // 2 - 1`. Therefore, the loop will execute if `len(t) // 2` is at least 1. This means that `len(t)` must be at least 2.

2. The state before the loop indicates that `t` is a deque containing the indices of all 'T' characters in the string `s`. For the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `t` has at least 2 indices, which implies there are at least 2 'T' characters in `s`.

3. `m` containing the indices of 'M' characters, `poss` being `True`, and `arr` being an array of appropriate length initialized to zeros do not directly affect whether the loop executes. Their states can remain unchanged for the loop condition to be satisfied.

Based on these observations, the adjustments needed are:
- Ensure that `len(t)` is at least 2, which means `t` should have at least 2 elements.

Thus, the state can be described as:
State: **`t` contains at least 2 indices, `m` is a deque containing indices of 'M' characters, `poss` is True, `arr` is an array of length `len(t) // 2` initialized to zeros, `i` is 0**
