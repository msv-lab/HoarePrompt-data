Postcondition: ***`t` is a deque containing the indices of all characters in `s` that are 'T'; `m` is a deque containing the indices of all characters in `s` that are not 'T'; `arr` remains unchanged; `poss` is True; `s` is a non-empty string. The length of `m` multiplied by 2 equals the length of `t`.***
