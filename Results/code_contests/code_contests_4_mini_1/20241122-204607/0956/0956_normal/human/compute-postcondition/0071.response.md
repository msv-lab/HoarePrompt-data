The expression `poss &= t.popleft() < m[0]` affects the variables as follows:

1. The method `popleft()` is called on the deque `t`, which removes and returns the leftmost element of `t`. This operation modifies `t` by reducing its length by one.
2. The condition `t.popleft() < m[0]` checks whether the returned value from `t.popleft()` is less than the first element of the deque `m`.
3. The result of this comparison, which is a boolean value, is combined with the current value of `poss` using the bitwise AND operator (`&=`). This updates the value of `poss` based on the result of the comparison.

The output state will reflect the updated value of `poss` and the new state of `t`, but not the specific values of the elements since they are not provided. The variable `m` remains unchanged, and the values of `arr` and `i` are also unaffected.

Output State: **`t` has one less element, `m` is unchanged, `poss` is updated based on the comparison, `arr` is a list of length `len(t) // 2` initialized with zeros, `i` is 0**
