The code `arr[i] = m.popleft()` updates the `arr` at index `i` with the first element of the deque `m`, and `i` is 1. The variable `m` is unchanged in terms of its reference but has its first element removed by `popleft()`. Since `arr[0]` has already been updated with the first element of `m`, the state of `arr[i]` will now reflect the next element that was originally the second element of `m`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`t` has one less element, `poss` is updated based on the comparison, `m` is unchanged, `s` is a non-empty string, `i` is 1, `arr[0]` is the first element of `m`, and `arr[1]` is updated with the second element of `m`**.
