The operation `poss &= t.popleft() < m[0]` involves several steps. 

1. The `t.popleft()` operation removes and returns the first element of `t`, which is a deque (or similar structure) that has at least 6 elements remaining.
2. The value obtained from `t.popleft()` is then compared to `m[0]`, which is the first element of the list `m`.
3. The result of the comparison (`t.popleft() < m[0]`) is then combined with the current value of `poss` using the `&=` operator, which performs a bitwise AND operation.

Since the specific values of `t`, `m`, and `poss` are not provided, we cannot calculate exact values. However, the output state will include the modification of `poss` based on the comparison.

Output State: **`t` has at least 5 elements remaining; `m` is updated by removing the first element; `arr` is a list of length `len(t) // 2`; `i` is 2; `arr[1]` is assigned the value from `m.popleft()`; `poss` is updated based on the comparison.**
