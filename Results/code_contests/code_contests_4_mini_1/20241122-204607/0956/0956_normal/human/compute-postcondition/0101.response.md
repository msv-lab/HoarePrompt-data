Postcondition: ***`t` is a deque that contains 0 if the first character of `s` is 'T', otherwise `t` remains empty. `m` is a deque that contains 0 if the first character of `s` is not 'T', otherwise `m` remains empty. `arr` remains unchanged, `poss` is either True or False, `s` is a non-empty string, `i` is 0, and `si` is the first character of `s`.***
