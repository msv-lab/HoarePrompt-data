Output State: **For each iteration of the outer loop, `t` is a deque containing the indices of all 'T' characters in the string `s`, `m` is a deque containing the indices of all 'M' characters, `poss` is True if the number of 'M' characters is half the number of 'T' characters and the conditions of the indices are satisfied, otherwise False. If `s` does not contain both 'T' and 'M' or if the length of `s` is not divisible by 3, the loop will execute but the result will be 'NO'. If `t` has an odd number of elements or if `len(m) * 2 != len(t)`, `poss` will be False and the function will return 'NO'.**
