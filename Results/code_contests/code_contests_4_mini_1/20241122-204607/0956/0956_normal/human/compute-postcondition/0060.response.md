Postcondition: ***`t` is a deque that contains 0 if the first character of `s` is 'T', otherwise it is empty. If the second character `si` is 'T', then `t` contains either [0, 1] if the first character of `s` is 'T' or [1] if the first character of `s` is not 'T'; otherwise, `m` contains the previous contents plus the value 1. The variable `poss` remains either True or False; `n` is an input integer; `s` is a non-empty string; `i` is 1; and `si` is the second character of `s`.***
