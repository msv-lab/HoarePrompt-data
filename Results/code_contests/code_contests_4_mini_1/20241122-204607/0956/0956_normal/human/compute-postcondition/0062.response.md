The code `t.append(i)` appends the value of `i`, which is 2, to the deque `t`. The state of `t` will change based on its previous content. 

1. If the first character of `s` is 'T', `t` initially contains either [0] or [0, 1], depending on the second character `si`.
2. If the first character of `s` is not 'T', `t` initially contains either [1] or is empty.
3. After executing `t.append(i)`, the value of `i` (which is 2) will be added to `t`.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated contents of `t`, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is updated to include 2, `m` retains previous contents, `poss` remains either True or False, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty string with at least 3 characters, `i` is 2, `si` is the third character of `s`.**
