The code assigns the value from `m.popleft()` to `arr[i]`, where `i` is 2. This means that the element at index 2 of the list `arr` will now contain the first element removed from the deque `m`. Since `m` is updated by removing the first element prior to this assignment, its state will reflect that change. The list `arr` is of length `len(t) // 2`, and since `t` has at least 5 elements, `arr` has at least 2 elements. The state of other variables is not affected.

Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` has at least 2 elements, `m` is updated by removing its first element, and `arr[2]` is assigned the value from `m.popleft()`. 

Output State: **`arr` has at least 2 elements, `m` is updated by removing its first element, and `arr[2]` is assigned the value from `m.popleft()`**
