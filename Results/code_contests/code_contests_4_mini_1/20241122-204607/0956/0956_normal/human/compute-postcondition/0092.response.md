The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `t`, `m`, `arr`, and `poss` are not affected by this operation, so they remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is greater than the previous `t`, `m` remains unchanged, `arr` remains unchanged, `poss` is either True or False, and `n` is an input integer.

Output State: **`t` is greater than the previous `t`, `m` remains unchanged, `arr` remains unchanged, `poss` is either True or False, and `n` is an input integer**
