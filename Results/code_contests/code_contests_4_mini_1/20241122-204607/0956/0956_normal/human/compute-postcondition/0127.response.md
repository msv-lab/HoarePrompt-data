The code updates the variable `poss` by performing a bitwise AND operation with the boolean expression `i < t.popleft()`. Here, `t.popleft()` removes and returns the first element from the deque `t`, which reduces its length by 1. The variable `i` is the first element of `arr`, and since `arr` has a length of `len(t) // 2`, `i` is known but its exact value is not specified in the initial state. The value of `poss` is initially `True`, so the result of the expression will depend on the comparison `i < t.popleft()`.

Since `t` has at least 2 elements, `t.popleft()` will return one of those elements, but we cannot determine its value or the value of `i`. Therefore, we can only express the output state in terms of the known variables.

Output State: **`t` has at least 1 element remaining, `arr` has length `len(t) // 2`, `i` is the first element of `arr`, `poss` is updated to the result of `True AND (i < t.popleft())`**
