According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `arr`. If `arr` has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` contains the first `len(t) // 2 + 2` values popped from `m`, and `i` is currently `len(t) // 2 + 1`. 

To execute one more time, we need to ensure that `arr` still has at least 2 elements. Since `arr` started with `len(t) // 2 + 2` elements, and `i` is set to the first element of `arr`, for the loop to execute again, `arr` must be modified to have at least 2 elements remaining.

Since `i` is currently `len(t) // 2 + 1`, it should be adjusted to the next element in `arr`, which would be `len(t) // 2 + 2`. The state of `arr` should thus reflect that it has at least 2 elements remaining after one iteration.

To summarize:
- `len(t)` is at least 1 (this remains the same).
- `m` has at least `len(t) // 2 + 2` elements (this remains the same).
- `arr` must now have at least 2 elements remaining, which means it should be adjusted to reflect that it has at least `len(t) // 2 + 1` elements.
- `i` should now be set to `len(t) // 2 + 2`.

State: **`len(t)` is at least 1, `m` has at least `len(t) // 2 + 2` elements, `arr` has at least `len(t) // 2 + 1` elements, `i` is `len(t) // 2 + 2`**
