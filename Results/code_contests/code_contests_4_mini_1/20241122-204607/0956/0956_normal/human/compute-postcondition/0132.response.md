According to the code, the loop will continue executing as long as there are elements remaining in `arr`. Currently, `i` is the third element of `arr`, and `t` has at least 2 elements remaining. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must move to the next element in `arr`.

Since `i` is currently the third element, for the next iteration, `i` needs to be the fourth element of `arr`. Additionally, since `t` has at least 2 elements remaining, we need to ensure that `t` still has at least 2 elements for the loop to continue executing.

Thus, we can adjust `i` to be the fourth element of `arr`, while `t` remains as it is (as it already has at least 2 elements).

State: **`t` has at least 2 elements remaining, `i` is the fourth element of `arr`, `poss` is updated to `poss AND (i < old t[0])**
