The code assigns the value popped from the left side of the deque `m` to the array `arr` at index `i`. Since `i` is 0, `arr[0]` will be updated with the first element of `m`, and `m` will lose this first element.

Given that `t` is a deque with at least 1 element remaining, and `m` is unchanged, the value of `arr[0]` will be the first element of `m` after executing the code. The other variables `t`, `s`, and `i` remain unaffected.

Output State: **`t` is a deque with at least 1 element remaining, `m` is unchanged, `poss` is updated based on the comparison of the element popped from `t` and the first element of `m`, `s` is a non-empty string, `i` is 0, and `arr[0]` is updated with the first element of `m`.**
