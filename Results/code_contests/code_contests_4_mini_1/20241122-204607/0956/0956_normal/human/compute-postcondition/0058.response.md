The operation `t.append(i)` adds the value of `i` to the deque `t`. Since `i` is currently 1, `t` will now contain the value 1. 

The previous state of `t` depends on the first character of `s`. If the first character of `s` is 'T', `t` initially contains 0; otherwise, it is empty. 

- If the first character of `s` is 'T', after the operation, `t` will contain [0, 1].
- If the first character of `s` is not 'T', after the operation, `t` will contain [1].

The states of other variables (`m`, `poss`, `n`, `s`, `si`) remain unchanged in this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` contains either [0, 1] if the first character of `s` is 'T' or [1] if the first character of `s` is not 'T'; `m` is a deque that contains 0 if the first character of `s` is not 'T', otherwise `m` is empty; `poss` is either True or False; `n` is an input integer; `s` is a non-empty string; `i` is 1; `si` is the second character of `s`.**
