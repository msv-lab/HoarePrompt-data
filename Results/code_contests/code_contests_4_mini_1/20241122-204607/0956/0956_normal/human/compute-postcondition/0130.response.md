According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `arr`. If `arr` has at least 3 elements remaining, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the second element of `arr`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be updated to the third element of `arr`, and since `t` has at least 3 elements remaining, it remains unchanged. 

Thus, the states need to be adjusted to reflect that `i` is now the third element of `arr`.

State: **`t` has at least 3 elements remaining, `i` is the third element of `arr`, `poss` is updated to `poss AND (i < t[0])`**
