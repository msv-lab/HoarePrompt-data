The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `s`. 

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
- `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n < 10^5\) and is divisible by 3.
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'T' and 'M'.

Based on the output described, the function processes these parameters and returns a result based on the specified constraints. However, the exact return value or logic based on those parameters is not provided in this case.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `s`, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is an integer between 3 and less than 100,000 that is divisible by 3, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'T' and 'M'.**
