The code initializes `t` as a deque (double-ended queue). The previous state of `t` is an integer that satisfies the condition of 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000, but after the execution, `t` is now a deque. The integer value of `t` is not retained in this context. The other variables `n` and `s` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is a deque, `n` is an input integer satisfying 3 ≤ `n` < 10^5 and divisible by 3; `s` is an input string of length `n` consisting of 'T' and 'M'.

Output State: **`t` is a deque, `n` is an input integer satisfying 3 ≤ `n` < 10^5 and divisible by 3; `s` is an input string of length `n` consisting of 'T' and 'M'**
