The code assigns a new empty deque to the variable `m`, which means the previous contents of `m` are cleared. Other variables (`t`, `poss`, `n`, and `s`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is an empty deque, `m` is an empty deque, `poss` is either True or False, `n` is an input integer, and `s` is an input string.

Output State: **`t` is an empty deque, `m` is an empty deque, `poss` is either True or False, `n` is an input integer, and `s` is an input string**
