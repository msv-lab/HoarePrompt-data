The code updates the value of `poss` by performing a bitwise AND operation with the result of the comparison `i < t.popleft()`. The `popleft()` method removes and returns the first element from the deque `t`. Since `t` has at least 3 elements remaining, this operation is valid. The initial value of `i` is the third element of `arr`, and the first element of `t` is compared with `i`.

After executing the code, `poss` is updated to `poss AND (i < t[0])`, where `t[0]` is the element that was removed from the front of `t`. The states of `i` and the remaining elements in `t` will also change as an element is removed.

Therefore, the output state is: `t` has at least 2 elements remaining after `popleft()`, `i` is the third element of `arr`, and `poss` is updated to `poss AND (i < old t[0])` where `old t[0]` is the value of the first element before `popleft()`.

Output State: **`t` has at least 2 elements remaining, `i` is the third element of `arr`, and `poss` is updated to `poss AND (i < old t[0])`**
