Postcondition: ***`t` is a deque that contains 0 if the first character of `s` is 'T' and additionally contains `i` if the second character of `s` is also 'T'; otherwise, `t` remains unchanged. `m` is a deque that contains 0 if the first character of `s` is not 'T' and additionally contains `i` if the second character of `s` is not 'T'; otherwise, `m` remains unchanged. `arr` remains unchanged, `poss` is either True or False, `s` is a non-empty string, `i` is 1, and `si` is the second character of `s`.***
