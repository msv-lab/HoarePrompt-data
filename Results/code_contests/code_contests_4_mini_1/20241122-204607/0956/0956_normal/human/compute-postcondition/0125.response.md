Output State: **If the length of `t` is at least 2, the loop will execute `len(t) // 2` times, updating `poss` based on the comparison of the popped elements and updating `arr` with elements from `m`. After execution, `t` will have `len(t) - len(t) // 2` elements remaining, `m` will have `len(m)` elements remaining, `arr` will contain the first `len(t) // 2` elements from `m`, and `poss` will reflect whether all comparisons were true. If `t` has less than 2 elements, the loop will not execute, `t` will remain unchanged, `m` will remain unchanged, `arr` will be a list of zeros with length `len(t) // 2`, and `poss` will still be True.**
