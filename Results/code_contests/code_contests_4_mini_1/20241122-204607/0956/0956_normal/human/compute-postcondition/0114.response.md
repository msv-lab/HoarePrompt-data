The variable `arr` is assigned a list of zeros with a length equal to half of the length of `t`. Given that the length of `m` multiplied by 2 equals the length of `t`, the length of `t` is even. Therefore, `len(t) // 2` gives a non-negative integer representing the half-length of `t`. The other variables (`t`, `m`, `poss`, `s`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a deque containing the indices of all characters in `s` that are 'T'; `m` is a deque containing the indices of all characters in `s` that are not 'T'; `arr` is a list of zeros with length len(t) // 2; `poss` is True; `s` is a non-empty string**.
