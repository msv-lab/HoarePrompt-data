The variable `t` is assigned a new empty deque, replacing its previous state which contained indices of at least 1 'T' character. The states of other variables (`m`, `poss`, `n`, and `s`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is an empty deque, `m` is a deque containing the indices of all 'M' characters, `poss` is either True or False, `n` is an input integer, and `s` is an input string.

Output State: **`t` is an empty deque, `m` is a deque containing the indices of all 'M' characters, `poss` is either True or False, `n` is an input integer, and `s` is an input string**
