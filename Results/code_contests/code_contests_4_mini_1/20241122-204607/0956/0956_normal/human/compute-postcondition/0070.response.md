According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. The loop will execute if `len(t) // 2` is at least 1, which means `len(t)` must be at least 2. The state before the loop indicates that `t` is a deque containing the indices of characters in `s` that are 'T'. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `t` must contain at least 2 indices. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` will be equal to `len(t) // 2 - 1`. To adjust the state accordingly, we can set `i` to 0 for the first iteration, and `len(t)` must be at least 2. 

State: **`t` is a deque with at least 2 indices, `m` is a deque containing indices of characters in `s` that are not 'T', `n` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty string, `poss` is True, `arr` is a list of length `len(t) // 2` initialized with zeros, `i` is 0**
