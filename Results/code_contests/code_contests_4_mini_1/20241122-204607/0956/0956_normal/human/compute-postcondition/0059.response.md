The code `m.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the deque `m`. The initial state indicates that `m` contains 0 if the first character of `s` is not 'T'; otherwise, `m` is empty. The value of `i` is 1. Therefore, regardless of the previous contents of `m`, after execution, `i` (which is 1) will be added to `m`.

The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a deque that contains 0 if the first character of `s` is 'T', otherwise `t` is empty; `m` now contains the previous contents plus the value 1; `poss` is either True or False; `n` is an input integer; `s` is a non-empty string; `i` is 1; `si` is the second character of `s`.

Output State: **`t` is a deque that contains 0 if the first character of `s` is 'T', otherwise `t` is empty; `m` now contains the previous contents plus the value 1; `poss` is either True or False; `n` is an input integer; `s` is a non-empty string; `i` is 1; `si` is the second character of `s`**
