The expression `poss &= i < t.popleft()` modifies the value of `poss` by performing a bitwise AND operation between its current value and the result of the comparison `i < t.popleft()`. The value of `i` is `len(t) // 2`, and `t` is a deque (assuming based on the use of `popleft()`) with at least 2 elements.

1. `t.popleft()` removes and returns the leftmost element from `t`.
2. The comparison `i < t.popleft()` will evaluate to either `True` or `False` based on the value of the element removed and the current value of `i`.
3. `poss` is updated based on the result of this comparison.

Since the exact value of `poss` and the first element of `t` are not given, we can only conclude that `poss` will either remain unchanged (if the condition is `False`), or it will be modified (if the condition is `True`, and `poss` was `True` to begin with).

Thus, the output state reflects the conditions of `i`, the updated state of `poss`, and the outcome of the `popleft()` operation.

Output State: **`len(t)` is at least 2, `m` has at least `len(t) // 2 + 1` elements, `arr` contains the first `len(t) // 2 + 1` values popped from `m`, `i` is `len(t) // 2`, and `poss` is updated based on the comparison `i < t.popleft()`**
