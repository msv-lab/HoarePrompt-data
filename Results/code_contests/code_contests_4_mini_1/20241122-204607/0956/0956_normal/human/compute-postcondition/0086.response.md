The expression `poss &= i < t.popleft()` updates the variable `poss` based on the comparison between `i` and the result of `t.popleft()`. 

1. The value of `i` is `len(t) // 2 + 1`.
2. The method `t.popleft()` removes and returns the first element from the deque `t`.
3. The comparison `i < t.popleft()` evaluates to either `True` or `False`.
4. The result of this comparison is then combined with the current value of `poss` using the bitwise AND operator (`&=`).

Since `len(t)` is at least 2, after `t.popleft()` is called, the length of `t` will decrease by 1.

The output state will reflect the updated value of `poss` after this operation and the new state of `t`:

Output State: **`len(t)` is at least 1, `m` has at least `len(t) // 2 + 2` elements, `arr` contains the first `len(t) // 2 + 2` values popped from `m`, `i` is `len(t) // 2 + 1`, `poss` is updated based on the comparison `i < t.popleft()`.**
