Precondition: **t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) representing the number of test cases, n is an integer (3 ≤ n < 10^5) for each test case representing the length of the string, and the string consists of exactly n characters that are either 'T' or 'M'. The value of n is guaranteed to be divisible by 3, and the total sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 10^5.**
