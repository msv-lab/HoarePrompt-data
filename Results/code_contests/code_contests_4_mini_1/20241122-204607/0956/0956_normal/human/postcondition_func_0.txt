The function accepts an integer `t`, representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts an integer `n` (which must be divisible by 3) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters 'T' and 'M'. The function checks if the number of 'M' characters is exactly half of the number of 'T' characters and that the indices of 'M' characters are such that each 'M' appears before a corresponding 'T'. If these conditions are met, it outputs 'YES'; otherwise, it outputs 'NO'. The function does not handle input validation for `t` or `n`, nor does it check for the validity of characters in `s`, and it assumes valid input as per the problem constraints.
