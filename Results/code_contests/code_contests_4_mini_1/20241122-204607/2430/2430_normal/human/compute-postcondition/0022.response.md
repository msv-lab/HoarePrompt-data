To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the provided state and the conditions under which the `while queue:` loop will continue to execute.

1. The loop will execute as long as `queue` is not empty.
2. The state indicates that `cur` is assigned the value of the first element in `queue`, which means that there is at least one element in `queue` at the end of the previous iteration.
3. For the loop to execute again, `queue` must not be empty after the current iteration. This implies that at least one `sosed` from `nodes[ind]` must have `res[sosed]` equal to 0 so that `[sosed, val]` can be appended to `queue`.

Given that:

- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5,
- `HM` is 51,
- `res` is a list of length `n` filled with 0s,
- `cur` is assigned the value of the first element in `queue`,
- `val` is incremented by 1,
- `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`,
- `nodes[ind]` is a list that may contain elements.

We need to ensure that there is at least one element in `nodes[ind]` such that `res[sosed]` is 0, to allow for the appending of `[sosed, val]` to `queue`.

Since the state describes that `nodes[ind]` may contain elements, but does not specify whether all `res[sosed]` values are 0 or not, we cannot assume the current state is sufficient for the loop to execute again without adjustment.

Thus, we need to adjust the state to indicate that there is at least one `sosed` in `nodes[ind]` such that `res[sosed]` is 0. This adjustment is necessary to guarantee that `queue` can be modified and will not remain empty after the current iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res` is a list of length `n` filled with 0s, `cur` is assigned the value of the first element in `queue`, `val` is incremented by 1, `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`, `nodes[ind]` contains at least one `sosed` such that `res[sosed]` is 0**
