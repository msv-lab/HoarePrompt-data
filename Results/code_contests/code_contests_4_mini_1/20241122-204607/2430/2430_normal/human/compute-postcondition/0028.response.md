Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res` is a list of length `n` filled with 0s except at index `ind`, which holds the value `val`. If `val` is greater than `HM`, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, the execution continues without breaking. Additionally, `cur` holds the first element of `queue`, `val` is assigned from `cur[1]`, `ind` is assigned from `cur[0]`, and `nodes[ind]` contains at least one `sosed` such that `res[sosed]` is 0.***
