Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res` is a list of length `n` filled with 0s except at index `ind`, which holds the value `val + 1`. If `nodes[ind]` is not empty, the loop will execute for each element in `nodes[ind]`. For each iteration where `sosed` is an element of `nodes[ind]`, if `res[sosed]` is 0, then the `queue` will be updated to include the pair `[sosed, val]`; otherwise, `queue` remains unchanged. If `nodes[ind]` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `queue` remains unchanged.**
