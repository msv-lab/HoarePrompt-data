Output State: **`res[ind]` is equal to `val`, which is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `HM`. `nodes[ind]` is a list of neighboring nodes, and `queue` may contain pairs `[sosed, val]` for each `sosed` in `nodes[ind]` where `res[sosed]` is equal to 0. If `nodes[ind]` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `queue` remains unchanged. If all elements in `nodes[ind]` have `res[sosed]` not equal to 0, the loop executes but does not add any new elements to `queue`.**
