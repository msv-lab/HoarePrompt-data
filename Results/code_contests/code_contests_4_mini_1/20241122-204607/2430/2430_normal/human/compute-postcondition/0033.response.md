Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res` is a list of length `n` filled with 0s except at index `ind`, which holds the value `val + 1` (where `val` has been incremented by 1), `ind` is a valid index, `nodes[ind]` is not empty, and `sosed` is the first element of `nodes[ind]`. If the value at index `sosed` in `res` is 0, then `queue` is updated to include the list [sosed, val]. Otherwise, no changes are made to `queue`.***
