Postcondition: ***`res[ind]` is updated to `val`, `nodes[ind]` is a list with at least 2 elements, and `sosed` is the second element in `nodes[ind]`. If `res[sosed]` is equal to 0, then `queue` includes the pair `[sosed, val]`. If `res[sosed]` is not equal to 0, the state of `queue` remains unchanged.***
