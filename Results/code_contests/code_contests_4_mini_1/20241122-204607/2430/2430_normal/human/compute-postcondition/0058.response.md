The code appends a new list containing `sosed` and `val` to the `queue`. The previous state of `res[ind]` is updated to `val`, and `sosed` is defined as the third element in `nodes[ind]`. The `nodes[ind]` being a list with at least 3 elements ensures that the value of `sosed` is valid.

The state of the other variables (`res` and `nodes`) is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `res[ind]` is updated to `val`, `nodes[ind]` is a list with at least 3 elements, `sosed` is the third element in `nodes[ind]`, and `queue` now includes a new element `[sosed, val]`.

Output State: **`res[ind]` is updated to `val`, `nodes[ind]` is a list with at least 3 elements, `sosed` is the third element in `nodes[ind]`, and `queue` now includes a new element `[sosed, val]`.**
