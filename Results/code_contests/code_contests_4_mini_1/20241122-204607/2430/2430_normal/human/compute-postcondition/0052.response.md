The code appends a list containing `sosed` and `val` to `queue`. The values of `sosed` and `val` are known from the initial state, where `val` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `HM`, and `sosed` is the first element in `nodes[ind]`. The state of other variables remains unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `res[ind]` is updated to `val`, `val` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `HM`, `nodes[ind]` is a list with at least 1 element, `sosed` is the first element in `nodes[ind]`, `res[sosed]` is equal to 0, and `queue` now contains an additional element `[sosed, val]`.

Output State: **`res[ind]` is updated to `val`, `val` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `HM`, `nodes[ind]` is a list with at least 1 element, `sosed` is the first element in `nodes[ind]`, `res[sosed]` is equal to 0, and `queue` now contains an additional element `[sosed, val]`**.
