Postcondition: ***`res[ind]` is updated to `val` (where `val` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `HM`), `nodes[ind]` is a list with at least 1 element, and `sosed` is the first element in `nodes[ind]`. If `res[sosed]` is equal to 0, `queue` now contains an additional element `[sosed, val]`. If `res[sosed]` is not equal to 0, the state of `queue` remains unchanged.***
