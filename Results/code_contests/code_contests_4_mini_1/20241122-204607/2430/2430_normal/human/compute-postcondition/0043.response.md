The value of `cur` is assigned from the first element of `queue` after popping it, which modifies `queue` by removing that first element. The initial state does not provide the values for `queue` or `ind`, but since `nodes[ind]` is not empty, it implies that there is at least one element in `queue`. Therefore, after executing this line, the state of `cur` will reflect the value that was at the front of the `queue`, and `queue` will have one less element. The specific value of `cur` and the new state of `queue` cannot be determined without additional information.

Output State: **`cur` is assigned the first element of `queue`, and `queue` is modified by popping its first element.**
