The `queue` list is updated by appending a new list containing `sosed` and `val`. The variable `val` has been incremented by 1, so the current value is `val + 1`. The previous state of `res` remains unchanged except for the element at index `ind`, which holds `val + 1`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res` is a list of length `n` filled with 0s except at index `ind`, which holds the value `val + 1`, `val` is now incremented by 1, `ind` is a valid index, `nodes[ind]` is not empty, `sosed` is the first element of `nodes[ind]`, the value at index `sosed` in `res` is 0, and `queue` is updated to include the list [sosed, val].**
