The code appends a list containing `sosed` and `val` to the `queue`. The values of `sosed` and `val` are derived from the initial state. The initial state indicates that `sosed` is the third element of `nodes[ind]`, and `val` is the value that exists at the index `ind` in the `res` list (which is `0` except at index `ind` where it is `val + 1`). The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, after executing the code, we have the following output state:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res` is a list of length `n` filled with 0s except at index `ind` which holds the value `val + 1`, `ind` is a valid index, `nodes[ind]` has at least 3 elements, `sosed` is the third element of `nodes[ind]`, and `queue` now contains `[sosed, val]`**.
