Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res` is a list of length `n` filled with 0s, `cur` is assigned the value of the first element in `queue`, `val` is incremented by 1, `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`, and `nodes[ind]` is a list that may contain elements. The loop will execute for each `sosed` in `nodes[ind]`. If `res[sosed]` is equal to 0, then `[sosed, val]` is appended to `queue`. If `res[sosed]` is not 0, the loop does not append any elements to `queue`. If the `nodes[ind]` is empty or all `res[sosed]` values are not 0, then the loop will not execute at all and `queue` remains unchanged.**
