The variable `cur` is assigned the value of the first element in `queue`, and then that first element is removed from `queue` using `pop(0)`. The state of other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `cur` now holds the first element of `queue`, and `queue` has been modified accordingly.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res` is a list of length `n` filled with 0s, `cur` is assigned the first element of `queue`, `val` is incremented by 1, `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`, `nodes[ind]` contains at least one `sosed` such that `res[sosed]` is 0, and the first element is removed from `queue`.**
