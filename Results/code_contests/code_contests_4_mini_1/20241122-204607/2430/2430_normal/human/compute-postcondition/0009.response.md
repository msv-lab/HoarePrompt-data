The value of `val` is incremented by 1. If the previous value of `val` was greater than 51, the program would have broken out of a loop. However, since we are not provided with the previous value of `val`, we cannot determine whether the break occurred. Regardless, the only change is that `val` now holds the value of its previous value plus 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `HM` is 51; `res` is a list of length `n` filled with 0s; `cur` is assigned the value of the first element in `queue`, which is removed from `queue`; `val` is now `val + 1`; `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`, and `res[ind]` is assigned the value of `val`.**
