The variable `cur` is assigned the first element of `queue`, and `queue` is modified by popping its first element. The code then assigns the second element of `cur` to `val`. Since the specific values of `cur` and `queue` are not provided, we can only describe the result in general terms. 

Assuming `cur` has at least two elements (as it is accessed with index `1`), `val` will be equal to the second element of `cur`. The state of `queue` will have its first element removed.

Output State: **`cur` is the first element of `queue`, `queue` has its first element popped, and `val` is the second element of `cur`**
