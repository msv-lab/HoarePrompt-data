Postcondition: ***If the maximum value in `res` exceeds `HM`, the function returns 'Impossible!'. Otherwise, for each index `ind` in `res`, if the value `val` at that index is greater than 26, it is updated to `2 * 26 - val`. If `res` is initially empty, it remains an empty list. After execution, `res` will either be unchanged if all values are 0 or less than or equal to 26, or it will reflect the updates made for values greater than 26, while `queue` remains empty throughout the process.***
