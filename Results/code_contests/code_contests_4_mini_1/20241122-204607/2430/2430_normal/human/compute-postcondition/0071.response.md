According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `ind` and the length of `res`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `ind` is less than the length of `res`. At the end of the last iteration, `ind` is 1 and `res` is a list of 0s with at least 1 element, which means the length of `res` is at least 2 for the loop to execute one more time.

To allow the loop to execute again, `ind` must be incremented to 2. Additionally, `val` should be updated to the value at `res[2]`.

State: **`res` is a list of 0s with at least 2 elements, `queue` is empty, `ind` is 2, and `val` is assigned the value at `res[2]**
