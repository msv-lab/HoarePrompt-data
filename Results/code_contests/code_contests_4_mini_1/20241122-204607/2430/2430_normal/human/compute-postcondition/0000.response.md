The variable `HM` is assigned the value of the expression `2 * 26 - 1`. 

Calculating this:
- First, we evaluate `2 * 26`, which equals `52`.
- Then, we subtract `1` from `52`, resulting in `51`.

Since there are no other variables affected and the value of `n` is not involved in this calculation, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and `HM` is 51.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and `HM` is 51**
