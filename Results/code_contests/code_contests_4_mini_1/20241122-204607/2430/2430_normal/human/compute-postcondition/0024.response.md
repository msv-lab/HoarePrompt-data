The variable `val` is assigned the value of `cur[1]`. The initial state indicates that `cur` is assigned the first element of `queue`, and we know `cur` is a tuple or list, where `cur[1]` is a valid index. The value of `val` changes to whatever `cur[1]` is, while other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res` is a list of length `n` filled with 0s, `cur` is assigned the first element of `queue`, `val` is now `cur[1]`, `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`, `nodes[ind]` contains at least one `sosed` such that `res[sosed]` is 0, and the first element is removed from `queue`.
