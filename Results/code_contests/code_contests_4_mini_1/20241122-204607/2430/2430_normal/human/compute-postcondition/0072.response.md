The variable `val` is assigned the value at `res[ind]`, where `ind` is 2. Since `res` is a list of 0s with at least 2 elements, the value at `res[2]` is 0. The other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `res` is a list of 0s, `queue` is empty, `ind` is 2, and `val` is 0.

Output State: **`res` is a list of 0s, `queue` is empty, `ind` is 2, and `val` is 0**
