The code appends a list containing `sosed` and `val` to the `queue`. The values of `sosed` and `val` are derived from the previously defined variables. The state of `res` and `nodes` is not directly affected by this operation, but the `queue` is modified to include the new entry. Therefore, the output state can be articulated as follows:

Output State: **`res[ind]` is updated to `val`, `nodes[ind]` is a list with at least 2 elements, `sosed` is the second element in `nodes[ind]`, and `queue` now includes `[sosed, val]`.**
