Output State: **`if queue is not empty then the loop executes and `res[ind]` is assigned `val`, which is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to `HM`. `queue` may be updated with pairs `[sosed, val]` for each `sosed` in `nodes[ind]` where `res[sosed]` is 0. If `val` exceeds `HM`, the loop breaks. If `queue` is empty initially, the loop does not execute, and `res` remains a list of 0s. If no new elements are added to `queue` in subsequent iterations (because all `res[sosed]` are non-zero), the loop will terminate. If `HM` is exceeded in the first iteration, `res` will only update the first index, and `queue` will not change.**
