Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res` is a list of length `n` filled with 0s, `cur` is assigned the value of the first element in `queue`, `val` is now `val + 1`, `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`, and `nodes[ind]` is a non-empty list. If `res[sosed]` is equal to 0, then `[sosed, val]` is appended to `queue`. If `res[sosed]` is not 0, the state of `queue` remains unchanged.***
