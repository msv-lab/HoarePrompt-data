According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nodes` structure and specifically the value of `ind`. The loop will iterate over the elements in `nodes[ind]`. For the loop to execute, `nodes[ind]` must contain at least one element. Additionally, since `sosed` is being used within the loop, it will represent the first element of `nodes[ind]` during the first iteration.

Before the loop starts, `res[ind]` has already been updated to `val`, and `val` has been increased by 1. The state of `val` should be less than or equal to `HM` to allow the program to continue executing without interruption. 

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, the following states need to be adjusted:

- `nodes[ind]` must have at least one element.
- `sosed` should be the first element in `nodes[ind]`.

State: **`res[ind]` is updated to `val`, `val` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `HM`, `nodes[ind]` is a list with at least 1 element, `sosed` is the first element in `nodes[ind]`**
