The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `HM` is 51; `res` is a list of length n filled with 0s; `cur` is assigned the value of the first element in `queue`, which is removed from `queue`; `val` is assigned the value of `cur[1]`; `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`; `res[ind]` is assigned the value of `val`; `val` is greater than 51, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
