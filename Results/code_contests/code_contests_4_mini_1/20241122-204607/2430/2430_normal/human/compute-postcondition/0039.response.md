Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res` is a list of length `n` filled with 0s except at index `ind` which holds the value `val + 1`, `ind` is a valid index, `nodes[ind]` has at least 3 elements, and `sosed` is the third element of `nodes[ind]`. If `res[sosed]` is 0, then `queue` contains the pair `[sosed, val]`; otherwise, the state of `queue` remains unchanged.***
