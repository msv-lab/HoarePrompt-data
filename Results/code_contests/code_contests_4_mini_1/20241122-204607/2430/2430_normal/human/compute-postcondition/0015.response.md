The code appends a new list containing `sosed` and `val` to the `queue`. The value of `sosed` is derived from the element `nodes[ind]`. The previous state of the variables `n`, `HM`, `res`, `cur`, `val`, `ind`, and `sosed` is not altered by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of these variables, along with the fact that a new element has been added to the `queue`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res` is a list of length `n` filled with 0s, `cur` is assigned the value of the first element in `queue`, `val` is now `val + 1`, `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`, `sosed` is the next element in `nodes[ind]`, and a new element [sosed, val] has been appended to the queue.**
