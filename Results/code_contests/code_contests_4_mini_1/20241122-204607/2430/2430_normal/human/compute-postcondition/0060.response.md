According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `nodes[ind]` list. The loop iterates over each element in `nodes[ind]`. Since it is stated that `nodes[ind]` has at least 3 elements, the loop can execute multiple times. 

At the end of the last iteration, `sosed` is the third element in `nodes[ind]`. For the loop to execute one more time, `sosed` must be updated to the next element in `nodes[ind]`. Thus, the index for `sosed` should be 3, which means it must be the fourth element in `nodes[ind]`.

In summary:
- `nodes[ind]` must still have at least 4 elements for the next loop iteration to occur.
- Therefore, `sosed` must be updated to the fourth element in `nodes[ind]`.

State: **`res[ind]` is updated to `val`, `nodes[ind]` is a list with at least 4 elements, and `sosed` is the fourth element in `nodes[ind]`.**
