Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res` is a list of length `n` filled with 0s, `cur` is assigned the value of the first element in `queue`, `val` is incremented by 1, `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`, and `sosed` is the next element in `nodes[ind]`. If `res[sosed]` was 0, then a new element `[sosed, val]` is appended to the queue, indicating that `sosed` was not previously processed. Otherwise, if `res[sosed]` was not 0, no changes to the queue occur, and it remains unaffected by this execution.***
