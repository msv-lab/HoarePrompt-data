The value of `val` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `val` is unknown, but since it is updated, we know that it has been increased by 1. The states of the other variables, including `res[ind]` and `HM`, are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `res[ind]` is updated to `val`, the value of `val` is increased by 1, and the program continues executing without interruption unless `val` exceeds `HM`.

Output State: **`res[ind]` is updated to `val`, the value of `val` is increased by 1, and the program continues executing without interruption unless `val` exceeds `HM`.**
