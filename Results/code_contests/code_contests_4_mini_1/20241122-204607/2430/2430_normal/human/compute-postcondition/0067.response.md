According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the `res` list. The loop will execute if `len(res)` is greater than 0. Since `res` is currently a list of 0s, we need to ensure that the list contains at least 1 element for the loop to be able to iterate. The `queue` being empty does not impact the loop execution. 

Thus, for the loop to be executed, `res` must have at least 1 element, and `ind` should start at 0, representing the first index of the list.

State: **`res` is a list of 0s with at least 1 element, `queue` is empty, `ind` is 0**
