The value of `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`, which is the first element of `cur`. Since `cur` is already assigned from `queue`, `ind` will now hold that specific value. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res` is a list of length `n` filled with 0s, `cur` is now assigned the first element of `queue`, `val` is now `cur[1]`, `ind` is now `cur[0]`, `nodes[ind]` contains at least one `sosed` such that `res[sosed]` is 0, and the first element is removed from `queue`.
