The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res` is a list of length `n` filled with 0s except for index `ind`, which is assigned the value `val`, `cur` is now assigned the first element of `queue`, `val` is now `cur[1]`, `ind` is now `cur[0]`, `nodes[ind]` contains at least one `sosed` such that `res[sosed]` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
