The variable `val` is assigned the value of `res[ind]`. Given that `ind` is 0, `val` takes the value of the first element in the list `res`, which is 0 (as `res` is a list of 0s). The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `res` is a list of 0s with at least 1 element, `queue` is empty, `ind` is 0, and `val` is 0.

Output State: **`res` is a list of 0s with at least 1 element, `queue` is empty, `ind` is 0, `val` is 0**
