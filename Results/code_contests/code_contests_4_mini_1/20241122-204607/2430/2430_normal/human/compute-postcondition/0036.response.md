Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res` is a list of length `n` filled with 0s except at index `ind`, which holds the value `val + 1`, and `ind` is a valid index. If `res[sosed]` is 0, then `queue` is updated to include the new element `[sosed, val]`. If `res[sosed]` is not 0, `queue` remains unchanged. Additionally, it is guaranteed that `nodes[ind]` has at least 2 elements, and `sosed` is the second element of `nodes[ind]`. The condition of `res[sosed]` being 0 indicates that `sosed` was previously unvisited, allowing for the addition to the queue.***
