According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `nodes[ind]` list. If the list has at least 3 elements, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `nodes[ind]` has at least 2 elements, and `sosed` is the second element in `nodes[ind]`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the list `nodes[ind]` must have at least 3 elements. Since `sosed` is currently the second element, it needs to be adjusted to the third element in the list for the next iteration. The index of `sosed` within `nodes[ind]` also needs to be updated accordingly.

State: **`res[ind]` is updated to `val`, `nodes[ind]` is a list with at least 3 elements, `sosed` is the third element in `nodes[ind]`.**
