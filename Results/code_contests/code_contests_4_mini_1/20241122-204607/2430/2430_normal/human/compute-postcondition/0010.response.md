According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `nodes` and specifically `nodes[ind]`. For the loop to execute, `nodes[ind]` must be a non-empty list or collection. Given the initial state, `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`, which means `ind` must be within the valid range of indices for `nodes`.

To ensure that the loop executes correctly, the following conditions must be satisfied:
1. `ind` must be a valid index for `nodes`, meaning `ind` should be between 0 and the length of `nodes - 1`.
2. `nodes[ind]` must contain at least one element.

Given that `n` is an integer that can range from 2 to 100,000, and assuming that `nodes` is appropriately populated, we can say that `ind` must be a valid index pointing to a non-empty list.

To summarize the adjusted states:
- Ensure `ind` is a valid index for `nodes`.
- Ensure `nodes[ind]` contains at least one element.

Therefore, the resulting state should be:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res` is a list of length `n` filled with 0s, `cur` is assigned the value of the first element in `queue`, `val` is now `val + 1`, `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`, `nodes[ind]` is a non-empty list**.
