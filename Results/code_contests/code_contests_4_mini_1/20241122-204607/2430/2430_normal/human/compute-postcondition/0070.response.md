`val` is assigned the value of `res[ind]`. Since `ind` is 1 and `res` is a list of 0s with at least 1 element, the value at index 1 of `res` can be either 0 or another number depending on the contents of the list. However, without specific values for `res`, we cannot determine the exact value of `val`. The states of the other variables (`queue`, `ind`, and `res`) are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `res` is a list of 0s with at least 1 element, `queue` is empty, `ind` is 1, and `val` is assigned the value at `res[1]`.

Output State: **`res` is a list of 0s with at least 1 element, `queue` is empty, `ind` is 1, and `val` is assigned the value at `res[1]**
