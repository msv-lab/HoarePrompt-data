According to the code, the loop iterates over the elements in `nodes[ind]`. Since it is guaranteed that `nodes[ind]` has at least 2 elements, this means that the loop will execute at least twice. At the end of the last iteration, the variable `sosed` is set to the second element of `nodes[ind]`. To allow the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `sosed` refers to the next element in the list, which would be the third element if it exists.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `nodes[ind]` must contain at least 3 elements, and `sosed` must be updated to point to the third element in that list. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res` is a list of length `n` filled with 0s except at index `ind`, which holds the value `val + 1`, and `ind` is a valid index. `nodes[ind]` has at least 3 elements, and `sosed` is the third element of `nodes[ind]`.**
