The `queue` list is modified by appending a new element `[sosed, val]` to it. The values of `sosed` and `val` are already defined in the initial state, but their specific values are not provided. Other variables (`n`, `HM`, `res`, `cur`, `ind`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the change in the `queue` variable while noting that the values of `sosed` and `val` contribute to the new element being added.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res` is a list of length `n` filled with 0s, `cur` is assigned the value of the first element in `queue`, `val` is incremented by 1, `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`, `sosed` is the next unprocessed element in `nodes[ind]`, and `queue` has a new element `[sosed, val]` appended to it.**
