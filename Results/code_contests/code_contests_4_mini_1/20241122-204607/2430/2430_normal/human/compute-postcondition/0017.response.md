According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the `nodes[ind]`, which contains elements that the loop will iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`, and `sosed` is assigned the next element in `nodes[ind]`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that there is at least one more element in `nodes[ind]` that has not been processed yet. The variable `sosed` must be updated to reflect the next unprocessed element. 

Since `sosed` was already assigned to the next element of `nodes[ind]`, we need to ensure that `sosed` points to the next unprocessed element within the list `nodes[ind]`. Thus, we need to adjust `sosed` to ensure it points to the next element in `nodes[ind]` that hasn't been processed yet, and `ind` will remain the same unless the loop has finished processing all elements.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res` is a list of length `n` filled with 0s, `cur` is assigned the value of the first element in `queue`, `val` is incremented by 1, `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`, `sosed` is the next unprocessed element in `nodes[ind]`**
