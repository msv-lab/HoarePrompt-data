To determine whether the `while queue:` loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the current state of the `queue`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `queue` is not empty. 

From the provided state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `res[ind]` is equal to `val`, which is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `HM`.
- `nodes[ind]` is a list of neighboring nodes.
- `queue` may contain pairs `[sosed, val]` for each `sosed` in `nodes[ind]` where `res[sosed]` is equal to 0.
- If `nodes[ind]` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `queue` remains unchanged.
- If all elements in `nodes[ind]` have `res[sosed]` not equal to 0, the loop executes but does not add any new elements to `queue`.

Since there are conditions that affect whether the loop will execute again, we need to ensure that `queue` is still non-empty for the next iteration.

To keep `queue` non-empty, at least one of the following must be true:
1. `nodes[ind]` must contain at least one node `sosed` for which `res[sosed]` is equal to 0.
2. `queue` must have had elements that were not processed in the previous iteration.

Given that we want the loop to execute again, we need to ensure that `nodes[ind]` has at least one neighboring node `sosed` with `res[sosed]` equal to 0. 

Therefore, the necessary adjustment to the state should reflect that there exists at least one `sosed` in `nodes[ind]` such that `res[sosed]` is equal to 0.

State: **`res[ind]` is equal to `val`, which is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `HM`, `nodes[ind]` contains at least one node `sosed` such that `res[sosed]` is equal to 0**
