The code initializes a list `res` with a length of `n`, where each element is set to `0`. The value of `n` is an integer within the range of 2 to 100,000, and `HM` remains unchanged at 51. Therefore, the output state reflects that `res` is a list of zeros with a length equal to `n`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `HM` is 51; `res` is a list of length n filled with 0s.**
