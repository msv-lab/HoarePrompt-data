Output State: **`res` remains a list of 0s with the same length as the initial `res`, `queue` is empty, `ind` ranges from 0 to `len(res) - 1`, and `val` is assigned the corresponding elements of `res`. If `len(res)` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `res` remains an empty list, `queue` is empty, and no iterations occur. If any element of `res` is greater than 26, that element will be updated to `2 * 26 - val`, but if all elements are 0 or less than or equal to 26, `res` will remain unchanged.**
