The code appends a new element, which is a list containing `[sosed, val]`, to the `queue`. The previous state of the `queue` is not provided, but the operation of appending does not affect other variables. The previous values of `sosed` and `val` are necessary to determine the content being appended, but since we don't have their specific values, we only know that they are used in the append operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res` is a list of length `n` filled with 0s, `cur` is assigned the value of the first element in `queue`, `val` is now `val + 1`, `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`, `nodes[ind]` is a non-empty list, `res[sosed]` is equal to 0, and `[sosed, val]` is appended to `queue`.**
