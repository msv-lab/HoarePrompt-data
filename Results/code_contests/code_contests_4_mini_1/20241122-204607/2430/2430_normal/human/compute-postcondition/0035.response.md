The code appends a list containing `sosed` and `val` to the `queue`. Since the previous values of `sosed` and `val` are not specified but are assumed to have been defined based on the initial state, this operation will modify the `queue` variable by adding a new element to it. Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res` is a list of length `n` filled with 0s except at index `ind`, which holds the value `val + 1`, `ind` is a valid index, `nodes[ind]` has at least 2 elements, `sosed` is the second element of `nodes[ind]`, and `queue` is updated to include the new element [sosed, val].**
