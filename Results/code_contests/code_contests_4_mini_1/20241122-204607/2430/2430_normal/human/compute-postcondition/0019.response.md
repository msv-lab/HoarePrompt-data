Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res` is a list of length `n` filled with 0s, `cur` is assigned the value of the first element in `queue`, `val` is incremented by 1, `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`, `sosed` is the next unprocessed element in `nodes[ind]`. If `res[sosed]` is 0, then `sosed` is added to `queue` with the updated value of `val`. If `res[sosed]` is not 0, no changes are made to `queue` or `res`.***
