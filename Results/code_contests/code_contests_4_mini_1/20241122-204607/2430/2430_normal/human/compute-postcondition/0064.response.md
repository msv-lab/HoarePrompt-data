Postcondition: ***`queue` is not empty, `res` is a list where the maximum value is greater than `HM`, and `val` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to `HM`. The elements of `res` may include updated values from the loop execution, and `res[sosed]` are 0 for nodes that have been added to `queue`.***
