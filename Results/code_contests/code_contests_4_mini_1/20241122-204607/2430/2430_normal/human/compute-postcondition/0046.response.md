The variable `res` is updated at the index `ind` with the value `val`. The previous values indicate that `cur` is the first element of `queue`, `queue` has its first element popped, `val` is the second element of `cur`, and `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`. The specific values of `res`, `cur`, `queue`, `val`, and `ind` are not provided, but the state of the program changes as follows:

- `res[ind]` is now equal to `val`.

Since there are no other changes to the state of the other variables, the output state reflects only the update made to the `res` array.

Output State: **`res[ind]` is updated to `val`**
