The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `queue`, `n`, and `nodes`. The parameter `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\). The parameter `queue` is used during the execution but remains empty throughout the process. The parameter `nodes` is described but not constrained in the provided information. 

After executing the function body, if the maximum value in `res` exceeds `HM`, the function returns 'Impossible!'. Otherwise, for each index `ind` in `res`, if the value `val` at that index is greater than 26, it is updated to `2 * 26 - val`. If `res` is initially empty, it remains an empty list. After execution, `res` will either be unchanged if all values are 0 or less than or equal to 26, or it will reflect the updates made for values greater than 26.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `queue`, `n`, and `nodes`, returns 'Impossible!' if the maximum value in `res` exceeds `HM`, otherwise it updates the values in `res` that are greater than 26 and returns the modified `res`, keeping `queue` empty throughout the process.**
