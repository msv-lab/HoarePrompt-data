The code assigns the first element of `cur` to the variable `ind`. Since `cur` is assigned the value of the first element in `queue`, and `cur` is a tuple or list where the first element is accessed by `cur[0]`, `ind` will now hold this value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `HM` is 51; `res` is a list of length n filled with 0s; `cur` is assigned the value of the first element in `queue`, which is removed from `queue`; `val` is assigned the value of `cur[1]`; `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`.**
