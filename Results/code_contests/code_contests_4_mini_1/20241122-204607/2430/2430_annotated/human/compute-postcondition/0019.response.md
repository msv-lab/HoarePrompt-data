Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res` is a list of `n` integers with `res[ind]` updated to `val`, `cur` is assigned the first element of `queue`, `val` is an incremented integer, `ind` is a valid index (0 ≤ ind < n), `nodes[ind]` contains at least three elements. If `res[sosed]` equals 0, then `queue` will include an additional element `[sosed, val]`. If `res[sosed]` is not 0, the `queue` remains unchanged.***
