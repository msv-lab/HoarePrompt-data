Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `val` is incremented by 1, `res[ind]` remains unchanged, `ind` is a valid index, `nodes[ind]` is a list with at least 2 elements, and `sosed` is the first element in the list `nodes[ind]`. If `res[sosed]` equals 0, then `queue` includes the element [sosed, val]; otherwise, `queue` remains unchanged.***
