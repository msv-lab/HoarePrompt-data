The code appends a new element `[sosed, val]` to the end of the `queue`. The other variables, such as `n`, `HM`, `res`, `cur`, `val`, `ind`, and `nodes`, remain unchanged as this operation only modifies the `queue`. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables along with the update to `queue`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res` is a list of `n` integers with `res[ind]` updated to `val`, `cur` is assigned the first element of `queue`, `val` is an integer which has been incremented, `ind` is a valid index (0 ≤ ind < n), `nodes[ind]` contains at least one element, and the element `res[sosed]` is equal to 0; `queue` has a new element `[sosed, val]` appended to it.**
