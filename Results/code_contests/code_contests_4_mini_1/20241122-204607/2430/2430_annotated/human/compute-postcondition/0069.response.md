According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the `res` list. The loop will execute as long as `ind` is less than the length of `res`. At the end of the last iteration, `ind` is 0, and `n` is greater than 0, which implies that `len(res)` is at least 1. 

For the loop to be executed one more time, `ind` needs to be incremented by 1, which means at the start of the next iteration, `ind` should be 1. The state of `res` does not need to change since it is already a list of `n` zeros, and `n` being greater than 0 ensures that the list has at least one element.

State: **`queue` is non-empty or empty, `res` remains a list of `n` zeros, `val` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `ind` is 1**
