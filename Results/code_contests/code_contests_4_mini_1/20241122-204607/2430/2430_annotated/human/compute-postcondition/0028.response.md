Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res[ind]` is updated to `val`, `cur` is the first element of `queue`, `val` is the value of `cur[1]`, and `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`. If `val` is greater than `HM`, the loop is terminated, otherwise, the execution continues with no changes made to the current state. Additionally, `nodes[ind]` contains elements, and at least one `sosed` in `nodes[ind]` has `res[sosed]` equal to 0, which implies that there are still further elements to process unless the loop is exited due to `val` exceeding `HM`.***
