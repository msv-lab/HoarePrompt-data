The code appends a list containing `sosed` and `val` to the `queue`. The previous values of the affected variables are not altered by this operation. Therefore, `queue` will now contain an additional element, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res` is a list of `n` integers with `res[ind]` updated to `val`, `cur` is assigned the first element of `queue`, `val` is an integer which has been incremented, `ind` is a valid index (0 ≤ ind < n), `nodes[ind]` contains at least two elements, and `queue` now contains an additional element [sosed, val]**
