According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the `nodes[ind]`. For the loop to execute, `nodes[ind]` must contain at least one element. Given that `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`, it is necessary to ensure that `nodes[ind]` is not empty and contains at least one `sosed`. 

Since `res[sosed]` is equal to 0 for at least one `sosed` in `nodes[ind]`, this condition is already satisfied. 

Therefore, before the loop starts, the state should confirm that `nodes[ind]` has at least one `sosed`. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res[ind]` is updated to `val`, `cur` is the first element of `queue`, `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`, `val` is incremented by 1, `nodes[ind]` contains at least one `sosed`, and `sosed` is the first element in `nodes[ind]`.**
