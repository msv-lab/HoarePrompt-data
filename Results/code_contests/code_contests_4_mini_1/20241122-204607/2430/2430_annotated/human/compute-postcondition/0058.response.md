The code appends the list `[sosed, val]` to `queue`. The state of other variables remains unchanged. Since `val` was incremented by 1 and `sosed` is defined as the first element in the list `nodes[ind]`, we can say that these values are being added to `queue`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `val` is incremented by 1, `res[ind]` remains unchanged, `ind` is a valid index, `nodes[ind]` is a list with at least 2 elements, `sosed` is the first element in the list `nodes[ind]`, and `queue` now includes the element [sosed, val].**
