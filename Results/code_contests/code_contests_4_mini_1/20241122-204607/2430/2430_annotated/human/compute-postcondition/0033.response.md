Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res[ind]` is updated to `val`, `cur` is the first element of `queue`, `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`, `val` is incremented by 1, `nodes[ind]` contains at least one `sosed`, and `sosed` is the first element in `nodes[ind]`. If `res[sosed]` is equal to 0, then `queue` is updated to include [sosed, val]. If `res[sosed]` is not equal to 0, then `queue` remains unchanged.***
