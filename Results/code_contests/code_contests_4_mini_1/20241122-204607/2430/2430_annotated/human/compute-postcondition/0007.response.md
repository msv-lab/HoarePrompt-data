The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `HM` is 51; `res` is a list of `n` integers with `res[ind]` updated to `val`; `cur` is assigned the first element of `queue`; `val` is an integer greater than 51; `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
