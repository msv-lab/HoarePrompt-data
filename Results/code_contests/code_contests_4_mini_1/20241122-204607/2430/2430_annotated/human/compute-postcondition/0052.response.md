The operation appends a new list containing `sosed` and `val` to the `queue`. The value of `val` has been incremented by 1, but `res[ind]` remains unchanged, `ind` is valid, `nodes[ind]` has at least 1 element, and `res[sosed]` is equal to 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `val` is incremented by 1, `res[ind]` remains unchanged, `ind` is a valid index, `nodes[ind]` is a list with at least 1 element, `queue` is modified to include the new element, and `res[sosed]` is equal to 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `val` is incremented by 1, `res[ind]` remains unchanged, `ind` is a valid index, `nodes[ind]` is a list with at least 1 element, `queue` is modified to include [sosed, val], and `res[sosed]` is equal to 0.**
