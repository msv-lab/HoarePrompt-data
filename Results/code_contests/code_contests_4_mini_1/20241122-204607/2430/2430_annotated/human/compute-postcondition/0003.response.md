The variable `cur` is assigned the first element of `queue`, which is unknown. The code then assigns `val` the value of the second element of `cur`, specifically `cur[1]`. Since the value of `cur` is unknown, we cannot determine the exact value of `val`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `HM` is 51; `res` is a list of `n` zeros; `cur` is assigned the first element of `queue`, and `val` is assigned the value of `cur[1]` (which is unknown)**
