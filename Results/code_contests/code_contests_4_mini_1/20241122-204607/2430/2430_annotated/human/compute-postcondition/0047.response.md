The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res[ind]` is updated to `val`, `val` is `cur[1]`, `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`, and `queue` no longer contains the first element, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
