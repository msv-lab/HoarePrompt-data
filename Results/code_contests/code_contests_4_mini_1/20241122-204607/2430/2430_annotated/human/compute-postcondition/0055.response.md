The statement `queue.append([sosed, val])` appends a list containing `sosed` and `val` to the `queue`. The value of `sosed` is determined by the second element of the list `nodes[ind]`, and `val` is the value that has been incremented by 1. The other variables `n`, `res`, and `ind` remain unchanged, as specified.

Therefore, the output state reflects that `queue` has a new element added to it, while the other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `val` is incremented by 1, `res[ind]` remains unchanged, `ind` is a valid index, `nodes[ind]` is a list with at least 2 elements, `sosed` is the second element in the list `nodes[ind]`, and `queue` now includes the element [sosed, val].**
