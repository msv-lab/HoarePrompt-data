Output State: **`res` remains a list of `n` zeros or updated values depending on the original values in `res`; `val` is the original value of `res[ind]` for each index `ind` from 0 to `n-1`. If any element in `res` was greater than 26, it will be updated to `2 * 26 - val`; if all elements are less than or equal to 26, `res` remains unchanged. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute and `res` remains a list of zeros.**
