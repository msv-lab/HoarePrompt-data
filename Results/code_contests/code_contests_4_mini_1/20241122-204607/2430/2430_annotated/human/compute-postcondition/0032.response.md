The code appends a list containing `sosed` and `val` to the `queue`. The previous values of the affected variables are `sosed` (which is the first element in `nodes[ind]`) and `val` (which has been incremented by 1). The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the action taken.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res[ind]` is updated to `val`, `cur` is the first element of `queue`, `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`, `val` is incremented by 1, `nodes[ind]` contains at least one `sosed`, `sosed` is the first element in `nodes[ind]`, `res[sosed]` is equal to 0, and `queue` is updated to include [sosed, val]**
