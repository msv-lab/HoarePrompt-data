The variable `val` is assigned the value of `cur[1]`. The previous values of the affected variables (`cur`, `n`, `HM`, `res`, `ind`, and `queue`) do not change as a result of this assignment. The output state will reflect the current values of these variables and the new assignment of `val`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res[ind]` is updated to `val`, `val` is `cur[1]`, `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`, and `queue` no longer contains the first element.**
