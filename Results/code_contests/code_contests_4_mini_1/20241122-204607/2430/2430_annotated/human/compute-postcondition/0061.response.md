Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `val` is incremented by 1, `res[ind]` remains unchanged, `ind` is a valid index, `nodes[ind]` is a list with at least 0 elements. If `nodes[ind]` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `queue` remains unchanged. If `nodes[ind]` contains elements, the loop executes for each element `sosed` in `nodes[ind]`. If `res[sosed]` equals 0, then `queue` is modified to include the pair [sosed, val]. If `res[sosed]` is not equal to 0, then `queue` remains unchanged for that iteration.**
