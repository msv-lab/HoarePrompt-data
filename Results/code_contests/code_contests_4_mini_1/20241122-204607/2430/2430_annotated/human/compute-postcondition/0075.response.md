Postcondition: ***If the maximum value in `res` exceeds `HM`, the function returns 'Impossible!'. Otherwise, `res` remains a list of `n` zeros or contains updated values, where each element in `res` is modified to `2 * 26 - val` if `val` (the original value of `res[ind]`) is greater than 26. If all elements in `res` are less than or equal to 26, they remain unchanged. In cases where `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `res` stays as a list of zeros.***
