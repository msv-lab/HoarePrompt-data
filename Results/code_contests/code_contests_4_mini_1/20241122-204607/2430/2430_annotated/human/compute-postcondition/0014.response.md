According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the elements in `nodes[ind]`. At the end of the last iteration, `ind` is a valid index (0 ≤ ind < n) and `nodes[ind]` contains at least one element, which means that `sosed` will take on the values from the elements in `nodes[ind]`.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `nodes[ind]` still has elements that can be iterated over. If `nodes[ind]` had `k` elements at the start of the last iteration, then after the last iteration, it should still have at least one element remaining for the loop to run again.

Since we don't have the exact number of elements in `nodes[ind]`, we can't specify the exact situation, but we know that `nodes[ind]` must contain at least one more element than it did at the end of the last iteration for the loop to execute again.

Thus, we need to adjust `nodes[ind]` to ensure it has at least one more element. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res` is a list of `n` integers with `res[ind]` updated to `val`, `cur` is assigned the first element of `queue`, `val` is an integer which has been incremented, `ind` is a valid index (0 ≤ ind < n), `nodes[ind]` contains at least two elements.**
