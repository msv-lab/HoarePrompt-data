Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res` is a list of `n` integers with `res[ind]` updated to `val`, `cur` is assigned the first element of `queue`, `val` is the value of `cur[1]`, `ind` is a valid index (0 ≤ ind < n), `nodes[ind]` contains elements, at least one `sosed` in `nodes[ind]` has `res[sosed]` equal to 0, and `cur` is the first element removed from `queue`.**
