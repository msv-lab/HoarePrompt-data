Output State: **If `queue` is non-empty, the loop will execute; `res` will contain updated values at indices corresponding to elements in `queue`, and `val` will be incremented accordingly. If at any point `val` exceeds `HM`, the loop will terminate early. If `queue` is empty at the start, the loop does not execute, and `res` remains a list of `n` zeros. If all elements in `nodes[ind]` have been visited (i.e., `res[sosed]` is non-zero for all), the loop will execute without adding new elements to `queue`, maintaining its state. In any case, `n` remains unchanged.**
