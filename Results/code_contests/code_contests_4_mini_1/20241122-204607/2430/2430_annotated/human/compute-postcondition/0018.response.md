The code appends a new list `[sosed, val]` to the `queue`. The previous values of the affected variables are `sosed`, which is the next element in `nodes[ind]`, and `val`, which has been incremented. The state of `res` and `cur` is not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the other variables and indicates that a new element has been added to the `queue`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res` is a list of `n` integers with `res[ind]` updated to `val`, `cur` is assigned the first element of `queue`, `val` is an incremented integer, `ind` is a valid index (0 ≤ ind < n), `nodes[ind]` contains at least three elements, `queue` now includes an additional element `[sosed, val]`**
