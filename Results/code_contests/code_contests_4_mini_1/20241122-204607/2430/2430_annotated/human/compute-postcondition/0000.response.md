The value of `HM` is calculated as `2 * 26 - 1`. Performing the calculation:

1. First, calculate `2 * 26`, which equals `52`.
2. Then, subtract `1` from `52`, resulting in `51`.

The initial state of `n` and the undirected roads connecting cities are not affected by this calculation. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `HM` is 51**
