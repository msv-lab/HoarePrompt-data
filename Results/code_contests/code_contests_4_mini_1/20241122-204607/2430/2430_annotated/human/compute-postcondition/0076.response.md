The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `queue`, `n`, and `nodes`. The parameter `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), and `nodes` represents the undirected roads connecting the cities. The output of the function depends on the values in a list called `res`. If the maximum value in `res` exceeds a variable `HM`, the function returns the string 'Impossible!'. Otherwise, `res` either remains a list of `n` zeros or contains updated values, where each element in `res` is modified to \(2 \times 26 - \text{val}\) if the original value of `res[ind]` (denoted as `val`) is greater than 26. If all elements in `res` are less than or equal to 26, they remain unchanged. Additionally, if `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `res` stays as a list of zeros.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `queue`, `n`, and `nodes`, returning 'Impossible!' if the maximum value in `res` exceeds `HM`. If not, it returns a modified list `res` where elements greater than 26 are updated to \(2 \times 26 - \text{val}\), or remains unchanged if they are less than or equal to 26. If `n` is 0, `res` remains a list of zeros.**
