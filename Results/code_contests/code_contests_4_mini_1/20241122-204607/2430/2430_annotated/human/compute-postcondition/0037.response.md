According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nodes[ind]`. The loop will iterate over the elements in `nodes[ind]`. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `nodes[ind]` contains at least two `sosed`, and `sosed` is currently assigned the second element of `nodes[ind]`.

To execute the loop one more time, we need to ensure that `nodes[ind]` has at least three elements, which means that `sosed` must be updated to the third element of `nodes[ind]`. The current value of `sosed` is the second element, thus we need to adjust it accordingly.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res[ind]` is updated to `val`, `cur` is the first element of `queue`, `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`, `val` is incremented by 1, `nodes[ind]` contains at least three `sosed`, `sosed` is the third element in `nodes[ind]`, `queue` remains unchanged.**
