The value at index `ind` of the list `res` is updated to `val`. The initial state specifies that `res[ind]` was previously some integer value, and now it is changed to `val`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `res[ind]`, while noting the conditions of the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res[ind]` is updated to `val`, `cur` is the first element of `queue`, `val` is the value of `cur[1]`, `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`, and `nodes[ind]` contains elements, at least one `sosed` in `nodes[ind]` has `res[sosed]` equal to 0**
