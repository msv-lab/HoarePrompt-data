According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `queue`. If `queue` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, we have `queue` which may contain multiple entries depending on the number of `sosed` in `nodes[ind]` with `res[sosed]` equal to 0. Since the loop can only execute if `queue` is not empty, we need to ensure that there is at least one entry in `queue` to allow the loop to proceed one more time.

As per the given state, since `queue` may contain multiple entries, we do not have enough information to definitively state whether it is empty or not. However, we need to adjust `queue` to ensure that it contains at least one entry. 

Thus, we can conclude that for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `queue` has at least one element. Therefore, we can modify the state to indicate that `queue` contains one element.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res[ind]` is updated to `val`, `cur` is the first element of `queue`, `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`, `val` is incremented by 1, and `queue` contains at least one entry**
