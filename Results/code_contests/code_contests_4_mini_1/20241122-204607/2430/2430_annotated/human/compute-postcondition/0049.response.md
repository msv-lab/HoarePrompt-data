The value of `val` is incremented by 1. The previous conditions on `val`, `HM`, `res[ind]`, `ind`, and `queue` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `val` and the unchanged states of the other variables. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `val` is incremented by 1; `res[ind]`, `ind`, and `queue` remain unchanged.**
