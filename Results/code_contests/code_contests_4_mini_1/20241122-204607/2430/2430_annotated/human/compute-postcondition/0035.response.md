The `append` method adds a new element to the end of the `queue`. The new element being appended is a list containing `sosed` and `val`. The previous state of the affected variables is as follows: `cur` is the first element of `queue`, `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`, and `val` has been incremented by 1. Since `nodes[ind]` contains at least two `sosed`, the value of `sosed` is valid.

After executing the code, we update the `queue` with the new element `[sosed, val]`, but the other variables remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res[ind]` is updated to `val`, `cur` is the first element of `queue`, `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`, `val` is incremented by 1, `nodes[ind]` contains at least two `sosed`, `sosed` is the second element in `nodes[ind]`, and `queue` now contains a new element `[sosed, val]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res[ind]` is updated to `val`, `cur` is the first element of `queue`, `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`, `val` is incremented by 1, `nodes[ind]` contains at least two `sosed`, `sosed` is the second element in `nodes[ind]`, and `queue` now contains a new element `[sosed, val]`**.
