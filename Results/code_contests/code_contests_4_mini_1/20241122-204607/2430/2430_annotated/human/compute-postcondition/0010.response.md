According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nodes[ind]`. For the loop to execute, `nodes[ind]` must be a list that contains at least one element. Given that `n` is an integer within the range of 2 to 100,000, we must ensure that `ind` is a valid index within the bounds of `res` and `nodes`. 

Additionally, we need to consider the variable `sosed`, which will take values from `nodes[ind]` during each iteration of the loop. 

To ensure the loop executes:
1. `nodes[ind]` must contain at least one element.
2. `ind` must be a valid index such that `0 ≤ ind < n`.
3. The initial value of `cur` is set to the first element of `queue`, but it does not affect the execution of the loop itself.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res` is a list of `n` integers with `res[ind]` updated to `val`, `cur` is assigned the first element of `queue`, `val` is an integer (which has been incremented), `ind` is a valid index (0 ≤ ind < n), `nodes[ind]` contains at least one element**.
