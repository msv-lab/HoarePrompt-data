Postcondition: ***`queue` is non-empty, `res` contains updated values at indices corresponding to elements in `queue`, `val` has been incremented, and the maximum value in `res` exceeds `HM`. `n` remains unchanged. If `val` has exceeded `HM`, the loop has terminated early. If all elements in `nodes[ind]` have been visited, `res[sosed]` is non-zero for all corresponding indices.***
