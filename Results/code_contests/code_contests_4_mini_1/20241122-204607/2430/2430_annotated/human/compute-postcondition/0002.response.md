The code `cur = queue.pop(0)` attempts to remove and return the first element from the list `queue`. However, the initial state does not provide information about the variable `queue`. Since the state of `queue` is unknown, we cannot determine the exact value of `cur` after this operation. Therefore, we cannot specify the value of `cur` or determine the effect on `res`. 

The output state is based on the fact that `cur` is assigned the value of the first element of `queue`, but without knowing the contents of `queue`, we cannot provide a specific state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `HM` is 51; `res` is a list of `n` zeros; `cur` is assigned the first element of `queue`, which is unknown**.
