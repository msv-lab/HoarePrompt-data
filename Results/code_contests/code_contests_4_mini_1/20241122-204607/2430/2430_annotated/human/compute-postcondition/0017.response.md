According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nodes[ind]` list. If `nodes[ind]` contains at least one more element, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `nodes[ind]` contains at least two elements. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, we need to adjust the state such that `nodes[ind]` contains at least three elements, and we also need to update `sosed` to be the next element in `nodes[ind]`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res` is a list of `n` integers with `res[ind]` updated to `val`, `cur` is assigned the first element of `queue`, `val` is an integer which has been incremented, `ind` is a valid index (0 ≤ ind < n), `nodes[ind]` contains at least three elements, if `res[sosed]` equals 0, then `queue` will contain an additional element `[sosed, val]`, sosed is the next element in `nodes[ind]`**
