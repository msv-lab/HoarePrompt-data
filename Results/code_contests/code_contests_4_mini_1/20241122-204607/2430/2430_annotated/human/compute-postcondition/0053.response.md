Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `val` is incremented by 1, `res[ind]` remains unchanged, `ind` is a valid index, `nodes[ind]` is a list with at least 1 element, and `queue` is modified to include the pair [sosed, val] if `res[sosed]` is equal to 0. If `res[sosed]` is not equal to 0, then `queue` remains unchanged while all other conditions hold true.***
