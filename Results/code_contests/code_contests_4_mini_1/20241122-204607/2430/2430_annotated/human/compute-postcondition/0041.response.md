Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res[ind]` is updated to `val`, `cur` is the first element of `queue`, `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`, `val` is incremented by 1. After the loop executes, `queue` may contain multiple entries depending on the number of `sosed` in `nodes[ind]` with `res[sosed]` equal to 0. If there are no `sosed` with `res[sosed]` equal to 0, `queue` remains unchanged. If `nodes[ind]` is empty, the loop does not execute, leaving `queue`, `res[ind]`, and other variables unchanged.**
