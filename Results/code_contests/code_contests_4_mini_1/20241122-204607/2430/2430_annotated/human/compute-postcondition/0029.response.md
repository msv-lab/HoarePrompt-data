The value of `val` is incremented by 1. Since the previous value of `val` is not explicitly defined, we note that `val` will now be greater than its previous value. However, the other variables remain unchanged. The output state reflects that `val` has been updated, but we do not specify the exact value of `val` since it is unknown. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res[ind]` is updated to `val`, `cur` is the first element of `queue`, `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`, `val` is incremented by 1, and at least one `sosed` in `nodes[ind]` has `res[sosed]` equal to 0.**
