The code appends a new list `[sosed, val]` to the `queue`. The values of `sosed` and `val` are derived from the previous state where `sosed` is the third element in `nodes[ind]`, and `val` has been incremented by 1. The values of `n`, `HM`, `res[ind]`, `cur`, `ind`, and `nodes[ind]` are unchanged by this operation. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res[ind]` is updated to `val`, `cur` is the first element of `queue`, `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`, `val` is incremented by 1, `nodes[ind]` contains at least three `sosed`, `sosed` is the third element in `nodes[ind]`, `queue` remains unchanged, and a new entry `[sosed, val]` is appended to `queue`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res[ind]` is updated to `val`, `cur` is the first element of `queue`, `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`, `val` is incremented by 1, `nodes[ind]` contains at least three `sosed`, `sosed` is the third element in `nodes[ind]`, `queue` remains unchanged, and a new entry `[sosed, val]` is appended to `queue`.**
