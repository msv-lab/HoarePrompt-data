The variable `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`. The previous state of `cur` is not provided, so we cannot determine the specific value of `ind`. The other variables (`n`, `HM`, `res[ind]`, `val`, and the state of `queue`) remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `ind`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res[ind]` is updated to `val`, `val` is `cur[1]`, `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`, and `queue` no longer contains the first element.**
