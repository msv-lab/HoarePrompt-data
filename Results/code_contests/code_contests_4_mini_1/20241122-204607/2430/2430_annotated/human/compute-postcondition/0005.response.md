The value of `res[ind]` is assigned the value of `val`. The specific values of `ind` and `val` are unknown, but they will impact the `res` list at the index `ind`. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `HM` is 51; `res` is a list of `n` zeros with `res[ind]` updated to `val`; `cur` is assigned the first element of `queue`; `val` is assigned the value of `cur[1]`; `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`.
