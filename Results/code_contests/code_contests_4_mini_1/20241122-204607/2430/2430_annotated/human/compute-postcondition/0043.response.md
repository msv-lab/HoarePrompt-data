The value of `cur` is assigned the first element of `queue`, and the first element is removed from `queue` as a result of the `pop(0)` operation. The states of the other variables (`n`, `HM`, `res[ind]`, `val`, `ind`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res[ind]` is updated to `val`, `val` is incremented by 1, `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`, and `queue` no longer contains the element that was just removed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res[ind]` is updated to `val`, `val` is incremented by 1, `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`, and `queue` no longer contains the first element.**
