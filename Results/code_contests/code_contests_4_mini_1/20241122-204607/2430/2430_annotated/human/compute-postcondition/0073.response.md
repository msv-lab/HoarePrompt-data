According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `ind` and the length of `res`. The loop is designed to iterate over the indices of the `res` list, which has a length of `n`. If `ind` is less than `len(res)`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `ind` is 2 and `n` is greater than 2. For `len(res)` to be at least 3 (since it contains `n` zeros), the condition for the loop execution is satisfied. 

However, since `ind` is currently 2, for the loop to execute one more time, `ind` must be incremented to 3. Therefore, we need to adjust `ind` to 3.

State: **`queue` is non-empty or empty, `res` remains a list of `n` zeros, `val` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `ind` is 3, and `val` is 0**
