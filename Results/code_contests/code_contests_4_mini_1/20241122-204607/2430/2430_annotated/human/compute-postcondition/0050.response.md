According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nodes` list and the value of `ind`. The loop iterates over `nodes[ind]`, which means that `ind` must be a valid index for the `nodes` list. Furthermore, for the loop to execute, `nodes[ind]` must contain at least one element.

Given the constraints on `n`, `val`, `res[ind]`, and `queue` are unchanged, the state needs to ensure that `ind` is a valid index and that `nodes[ind]` is a non-empty list.

To ensure that the loop can execute:
- `ind` must be valid (0 ≤ `ind` < length of `nodes`).
- `nodes[ind]` must contain at least one element.

Thus, the adjusted state would be:
State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `val` is incremented by 1, `res[ind]` remains unchanged, `ind` is a valid index, `nodes[ind]` is a list with at least 1 element, and `queue` remains unchanged.**
