The variable `val` is assigned the value at index `ind` of the list `res`. Since `ind` is 0, `val` will take the value of `res[0]`. As stated, `res` is a list of `n` zeros, so `res[0]` is 0. The other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `queue` is non-empty or empty, `res` remains a list of `n` zeros, `val` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and `ind` is 0.

Output State: **`queue` is non-empty or empty, `res` remains a list of `n` zeros, `val` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and `ind` is 0**
