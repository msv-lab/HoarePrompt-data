`val` is assigned the value of `res[ind]`. The variable `ind` is 1, and `res` is a list of `n` zeros, so `res[1]` is 0. Therefore, `val` is assigned the value 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`queue` is non-empty or empty, `res` remains a list of `n` zeros, `val` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `ind` is 1, and `val` is 0**.
