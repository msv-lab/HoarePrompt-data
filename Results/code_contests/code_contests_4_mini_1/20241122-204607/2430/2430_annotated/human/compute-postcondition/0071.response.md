According to the code, the loop iterates based on the length of the `res` list, which is `n`. The loop will execute as long as `ind` is less than `len(res)`. At the end of the last iteration, `ind` is 1 and since `n` is greater than 0, `len(res)` is at least 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `ind` needs to be increased by 1. Therefore, `ind` should be adjusted to 2. Additionally, since `res` remains a list of `n` zeros, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 2 for the loop to have more iterations.

State: **`queue` is non-empty or empty, `res` remains a list of `n` zeros, `val` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `ind` is 2, and `val` is 0**
