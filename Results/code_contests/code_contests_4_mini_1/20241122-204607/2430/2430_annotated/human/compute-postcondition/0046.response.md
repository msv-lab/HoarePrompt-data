The variable `res[ind]` is assigned the value `val`, where `val` is equal to `cur[1]`, and `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`. Since both `cur[0]` and `cur[1]` are not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine their specific values or the resulting changes in `res`. The output state remains focused on the relationships between the variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res[ind]` is updated to `val`, `val` is `cur[1]`, `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`, and `queue` no longer contains the first element.**
