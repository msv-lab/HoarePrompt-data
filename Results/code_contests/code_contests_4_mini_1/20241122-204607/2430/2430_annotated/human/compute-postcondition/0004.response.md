The variable `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`, where `cur` is assigned the first element of `queue`. Since `cur` is unknown and contains at least one element, the value of `ind` will be determined by `cur[0]`, but it remains unspecified. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `HM` is 51; `res` is a list of `n` zeros; `cur` is assigned the first element of `queue`; `val` is assigned the value of `cur[1]` (which is unknown); `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]` (which is unknown).
