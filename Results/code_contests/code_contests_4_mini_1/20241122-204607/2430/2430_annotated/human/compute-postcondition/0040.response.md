According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `nodes[ind]`. The loop will iterate over the elements in `nodes[ind]`. At the end of the last iteration, `nodes[ind]` contains at least three `sosed`, and `sosed` is the third element in `nodes[ind]`. 

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to consider the next element in `nodes[ind]`. Since `sosed` is currently the third element, the loop must be prepared to execute with `sosed` being the fourth element in the next iteration. This means we need to update the state to indicate that we are now at the fourth `sosed` in the list.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `sosed` should be updated to the fourth element in `nodes[ind]`.
- The index of the loop (implicitly) should be updated to reflect that we are moving to the next element.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res[ind]` is updated to `val`, `cur` is the first element of `queue`, `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`, `val` is incremented by 1, `nodes[ind]` contains at least four `sosed`, and `sosed` is the fourth element in `nodes[ind]`, `queue` remains unchanged.**
