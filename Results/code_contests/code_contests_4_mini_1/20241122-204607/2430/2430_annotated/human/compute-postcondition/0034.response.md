According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `ind` and the content of `nodes[ind]`. The loop iterates over the elements in `nodes[ind]`. At the end of the last iteration, `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`, and `nodes[ind]` contains at least one `sosed`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the following conditions must be met:
1. `nodes[ind]` must contain at least one more `sosed` than it did in the last iteration, since the loop will iterate over each `sosed` in `nodes[ind]`.
2. The value of `sosed` must be updated to reflect the next element in `nodes[ind]`.

Currently, we know that `sosed` is the first element in `nodes[ind]`. To ensure that the loop can execute again, we need to adjust the state so that `nodes[ind]` contains at least one more `sosed`, and `sosed` will be updated to the next element. 

Thus, we can conclude that:
- `nodes[ind]` should contain at least two `sosed`, and the first `sosed` is currently the first element; hence the second `sosed` becomes the next `sosed` in the next loop iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res[ind]` is updated to `val`, `cur` is the first element of `queue`, `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`, `val` is incremented by 1, `nodes[ind]` contains at least two `sosed`, `sosed` is the second element in `nodes[ind]`**
