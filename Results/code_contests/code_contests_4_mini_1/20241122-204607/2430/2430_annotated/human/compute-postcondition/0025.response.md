The value of `ind` is assigned the first element of `cur`, which is `cur[0]`. Since `cur` is defined as the first element removed from `queue`, and `ind` is a valid index (0 ≤ ind < n), this means that `ind` will have a specific integer value between 0 and n-1. The other variables (`n`, `HM`, `res`, `val`, `nodes`, and `cur`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res` is a list of `n` integers with `res[ind]` updated to `val`, `cur` is the first element of `queue`, `val` is the value of `cur[1]`, `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`, `nodes[ind]` contains elements, at least one `sosed` in `nodes[ind]` has `res[sosed]` equal to 0.
