Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res[ind]` is updated to `val`, `cur` is the first element of `queue`, `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`, `val` is incremented by 1, `nodes[ind]` contains at least two `sosed`, `sosed` is the second element in `nodes[ind]`. If `res[sosed]` is 0, then `queue` now contains a new element `[sosed, val]`. If `res[sosed]` is not 0, the condition does not append to the queue, and the state of `queue` remains unchanged.***
