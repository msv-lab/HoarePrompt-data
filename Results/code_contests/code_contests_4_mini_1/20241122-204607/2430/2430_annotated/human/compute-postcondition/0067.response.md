According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `res`. The loop will iterate over the indices of `res`, which means `len(res)` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute. Since `res` is initialized as a list of `n` zeros, it will have a length of `n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. 

Additionally, the `ind` variable will start at 0 and will increment up to `len(res) - 1` during each iteration. Thus, `ind` needs to be initialized to 0 before the loop starts.

State: **`queue` is non-empty or empty, `res` remains a list of `n` zeros, `val` is less than or equal to `HM`, `n` is greater than 0, and `ind` is 0**
