Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5. If `val` (which is `cur[1]`) is greater than `HM` (51), the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. In this case, `res[ind]` is updated to `val`, `ind` is assigned the value of `cur[0]`, and `queue` no longer contains the first element. If `val` is less than or equal to `HM`, the program continues execution without breaking, maintaining the conditions on `n`, `res[ind]`, `ind`, and `queue`.***
