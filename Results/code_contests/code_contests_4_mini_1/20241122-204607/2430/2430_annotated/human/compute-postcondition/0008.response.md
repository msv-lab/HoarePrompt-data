Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res` is a list of `n` integers with `res[ind]` updated to `val`, `cur` is assigned the first element of `queue`, `val` is an integer, and if `val` is greater than 51, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `val` is less than or equal to 51, the program continues executing the next statements without breaking.***
