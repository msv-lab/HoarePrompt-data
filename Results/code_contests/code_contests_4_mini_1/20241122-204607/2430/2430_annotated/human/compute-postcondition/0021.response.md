Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `HM` is 51, `res` is a list of `n` integers with `res[ind]` updated to `val`, `cur` is assigned the first element of `queue`, `val` is an incremented integer, `ind` is a valid index (0 ≤ ind < n), `nodes[ind]` contains elements. If `res[sosed]` equals 0 for any `sosed` in `nodes[ind]`, then `[sosed, val]` will be appended to the `queue` for each such `sosed`. If `nodes[ind]` is empty, the loop does not execute and `queue` remains unchanged. If all `res[sosed]` are non-zero, the loop executes but does not make any changes to `queue`.**
