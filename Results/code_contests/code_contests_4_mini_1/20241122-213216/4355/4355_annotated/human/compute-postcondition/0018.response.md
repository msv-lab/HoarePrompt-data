The variable `integer` is assigned the value of `int(binary, 2)`, which converts the binary string `binary` into its integer representation. The previous values of the affected variables are as follows: `binary` is the reverse of `s`, where `s` is the 8-bit binary representation of `ord(c)`. Thus, `integer` will hold the integer value corresponding to the binary representation of the character `c`.

Therefore, the output state is: `text` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `table` is {'>': 8, '<': 9, '+': 10, '-': 11, '.': 12, ',': 13, '[': 14, ']': 15}, `input` is a string containing at least 3 characters, `c` is the third character of `input`, `s` is an 8-bit binary representation of `ord(c)`, `binary` is the reverse of `s`, and `integer` is the integer representation of `binary`.
