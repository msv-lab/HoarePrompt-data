The variable `binary` is assigned the value of `s` reversed (`s[::-1]`). The value of `s` is the 8-bit binary representation of the ASCII value of the second character of `input`, which is `c`. Since `s` is a string of 8 characters (the binary representation), reversing it will give another string of 8 characters. The values of other variables (`text`, `table`, `input`, `prev`, `c`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`text` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `table` is {'>': 8, '<': 9, '+': 10, '-': 11, '.': 12, ',': 13, '[': 14, ']': 15}, `input` is a string containing at least 2 characters, `prev` is now equal to `integer`, `c` is the second character of `input`, `s` is the 8-bit binary representation of `ord(c)` padded with zeros on the left, `binary` is the reverse of `s`.**
