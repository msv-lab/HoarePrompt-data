The variable `input` is assigned the value of `sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()`, which reads a line from standard input and removes any trailing whitespace, including newline characters. The variable `text` remains unchanged as it is not directly affected by this code. The state of `table` is also unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables along with the newly assigned value to `input`.

Output State: **`text` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters; `table` is {'>': 8, '<': 9, '+': 10, '-': 11, '.': 12, ',': 13, '[': 14, ']': 15}; `input` is the input string without trailing whitespace**.
