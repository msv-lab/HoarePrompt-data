The variable `prev` is initialized with the value `0`. The other variables `text`, `table`, and `input` remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the initialization of `prev` while retaining the states of the other variables.

Output State: **`text` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters; `table` is {'>': 8, '<': 9, '+': 10, '-': 11, '.': 12, ',': 13, '[': 14, ']': 15}; `input` is the input string without trailing whitespace; `prev` is 0**
