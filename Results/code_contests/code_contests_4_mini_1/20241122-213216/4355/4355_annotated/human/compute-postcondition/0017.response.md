The variable `binary` is assigned the value of `s` reversed. Since `s` is an 8-bit binary representation of `ord(c)` padded to 8 bits, reversing `s` will yield a new string that is the reverse of that binary representation. The values of the other variables, `text`, `table`, `input`, `c`, and `prev`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `text` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `table` is {'>': 8, '<': 9, '+': 10, '-': 11, '.': 12, ',': 13, '[': 14, ']': 15}, `input` is a string containing at least 3 characters, `c` is the third character of `input`, `s` is an 8-bit binary representation of `ord(c)`, `binary` is the reverse of `s`, and `prev` is equal to `integer`.
