To determine the impact of the code snippet, we need to break it down step by step based on the initial state of the variables.

1. The variable `integer` is defined as the integer representation of `binary`, which is the reverse of `s`, where `s` is the 8-bit binary representation of the ordinal value of the third character `c` from the `input` string.
2. The code snippet `print(prev - integer) % 256` implies that there is a variable `prev` that is not defined in the initial state provided. Hence, we cannot calculate the precise output without knowing the value of `prev`.

Since `prev` is undefined in the initial state, we cannot determine the result of the expression `prev - integer`. Therefore, the output state will reflect that we cannot derive the final calculation due to the missing variable.

Output State: **`text` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `table` is {'>': 8, '<': 9, '+': 10, '-': 11, '.': 12, ',': 13, '[': 14, ']': 15}, `input` is a string containing at least 3 characters, `c` is the third character of `input`, `s` is an 8-bit binary representation of `ord(c)`, `binary` is the reverse of `s`, `integer` is the integer representation of `binary`, and `prev` is undefined.**
