The variable `prev` is assigned the value of `integer`, effectively replacing its previous value. The value of `integer` is not specified in the initial state, but we note that `prev` will now equal `integer`. The other variables remain unaffected, so we report their states as well.

Output State: **`text` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `table` is {'>': 8, '<': 9, '+': 10, '-': 11, '.': 12, ',': 13, '[': 14, ']': 15}, `input` is a string containing at least 2 characters, `c` is the second character of `input`, `s` is the 8-bit binary representation of `ord(c)`, `binary` is the reverse of `s`, `prev` is equal to `integer`, and `prev` is now equal to `integer`.**
