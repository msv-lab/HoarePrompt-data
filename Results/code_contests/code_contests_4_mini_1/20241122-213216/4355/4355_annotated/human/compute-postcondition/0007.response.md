To execute the provided code snippet, we need to determine the values of the affected variables based on the initial state.

1. The initial state has the variable `prev` set to `0`.
2. The variable `c` is the first character of the `input`, and `s` is the binary representation of `ord(c)`, padded to 8 characters.
3. The variable `binary` is the reverse of `s`.
4. The variable `integer` is the integer value of `binary`.

The code then computes `(prev - integer) % 256`. 

- Since `prev` is `0`, the expression simplifies to `(-integer) % 256`. 
- The exact value of `integer` depends on the first character of `input`, which is not specified in the initial state. 

Thus, we summarize the output state with the information provided:

Output State: **`text` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `table` is {'>': 8, '<': 9, '+': 10, '-': 11, '.': 12, ',': 13, '[': 14, ']': 15}, `input` is a string containing at least 1 character, `prev` is 0, `c` is the first character of `input`, `s` is the binary representation of `ord(c)` padded to 8 characters, `binary` is the reversed version of `s`, `integer` is the integer value of `binary`, and the result of the expression is `(-integer) % 256`.**
