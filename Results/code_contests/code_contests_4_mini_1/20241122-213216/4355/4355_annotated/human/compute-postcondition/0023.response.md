The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It is designed to process a string `text`, which is expected to be a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, with each character's ASCII code ranging from 32 (space) to 126 (tilde), inclusive. The function's output is not specified, so we cannot describe the return value at this time. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and processes a string `text` with specific constraints, but the return value is not specified.**
