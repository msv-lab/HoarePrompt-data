The variable `table` is initialized as a dictionary containing specific mappings of characters to integers. The initial state of `text` is not affected by this code, as it merely defines a new variable. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged value of `text` and the newly defined `table`.

Output State: **`text` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, where each character's ASCII code is between 32 (space) and 126 (tilde), inclusive; `table` is {'>': 8, '<': 9, '+': 10, '-': 11, '.': 12, ',': 13, '[': 14, ']': 15}**
