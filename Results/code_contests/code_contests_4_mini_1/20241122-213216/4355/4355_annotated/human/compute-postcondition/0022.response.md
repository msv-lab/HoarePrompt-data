Output State: **`prev` is equal to the integer value of the last character in `input`, `c` is the last character of `input`, `s` is the 8-bit binary representation of `ord(c)`, `binary` is the reverse of `s`, and the result of the expression is `(-integer) % 256`. If `input` is an empty string, the loop does not execute and `prev` remains 0, `c` is undefined, and `integer` is undefined.**
