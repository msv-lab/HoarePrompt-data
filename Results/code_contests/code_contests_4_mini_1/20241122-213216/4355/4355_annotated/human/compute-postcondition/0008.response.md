The variable `prev` is assigned the value of `integer`. The value of `integer` has been calculated as `(-integer) % 256`, so `prev` will now hold that value. The previous value of `prev` was 0, but it will be updated to the newly calculated `integer`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`text` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `table` is {'>': 8, '<': 9, '+': 10, '-': 11, '.': 12, ',': 13, '[': 14, ']': 15}, `input` is a string containing at least 1 character, `prev` is now equal to `integer`, `c` is the first character of `input`, `s` is the binary representation of `ord(c)`, `binary` is the reversed version of `s`, `integer` is the integer value of `binary`, and the result of the expression is `(-integer) % 256`.**
