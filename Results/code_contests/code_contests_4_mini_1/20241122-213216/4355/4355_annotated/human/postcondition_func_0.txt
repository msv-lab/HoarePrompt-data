The function does not accept any parameters and reads a line of input from standard input. It processes each character of the input string by converting it to its 8-bit binary representation, reversing that binary string, and then converting it back to an integer. It calculates the difference between the current and previous integer values and prints the result modulo 256. If the input is empty, it does not execute the loop, and the previous integer remains 0. The function does not return any value.
