You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: INTERCAL is the oldest of esoteric programming languages. One of its many weird features is the method of character-based output, known as Turing Tape method. It converts an array of unsigned 8-bit integers into a sequence of characters to print, using the following method.

The integers of the array are processed one by one, starting from the first. Processing i-th element of the array is done in three steps:

1. The 8-bit binary notation of the ASCII-code of the previous printed character is reversed. When the first element of the array is processed, the result of this step is considered to be 0.

2. The i-th element of the array is subtracted from the result of the previous step modulo 256.

3. The binary notation of the result of the previous step is reversed again to produce ASCII-code of the i-th character to be printed.

You are given the text printed using this method. Restore the array used to produce this text.

Input

The input will consist of a single line text which contains the message printed using the described method. String text will contain between 1 and 100 characters, inclusive. ASCII-code of each character of text will be between 32 (space) and 126 (tilde), inclusive.

Output

Output the initial array, which was used to produce text, one integer per line.

Examples

Input

Hello, World!


Output

238
108
112
0
64
194
48
26
244
168
24
16
162

Note

Let's have a closer look at the beginning of the example. The first character is "H" with ASCII-code 72 = 010010002. Its reverse is 000100102 = 18, and this number should become the result of the second step of processing. The result of the first step is considered to be 0, so the first element of the array has to be (0 - 18) mod 256 = 238, where a mod b is the remainder of division of a by b.
Program:
```
table = {'>': 8, '<': 9, '+': 10, '-': 11, '.': 12, ',': 13, '[': 14, ']': 15}
input = sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()
prev = 0
for c in input:
    s = '{0:0>{1}}'.format(bin(ord(c))[2:], 8)
    binary = s[::-1]
    integer = int(binary, 2)
    print(prev - integer) % 256
    prev = integer
```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
