To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step.

### Problem Description Breakdown:
1. For the first character, the previous printed character's binary representation is considered to be `0`.
2. The ASCII code of the previous character is reversed, and the i-th element is subtracted from this reversed value modulo `256`.
3. The result is then reversed again to produce the ASCII code for the current character.

### Program Analysis:
```python
table = {'>': 8, '<': 9, '+': 10, '-': 11, '.': 12, ',': 13, '[': 14, ']': 15}
input = sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()
prev = 0
for c in input:
    s = '{0:0>{1}}'.format(bin(ord(c))[2:], 8)
    binary = s[::-1]
    integer = int(binary, 2)
    print(prev - integer) % 256
    prev = integer
```
1. The program reads an input string.
2. It initializes `prev` to `0`.
3. For each character `c` in the input string:
   - It calculates the binary representation of the ASCII value of `c`, reverses it, and converts it to an integer.
   - It subtracts this integer from `prev` and prints the result modulo `256`.
   - Then it updates `prev` to this new integer value.

### Issues in the Code:
1. The expression `print(prev - integer) % 256` is incorrect because of operator precedence. The modulo is applied to the print statement, not to the result of the subtraction. This means that it will print `prev - integer` and then take the result of that entire expression modulo `256`, which will not yield the intended output.

2. The modulo operation should be applied to the result of `prev - integer` before it is printed. Specifically, it should be `print((prev - integer) % 256)` to ensure that the result is correctly calculated before being printed.

### Test Case:
For example, consider the case where `input` is "H":
- The ASCII code for "H" is `72`.
- The reversed binary of `72` is `00010010`, which converts to `18`.
- The initial calculation should be `(0 - 18) % 256`, which equals `238`.

However, due to the operator precedence issue, the code will output `prev - integer` without the correct modulo application.

### Conclusion:
Due to the incorrect application of modulo in the print statement, the program fails to meet the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **False**.
