Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement for calculating the array of unsigned 8-bit integers. Specifically, the issue lies in the line where the integer is printed:

```python
print(prev - integer) % 256
```

This line does not correctly apply the modulo operation to the result of the subtraction before printing. Instead, the expression is evaluated as:

```python
print(prev - integer)  # This prints the result of prev - integer
```
followed by the modulo operation, which does not affect the printed output. It should be:

```python
print((prev - integer) % 256)
```

as the modulo operation needs to be applied to the result of the subtraction in order to ensure the output is within the range of 0 to 255, as required for 8-bit integers.

Additionally, the program uses `sys.stdin.readline()` for input but does not import the `sys` module, which would lead to an error if run.

To illustrate the failure, consider the input "H". The expected output would be `238`, but due to the incorrect print statement, the output may not be what is expected based on the algorithm described.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
