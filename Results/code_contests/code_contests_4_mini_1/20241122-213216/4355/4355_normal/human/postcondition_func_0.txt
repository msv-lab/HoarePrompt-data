The function reads a line of input from standard input, processes each character by converting it to its binary representation, and calculates the difference between the integer values of consecutive characters. It prints the difference modulo 256 for each character, starting with a previous value initialized to 0. If the input is empty, no processing occurs, and the function effectively does nothing. The function does not accept parameters and does not return a value.
