According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `input` string. The loop will iterate over each character in `input`. At the end of the last iteration, `input` has at least 2 characters, and `c` is the second character of `input`. For the loop to execute one more time, `input` must have at least 3 characters and `c` needs to be updated to the third character in the `input` string.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `input` must have at least 3 characters.
- `c` must be updated to the third character of `input`.

State: **`text` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `table` is {'>': 8, '<': 9, '+': 10, '-': 11, '.': 12, ',': 13, '[': 14, ']': 15}, `input` is a string with at least 3 characters, `c` is the third character of `input`, `prev` is now equal to `integer`, `s` is the 8-bit binary representation of the Unicode code point of `c`, `binary` is the reverse of `s`, and `integer` is the integer representation of `binary`.**
