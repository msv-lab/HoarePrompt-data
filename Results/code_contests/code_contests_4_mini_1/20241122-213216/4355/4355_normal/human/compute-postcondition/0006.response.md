The value of `binary` is used to create an integer by interpreting it as a binary number. The `int` function with base 2 converts the reversed binary string `binary` into its corresponding integer value. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `text` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `table` is {'>': 8, '<': 9, '+': 10, '-': 11, '.': 12, ',': 13, '[': 14, ']': 15}, `input` is a string with at least 1 character, `c` is the first character of `input`, `prev` is 0, `s` is the binary representation of the Unicode code point of `c` padded to 8 bits, `binary` is the reverse of `s`, and `integer` is the integer value of `binary`.
