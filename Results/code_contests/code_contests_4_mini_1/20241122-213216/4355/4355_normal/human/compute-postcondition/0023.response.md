The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It is designed to work with a string `text` that is expected to contain between 1 and 100 characters, where each character has an ASCII code ranging from 32 (space) to 126 (tilde), inclusive. The output of the function is unspecified in the provided information, so we cannot determine the specific return values. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to handle a string input that meets certain criteria regarding length and character ASCII values.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and is intended to process a string `text` containing between 1 and 100 valid ASCII characters. The specific return value is not provided.**
