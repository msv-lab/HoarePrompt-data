To determine the output state based on the provided initial state and code, let's analyze the given information:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `text` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters.
   - `table` is {'>': 8, '<': 9, '+': 10, '-': 11, '.': 12, ',': 13, '[': 14, ']': 15}.
   - `input` is a string with at least 3 characters.
   - `c` is the third character of `input`.
   - `prev` is now equal to `integer`.
   - `s` is the 8-bit binary representation of `c`.
   - `binary` is the reverse of `s`.
   - `integer` is now the integer representation of `binary`.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The code `print(prev - integer) % 256` calculates the difference between `prev` and `integer`, followed by taking the result modulo 256.

3. **Outputs**:
   - The actual values of `prev` and `integer` are not specified, but we know their relationship from the initial state (`prev` equals `integer`).
   - Thus, `prev - integer` will be `0` since they are equal.
   - The final output of `0 % 256` will still be `0`.

Given that the output of the print statement does not affect the state of the variables, the output state remains as follows:

Output State: **`text` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `table` is {'>': 8, '<': 9, '+': 10, '-': 11, '.': 12, ',': 13, '[': 14, ']': 15}, `input` is a string with at least 3 characters, `c` is the third character of `input`, `prev` is now equal to `integer`, `s` is the 8-bit binary representation of `c`, `binary` is the reverse of `s`, `integer` is now the integer representation of `binary`, and the output of the print statement is 0.**
