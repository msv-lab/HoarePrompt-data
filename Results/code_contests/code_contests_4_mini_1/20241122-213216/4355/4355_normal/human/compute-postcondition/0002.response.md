The variable `prev` is initialized and assigned the value of `0`. The initial values of `text`, `table`, and `input` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is: `text` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `table` is {'>': 8, '<': 9, '+': 10, '-': 11, '.': 12, ',': 13, '[': 14, ']': 15}, `input` is a string from standard input with trailing whitespace removed, and `prev` is 0.
