The line of code assigns the value of `sys.stdin.readline().rstrip()` to the variable `input`. The `input` function reads a line from standard input and removes any trailing whitespace. The previous state of the variable `text` is not affected, and we do not know the exact value that will be assigned to `input` as it depends on user input.

Output State: **`text` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, where each character has an ASCII code between 32 (space) and 126 (tilde), inclusive; `table` is {'>': 8, '<': 9, '+': 10, '-': 11, '.': 12, ',': 13, '[': 14, ']': 15}; `input` is a string from standard input with trailing whitespace removed.**
