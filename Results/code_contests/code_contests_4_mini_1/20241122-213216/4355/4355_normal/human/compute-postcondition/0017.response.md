The variable `binary` is assigned the value of the reverse of `s`. The initial state specifies that `s` is the 8-bit binary representation of the Unicode code point of `c`, so reversing `s` will change the order of the bits in `binary`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `text` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `table` is {'>': 8, '<': 9, '+': 10, '-': 11, '.': 12, ',': 13, '[': 14, ']': 15}, `input` is a string with at least 3 characters, `c` is the third character of `input`, `prev` is now equal to `integer`, `s` is the original 8-bit binary representation of `c`, `binary` is the reverse of `s`, and `integer` is the integer representation of `binary`.
