The variable `prev` is assigned the value of `integer`. The value of `integer` is based on the binary representation of the reversed Unicode code point of the first character of `input`, which is `c`. Since `prev` is simply being updated to hold the same value as `integer`, the output state will reflect this change.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `text` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `table` is {'>': 8, '<': 9, '+': 10, '-': 11, '.': 12, ',': 13, '[': 14, ']': 15}, `input` is a string with at least 1 character, `c` is the first character of `input`, `prev` is equal to `integer`, `s` is the binary representation of the Unicode code point of `c` padded to 8 bits, `binary` is the reverse of `s`, and `integer` is the integer value of `binary`.
