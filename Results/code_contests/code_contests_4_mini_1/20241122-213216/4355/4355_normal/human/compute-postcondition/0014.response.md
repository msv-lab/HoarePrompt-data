The code assigns the value of `integer` to `prev`. The value of `prev` was previously the integer value of `c`, and since `prev` is now equal to `integer`, the original value of `prev` is replaced. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `text` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `table` is {'>': 8, '<': 9, '+': 10, '-': 11, '.': 12, ',': 13, '[': 14, ']': 15}, `input` is a string with at least 2 characters, `c` is the second character of `input`, `prev` is now equal to `integer`, `s` is the 8-bit binary representation of the Unicode code point of `c`, `binary` is the reverse of `s`, and `integer` is the integer representation of `binary`.
