The variable `s` is a string representing the 8-bit binary representation of the Unicode code point of `c`. The code `s[::-1]` reverses the string `s`. The value of `binary` will be the reverse of `s`. Since `s` contains 8 bits, `binary` will also contain 8 bits but in reverse order.

Therefore, the output state is: `text` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `table` is {'>': 8, '<': 9, '+': 10, '-': 11, '.': 12, ',': 13, '[': 14, ']': 15}, `input` is a string with at least 2 characters, `c` is the second character of `input`, `prev` is equal to the integer value of the new character, `s` is the 8-bit binary representation of the Unicode code point of `c`, and `binary` is the reverse of `s`.
