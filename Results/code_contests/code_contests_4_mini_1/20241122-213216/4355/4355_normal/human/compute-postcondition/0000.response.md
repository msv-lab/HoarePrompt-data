The code initializes a dictionary called `table` with specific key-value pairs. The initial state of the variable `text` remains unaffected by this code snippet, as the dictionary assignment does not depend on it. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged state of `text` along with the new state of the `table` variable.

Output State: **`text` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, where each character has an ASCII code between 32 (space) and 126 (tilde), inclusive; `table` is {'>': 8, '<': 9, '+': 10, '-': 11, '.': 12, ',': 13, '[': 14, ']': 15}**
