The variable `s` holds the binary representation of the Unicode code point of `c`, which is padded to 8 bits. The operation `s[::-1]` reverses the string `s`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `text` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `table` is {'>': 8, '<': 9, '+': 10, '-': 11, '.': 12, ',': 13, '[': 14, ']': 15}, `input` is a string with at least 1 character, `c` is the first character of `input`, `prev` is 0, `s` is the binary representation of the Unicode code point of `c` padded to 8 bits, and `binary` is the reverse of `s`.
