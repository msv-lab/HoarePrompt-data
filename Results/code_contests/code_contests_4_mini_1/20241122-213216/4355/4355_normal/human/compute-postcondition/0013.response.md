To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided code snippet and the initial state of the variables.

1. **Initial State:**
   - `text` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters.
   - `table` is `{'>': 8, '<': 9, '+': 10, '-': 11, '.': 12, ',': 13, '[': 14, ']': 15}`.
   - `input` is a string with at least 2 characters.
   - `c` is the second character of `input`.
   - `prev` is equal to the integer value of the new character (which is `c`).
   - `s` is the 8-bit binary representation of the Unicode code point of `c`.
   - `binary` is the reverse of `s`.
   - `integer` is the integer representation of `binary`.

2. **Execution of the Code:**
   - The code calculates `prev - integer` and takes the result modulo 256.

3. **Calculations:**
   - Since `prev` is the integer value of `c`, we denote it as `unicode_value_of_c`.
   - `s` is the binary representation of `unicode_value_of_c` in 8 bits.
   - `binary` is the reverse of `s`.
   - `integer` converts `binary` back to an integer.

4. **Final Calculation:**
   - The output is `print(prev - integer) % 256`, simplifying to `(unicode_value_of_c - integer) % 256`.

As we do not have specific values for `input`, `c`, `prev`, `s`, `binary`, and `integer`, the output state will represent the relationships and calculations involved.

Output State: **`text` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `table` is {'>': 8, '<': 9, '+': 10, '-': 11, '.': 12, ',': 13, '[': 14, ']': 15}, `input` is a string with at least 2 characters, `c` is the second character of `input`, `prev` is the integer value of `c`, `s` is the 8-bit binary representation of the Unicode code point of `c`, `binary` is the reverse of `s`, `integer` is the integer representation of `binary`, and the result of `(prev - integer) % 256` is computed.`
