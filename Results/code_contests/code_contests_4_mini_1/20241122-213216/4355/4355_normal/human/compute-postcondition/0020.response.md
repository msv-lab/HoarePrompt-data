The variable `prev` is assigned the value of `integer`, which is the integer representation of the reversed binary string `s`. The previous value of `prev` is not provided, but it will now hold the value of `integer`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `text` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `table` is {'>': 8, '<': 9, '+': 10, '-': 11, '.': 12, ',': 13, '[': 14, ']': 15}, `input` is a string with at least 3 characters, `c` is the third character of `input`, `prev` is now equal to `integer`, `s` is the 8-bit binary representation of `c`, `binary` is the reverse of `s`, `integer` is now the integer representation of `binary`, and the output of the print statement is 0.
