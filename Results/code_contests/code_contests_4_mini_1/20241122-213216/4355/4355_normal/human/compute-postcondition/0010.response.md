The variable `s` is assigned a formatted string that represents the binary representation of the Unicode code point of the character `c`, padded to 8 bits. The value of `c` is the second character of `input`, and `ord(c)` gives the Unicode code point of `c`. The `bin()` function converts this code point to binary, and the `format()` method ensures it is 8 bits long.

The previous values of the affected variables are:
- `c` is the second character of `input`
- `s` is initially undefined but will be assigned the new formatted binary string.

Since `s` is being assigned a new value based on the character `c`, its final value will depend on the Unicode code point of `c`, represented in an 8-bit binary format.

Therefore, the output state is:
`text` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `table` is {'>': 8, '<': 9, '+': 10, '-': 11, '.': 12, ',': 13, '[': 14, ']': 15}, `input` is a string with at least 2 characters, `c` is the second character of `input`, `prev` is equal to the integer value of the new character, `s` is the 8-bit binary representation of the Unicode code point of `c`.

Output State: **`text` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `table` is {'>': 8, '<': 9, '+': 10, '-': 11, '.': 12, ',': 13, '[': 14, ']': 15}, `input` is a string with at least 2 characters, `c` is the second character of `input`, `prev` is equal to the integer value of the new character, `s` is the 8-bit binary representation of the Unicode code point of `c`.**
