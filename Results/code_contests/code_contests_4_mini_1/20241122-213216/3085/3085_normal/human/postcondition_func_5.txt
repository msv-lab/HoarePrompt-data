The function accepts a list `BITree` and an integer `index`. It calculates and returns the total accumulation of values from the `BITree` list starting from the given `index` and moving to its ancestors (using the binary indexed tree logic) until `index` becomes 0. If the initial `index` is 0 or negative, it returns 0 without any accumulation.
