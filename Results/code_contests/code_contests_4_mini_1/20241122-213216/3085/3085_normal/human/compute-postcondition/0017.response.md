The statement `ans[i - 1] = k` assigns the value of `k` to the index `i - 1` of the list `ans`. Given that `i` is `2 * k - n`, this means the index being updated is calculated as `2 * k - n - 1`.

The variable `ans` is a range from 1 to `k`, and since `k` is an integer, `ans` can hold at least `k` values. The other variables are not directly affected by this assignment.

Thus, the output state reflects that `ans` has been updated at the index calculated from `i`. The previous value of `ans[k - 1]` was updated to `i`, but now it is being updated to `k`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is greater than `k`, `k` is an integer, `a[k - 1]` is `2 * k - n`, `maxInv` is assigned the result of `func_8(a, n)`, `i` is `2 * k - n`, `a[k]` is `k`, `curInv` is assigned the result of `func_8(a, n)`, `curInv` is less than or equal to `maxInv`, `ans` is updated at `i - 1` to `k`.**
