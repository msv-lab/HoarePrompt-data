Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters but relies on the output of `func_2()` to obtain values for `n` and `k`. It returns a range of integers based on the values of `n` and `k`. Specifically, if `n` equals `k`, it returns the range [1, 2, ..., k]. If `n` equals `k + 1`, it returns the range [1, 2, ..., k - 2] followed by `k` and `k - 1`. If `n` is greater than `k`, it attempts to construct a modified array based on specific conditions, potentially returning a modified version of the range [1, 2, ..., k] if certain criteria are met. If none of these conditions are satisfied, the function does not return any value. Additionally, if `n` is less than `k`, no value is returned as well.**
