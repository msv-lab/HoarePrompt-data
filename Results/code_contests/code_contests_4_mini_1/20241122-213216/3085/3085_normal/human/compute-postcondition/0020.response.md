According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the value of `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at its current value, which is calculated as `2 * k - n`. Additionally, `n` is greater than `k`, so we can infer that `2 * k - n` could be negative or zero depending on the values of `k` and `n`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to remain less than `k`. Since `n` is greater than `k`, we know `2 * k - n` will be strictly less than `k` if `k` is a positive integer, allowing the loop to run at least once. 

However, for the loop to run again, `i` must be incremented to `i + 1` in the next iteration. Therefore, we need to set `i` to `2 * k - n + 1` to allow for this increment to happen.

Thus, we need to adjust the state such that `i` is now `2 * k - n + 1`. No other states need to be adjusted since `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unaffected by the loop conditions.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is greater than `k`, `k` is an integer, `i` is `2 * k - n + 1`**
