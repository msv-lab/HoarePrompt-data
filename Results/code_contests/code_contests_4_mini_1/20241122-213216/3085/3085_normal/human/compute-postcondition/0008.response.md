To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we analyze the function call to `func_8(a, n)` where `a` is a list of integers constructed based on the values of `k` and the constraints given for `n`.

However, we do not have the implementation details of `func_8`, so we cannot compute its specific output. We can only acknowledge that it processes the list `a` and the integer `n`.

The initial state includes:
- `t`: a positive integer (number of test cases)
- `n`: an integer such that `k ≤ n < 2k`
- `k`: an integer
- `a`: a list that is constructed from integers ranging from `1` to `k` followed by integers from `k - 1` to `2*k - n - 1` in descending order.

Since we cannot determine the return value of `func_8`, we will describe the state without knowing its outcome.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, `n` and `k` are integers such that `k ≤ n < 2k`, `a` is assigned a range of integers from 1 to `k`, followed by integers from `k - 1` to `2*k - n - 1` in descending order, and `maxInv` is assigned the result of `func_8(a, n)`**.
