Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `n` is greater than `k`, `k` is an integer, `a[k - 1]` is `2 * k - n`, `maxInv` is assigned the result of `func_8(a, n)`, `i` is `2 * k - n`, `a[k]` is `k`, `curInv` is assigned the result of `func_8(a, n)`, and `curInv` is less than or equal to `maxInv`.***
