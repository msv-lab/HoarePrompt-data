Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `n` is greater than `k`, and `k` is an integer. If `curInv` is less than or equal to `maxInv`, the function returns an array `ans` containing the integers from 1 to `k`, where the value at index `k - 1` is updated to `i` and the value at index `i - 1` is updated to `k`. If `curInv` exceeds `maxInv`, the function does not return anything.***
