Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is greater than `k`, `k` is an integer, and `i` varies from `2 * k - n` to `k - 1`. If the loop executes, `ans` is an array containing integers from 1 to `k`, with modifications at indices `k - 1` and `i - 1`. If `curInv` is less than or equal to `maxInv`, `ans` is returned; otherwise, nothing is returned. If `n` is equal to `k`, the loop doesn't execute, and `a` remains unchanged. If `n` is less than `k`, the loop doesn't execute, `a` remains unchanged, and no value is returned.**
