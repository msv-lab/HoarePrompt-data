The variable `ans` is assigned the value of `range(1, k + 1)`, which generates a range object containing integers from 1 to `k` (inclusive of 1 and exclusive of `k + 1`). The previous values of the affected variables are `t` (a positive integer), `n` (greater than `k`), `k` (an integer), `a[k - 1]` (equal to `2 * k - n`), `maxInv` (result of `func_8(a, n)`), `i` (equal to `2 * k - n`), `a[k]` (equal to `k`), and `curInv` (result of `func_8(a, n)` and less than or equal to `maxInv`). Other variables are not affected by this assignment.

Since `ans` now represents a range of integers from 1 to `k`, the output state reflects this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is greater than `k`, `k` is an integer, `a[k - 1]` is `2 * k - n`, `maxInv` is assigned the result of `func_8(a, n)`, `i` is `2 * k - n`, `a[k]` is `k`, `curInv` is assigned the result of `func_8(a, n)`, `curInv` is less than or equal to `maxInv`, and `ans` is the range from 1 to `k`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is greater than `k`, `k` is an integer, `a[k - 1]` is `2 * k - n`, `maxInv` is assigned the result of `func_8(a, n)`, `i` is `2 * k - n`, `a[k]` is `k`, `curInv` is assigned the result of `func_8(a, n)`, `curInv` is less than or equal to `maxInv`, and `ans` is the range from 1 to `k`.**
