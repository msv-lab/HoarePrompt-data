The value of `a[k - 2]` is assigned the value of `k`. The previous value of `a[k - 2]` is unknown, but `k` is an integer. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `maxInv`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the update to the array `a` at the specified index.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is greater than `k`, `k` is an integer, `a[k - 1]` is `2 * k - n`, `maxInv` is assigned the result of `func_8(a, n)`, `i` is `2 * k - n`, and `a[k - 2]` is `k`.**
