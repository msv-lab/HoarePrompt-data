The code assigns the value of `i` to `a[k - 1]`. The variable `i` is calculated as `2 * k - n + 2`. Given the initial state, `n` is greater than `k + 1`, which means `n` is at least `k + 2`. Therefore, `i` will be computed using the specific values of `k` and `n`. 

The variable `a` is an array with at least `k` elements, as it is being indexed by `k - 1`. 

So, the output state will reflect the assignment of `i` to `a[k - 1]`. 

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is greater than `k + 1`, `k` is an integer, `i` is `2 * k - n + 2`, and `a[k - 1]` is assigned the value of `i`.**
