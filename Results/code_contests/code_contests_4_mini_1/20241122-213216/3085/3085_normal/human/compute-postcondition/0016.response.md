The value of `ans[k - 1]` is assigned the value of `i`, where `i` is `2 * k - n`. The variable `ans` is an array or list with at least `k` elements, and the previous value of `ans[k - 1]` is updated to `i`. The other variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `maxInv`, `curInv`, and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `ans[k - 1]` and retains the previous states of the other variables.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is greater than `k`, `k` is an integer, `a[k - 1]` is `2 * k - n`, `maxInv` is assigned the result of `func_8(a, n)`, `i` is `2 * k - n`, `a[k]` is `k`, `curInv` is assigned the result of `func_8(a, n)`, `curInv` is less than or equal to `maxInv`, `ans` is the range from 1 to `k`, and `ans[k - 1]` is updated to `i`.**
