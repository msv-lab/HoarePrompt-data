The function `func_9` accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `k`. Here are the details of the functionality based on the output cases:

Case 1: When `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, `n` and `k` are integers such that `k ≤ n < 2k` and `1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5`. If `n` is equal to `k`, the function returns a range of integers from 1 to `k`, which is [1, 2, ..., k]. If `n` is not equal to `k`, no value is returned from the function.

Case 2: If `n` is equal to `k + 1`, the function returns a range of integers from 1 to `k - 2`, followed by `k` and `k - 1`. If `n` is equal to `k`, no value is returned from the function. For any other value of `n`, no value is returned as well.

Case 3: When `n` is greater than `k`, the function checks for a loop that varies `i` from `2 * k - n` to `k - 1`. If the loop executes, `ans` is an array containing integers from 1 to `k`, with modifications at indices `k - 1` and `i - 1`. If a certain condition regarding `curInv` is met, `ans` is returned; otherwise, nothing is returned. If `n` is equal to `k`, the loop doesn't execute, and `ans` remains unchanged. If `n` is less than `k`, the loop doesn't execute, and no value is returned.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_9` is to accept three parameters `t`, `n`, and `k`, and returns a specific range of integers or an array based on the values of `n` and `k` under certain conditions. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters t, n, and k. It returns a range of integers based on the values of n and k. If n equals k, it returns [1, 2, ..., k]. If n equals k + 1, it returns [1, 2, ..., k - 2, k, k - 1]. If n is greater than k, it may return an array based on specific conditions. If n is less than or not equal to k, no value is returned.**
