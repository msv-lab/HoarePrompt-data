The statement `a[k - 1] = i` assigns the value of `i` to the `k - 1` index of the array `a`. The variable `i` is calculated as `2 * k - n + 1`. Given that `n` is greater than `k`, `i` will be a specific integer value based on the relationship between `k` and `n`. Other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`) remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by this assignment. 

Therefore, the output state reflects the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and the assigned value of `i`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is greater than `k`, `k` is an integer, `i` is `2 * k - n + 1`, and `a[k - 1]` is assigned the value of `i`.**
