The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `n`, which is the length of the list. It calculates and returns the total inversion count of `arr`, which represents the number of pairs (i, j) such that i < j and arr[i] > arr[j]. If `n` is less than or equal to 0, the function returns 0 as the inversion count.
