You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those output hints describes certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.


Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_divisible(number1, number2):
    if number1 % number2 == 0:
        return True
''' 

Output hints for function1:  The function accepts 2 numbers as input, if number 1 is divisible than number2 then the function returns True.
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if is_divisible(n,i):
            return True
    return False
''' 

Output hints for function 2:  The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation: The program initially seems to do what the description says. Lets see if the hints also agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the program is incorrect. The output hints seem to agree with the program code and from their contents they reenforce our reasoning that the code is correct.
The function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints for function number 1 : The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The function initially seems to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the code is incorrec. Indeed they agree with the code and they show that the code might not always follow the program description. The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.


# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to find the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string.

Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def get_list_size(list):
    return len(list)
''' 

Output hint for function1:  The function accepts a string and returns the size of that string
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def find_Rotations(str1):
    n = get_list_size(str1)
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if str1[i:] + str1[:i] == str1:
            return i
''' 

Output hint for function 2: If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value and the variable n remains unchanged, holding the length of the string str1. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer i such that 0 < i < n, where n is the length of the string str1, and i represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. If no such rotation exists, then the function does not return a value.

Example Answer 3:
Explanation: The code initially does not seem to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and reenforce our belief that the code is incorrect. The hints do seem to agree with the code and they also show that the code does not always follow the program description. If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value, and the variable `n` remains unchanged, holding the length of the string `str1`. This behavior is correct as the specification states that the rotation count must be greater than 0. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer `i` such that `0 < i < n`, where `n` is the length of the string `str1`. The value `i` represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. However, the code iterates from `1` to `n-1`, meaning it does not include `n`. This omission is problematic because it fails to check the complete rotation case, where `i` could be equal to `n`. Consequently, the function does not meet the specification as it should return the rotation count up to `n` times. Therefore, it does not meet the specification.

Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You have a sequence a with n elements 1, 2, 3, ..., k - 1, k, k - 1, k - 2, ..., k - (n - k) (k ≤ n < 2k).

Let's call as inversion in a a pair of indices i < j such that a[i] > a[j].

Suppose, you have some permutation p of size k and you build a sequence b of size n in the following manner: b[i] = p[a[i]].

Your goal is to find such permutation p that the total number of inversions in b doesn't exceed the total number of inversions in a, and b is lexicographically maximum.

Small reminder: the sequence of k integers is called a permutation if it contains all integers from 1 to k exactly once.

Another small reminder: a sequence s is lexicographically smaller than another sequence t, if either s is a prefix of t, or for the first i such that s_i ≠ t_i, s_i < t_i holds (in the first position that these sequences are different, s has smaller number than t).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (k ≤ n < 2k; 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5) — the length of the sequence a and its maximum.

It's guaranteed that the total sum of k over test cases doesn't exceed 10^5.

Output

For each test case, print k integers — the permutation p which maximizes b lexicographically without increasing the total number of inversions.

It can be proven that p exists and is unique.

Example

Input


4
1 1
2 2
3 2
4 3


Output


1 
1 2 
2 1 
1 3 2 

Note

In the first test case, the sequence a = [1], there is only one permutation p = [1].

In the second test case, the sequence a = [1, 2]. There is no inversion in a, so there is only one permutation p = [1, 2] which doesn't increase the number of inversions.

In the third test case, a = [1, 2, 1] and has 1 inversion. If we use p = [2, 1], then b = [p[a[1]], p[a[2]], p[a[3]]] = [2, 1, 2] and also has 1 inversion.

In the fourth test case, a = [1, 2, 3, 2], and since p = [1, 3, 2] then b = [1, 3, 2, 3]. Both a and b have 1 inversion and b is the lexicographically maximum.
Functions with output description for each function:
Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return int(input())
''' 

 Output decription for function1:  The function accepts no parameters and prompts the user for input, returning the input as a positive integer. It does not handle cases where the user might input a non-integer value or a negative integer, which could lead to runtime errors.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
''' 

 Output decription for function2:  The function accepts a single line of input consisting of integers separated by spaces, converts them to integers, and returns them as a list. It does not handle any errors that may arise from invalid input (such as non-integer values) and will raise an exception if the input cannot be converted to integers.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    s = input()
    return list(s[:len(s) - 1])
''' 

 Output decription for function3:  The function accepts no parameters and reads a string input from the user. It returns a list of characters from that input string, excluding the last character. If the input string is empty, it returns an empty list.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4():
    s = input()
    return s[:len(s) - 1]
''' 

 Output decription for function4:  The function accepts no parameters, prompts the user for input, and returns the input string with the last character removed. If the input string is empty, it will return an empty string.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5(l):
    print(' '.join(map(str, l)))
''' 

 Output decription for function5:  The function accepts a list `l` and prints the string representation of each element in the list, separating them by spaces. The function does not return any values and does not process any tuples or integers as indicated in the annotations.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6(BITree, index):
    sum = 0
    while index > 0:
        sum += BITree[index]
        index -= index & -index
    return sum
''' 

 Output decription for function6:  The function accepts a list `BITree` and an integer `index`. It calculates and returns the total accumulation of values from the `BITree` list starting from the given `index` and moving to its ancestors (using the binary indexed tree logic) until `index` becomes 0. If the initial `index` is 0 or negative, it returns 0 without any accumulation.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7(BITree, n, index, val):
    while index <= n:
        BITree[index] += val
        index += index & -index
''' 

 Output decription for function7:  The function accepts a binary indexed tree (BITree), an integer n, an integer index, and an integer val. It updates the BITree by adding val to the elements starting from the specified index and continuing until the index exceeds n. If the initial index is greater than n, the BITree remains unchanged.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_8(arr, n):
    invcount = 0
    maxElement = max(arr)
    BIT = [0] * (maxElement + 1)

        invcount += func_6(BIT, arr[i] - 1)
        func_7(BIT, maxElement, arr[i], 1)
    return invcount
''' 

 Output decription for function8:  The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `n`, which is the length of the list. It calculates and returns the total inversion count of `arr`, which represents the number of pairs (i, j) such that i < j and arr[i] > arr[j]. If `n` is less than or equal to 0, the function returns 0 as the inversion count.
Function number 9 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_9():
    (n, k) = func_2()
    if n == k:
        return range(1, k + 1)
    if n == k + 1:
        return range(1, k + 1 - 2) + [k, k - 1]

    if testing:
        sys.stdout = cmd
        print(int(round(time() * 1000)) - start_time)
''' 

 Output decription for function9:  The function accepts no parameters but relies on the output of `func_2()` to obtain values for `n` and `k`. It returns a range of integers based on the values of `n` and `k`. Specifically, if `n` equals `k`, it returns the range [1, 2, ..., k]. If `n` equals `k + 1`, it returns the range [1, 2, ..., k - 2] followed by `k` and `k - 1`. If `n` is greater than `k`, it attempts to construct a modified array based on specific conditions, potentially returning a modified version of the range [1, 2, ..., k] if certain criteria are met. If none of these conditions are satisfied, the function does not return any value. Additionally, if `n` is less than `k`, no value is returned as well.



First I want you to try to see if the program (including all the functions) does what the description says. Look at only the code and the description and make an initial assesment.Try to think of any edge cases that the code might not be handling.

Then I want you to see if the output hints agree with the code. Sometimes the output hints hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the output hints says are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to make a more informed decision and detrmine if the code is correct or not.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code.
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
