The function accepts a Binary Indexed Tree (BITree), an integer `n` representing the size of the tree, an integer `index` for the position to update, and an integer `val` which will be added to `BITree[index]`. It continuously updates the tree at `index` and subsequent indices determined by the lowest set bit of `index`, until `index` exceeds `n`. If `index` starts greater than `n`, no updates are made.
