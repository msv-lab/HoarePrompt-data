The function `func_8` accepts an array `arr` and an integer `n`, which represents the number of elements in `arr`. It calculates and returns the total number of inversions in the array, where an inversion is defined as a pair of indices (i, j) such that i < j and arr[i] > arr[j]. If `n` is 0 or less, the function will return 0 since there are no elements to compare. Additionally, if `arr` is empty or contains negative values, the behavior of the inversion count may not be defined, but the function will still return 0 in such cases. The overall outcome is that the function reliably counts inversions for valid input arrays while gracefully handling edge cases.
