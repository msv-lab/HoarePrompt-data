Output State: **If `t` is at least 1 and `n` and `k` satisfy the condition `k â‰¤ n < 2k`, the loop will execute at least once, and `curInv` will be the result of `func_8(a, n)`. If `curInv` is less than or equal to `maxInv`, the function will return a range object from 1 to `k`, where the `k`-th element is set to `i` and the `i`-th element is set to `k`. If `curInv` is greater than `maxInv`, the loop may execute multiple times until the condition is met or until `i` reaches `k - 1`. If `k` is less than or equal to `2 * k - n`, the loop will not execute, and `a` and `curInv` will remain unchanged, with `ans` undefined.**
