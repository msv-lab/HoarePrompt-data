The function `func_9` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `k`. Here, `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and `n` and `k` are integers such that `k ≤ n < 2k` and `1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5`. 

The function has several cases for returning values:

**Case 1**: If `n` equals `k`, the function returns a range object containing the numbers from 1 to `k` (inclusive). If `n` is not equal to `k`, it does not return any value (implicitly returns None).

**Case 2**: If `n` equals `k + 1`, the function returns a range object containing the integers from 1 to `k - 2`, followed by the integers `k` and `k - 1`. If `n` is equal to `k`, it returns a range object containing the numbers from 1 to `k` (inclusive). If `n` is neither `k` nor `k + 1`, it does not return any value and implicitly returns None.

**Case 3**: If `t` is at least 1 and `n` and `k` satisfy the condition `k ≤ n < 2k`, the function may return a range object from 1 to `k`, where the `k`-th element is set to `i` and the `i`-th element is set to `k` if `curInv` is less than or equal to `maxInv`. If `curInv` is greater than `maxInv`, the loop may execute multiple times until the condition is met or until `i` reaches `k - 1`. If `k` is less than or equal to `2 * k - n`, the loop will not execute, and `a` and `curInv` will remain unchanged, with `ans` undefined.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `k`. It returns a range object under certain conditions based on the values of `n` and `k`, or implicitly returns None if no conditions are met.**
