You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for describing the functionality of a Python function. You will be provided with the constraints and relationships between the input parameters, as well as the resulting output of the function based on these inputs. Your task is to organize this information and describe the functionality of the function. Please avoid describing how the function operates or details such as how local variables are initialized—only describe what parameters the function accepts and what it returns. If there are multiple return points in the function we will split them in Cases with an arithmetic counter and remember if one case is fullfilled none of the others are. You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: **functionality**.


Example1:
Parameter constraints and relationships: `number` is an integer.
```
def func(number):
```
Output: `number` is an integer. If `number` is even, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer1:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `number`. `number` is an integer. After executing the function body, if number is even, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `number`, and if `number` is even, it returns True. If `number` is not even, it returns False.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter number, returns `True` if `number` is even. If `number` is not even, it returns `False`.**


Parameter constraints and relationships: `age` is an integer.
```
def func(age):
```
Output: Case_1:`number` is an integer. If `number` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative; 
        Case_2: `number` is an integer. If `number` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult".
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `age`. `age` is an integer. If `age` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative. If `age` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult". Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `age`  and return if the person is a minor or an adult based on the age while handling wrong negative input values.


Your Task:
Parameter constraints: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that k ≤ n < 2k and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5.
```
def func_9():
```
Output: Case_1: *`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and `n` and `k` are integers such that `k ≤ n < 2k` and `1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5`. If `n` equals `k`, the function returns a range object containing the numbers from 1 to `k` (inclusive). If `n` is not equal to `k`, the function does not return any value (implicitly returns None).

Case_2: *`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and `n` and `k` are integers such that `k ≤ n < 2k` and `1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5`. If `n` equals `k + 1`, the function returns a range object containing the integers from 1 to `k - 2`, followed by the integers `k` and `k - 1`. If `n` is equal to `k`, the function returns a range object containing the numbers from 1 to `k` (inclusive). If `n` is neither `k` nor `k + 1`, the function does not return any value and implicitly returns None.

Case_3: If `t` is at least 1 and `n` and `k` satisfy the condition `k ≤ n < 2k`, the loop will execute at least once, and `curInv` will be the result of `func_8(a, n)`. If `curInv` is less than or equal to `maxInv`, the function will return a range object from 1 to `k`, where the `k`-th element is set to `i` and the `i`-th element is set to `k`. If `curInv` is greater than `maxInv`, the loop may execute multiple times until the condition is met or until `i` reaches `k - 1`. If `k` is less than or equal to `2 * k - n`, the loop will not execute, and `a` and `curInv` will remain unchanged, with `ans` undefined.

Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?
