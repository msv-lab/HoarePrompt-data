According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i`, `k`, and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `k`.

At the end of the last iteration, we have:
- `i` is `2 * k - n + 2`
- `k` is greater than `2 * k - n + 2`

Since `k` is greater than `i`, it implies that the loop could execute again. However, to determine the exact state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `i`.

The next value of `i` that the loop would take on is `i + 1`. Given that the current value of `i` is `2 * k - n + 2`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be updated to `2 * k - n + 3`. 

Additionally, since `k` remains greater than `2 * k - n + 2`, it continues to satisfy the loop condition.

Therefore, the adjusted states should capture the new value of `i` while keeping the others the same. 

State: **`curInv` is the result of `func_8(a, n)`; `i` is `2 * k - n + 3`; `k` is greater than `2 * k - n + 3; a[k - 1]` is assigned the value of `i`.**
