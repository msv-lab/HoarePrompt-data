The variable `ans` is assigned the value `range(1, k + 1)`, which creates a range object starting from 1 up to and including `k`. The values of `a`, `curInv`, and `maxInv` are not affected by this assignment. Thus, the output state reflects the unchanged states of these variables and the new assignment of `ans`.

Output State: **`a` is mutable, `curInv` is the result of `func_8(a, n)`, and `curInv` is less than or equal to `maxInv`; `ans` is a range object from 1 to `k`**
