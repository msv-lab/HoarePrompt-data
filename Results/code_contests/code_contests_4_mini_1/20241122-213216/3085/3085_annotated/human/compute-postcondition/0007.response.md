Output State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases; `n` and `k` are integers such that `k ≤ n < 2k` and `1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5; a` is a range object containing the integers from 1 to `k` (inclusive) concatenated with the integers from `k - 1` to `2 * k - n - 1` in reverse, if `n` equals `k + 1`. If `n` is equal to `k`, `a` is a range object containing the numbers from 1 to `k` (inclusive). If `n` is neither `k` nor `k + 1`, `a` is None.**
