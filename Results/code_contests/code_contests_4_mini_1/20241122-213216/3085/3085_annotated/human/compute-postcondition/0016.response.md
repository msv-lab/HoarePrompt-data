The code assigns the value of `i` to the last element of the `ans` range object, specifically at the index `k - 1`. Since `ans` is a range object from 1 to `k`, it is immutable, which means that while the code attempts to modify it, it will not succeed, and no actual change will occur to `ans`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected from this operation.

Output State: **`a` is mutable, `curInv` is the result of `func_8(a, n)`, and `curInv` is less than or equal to `maxInv`; `ans` is a range object from 1 to `k`, and the attempt to assign `i` to `ans[k - 1]` does not change `ans`.**
