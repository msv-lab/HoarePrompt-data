The value of `ans[i - 1]` is assigned the value `k`. However, since the assignment is made to `ans`, which is a range object, it does not support item assignment or modification. Therefore, the state of `ans` remains unchanged. The other variables `a`, `curInv`, and `maxInv` are not affected by this assignment. 

Output State: **`a` is mutable, `curInv` is the result of `func_8(a, n)` and is less than or equal to `maxInv`, `ans` is a range object from 1 to `k`, and the attempt to assign `i` to `ans[k - 1]` does not change `ans`.**
