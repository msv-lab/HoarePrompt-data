According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `k`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `2 * k - n` and the loop's condition is `i < k`. 

To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to check the current value of `i`:
- If `i` is currently `2 * k - n`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `k`.
- Therefore, we need to adjust the condition such that `i` becomes `2 * k - n + 1` for the next iteration, which would still need to be less than `k`.

This indicates that `k` must be greater than `2 * k - n`, or equivalently, `n` must be less than `k`. So we need to adjust the state to reflect this.

State: **`curInv` is the result of `func_8(a, n)`, if `curInv` is less than or equal to `maxInv`, `i` is `2 * k - n + 1`, and `k` is greater than `2 * k - n + 1`**
