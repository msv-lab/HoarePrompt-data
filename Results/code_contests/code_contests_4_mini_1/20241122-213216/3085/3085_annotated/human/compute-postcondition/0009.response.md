To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the variables involved in the loop statement:

1. The loop condition is `for i in xrange(2 * k - n, k)`. This means that the loop will execute as long as the range defined by `xrange(2 * k - n, k)` produces at least one value.

2. The start of the range is `2 * k - n` and the end is `k`. The loop will execute if `2 * k - n < k`. 

3. Simplifying the condition `2 * k - n < k` gives us:
   - `2 * k - n < k`
   - `2 * k < k + n`
   - `k < n`

   Therefore, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than `k`. Given the constraints `k ≤ n < 2k`, this condition is satisfied if `n` is at least `k + 1`.

4. The starting value of `i` will be `2 * k - n`. If `n` is greater than `k`, then `2 * k - n` will be less than `k`, allowing the loop to execute.

5. The value of `i` will start from `2 * k - n`, which should be calculated based on the current values of `n` and `k`.

Thus, to summarize the states that need to be adjusted:

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is greater than `k`, `k` is an integer such that `k ≤ n < 2k`, `a` is either a range object or None, `i` is `2 * k - n`**
