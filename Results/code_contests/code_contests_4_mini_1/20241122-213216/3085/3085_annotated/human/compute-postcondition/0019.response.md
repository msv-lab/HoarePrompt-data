Postcondition: ***`curInv` is the result of `func_8(a, n)`, and if `curInv` is less than or equal to `maxInv`, the program returns a range object from 1 to `k`, where the `k`-th element of the range is set to `i` and the `i`-th element is set to `k`. If `curInv` is greater than `maxInv`, there is no output from the program.***
