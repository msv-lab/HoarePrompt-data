Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and `n` and `k` are integers such that `k ≤ n < 2k` and `1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5`. If `n` equals `k`, the function returns a range object containing the numbers from 1 to `k` (inclusive). If `n` is not equal to `k`, the function does not return any value (implicitly returns None).***
