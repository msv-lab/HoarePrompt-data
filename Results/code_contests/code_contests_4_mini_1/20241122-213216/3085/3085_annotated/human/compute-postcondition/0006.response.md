Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and `n` and `k` are integers such that `k ≤ n < 2k` and `1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5`. If `n` equals `k + 1`, the function returns a range object containing the integers from 1 to `k - 2`, followed by the integers `k` and `k - 1`. If `n` is equal to `k`, the function returns a range object containing the numbers from 1 to `k` (inclusive). If `n` is neither `k` nor `k + 1`, the function does not return any value and implicitly returns None.***
