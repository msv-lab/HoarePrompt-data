To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program step by step.

### Problem Summary:
- We need to construct a sequence `b` from a permutation `p` of size `k` such that the number of inversions in `b` does not exceed the inversions in `a`, and `b` is lexicographically maximum.
- The sequence `a` is defined based on the parameters `n` and `k`.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads input values for multiple test cases.
  
2. **Sequence Generation**:
   - The program constructs the sequence `a` using the specified rules and then calculates inversions within it.
   - The function `func_9()` is responsible for determining the permutation `p` based on the conditions set in the problem.

3. **Inversion Calculation**:
   - The program employs a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) to count inversions in the sequence `a`, which is efficient for the given constraints.

4. **Constructing the Permutation**:
   - The logic to derive `p` is somewhat complex and relies on adjusting elements of `a` while ensuring that inversions do not exceed the maximum found in the original sequence `a`.

### Potential Edge Cases:
- The program must handle cases where `n` equals `k` and `n` equals `k + 1` correctly.
- The generation of the sequence `a` and the adjustments to derive `p` must maintain the constraints of inversions and lexicographical order.

### Identifying Incorrect Behaviors:
Let's consider a specific case to test:

#### Test Case:
For `n = 4` and `k = 3`, we have:
- `a = [1, 2, 3, 2]`.

The expected result:
- The number of inversions in `a` is 1 (the pair (3,2)).
- To maximize `b` lexicographically, we should have `p = [1, 3, 2]`, leading to `b = [1, 3, 2, 3]`, which also has 1 inversion.

Now, let's see the program output for this particular case:
- The program's logic in `func_9()` needs to construct the correct permutation; if it fails to produce `[1, 3, 2]` or any valid permutations that meet the criteria, then it is incorrect.

Upon examining the code:
- The conditions and logic seem overly complex and may not properly handle all scenarios, particularly with setting and adjusting `a` to derive `p`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not definitively guarantee that it will produce the correct permutation `p` for all edge cases defined by the problem description. Given the complexity of the sequence adjustments, there is a potential for failure in generating the desired permutations under certain conditions.

Thus, based on the analysis and potential issues identified:

Correctness: **False**
