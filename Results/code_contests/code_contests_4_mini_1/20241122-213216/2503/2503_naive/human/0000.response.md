To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the function `func_2()`.

### Breakdown of the Program Logic:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the initial and destination coordinates, the length of the wind direction string, and the string itself.

2. **Edge Case Handling**: 
   - It checks if the starting point is the same as the destination, which is not a valid scenario according to the problem description.

3. **Prefix Sums Calculation**:
   - The program computes the cumulative effect of the wind directions on the ship's movement by maintaining a list of prefix sums for the net movements in the x and y directions.

4. **Distance Calculation**:
   - For each day, it calculates the distance from the current position (after applying the wind's effect) to the destination. 

5. **Determining Minimum Days**:
   - The program attempts to find the minimum number of days required for the ship to reach the destination based on the calculations of the prefix sums and the remaining distances.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Wind Directions Not Fully Accounted**: The program assumes that the cumulative effect from the wind will always allow reaching the destination if the distances allow it. However, there can be cases where the ship cannot reach the destination if the wind direction does not positively contribute to the necessary movements.
   
2. **Movement Infeasibility**: The program does not seem to correctly handle cases where the wind doesn't provide sufficient movement towards the destination due to its periodic nature. For example, if the ship needs to move up but the wind primarily blows down or sideways, it might not reach the destination at all.

### Test Case to Illustrate the Issue:
Consider the following input:
```
0 0
1 1
3
DLL
```
- Starting Position: (0, 0)
- Destination Position: (1, 1)
- Wind Directions: D (Down), L (Left), L (Left)

In this case:
- After the first day (D), position becomes (0, -1).
- After the second day (L), position becomes (-1, -1).
- After the third day (L), position becomes (-2, -1).

The ship cannot reach (1, 1) as it is moving away from the target. The program should output `-1`, indicating that it is impossible to reach the destination. 

### Conclusion:
Given the logic of the program and the identified edge case that it does not correctly handle, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to account for scenarios where the wind directions do not allow the ship to reach the target, leading to potentially misleading outputs.
