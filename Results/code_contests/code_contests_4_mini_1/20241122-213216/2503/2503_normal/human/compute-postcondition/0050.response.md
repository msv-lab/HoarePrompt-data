Postcondition: ***`new_x` is equal to `x1 + pref_sums[i][0]`, `new_y` is equal to `y1 + pref_sums[i][1]`, and `dist` is calculated as `abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - i - 1`. If `dist` is less than or equal to 0, the function prints `i + 1` and returns. If `dist` is greater than 0, the function does not perform any action and continues execution beyond this block.***
