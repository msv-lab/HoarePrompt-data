Postcondition: ***`new_x` is `x1 + r`, `new_y` is `y1 + 1` if the character at index `i` of `s` is not 'D'; if the character at index `i` is 'L', then `r` is set to -1, resulting in `new_x` being `x1 - 1`. If the character at index `i` is 'R', then `r` is set to 1. For any other character at index `i`, `r` remains unchanged, which may affect `new_x` but does not affect `new_y`. The variable `i` remains 1, and `n` is greater than 1, ensuring the index is still valid for subsequent operations on the string `s`. The distance `dist` is calculated as `abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - 1`.***
