The code initializes a list of lists called `pref_sums` with dimensions `n x 2`, where each inner list is initialized to `[0, 0]`. The variable `n` is an input integer, and it defines the number of inner lists created. The values of `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` are not affected by this code. 

The output state reflects the creation of `pref_sums` based on the input value of `n`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `pref_sums` is a list of `n` lists, each containing two zeros.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `pref_sums` is a list of `n` lists, each containing two zeros**
