The variables `u` and `r` are both assigned the value `0`. The initial state of the variables `n` and `pref_sums` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `pref_sums` is a list of `n` lists, each containing two zeros, `u` is 0, `r` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `pref_sums` is a list of `n` lists, each containing two zeros, `u` is 0, `r` is 0**
