To determine the output state, we analyze the provided code snippet and the initial state:

Given:
- If `n` is at least 2, then:
  - `new_x` is equal to `x1 + pref_sums[n-1][0]`
  - `new_y` is equal to `y1 + pref_sums[n-1][1]`
- If `n` is less than or equal to 1, then:
  - `new_x` is still `x1`
  - `new_y` is still `y1`
  - `dist` is calculated as `abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - 1`
  - `min_dist` is unchanged

The calculation for `moves_toward` is:
```
moves_toward = abs(x1 - x2) + abs(y1 - y2) - (abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - n)
```

- **If `n` is at least 2:**
  - `new_x` and `new_y` will be updated based on `pref_sums`.
- **If `n` is less than or equal to 1:**
  - `new_x` will equal `x1` and `new_y` will equal `y1`.
  - `dist` will be calculated.
  - `min_dist` remains unchanged.

Since the initial state mentions conditions based on `n`, we assume both cases need to be considered for clarity.

For the output state, we need to derive `moves_toward` based on the conditions of `n`. 

1. Calculate `abs(x1 - x2) + abs(y1 - y2)`.
2. If `n` is at least 2:
   - Calculate `new_x` and `new_y`.
   - Then, calculate `abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2)` using the updated values.
3. If `n` is less than or equal to 1:
   - Use `x1` and `y1` directly for `new_x` and `new_y`.

The final output state should reflect the calculations made and any values returned or modified.

Output State: **`moves_toward` is calculated based on the conditions of `n`. If `n` is at least 2, `new_x` and `new_y` are updated, otherwise, `new_x` is `x1` and `new_y` is `y1`.**
