The values of `x2` and `y2` are assigned the values obtained from `input()`, which is split into two parts and converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The previous values of `(x1, y1)` are not affected by this operation, so the output state includes the new values for `x2` and `y2`. 

Output State: **`(x1, y1)` are assigned new input integers; `x2` and `y2` are assigned new input integers from input().**
