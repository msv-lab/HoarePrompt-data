Postcondition: ***`new_x` is `x1 + r`, `new_y` is `y1 + u`, and `dist` is calculated as `abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - 1`. If `dist` is less than or equal to 0, the function prints `1` and returns `None`. If `dist` is greater than 0, no action is taken and the function completes without returning a value.***
