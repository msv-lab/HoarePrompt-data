The values of `u` and `r` are assigned the values `0` and `0`, respectively. Since both `u` and `r` are already `0`, their values remain unchanged. Other variables such as `new_x`, `new_y`, `dist`, `i`, and `n` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `u` and `r`.

Output State: **`new_x` is equal to `x1 + pref_sums[k + 1][0]`, `new_y` is equal to `y1 + pref_sums[k + 1][1]`, `dist` is calculated as `abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - (k + 2)`, `i` is `k + 2`, `n` is unchanged, `u` is 0, `r` is 0**
