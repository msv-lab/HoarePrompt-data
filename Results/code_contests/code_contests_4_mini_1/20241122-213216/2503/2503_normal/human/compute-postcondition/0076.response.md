According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0, which means the loop can execute one more time. 

To prepare for the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. The current value of `i` is 0, so for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be adjusted to 1. No other states need to be adjusted because `n` remains unchanged and still satisfies the condition (i.e., `i` will be less than `n` if `n` is greater than 0).

State: **`new_x` and `new_y` remain unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and `dist` is calculated as `abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - n * cycles - 1`**
