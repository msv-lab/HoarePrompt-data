The calculation for `cycles` is performed using the formula `(abs(x1 - x2) + abs(y1 - y2) - min_dist) // moves_toward`. Since `moves_toward` is greater than 0, the formula is executed without any issue. The values of `new_x` and `new_y` remain unchanged, and the variables are not affected by this calculation. 

Therefore, the output state is: `new_x` and `new_y` remain unchanged, `cycles` is calculated based on the given formula.

Output State: **`new_x` and `new_y` remain unchanged; `cycles` is calculated based on the formula `(abs(x1 - x2) + abs(y1 - y2) - min_dist) // moves_toward`**
