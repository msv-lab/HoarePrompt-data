The value of `min_dist` is assigned the value of `dist`. The previous calculations for `new_x`, `new_y`, and `dist` are not changed by this assignment. The output state reflects the values of `new_x`, `new_y`, and `dist` as they were prior to this code execution, along with the assignment of `min_dist`.

Output State: **`new_x` is `x1 + r`, `new_y` is `y1 + u`, `dist` is calculated as `abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - 1`, and `min_dist` is assigned the value of `dist`.**
