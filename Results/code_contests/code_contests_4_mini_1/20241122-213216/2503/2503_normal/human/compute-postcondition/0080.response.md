According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` relative to `n`. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` should be adjusted to 3. Additionally, since `n` is greater than 1, it must be adjusted to ensure it is at least 3 for the loop to continue executing. 

Thus, the necessary adjustments are: `i` should be set to 3, and `n` should be set to at least 3.

State: **`new_x` is `x1 + pref_sums[2][0]`, `new_y` is `y1 + pref_sums[2][1]`, `n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3**
