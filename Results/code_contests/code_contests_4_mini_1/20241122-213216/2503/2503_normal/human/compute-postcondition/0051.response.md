According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as the variable `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, the state indicates that `i` has reached its current value, which is not specified, but it can be inferred that `i` is less than `n` for the loop to have executed at least once.

Since the range of the loop is from 1 to `n`, if `i` is currently equal to `k` (where `k < n`), then for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` should be adjusted to `k + 1`.

The value of `n` is not specified to change, but since the loop continues while `i` is less than `n`, `n` remains unchanged.

State: **`new_x` is equal to `x1 + pref_sums[k + 1][0]`, `new_y` is equal to `y1 + pref_sums[k + 1][1]`, `dist` is calculated as `abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - (k + 1)`, `i` is `k + 1`, `n` is unchanged**
