The variable `s` is assigned the value of `input()`, which accepts user input as a string. The values of `(x1, y1)`, `(x2, y2)`, and `n` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` are integers; `n` is an input integer; `s` is an input string.

Output State: **`(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` are integers; `n` is an input integer; `s` is an input string**
