Postcondition: ***`new_x` is `x1 + r`, `new_y` is `y1 + 1`, `dist` is calculated as `abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - 1`. If the character at index `i` of `s` is 'D', then `u` is set to -1, resulting in `new_y` being `y1` and affecting the calculation of `dist`. If the character is not 'D', `u` remains 0, keeping `new_y` as `y1 + 1`. The variable `i` remains 1, and `n` is greater than 1, ensuring the index is still valid for the next operations on the string `s`.***
