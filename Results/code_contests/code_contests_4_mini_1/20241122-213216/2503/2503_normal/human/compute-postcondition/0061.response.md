Postcondition: ***If `moves_toward` is less than or equal to 0, the function prints -1 and returns None. If `moves_toward` is greater than 0, there are no changes made to the program state as there are no further actions defined in the else part. The variables `new_x` and `new_y` remain unchanged from their previous state.***
