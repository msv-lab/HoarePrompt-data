Postcondition: ***`new_x` and `new_y` remain unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `dist` is calculated as `abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - n * cycles - 1`. If `dist` is less than or equal to 0, the program prints `res + i + 1` and returns, otherwise, the program does not execute any return statement.***
