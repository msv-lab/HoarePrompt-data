Output State: **`new_x` is `x1 + r`, `new_y` is `y1 + 1` if the character at index `i` of `s` is not 'D'; if the character at index `i` is 'L', then `r` is set to -1, resulting in `new_x` being `x1 - 1`; if the character at index `i` is 'R', then `r` is set to 1; for any other character at index `i`, `r` remains unchanged, which may affect `new_x` but does not affect `new_y`; `i` remains 1; `n` is greater than 1; `pref_sums[i]` is updated to `[pref_sums[i - 1][0] + r, pref_sums[i - 1][1] + u]`.**
