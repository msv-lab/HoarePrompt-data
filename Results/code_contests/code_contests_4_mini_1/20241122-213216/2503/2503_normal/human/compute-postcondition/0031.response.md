The values of `u` and `r` are both assigned the value of 0. The previous values of `new_x`, `new_y`, `dist`, `min_dist`, `i`, and `n` are all unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new values of `u` and `r` while maintaining the state of the other variables.

Output State: **`new_x` is `x1 + r`, `new_y` is `y1 + u`, `dist` is calculated as `abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - 1`, `min_dist` is assigned the value of `dist`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1; `u` is 0, `r` is 0**
