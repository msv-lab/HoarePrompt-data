According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop will execute for values of `i` starting from 1 up to `n-1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 2. Additionally, since `i` is initialized at 1, at the start of the loop, `i` should be 1. 

State: **`new_x` is `x1 + r`, `new_y` is `y1 + u`, `dist` is calculated as `abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - 1`, `min_dist` is assigned the value of `dist`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1**
