The code snippet includes a print statement that outputs the value `1`. The values of the variables `new_x`, `new_y`, and `dist` remain unchanged, as the print statement does not modify any variables. Therefore, the output state will reflect the unchanged variables along with the output of the print statement.

Output State: **`new_x` is `x1 + r`, `new_y` is `y1 + u`, `dist` is calculated as `abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - 1`, and `dist` is less than or equal to 0; the output is 1**.
