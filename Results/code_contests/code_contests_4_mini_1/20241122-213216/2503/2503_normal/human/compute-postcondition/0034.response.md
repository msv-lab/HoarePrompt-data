Postcondition: ***`new_x` is `x1 + r`, `new_y` is `y1 + u`, and `dist` is calculated as `abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - 1`. If the character at index `i` of `s` is 'U', then `u` is set to 1, resulting in `new_y` being `y1 + 1`. This updates `min_dist` to the value of `dist` based on the new coordinates. The variable `i` remains 1, and `n` is greater than 1, ensuring that the index is valid for further operations in the string `s`. If the character is not 'U', `u` remains 0, and `new_y` stays as `y1`.***
