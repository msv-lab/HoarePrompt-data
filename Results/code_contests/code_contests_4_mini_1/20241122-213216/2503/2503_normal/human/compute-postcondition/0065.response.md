Postcondition: ***`new_x` and `new_y` remain unchanged; `cycles` is calculated based on the formula `(abs(x1 - x2) + abs(y1 - y2) - min_dist) // moves_toward; res is assigned the value of n multiplied by cycles; `x1` is updated to `x1 + cycles * pref_sums[-1][0]`, and `y1` is updated to `y1 + cycles * pref_sums[-1][1]`. The expression `(abs(x1 - x2) + abs(y1 - y2) - n * cycles)` is less than or equal to 0.***
