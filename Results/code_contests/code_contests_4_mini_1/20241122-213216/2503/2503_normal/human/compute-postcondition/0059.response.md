The `print(-1)` statement outputs `-1` to the console, but it does not change the values of the variables in the program. The initial state remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `moves_toward` is less than or equal to 0, `new_x` is `x1`, `new_y` is `y1`, and the function prints -1.

Output State: **`moves_toward` is less than or equal to 0, `new_x` is `x1`, `new_y` is `y1`, and the function prints -1**
