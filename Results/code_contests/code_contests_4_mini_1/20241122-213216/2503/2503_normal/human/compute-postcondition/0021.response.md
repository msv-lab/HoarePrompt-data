Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `pref_sums` is a list of `n` lists each containing two zeros, `u` is -1 if `s[0]` is 'D', 1 if `s[0]` is 'U', or 0 if `s[0]` is neither 'D' nor 'U', and `r` is -1 if `s[0]` is 'L'; otherwise, `r` remains unchanged at 0. If `s[0]` is 'R', then `r` is set to 1.***
