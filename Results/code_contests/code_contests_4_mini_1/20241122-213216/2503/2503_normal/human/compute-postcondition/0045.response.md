To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we need to evaluate the new values of `new_x` and `new_y`.

1. From the initial state, we have:
   - `new_x` is calculated as `x1 + pref_sums[i][0]`
   - `new_y` is calculated as `y1 + pref_sums[i][1]`
   - The values of `pref_sums[i]` depend on the calculations made previously in the program, specifically utilizing `pref_sums[i - 1]` and the value of `r`.

2. The value of `r` is influenced by the character at index `i` of the string `s`. 
   - If the character is 'D', `r` is unchanged.
   - If the character is 'L', `r` is set to -1, affecting `new_x` as `x1 - 1`.
   - If the character is 'R', `r` is set to 1, affecting `new_x` as `x1 + 1`.
   - For any other character, `r` remains unchanged.

3. The new values for `new_x` and `new_y` are then computed based on the above logic.

Given the context, we can conclude that `new_x` and `new_y` have been derived from `x1`, `y1`, and the updated values from `pref_sums[i]`. 

Thus, we summarize the output state as follows:

Output State: **`new_x` is `x1 + pref_sums[i][0]`, `new_y` is `y1 + pref_sums[i][1]`**
