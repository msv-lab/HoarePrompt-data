You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for describing the functionality of a Python function. You will be provided with the constraints and relationships between the input parameters, as well as the resulting output of the function based on these inputs. Your task is to organize this information and describe the functionality of the function. Please avoid describing how the function operates or details such as how local variables are initialized—only describe what parameters the function accepts and what it returns. If there are multiple return points in the function we will split them in Cases with an arithmetic counter and remember if one case is fullfilled none of the others are. You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: **functionality**.


Example1:
Parameter constraints and relationships: `number` is an integer.
```
def func(number):
```
Output: `number` is an integer. If `number` is even, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer1:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `number`. `number` is an integer. After executing the function body, if number is even, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `number`, and if `number` is even, it returns True. If `number` is not even, it returns False.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter number, returns `True` if `number` is even. If `number` is not even, it returns `False`.**


Parameter constraints and relationships: `age` is an integer.
```
def func(age):
```
Output: Case_1:`number` is an integer. If `number` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative; 
        Case_2: `number` is an integer. If `number` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult".
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `age`. `age` is an integer. If `age` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative. If `age` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult". Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `age`  and return if the person is a minor or an adult based on the age while handling wrong negative input values.


Your Task:
Parameter constraints: (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are tuples of non-negative integers where 0 ≤ x1, y1, x2, y2 ≤ 10^9, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and s is a string consisting only of the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R'.
```
def func_2():
```
Output: Case_1: *`(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` are integers. If `x1` is equal to `x2` and `y1` is equal to `y2`, the function prints 0 and returns None. If `x1` is not equal to `x2` or `y1` is not equal to `y2`, there is no further action taken in this fragment.

Case_2: *`new_x` is `x1 + r`, `new_y` is `y1 + u`, and `dist` is calculated as `abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - 1`. If `dist` is less than or equal to 0, the function prints `1` and returns `None`. If `dist` is greater than 0, no action is taken and the function completes without returning a value.

Case_3: if n is at least 2, then `new_x` is equal to `x1 + pref_sums[n-1][0]`, `new_y` is equal to `y1 + pref_sums[n-1][1]`, `dist` is the distance calculated at the last iteration, and `min_dist` is the minimum distance found; if n is less than or equal to 1, then `new_x` is still `x1`, `new_y` is still `y1`, `dist` is calculated as `abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - 1`, and `min_dist` is unchanged from its initial value.

Case_4: *If `moves_toward` is less than or equal to 0, the function prints -1 and returns None. If `moves_toward` is greater than 0, there are no changes made to the program state as there are no further actions defined in the else part. The variables `new_x` and `new_y` remain unchanged from their previous state.

Case_5: *`new_x` and `new_y` remain unchanged. The variable `cycles` is calculated based on the formula `(abs(x1 - x2) + abs(y1 - y2) - min_dist) // moves_toward`. The value of `res` is assigned as `n` multiplied by `cycles`. If the condition `abs(x1 - x2) + abs(y1 - y2) - n * cycles <= 0` holds true, the program prints `res` and returns without any value. If the condition is false, the program continues execution beyond the if block.

Case_6: `new_x` and `new_y` are computed based on the values from `pref_sums`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` ranges from 0 to n-1. The variable `dist` is calculated in each iteration based on the current values of `new_x`, `new_y`, and `cycles`. If `n` is 0 or lower, the loop does not execute, and `new_x` and `new_y` remain unchanged. If the loop executes and `dist` is less than or equal to 0 in any iteration, the program prints `res + i + 1` and returns; otherwise, it completes the full iteration without returning.

Case_7: The program returns None

Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?
