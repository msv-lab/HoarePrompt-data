The values of `x1` and `y1` are being assigned new values from the input, which will be split and converted to integers. The previous values of `x1` and `y1` are not altered until the input is provided. Therefore, the output state reflects that the variables `x1` and `y1` are now assigned new input integers.

Output State: **`(x1, y1)` are assigned new input integers**
