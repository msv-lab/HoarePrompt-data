The variables `new_x` and `new_y` are assigned new values based on the expressions `x1 + pref_sums[i][0]` and `y1 + pref_sums[i][1]` respectively. The value of `i` is 1, so the calculation depends on the values in `pref_sums` at index 1. The values of `new_x` and `new_y` will change accordingly, but the states of the other variables (`n`, `dist`, `cycles`) remain unaffected, and `n` is still greater than 0.

Therefore, the output state reflects the new values of `new_x` and `new_y` based on the computations, while other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`new_x` is `x1 + pref_sums[1][0]`, `new_y` is `y1 + pref_sums[1][1]`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `dist` is calculated as `abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - n * cycles - 1`**
