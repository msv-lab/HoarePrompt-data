According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` in relation to `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be at least 2, and `i` must be incremented to 2. 

Thus, the adjusted states would be:
- `n` is greater than 1 (to ensure that the loop can execute again with the next value of `i`)
- `i` is now 2 (the next iteration value)

The other variables (`new_x`, `new_y`, and `dist`) do not need to be adjusted as they are not directly related to the loop's iteration condition.

State: **`new_x` is `x1 + pref_sums[1][0]`, `new_y` is `y1 + pref_sums[1][1]`, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `dist` is calculated as `abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - n * cycles - 1`**
