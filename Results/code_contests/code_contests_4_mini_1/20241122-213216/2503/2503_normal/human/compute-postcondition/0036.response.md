The value of `u` is assigned -1, which does not affect any of the previously defined variables. The values of `new_x`, `new_y`, `dist`, `s`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `new_x` is `x1 + r`, `new_y` is `y1 + 1`, `dist` is calculated as `abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - 1`, the character at index `i` of `s` is 'D', `i` remains 1, and `n` is greater than 1, while `u` is -1.
