The value of `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial state does not provide specific values for `n` or any other variables. Therefore, the output state reflects the new assignment of `n` but does not change any previous values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, or `y2`. 

Output State: **`(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` are integers; `n` is an input integer**
