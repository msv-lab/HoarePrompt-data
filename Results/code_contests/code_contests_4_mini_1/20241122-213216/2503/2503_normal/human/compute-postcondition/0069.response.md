According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute `n` times if `n` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `new_x` and `new_y` remain unchanged, and the calculation of `cycles` and `res` is dependent on the values of `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, `y2`, `min_dist`, and `moves_toward`. 

For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0, and the variable `i` will start at 0 and increment with each iteration until it reaches `n - 1`.

Thus, the states need to be adjusted as follows: `n` needs to be greater than 0, `i` is initialized to 0.

State: **`new_x` remains unchanged, `new_y` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
