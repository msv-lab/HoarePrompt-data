Postcondition: ***`new_x` and `new_y` remain unchanged. The variable `cycles` is calculated based on the formula `(abs(x1 - x2) + abs(y1 - y2) - min_dist) // moves_toward`. The value of `res` is assigned as `n` multiplied by `cycles`. If the condition `abs(x1 - x2) + abs(y1 - y2) - n * cycles <= 0` holds true, the program prints `res` and returns without any value. If the condition is false, the program continues execution beyond the if block.***
