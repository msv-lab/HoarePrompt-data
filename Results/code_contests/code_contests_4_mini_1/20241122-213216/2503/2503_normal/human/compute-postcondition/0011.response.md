The value of `u` is assigned the value `1`. The previous value of `u` was `0`, but now it changes to `1`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `pref_sums` is a list of `n` lists, each containing two zeros, `u` is 1, `r` is 0, and the first element of list `s` is 'U'.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `pref_sums` is a list of `n` lists, each containing two zeros, `u` is 1, `r` is 0, and the first element of list `s` is 'U'**.
