According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` in relation to `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `k + 1`, and `n` is unchanged.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`, meaning we need to ensure that `k + 1` is less than `n`. Thus, we should adjust `i` to `k + 2`. 

No other states need to be adjusted since `new_x`, `new_y`, `dist`, `u`, and `r` are not influenced directly by the loop iteration count. The key adjustment is to ensure that `i` is incremented appropriately for the next iteration.

State: **`new_x` is equal to `x1 + pref_sums[k + 1][0]`, `new_y` is equal to `y1 + pref_sums[k + 1][1]`, `dist` is calculated as `abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - (k + 2)`, `i` is `k + 2`, `n` is unchanged; `u` is 0, `r` is 0**
