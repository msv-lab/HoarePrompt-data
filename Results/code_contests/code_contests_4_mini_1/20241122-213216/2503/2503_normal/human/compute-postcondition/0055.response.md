According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the range defined by `n`. The loop starts with `i` initialized to 1 and continues while `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `k + 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`. Thus, the condition that needs to be adjusted is `i < n`. 

Since `i` is currently `k + 2`, to allow the loop to execute one more time, `k + 2` must be less than `n`, leading to the requirement that `k` must be less than `n - 2`. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`new_x` is equal to `x1 + pref_sums[k + 1][0]`, `new_y` is equal to `y1 + pref_sums[k + 1][1]`, `dist` is calculated as `abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - (k + 2)`, `i` is `k + 2`, `n` is unchanged, `u` is 0, `r` is 0, `k` is less than `n - 2`**
