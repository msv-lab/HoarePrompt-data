The function `func_2` accepts the following parameters: 

- `(x1, y1)`: a tuple of non-negative integers.
- `(x2, y2)`: a tuple of non-negative integers.
- `n`: a positive integer.
- `s`: a string consisting only of the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R'.

The function has multiple cases for its output:

- **Case 1**: If `(x1, y1)` is equal to `(x2, y2)`, the function prints `0` and returns `None`. If they are not equal, no further action is defined.

- **Case 2**: If the calculated `dist` is less than or equal to `0`, the function prints `1` and returns `None`. If `dist` is greater than `0`, the function completes without returning a value.

- **Case 3**: If `n` is at least `2`, the function calculates positions and minimum distance based on previous iterations. If `n` is less than or equal to `1`, the distance calculation remains unchanged.

- **Case 4**: If `moves_toward` is less than or equal to `0`, the function prints `-1` and returns `None`. If `moves_toward` is greater than `0`, the function completes without any changes.

- **Case 5**: The function calculates `cycles` and checks a condition to either print `res` or continue execution.

- **Case 6**: The function potentially executes a loop to calculate distances and may print a result before returning, depending on the outcome of the iterations.

- **Case 7**: The function returns `None`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept tuples of non-negative integers `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`, a positive integer `n`, and a string `s`. The function performs various calculations and checks based on these inputs, potentially printing specific results and returning `None` at multiple points based on the defined cases. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) as tuples of non-negative integers, n as a positive integer, and s as a string. It performs checks and calculations, printing outputs based on certain conditions and returning None at various points.**
