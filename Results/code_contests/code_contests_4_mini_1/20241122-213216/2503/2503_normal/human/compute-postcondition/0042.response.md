The variable `r` is assigned the value `-1`, which does not change the values of `new_x`, `new_y`, `i`, `n`, or `s`. The previous values are `new_x` is `x1 + r`, `new_y` is `y1 + 1`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, and the character at index `i` of `s` is 'L'. Since `r` is now `-1`, `new_x` will be affected by this change, specifically, `new_x` will now be `x1 - 1`. The value of `new_y` is already `y1 + 1` and remains unchanged.

Output State: **`new_x` is `x1 - 1`, `new_y` is `y1 + 1`, `r` is -1, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, and the character at index `i` of `s` is 'L'**.
