The values of `u` and `r` are both initialized to 0. The previous values of the affected variables (`new_x`, `new_y`, `dist`, `i`, and `n`) remain unchanged as they are not impacted by the code snippet. Therefore, the output state reflects the initialization of `u` and `r` while retaining the previous values of the other variables.

Output State: **`new_x` is equal to `x1 + pref_sums[k + 1][0]`, `new_y` is equal to `y1 + pref_sums[k + 1][1]`, `dist` is calculated as `abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - (k + 1)`, `i` is `k + 1`, `n` is unchanged; `u` is 0, `r` is 0**
