The values of `new_x` and `new_y` are recalculated based on the values of `x1`, `y1`, and `pref_sums` at the index `i` which is 2. The initial state indicates that `new_x` is defined as `x1 + pref_sums[1][0]` and `new_y` as `y1 + pref_sums[1][1]`. 

After executing the code, the new values of `new_x` and `new_y` will be updated to reflect the values of `pref_sums[i][0]` and `pref_sums[i][1]` respectively. 

Therefore, the output state will reflect the new computations of `new_x` and `new_y` based on the initial values of `x1`, `y1`, and `pref_sums`. However, since the exact values of `x1`, `y1`, and `pref_sums[2][0]`, `pref_sums[2][1]` are not provided, we cannot determine the specific values for `new_x` and `new_y`.

Output State: **`new_x` is `x1 + pref_sums[2][0]`, `new_y` is `y1 + pref_sums[2][1]`, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2**
