The function accepts two integer parameters, `x` and `y`, and computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y` using the Euclidean algorithm. If `y` is initially 0, the function returns `x` as the GCD. If `y` is non-zero, the function repeatedly updates `x` and `y` until `y` becomes 0, at which point it returns the last non-zero value of `y`, which is the GCD of the original inputs.
