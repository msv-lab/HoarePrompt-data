To determine the correctness of the provided code in relation to the problem description, let's analyze the code, its functions, and the output descriptions.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to find the minimal number of days required for a ship to reach a destination point on a Cartesian plane, given the initial coordinates, destination coordinates, and a string representing wind directions over a number of days. 

### Function Analysis
1. **Function `func_1`:** 
   - This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers. 
   - **Relevance to the problem:** This function is not relevant to the main problem since the task does not require GCD calculations. 

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - Reads input for starting and ending coordinates and the wind direction string.
   - It calculates the new position after applying movements based on the wind string.
   - It handles distance calculations and checks if the ship can reach the destination.
   - The function prints the number of days required or -1 if it's impossible to reach.

### Output Description Analysis
- The output description for `func_2` summarizes the steps taken in the function but lacks clarity on certain edge cases:
  - It mentions the possibility of the function completing without printing if the distance does not meet certain criteria, which could lead to confusion in determining whether reaching the destination is possible or not.

### Edge Cases and Potential Issues
1. **Immediate Check:** The first if-condition checks if the starting and ending coordinates are the same, which is not supposed to happen according to the problem description.
2. **Distance Calculation:** The distance is calculated based on the new position after the first wind direction move. However, if the first move does not bring the ship closer to the destination, it might incorrectly suggest that the ship can reach the destination in fewer moves than necessary.
3. **Cycles Calculation:** The code attempts to calculate how many complete cycles of wind will be needed to reach the destination. However, if the ship is moving away from the destination due to wind, this logic could fail.
4. **Final Output:** If none of the conditions are met for printing the result, the function can exit without producing any output, which is incorrect behavior.

### Confirmation Against Output Hints
The output hints for `func_2` do point out the function's behavior of checking distances and printing results based on them. However, they do not adequately address the potential for the ship to never reach the destination due to unfavorable wind conditions: 
- For example, if the wind is consistently pointing in the opposite direction of the required movement, the function does not properly handle this case to ensure a result of -1 is printed when appropriate.

### Conclusion
Given the identified issues with distance calculations, the handling of wind directions, and the potential for the function to complete without producing output, it is clear that the code does not reliably follow the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not correctly handle edge cases where reaching the destination is impossible due to wind directions, which could lead to incorrect or missing outputs.
