x1, y1, x2, y2 are integers representing the initial and destination coordinates of the ship, where 0 ≤ x1, y1, x2, y2 ≤ 10^9 and (x1, y1) ≠ (x2, y2); n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of the wind direction string s; s is a string of length n consisting only of characters 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R'.
