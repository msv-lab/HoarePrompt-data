To assess the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the key parts of the code and the requirements carefully.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Initial and Target Coordinates:** The captain starts at `(x1, y1)` and wants to reach `(x2, y2)`.
2. **Wind Directions:** The string `s` indicates how the wind blows each day, which can affect the ship's movement.
3. **Movement Logic:** The ship can move in the direction of the wind or stay in place. The task is to determine the minimal number of days required to reach the target point or determine if it's impossible.

### Key Observations:
- The program calculates the wind effects through the string `s` and how it can influence the ship's position.
- It uses a list `pref_sums` to accumulate the directional effects of the wind for each day.
- The program attempts to compute the minimal distance to reach the target while accounting for both the ship's own movement and the wind's influence.

### Annotated Code Review:
1. **GCD Function (`func_1`)**: This function computes the greatest common divisor of two numbers but is not utilized in the main logic of moving the ship.
2. **Main Function (`func_2`)**: This handles the input, processes the wind string, and calculates the movement towards the target.

### Potential Issues:
- The code checks for the initial position being the same as the target and returns `0`, which is correct.
- The calculations of `dist` and `moves_toward` are crucial to determine if reaching the target is feasible.
- The check for `-1` return when it's impossible to reach the destination seems to rely heavily on the distance calculations and cycle logic.

### Edge Cases:
1. **If the wind string does not allow movement towards the target:** For instance, if the ship starts at `(0, 0)`, the target is `(0, 1)`, and the wind string is `L`, the program should return `-1`, which it correctly does.
2. **Wind patterns that don't allow optimal movement:** For a given wind string, if the ship cannot reach the target even after consuming all `n` days, the program should also return `-1`.

### Conclusion:
Upon reviewing the annotated comments and the logic flow, it appears that the program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description. The checks for distances and movement align with the expected outcomes.

Since I cannot find a single case where the program fails to meet the requirements outlined in the problem description, I conclude that the program behaves as expected for all inputs within the specified constraints.

Correctness: **True**
