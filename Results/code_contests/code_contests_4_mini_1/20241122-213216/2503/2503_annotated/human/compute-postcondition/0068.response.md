Postcondition: ***If `moves_toward` is less than or equal to 0, the function prints -1 and returns None. If `moves_toward` is greater than 0 and the sum of the absolute differences between `x1` and `x2` plus `y1` and `y2` minus `n * cycles` is less than or equal to 0, the function prints `res` and returns None. Otherwise, `x1` is updated to `x1 + cycles * pref_sums[-1][0]` and `y1` is updated to `y1 + cycles * pref_sums[-1][1]`.***
