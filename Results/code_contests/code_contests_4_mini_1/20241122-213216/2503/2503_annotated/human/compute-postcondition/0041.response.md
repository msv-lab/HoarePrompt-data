Postcondition: ***`new_x` is equal to `x1`, `new_y` is equal to `y1 + 1`, `dist` is calculated as `abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - 1`, assigned to `min_dist`, and the character at index `i` in the string `s` is 'L'. Additionally, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, ensuring that all conditions related to `u`, `r`, and the distance calculation are satisfied.***
