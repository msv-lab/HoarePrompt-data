The code prints the value `1`, and while the other variables (`new_x`, `new_y`, `dist`) are not modified by the print statement, their previous values remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `new_x` is `x1 + r`, `new_y` is `y1 + u`, `dist` is calculated as `abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - 1`, and `dist` is less than or equal to 0, and the function prints 1.
