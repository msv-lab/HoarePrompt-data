The values of `x1` and `y1` are assigned the values from the input, which are split into two integers. The previous values of `x1` and `y1` are unknown since they depend on the input. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `x1` is assigned a value from input, `y1` is assigned a value from input.

Output State: **`x1` is assigned a value from input, `y1` is assigned a value from input**
