The value of `r` is assigned the value `1`, changing its previous value from `0` to `1`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `x1` and `y1` are input values, `x2` and `y2` are input integers, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `pref_sums` is a list of `n` lists each containing [0, 0], the first character of `s` is 'R', `u` remains unchanged, and `r` is now 1.
