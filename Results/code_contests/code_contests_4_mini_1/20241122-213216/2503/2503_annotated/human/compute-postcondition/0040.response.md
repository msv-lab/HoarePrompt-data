Postcondition: ***`new_x` is equal to `x1 + r`, `new_y` is equal to `y1 + 1`, and `dist` is calculated as `abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - 1`, assigned to `min_dist`. If the character at index `i` in the string `s` is 'R', then `r` is set to 1, leading to `new_x` being `x1 + 1`. Otherwise, if `s[i]` is not 'R', then `r` remains 0, thus `new_x` stays as `x1 + 0`. Additionally, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, ensuring that all conditions related to `u`, `r`, and the distance calculation are satisfied.***
