Postcondition: ***`new_x` is equal to `x1 + pref_sums[0][0]`, `new_y` is equal to `y1 + pref_sums[0][1]`, and `dist` is calculated as `abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - i - n * cycles - 1`. If `dist` is less than or equal to 0, the program prints `res + i + 1` and does not return any value. If `dist` is greater than 0, the program does not execute the print statement or return, leading to no output or change in variables.***
