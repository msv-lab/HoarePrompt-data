The function `func_2` accepts four parameters: `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`, which are non-negative integers, and a positive integer `n` that represents the length of the string `s`. The string `s` consists solely of the characters U, D, L, and R. 

After executing the function body, the return values are as follows:

- **Case 1**: If `x1` is equal to `x2` and `y1` is equal to `y2`, the function prints `0` and returns `None`. If they are not equal, no action is taken, and the function continues executing.
  
- **Case 2**: If `dist` is less than or equal to `0`, the function prints `1` and returns without any additional value.
  
- **Case 3**: Depending on the value of `n`, the function updates `new_x` and `new_y`, and calculates `min_dist`. However, there is no return value or output specified for this case.

- **Case 4**: If `moves_toward` is less than or equal to `0`, the function prints `-1` and returns `None`. If `moves_toward` is greater than `0`, no action is taken.

- **Case 5**: Similar to Case 4, if `moves_toward` is less than or equal to `0`, it prints `-1` and returns `None`. If `moves_toward` is greater than `0` and a certain condition is met, it prints `res` and returns `None`. Otherwise, it updates `x1` and `y1`.

- **Case 6**: If `moves_toward` is less than or equal to `0`, the loop does not execute, leading to no updates or outputs. If the loop executes, it may print a value and return based on certain conditions.

- **Case 7**: The program completes without returning any value.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept parameters `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `n`, and `s`, and to perform various print operations or return `None` based on the specified conditions throughout the execution flow. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters x1, y1, x2, y2 (non-negative integers) and n (a positive integer) along with a string s. It may print values or return None based on various conditions related to the input parameters.**
