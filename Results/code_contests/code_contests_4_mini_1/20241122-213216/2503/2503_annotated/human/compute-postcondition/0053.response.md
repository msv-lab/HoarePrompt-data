According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `n`, which means the loop cannot execute again since the range specified in the `for` loop starts from 1 and goes up to (but does not include) `n`. 

Thus, for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than `n`. Specifically, `i` should be set to `n - 1`.

No other states need to be adjusted as they do not affect the loop execution.

State: **`new_x` is updated to `x1 + pref_sums[n][0]`, `new_y` is updated to `y1 + pref_sums[n][1]`, `dist` is calculated as abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - n - 1, `i` is n - 1, `u` is 0, `r` is 0**
