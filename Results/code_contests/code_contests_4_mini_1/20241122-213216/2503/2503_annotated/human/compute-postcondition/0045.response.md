The values of `new_x` and `new_y` are assigned based on the computation involving `x1`, `pref_sums[i][0]`, `y1`, and `pref_sums[i][1]`. The variable `pref_sums[i]` has already been updated to contain two elements: the first element is the sum of `pref_sums[i - 1][0]` and `r`, and the second element is the sum of `pref_sums[i - 1][1]` and `u`.

Thus, `new_x` is calculated as `x1 + pref_sums[i][0]` and `new_y` as `y1 + pref_sums[i][1]`. The specific values of `new_x` and `new_y` will depend on the values of `x1`, `y1`, `r`, and `u`, but those values are not provided in the initial state.

Therefore, the output state reflects that `new_x` and `new_y` have been calculated based on the provided formula.

Output State: **`new_x` is updated to `x1 + pref_sums[i][0]`, `new_y` is updated to `y1 + pref_sums[i][1]`**
