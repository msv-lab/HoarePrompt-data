The code assigns the value of `n` to be the integer conversion of an input. The previous values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are not affected as they are input values, and the only change is the assignment of `n`. Therefore, the output state reflects the input for `n` and the unchanged values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`.

Output State: **`x1` and `y1` are input values, `x2` and `y2` are input integers, `n` is an input integer.**
