The variable `min_dist` is assigned the value of `dist`. The value of `dist` is calculated as `abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - 1`. Since no specific values for `new_x`, `new_y`, `x2`, or `y2` are provided, `dist` can be any integer value. The previous state of the other variables is unaffected by this assignment.

Thus, the output state reflects that `min_dist` is now equal to `dist`, while the previous values are preserved.

Output State: **`new_x` is equal to `x1 + r`, `new_y` is equal to `y1 + u`, `dist` is calculated as `abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - 1`, and `min_dist` is assigned the value of `dist`**.
