According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` in relation to `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the current loop index, and since the loop is structured as `for i in range(n)`, `i` will increment by 1 with each iteration.

Given that the loop has not yet reached the maximum value of `n`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be adjusted to its next value, which is `i + 1`. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`.

State: **`new_x` is equal to `x1 + pref_sums[0][0]`, `new_y` is equal to `y1 + pref_sums[0][1]`, `dist` is calculated as `abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - (i + 1) - n * cycles - 1`**
