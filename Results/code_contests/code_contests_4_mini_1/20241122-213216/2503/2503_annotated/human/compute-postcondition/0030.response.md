According to the code, for the loop to execute, the variable `n` must be at least 2, since the range starts at 1 and goes up to (but does not include) `n`. If `n` is less than 2, the loop will not run. 

Before the loop starts, `new_x`, `new_y`, `dist`, and `min_dist` are defined, but they do not affect the execution of the loop directly. The variable `i` will start at 1 at the beginning of the loop.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, we need to state that `n` is greater than or equal to 2, and `i` starts at 1.

State: **`new_x` is equal to `x1 + r`, `new_y` is equal to `y1 + u`, `dist` is calculated as `abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - 1`, `min_dist` is assigned the value of `dist`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 2**
