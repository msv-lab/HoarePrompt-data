The variables `new_x` and `new_y` are assigned values based on the current values of `x1`, `y1`, and `pref_sums[i]`. The variable `i` is 0, so we are accessing the first element of `pref_sums`. The values of `new_x` and `new_y` will be calculated as follows:

- `new_x` becomes `x1 + pref_sums[0][0]`
- `new_y` becomes `y1 + pref_sums[0][1]`

Since the exact values of `x1`, `y1`, and `pref_sums` are not specified, we cannot provide specific numeric values for `new_x` and `new_y`. However, the output state will reflect the assignments made.

Output State: **`new_x` is `x1 + pref_sums[0][0]`, `new_y` is `y1 + pref_sums[0][1]`**
