Postcondition: ***`x1` and `y1` are input values, while `x2` and `y2` are input integers. If `x1` is equal to `x2` and `y1` is equal to `y2`, the function prints 0 and returns None. If `x1` is not equal to `x2` or `y1` is not equal to `y2`, no action is taken, and the function continues executing beyond this point.***
