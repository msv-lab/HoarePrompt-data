To determine the output state, we need to analyze the assignment statement in the provided code snippet.

1. The code declares `new_x` and `new_y` and assigns their values based on `x1`, `y1`, `r`, and `u`.
2. The variables `r` and `u` are part of the list `pref_sums[0]`, where `r` is dependent on the value of `s[0]`. The value of `r` can be:
   - `-1` if `s[0]` is 'L'
   - `1` if `s[0]` is 'R'
   - `0` otherwise
3. The variable `u` remains unchanged.

Since we do not have the exact values for `x1`, `y1`, and `u`, we can only describe the relationships:

- `new_x` will be computed as `x1 + r`
- `new_y` will be computed as `y1 + u`

Thus, the output state will reflect the relationships of `new_x` and `new_y` based on the values of `x1`, `y1`, `r`, and `u`. 

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`new_x` is `x1 + r`, `new_y` is `y1 + u`, where `r` is -1 if `s[0]` is 'L', 1 if `s[0]` is 'R', and 0 otherwise, and `u` remains unchanged.**
