Postcondition: ***`x1` and `y1` are input values, `x2` and `y2` are input integers, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `pref_sums` is a list of `n` lists each containing [0, 0]. If the first character of `s` is 'R', then `u` remains unchanged and `r` is set to 1. If the first character of `s` is not 'R', then `u` remains unchanged and `r` remains 0.***
