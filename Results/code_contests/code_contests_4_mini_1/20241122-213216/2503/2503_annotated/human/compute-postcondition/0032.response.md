Postcondition: ***`new_x` is equal to `x1 + r`, `new_y` is equal to `y1 + u`, `dist` is calculated as `abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - 1`, `min_dist` is assigned the value of `dist`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `u` is 0, `r` is 0, and the character at index `i` in the string `s` is 'U'.***
