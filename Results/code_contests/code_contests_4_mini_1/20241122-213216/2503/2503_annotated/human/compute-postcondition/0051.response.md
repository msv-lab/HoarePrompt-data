According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit defined by `n`. The loop is set to iterate over the range from 1 to `n - 1`, inclusive. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at its current value, which is `n - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` would need to be less than `n`. Since `i` is currently `n - 1`, it needs to be adjusted to `n` to allow for the next iteration.

Thus, the state of `i` needs to be updated to `n`, while the values of `new_x`, `new_y`, and `dist` do not require any adjustment because they are not directly relevant to the condition for the loop's next execution.

State: **`new_x` is updated to `x1 + pref_sums[n][0]`, `new_y` is updated to `y1 + pref_sums[n][1]`, and `dist` is calculated as abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - n - 1, `i` is n**
