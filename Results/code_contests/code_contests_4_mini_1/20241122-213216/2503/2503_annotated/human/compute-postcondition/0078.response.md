According to the code, the loop's ability to execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. Specifically, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` represents the current index in the loop, and since `i` is within the range of `n`, we need to adjust `i` for the next iteration.

Since `i` increments with each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1. Therefore, the new value of `i` should be `i + 1`, and the loop's condition must still hold true.

Since `n` remains unchanged, we need to ensure that `i` is still less than `n` after this adjustment. 

Thus, the new state should reflect that `i` is now `i + 1`, while `new_x`, `new_y`, and `dist` are recalculated based on this new value of `i`.

State: **`new_x` is equal to `x1 + pref_sums[i + 1][0]`, `new_y` is equal to `y1 + pref_sums[i + 1][1]`, and `dist` is calculated as `abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - (i + 2) - n * cycles - 1`**
