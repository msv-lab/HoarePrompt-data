The variable `u` is assigned the value of -1. The values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `n`, `s`, `pref_sums`, `r` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `x1` and `y1` are input values, `x2` and `y2` are input integers, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `pref_sums` is a list of `n` lists each containing [0, 0], the first character of `s` is 'D', `u` is -1, and `r` remains 0.
