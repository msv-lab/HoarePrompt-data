Postcondition: ***`new_x` is equal to `x1 + r`, `new_y` is equal to `y1 + 1`, and `dist` is calculated as `abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - 1`, which is assigned to `min_dist`. If the character at index `i` in the string `s` is 'U', then `u` is set to 1, maintaining that `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `r` is 0. If `s[i]` is not 'U', the values of `u`, `new_y`, and `min_dist` remain unchanged from their initial state.***
