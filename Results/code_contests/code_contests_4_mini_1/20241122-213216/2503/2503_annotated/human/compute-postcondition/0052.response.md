The variables `u` and `r` are assigned the values of 0 in the provided code snippet. This does not affect the previously calculated values of `new_x`, `new_y`, `dist`, or `i`, which remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state indicates the unchanged values of these variables.

Output State: **`new_x` is updated to `x1 + pref_sums[n][0]`, `new_y` is updated to `y1 + pref_sums[n][1]`, `dist` is calculated as abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - n - 1, `i` is n, `u` is 0, `r` is 0**
