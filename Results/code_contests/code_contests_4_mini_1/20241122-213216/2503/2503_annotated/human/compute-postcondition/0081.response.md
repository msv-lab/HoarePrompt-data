Output State: **If `moves_toward` is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute and `new_x`, `new_y`, and `dist` are not updated. If `moves_toward` is greater than 0 and if the sum of the absolute differences minus `n * cycles` is less than or equal to 0, the loop also does not execute, leading to no output or change in variables. If the loop executes, `new_x` is equal to `x1 + pref_sums[i][0]`, `new_y` is equal to `y1 + pref_sums[i][1]`, and `dist` is calculated. If `dist` is less than or equal to 0 during any iteration, it prints `res + i + 1` and returns, otherwise, it completes without return. The loop will run at most `n` times, with `i` ranging from 0 to `n-1`.**
