Postcondition: ***`new_x` is updated to `x1 + pref_sums[i][0]`, `new_y` is updated to `y1 + pref_sums[i][1]`, and `dist` is calculated as abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - i - 1. If `dist` is less than or equal to 0, the program prints `i + 1` and terminates without returning a value. If `dist` is greater than 0, the program continues execution beyond the if statement.***
