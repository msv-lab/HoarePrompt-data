Postcondition: ***`new_x` is equal to `x1 + r`, `new_y` is equal to `y1 + 1`, `dist` is calculated as `abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - 1`, which is assigned to `min_dist`. The character at index `i` in the string `s` is 'D', `u` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, and `r` is 0.***
