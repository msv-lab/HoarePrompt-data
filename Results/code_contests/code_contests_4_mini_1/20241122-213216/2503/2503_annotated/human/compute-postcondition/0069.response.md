According to the code, the ability for the loop to execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the conditions regarding `moves_toward`, `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, `y2`, `n`, `cycles`, and `pref_sums` need to be considered.

1. If `moves_toward` is less than or equal to 0, the function prints -1 and returns None, which means the loop will not execute in this case.
2. If `moves_toward` is greater than 0, we need to ensure that the sum of the absolute differences between `x1` and `x2`, plus `y1` and `y2`, minus `n * cycles` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
3. Additionally, the loop index `i` should start at 0.

For the loop to execute, we need `moves_toward` to be greater than 0, and the condition involving the sum of absolute differences must be satisfied.

State: **`moves_toward` is greater than 0, the sum of the absolute differences between `x1` and `x2` plus `y1` and `y2` minus `n * cycles` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0**
