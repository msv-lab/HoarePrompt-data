Functionality: ** The function accepts two pairs of coordinates (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) as input, a positive integer n, and a string s representing a sequence of movements ('U', 'D', 'R', 'L'). It checks if the two coordinate points are the same, in which case it prints 0. If they are different, it calculates the movement based on the string and determines the minimum distance to reach (x2, y2) after executing the movements. If the distance can be reduced to zero or below, it prints the number of moves required; if it can't, it computes cycles of movements and prints the results accordingly. The function may print 1 or -1 under certain conditions and does not explicitly return a value in any case. It also handles edge cases such as when the calculated distance is less than or equal to zero or when the moves toward the target are insufficient.**
