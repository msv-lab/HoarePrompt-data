The variable `u` is assigned the value `1`, changing its previous value from `0` to `1`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `x1` and `y1` are input values, `x2` and `y2` are input integers, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string where the first character of `s` is 'U', `pref_sums` is a list of `n` lists each containing [0, 0], `u` is 1, `r` is 0.
