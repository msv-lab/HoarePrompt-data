According to the code, whether the loop can execute one more time depends on the value of `i` in relation to `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, the state indicates that `new_x` is equal to `x1 + pref_sums[i][0]` and `new_y` is equal to `y1 + pref_sums[i][1]`, indicating that `i` has taken on a certain value during the last iteration.

To determine the necessary adjustments to the states for the loop to execute again: 

1. We need to understand that `i` must be incremented for the loop to continue. Since the current iteration has completed, we know that `i` is currently at its last value before the loop checks the condition again.
2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be equal to the current value plus one (i.e., `i + 1`).
3. Additionally, we must ensure that `i + 1` is still less than `n` for the loop to execute again.

Since we do not have the specific current value of `i`, we can adjust the condition based on the expected behavior of the loop.

Thus, we need to adjust `i` to be one more than its previous value (i.e., `i + 1`), and we must ensure that `n` is greater than `i + 1`.

State: **`new_x` is equal to `x1 + pref_sums[i + 1][0]`, `new_y` is equal to `y1 + pref_sums[i + 1][1]`, `i` is equal to `i + 1`, and `n` is greater than `i + 1`**
