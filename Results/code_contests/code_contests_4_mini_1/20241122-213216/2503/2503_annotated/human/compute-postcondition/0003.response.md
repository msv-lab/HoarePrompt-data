The code snippet prints `0`, and it does not change the values of any of the variables `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, or `y2`. Therefore, the output state remains the same with the values of the variables unchanged. 

Output State: **`x1` is assigned a value from input, `y1` is assigned a value from input, `x2` and `y2` are input integers. `x1` is equal to `x2` and `y1` is equal to `y2`, and the function prints 0.**
