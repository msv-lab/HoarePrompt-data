Postcondition: ***`new_x` is equal to `x1 + r`, `new_y` is equal to `y1 + u`, and `dist` is calculated as `abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - 1`. If `dist` is less than or equal to 0, the function prints 1 and returns without any additional value. In all other cases, the function has no output or return value.***
