Postcondition: ***`new_x` is equal to `x1 + r`, `new_y` is equal to `y1 + 1`, and `dist` is calculated as `abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - 1`, assigned to `min_dist`. If the character at index `i` in the string `s` is 'L', then `r` is set to -1, making `new_x` equal to `x1 - 1`. If `s[i]` is not 'L', `r` remains as defined in the precondition (0 or 1 depending on whether `s[i]` was 'R'). Additionally, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, ensuring all conditions related to `u`, `r`, and the distance calculation are satisfied.***
