You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for describing the functionality of a Python function. You will be provided with the constraints and relationships between the input parameters, as well as the resulting output of the function based on these inputs. Your task is to organize this information and describe the functionality of the function. Please avoid describing how the function operates or details such as how local variables are initialized—only describe what parameters the function accepts and what it returns. If there are multiple return points in the function we will split them in Cases with an arithmetic counter and remember if one case is fullfilled none of the others are. You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: **functionality**.


Example1:
Parameter constraints and relationships: `number` is an integer.
```
def func(number):
```
Output: `number` is an integer. If `number` is even, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer1:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `number`. `number` is an integer. After executing the function body, if number is even, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `number`, and if `number` is even, it returns True. If `number` is not even, it returns False.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter number, returns `True` if `number` is even. If `number` is not even, it returns `False`.**


Parameter constraints and relationships: `age` is an integer.
```
def func(age):
```
Output: Case_1:`number` is an integer. If `number` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative; 
        Case_2: `number` is an integer. If `number` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult".
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `age`. `age` is an integer. If `age` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative. If `age` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult". Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `age`  and return if the person is a minor or an adult based on the age while handling wrong negative input values.


Your Task:
Parameter constraints: x1, y1, x2, y2 are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ x1, y1, x2, y2 ≤ 10^9 and (x1, y1) is not equal to (x2, y2); n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of the string s; s is a string of length n consisting only of characters U, D, L, and R.
```
def func_2():
```
Output: Case_1: *`x1` and `y1` are input values, while `x2` and `y2` are input integers. If `x1` is equal to `x2` and `y1` is equal to `y2`, the function prints 0 and returns None. If `x1` is not equal to `x2` or `y1` is not equal to `y2`, no action is taken, and the function continues executing beyond this point.

Case_2: *`new_x` is equal to `x1 + r`, `new_y` is equal to `y1 + u`, and `dist` is calculated as `abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - 1`. If `dist` is less than or equal to 0, the function prints 1 and returns without any additional value. In all other cases, the function has no output or return value.

Case_3: If n is at least 1, new_x is updated to x1 + pref_sums[n-1][0], new_y is updated to y1 + pref_sums[n-1][1], and min_dist contains the minimum distance calculated during the loop. If n is less than or equal to 1, new_x remains x1 + r, new_y remains y1 + u, dist remains abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - 1, and min_dist remains its initial value.

Case_4: *If `moves_toward` is less than or equal to 0, the function prints -1 and returns None. If `moves_toward` is greater than 0, the program continues execution without any return or print statement, implying that no action is taken.

Case_5: *If `moves_toward` is less than or equal to 0, the function prints -1 and returns None. If `moves_toward` is greater than 0 and the sum of the absolute differences between `x1` and `x2` plus `y1` and `y2` minus `n * cycles` is less than or equal to 0, the function prints `res` and returns None. Otherwise, `x1` is updated to `x1 + cycles * pref_sums[-1][0]` and `y1` is updated to `y1 + cycles * pref_sums[-1][1]`.

Case_6: If `moves_toward` is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute and `new_x`, `new_y`, and `dist` are not updated. If `moves_toward` is greater than 0 and if the sum of the absolute differences minus `n * cycles` is less than or equal to 0, the loop also does not execute, leading to no output or change in variables. If the loop executes, `new_x` is equal to `x1 + pref_sums[i][0]`, `new_y` is equal to `y1 + pref_sums[i][1]`, and `dist` is calculated. If `dist` is less than or equal to 0 during any iteration, it prints `res + i + 1` and returns, otherwise, it completes without return. The loop will run at most `n` times, with `i` ranging from 0 to `n-1`.

Case_7: The program completes without returning any value.

Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?
