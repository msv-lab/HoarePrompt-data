The values of `x2` and `y2` are assigned from the input after being converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The initial values of `x1` and `y1` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state includes the previous values of `x1` and `y1`, along with the new values of `x2` and `y2`, which are derived from the input.

Output State: **`x1` is assigned a value from input, `y1` is assigned a value from input, `x2` and `y2` are input integers**
