The variables `new_x` and `new_y` are reassigned new values based on the indices `i` from the `pref_sums` array. The previous values of `new_x` and `new_y` were based on `i + 1`, but now they will take the values from `i`. Thus:

- `new_x` is now equal to `x1 + pref_sums[i][0]`
- `new_y` is now equal to `y1 + pref_sums[i][1]`

The other variables `dist`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `n`, and `cycles` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`new_x` is equal to `x1 + pref_sums[i][0]`, `new_y` is equal to `y1 + pref_sums[i][1]`, and the previous values of `new_x` and `new_y` have been updated.**
