According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the range defined by `n`. The loop iterates from `1` to `n - 1`, meaning it will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to `n`. However, since the loop's range is defined as `range(1, n)`, when `i` reaches `n`, the loop condition will no longer hold true, and it will not execute again. Therefore, we need to adjust `n` so that it is greater than `n - 1`.

Since `i` is `n - 1`, we can increase `n` to ensure that `i` can be less than `n` in the next iteration. We can set `n` to be at least `n` + 1.

No other state variables need to be adjusted based on the current information.

State: **`new_x` is updated to `x1 + pref_sums[n][0]`, `new_y` is updated to `y1 + pref_sums[n][1]`, `dist` is calculated as abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - n - 1, `i` is n - 1, `u` is 0, `r` is 0, and `n` is greater than n**
