The code prints the value of `res + i + 1`. The previous values of the affected variables are `res`, `i`, and the state of other variables remains unchanged. Since `dist` is calculated to be less than or equal to 0 and does not affect the print statement, we will only consider the current values of `res` and `i`. 

The output state reflects that the value of `res + i + 1` is printed, but the exact values of `res` and `i` are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `new_x` is `x1 + pref_sums[0][0]`, `new_y` is `y1 + pref_sums[0][1]`, `dist` is calculated as `abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - i - n * cycles - 1`, and the function prints `res + i + 1`.

Output State: **`new_x` is `x1 + pref_sums[0][0]`, `new_y` is `y1 + pref_sums[0][1]`, `dist` is calculated as `abs(new_x - x2) + abs(new_y - y2) - i - n * cycles - 1`, and the function prints `res + i + 1`.**
