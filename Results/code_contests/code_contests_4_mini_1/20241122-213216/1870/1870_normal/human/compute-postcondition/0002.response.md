The variable `d` is assigned the value of `c + W`. The ranges for `W` and `c` are both [1, 100000], so the value of `d` will be in the range [2, 200000]. However, since `W` and `c` can be any integers within their respective ranges, the exact value of `d` cannot be determined without specific values for `W` and `c`. Therefore, the output state reflects the relationship between the variables:

Output State: **`W` is an integer in the range [1, 100000]; `c` is an integer in the range [1, 100000]; `d` is an integer in the range [2, 200000] (where `d = c + W`)**
