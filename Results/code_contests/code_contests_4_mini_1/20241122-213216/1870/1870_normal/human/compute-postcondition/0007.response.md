The variable `ans` is assigned the value of `a - d`. The variables `a` and `d` are not defined in the initial state, but we know that `d` is equal to `c + W`, and `d` is less than `a`. Therefore, `ans` will be calculated as `a - (c + W)`. However, since we do not have a specific value for `a`, we cannot determine the exact value of `ans`. The output state reflects the relationships between the variables.

Output State: **`W` is an integer in the range [1, 100000]; `c` is an integer in the range [1, 100000]; `d` is an integer in the range [2, 200000] (where `d = c + W`); `b` is greater than or equal to `c`; `d` is less than `a`; `ans` is calculated as `a - d`.**
