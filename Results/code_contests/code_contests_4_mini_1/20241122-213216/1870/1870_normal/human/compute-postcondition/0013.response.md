The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Based on the output constraints provided, the function is expected to handle three integer values: `W`, `a`, and `b`. The parameter `W` is an integer within the range [1, 100000], and both `a` and `b` are also integers within the same range. However, since there are no specific output cases mentioned in the provided information, we cannot determine the exact return values or cases that arise from these parameters.

Given this, the functionality of the function cannot be accurately described without additional information regarding the expected outputs based on the values of `W`, `a`, and `b`. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and does not specify output behavior based on W, a, and b.**
