Postcondition: ***`W` is an integer in the range [1, 100000]; `c` is an integer in the range [1, 100000]; `d` is an integer in the range [2, 200000] (where `d = c + W`); if `b` is less than `c`, then `ans` is set to `c - b`. If `b` is greater than or equal to `c` and `d` is less than `a`, then `ans` is calculated as `a - d`. If `b` is greater than or equal to `c` and `d` is greater than or equal to `a`, then `ans` is set to 0. This ensures that all scenarios are accounted for, including when `b` is equal to `c`, as well as the relationship between `a` and `d`.***
