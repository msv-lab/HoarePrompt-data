The values of `W`, `a`, and `c` are assigned based on the input provided through `raw_input()`, which accepts a space-separated string of integers that are then converted into integers using `map(int, ...)`. The variable `b` is not affected by this line of code. Since `W`, `a`, and `c` are assigned values based on the input, their specific values will depend on what is entered, but they remain within the defined ranges. Therefore, the output state indicates that `W`, `a`, and `c` are integers assigned from the input, while `b` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`W` is an integer in the range [1, 100000]; `a` is an integer in the range [1, 100000]; `c` is an integer in the range [1, 100000]; `b` is an integer in the range [1, 100000]**
