Postcondition: ***`W` is an integer in the range [1, 100000]; `c` is an integer in the range [1, 100000]; `d` is an integer in the range [2, 200000] (where `d = c + W`); `b` is greater than or equal to `c`. If `d` is less than `a`, then `ans` is calculated as `a - d`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `a`, then `ans` is set to 0. This ensures that `ans` reflects the difference between `a` and `d` when `d` is less than `a`, while being zero when `d` is equal to or greater than `a`, covering all potential values and edge cases for the variables involved.***
