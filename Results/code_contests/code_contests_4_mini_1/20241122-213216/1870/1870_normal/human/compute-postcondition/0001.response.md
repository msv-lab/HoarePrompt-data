The variable `b` is assigned the value of `a + W`. The values of `a` and `W` are both integers in the range [1, 100000]. After this assignment, `b` will also be in the range [2, 200000] since the minimum value for `a + W` occurs when both `a` and `W` are at their minimum values of 1, resulting in `b` being 2, and the maximum occurs when both are at their maximum of 100000, resulting in `b` being 200000. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `W` is an integer in the range [1, 100000]; `a` is an integer in the range [1, 100000]; `c` is an integer in the range [1, 100000]; `b` is an integer in the range [2, 200000].

Output State: **`W` is an integer in the range [1, 100000]; `a` is an integer in the range [1, 100000]; `c` is an integer in the range [1, 100000]; `b` is an integer in the range [2, 200000]**
