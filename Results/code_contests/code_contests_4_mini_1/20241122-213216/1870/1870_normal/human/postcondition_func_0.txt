The function reads three integers, `W`, `a`, and `c`, from user input. It then calculates two derived values, `b` (which is `a + W`) and `d` (which is `c + W`). Based on the relationships between `b`, `c`, `a`, and `d`, it determines the value of `ans`. If `b` is less than `c`, `ans` is set to `c - b`. If `b` is greater than or equal to `c`, and `d` is less than `a`, `ans` is set to `a - d`. Otherwise, `ans` is set to 0. The function prints the resulting value of `ans`. It does not return any values and is dependent on user input for its execution.
