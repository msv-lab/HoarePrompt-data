The function reads three integer values W, a, and c from input. It computes two derived values, b = a + W and d = c + W, and then determines the value of ans based on the relationships between a, b, c, and d. If b is less than c, ans is set to c - b. If d is less than a, ans is set to a - d. If neither condition is met, ans is set to 0. Finally, the function prints the value of ans. The function does not return any values; it only outputs the result directly.
