You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
We have added some annotations within the code to help you understand the code and its logic. The annotations are in the form of comments and are inserted automatically so double check whether the annotations are correct or not and describe the code correctly.
If the annotations are correct use them along with the code to determine the correctness of the code. If the annotations are incorrect then you can ignore them and just use the code to determine the correctness.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: AtCoDeer the deer found two rectangles lying on the table, each with height 1 and width W. If we consider the surface of the desk as a two-dimensional plane, the first rectangle covers the vertical range of [0,1] and the horizontal range of [a,a+W], and the second rectangle covers the vertical range of [1,2] and the horizontal range of [b,b+W], as shown in the following figure:

<image>

AtCoDeer will move the second rectangle horizontally so that it connects with the first rectangle. Find the minimum distance it needs to be moved.

Constraints

* All input values are integers.
* 1≤W≤10^5
* 1≤a,b≤10^5

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


W a b


Output

Print the minimum distance the second rectangle needs to be moved.

Annotated Program:
```
def func():
    W, a, c = map(int, raw_input().split())
    b = a + W
    d = c + W
    if (b < c) :
        ans = c - b
    else :
        if (d < a) :
            ans = a - d
        else :
            ans = 0
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`W`, `a`, `c` are integers. If `d` (which is `c + W`) is less than `a`, `ans` is assigned the value of `a - d` (which means `ans` will be `a - (c + W)`). If `d` is greater than or equal to `a`, then `ans` is 0. Since `b` is assigned the value of `a + W` and is greater than or equal to `c`, this ensures that the relationship between `b`, `c`, and `d` is maintained throughout the execution of the program. Thus, the possible values of `ans` are either `a - (c + W)` when `c + W < a`, or `0` when `c + W >= a`.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`W`, `a`, `c` are integers. If `b` (which is `a + W`) is less than `c`, then `ans` is assigned the value of `c - b` (which means `ans` will be `c - (a + W)`). If `d` (which is `c + W`) is less than `a`, then `ans` is assigned the value of `a - d` (which means `ans` will be `a - (c + W)`). If both conditions are false, then `ans` is assigned the value of 0. Thus, the possible values of `ans` are either `c - (a + W)` when `a + W < c`, `a - (c + W)` when `c + W < a`, or `0` when both `a + W >= c` and `c + W >= a`.
    print(ans)

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
