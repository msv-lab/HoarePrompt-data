The variable `ans` is assigned the value `0`. The previous values of the affected variables are unchanged, so `W`, `a`, `c`, `b`, and `d` remain the same. Therefore, the output state is: `W` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `b` is assigned the value of `a + W`, `d` is assigned the value of `c + W`, and `d` is greater than or equal to `a`; `ans` is 0.

Output State: **`W` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `b` is assigned the value of `a + W`, `d` is assigned the value of `c + W`, and `d` is greater than or equal to `a`; `ans` is 0**
