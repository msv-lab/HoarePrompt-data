The variable `b` is assigned the value of `a + W`. The values of `a` and `W` are both input integers, so the value of `b` will depend on these two inputs. The variable `b` is now affected, while `c` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `W` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, and `b` is assigned the value of `a + W`.

Output State: **`W` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, and `b` is assigned the value of `a + W`**
