The code takes input values for `W`, `a`, and `c` and assigns them to the respective variables. The previous values of `W`, `a`, and `b` are integers, but only `W` and `a` are directly affected since `c` is assigned from the input. The variable `b` is not affected by this line of code.

Since `W`, `a`, and `c` are assigned values from `raw_input().split()`, which accepts user input, the output state will reflect that `W` and `a` are now set to the input values, and `c` is also assigned a new value from the input.

Output State: **`W` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, and `b` remains unchanged.**
