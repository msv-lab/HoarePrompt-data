Postcondition: ***`W`, `a`, `c` are integers. If `b` (which is `a + W`) is less than `c`, then `ans` is assigned the value of `c - b` (which means `ans` will be `c - (a + W)`). If `d` (which is `c + W`) is less than `a`, then `ans` is assigned the value of `a - d` (which means `ans` will be `a - (c + W)`). If both conditions are false, then `ans` is assigned the value of 0. Thus, the possible values of `ans` are either `c - (a + W)` when `a + W < c`, `a - (c + W)` when `c + W < a`, or `0` when both `a + W >= c` and `c + W >= a`.***
