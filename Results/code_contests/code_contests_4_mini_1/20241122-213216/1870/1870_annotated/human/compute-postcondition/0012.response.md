To determine the output state, we need to analyze the conditions and assignments that affect the variable `ans`.

1. The initial state indicates that `W`, `a`, and `c` are integers.
2. We compute `b` as `a + W`.
3. We check the first condition: if `b < c` (i.e., `a + W < c`), then `ans` is assigned the value `c - b` (which is `c - (a + W)`).
4. We check the second condition: if `d < a` (where `d` is `c + W`), then `ans` is assigned the value `a - d` (which is `a - (c + W)`).
5. If both conditions are false, `ans` is assigned the value `0`.

Since the code only prints `ans` without changing any variables further, and depending on the values of `a`, `W`, and `c`, `ans` will take one of the three possible values described above.

However, since we don't have specific values for `W`, `a`, and `c`, we cannot determine a specific number for `ans`. Therefore, the output state should reflect the conditions affecting `ans`.

Output State: **`ans` is either `c - (a + W)` when `a + W < c`, `a - (c + W)` when `c + W < a`, or `0` when both conditions are false.**
