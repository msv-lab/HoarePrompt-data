Postcondition: ***`W`, `a`, `c` are integers. If `d` (which is `c + W`) is less than `a`, `ans` is assigned the value of `a - d` (which means `ans` will be `a - (c + W)`). If `d` is greater than or equal to `a`, then `ans` is 0. Since `b` is assigned the value of `a + W` and is greater than or equal to `c`, this ensures that the relationship between `b`, `c`, and `d` is maintained throughout the execution of the program. Thus, the possible values of `ans` are either `a - (c + W)` when `c + W < a`, or `0` when `c + W >= a`.***
