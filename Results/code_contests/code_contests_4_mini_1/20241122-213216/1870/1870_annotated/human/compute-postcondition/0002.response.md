`d` is assigned the value of `c + W`. The variables `W`, `a`, and `c` are input integers, and `b` is assigned the value of `a + W`. The value of `d` depends on the values of `c` and `W`, which are known inputs. Other variables are not affected, so the output state will include the values of `W`, `a`, `c`, `b`, and the newly computed value of `d`.

Output State: **`W` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `b` is assigned the value of `a + W`, and `d` is assigned the value of `c + W`**.
