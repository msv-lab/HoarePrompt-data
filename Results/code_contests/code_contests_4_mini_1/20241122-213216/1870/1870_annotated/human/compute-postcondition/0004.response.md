To determine the output state after running the provided Python code, we analyze the initial state and the code snippet. 

1. The initial state indicates that `W`, `a`, `c` are integers, `b` is assigned the value of `a + W`, `d` is assigned the value of `c + W`, and it is given that `b` is less than `c`.
2. The code snippet calculates `ans` as `c - b`.

From the initial state:
- `b = a + W`
- Given that `b < c`, we can express this as `a + W < c`.

Now, we compute `ans`:
- `ans = c - b`
- Substituting the value of `b`, we get `ans = c - (a + W) = c - a - W`.

The calculation of `ans` does not affect the values of `W`, `a`, `c`, or `d`, but gives us a new value for `ans`. 

The output state after executing the code will reflect the values of `W`, `a`, `c`, `b`, and the newly calculated `ans`.

Output State: **`W`, `a`, `c` are integers; `b` is assigned the value of `a + W`; `d` is assigned the value of `c + W`; `b` is less than `c`; `ans` is equal to `c - a - W`**.
