The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, as it has been defined without any input parameters in its signature. However, it operates under the constraints that `W`, `a`, and `b` are integers, where `1 ≤ W ≤ 100000` and `1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100000`. 

Based on the output provided, the function likely returns a value based on the logic that utilizes `W`, `a`, and `b`, although the specific return value is not detailed in the output description. Therefore, the exact nature of the return value cannot be determined without additional context.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters directly but operates under the constraints that W, a, and b are integers within specified ranges. The return value is determined based on the internal logic involving these integers.**
