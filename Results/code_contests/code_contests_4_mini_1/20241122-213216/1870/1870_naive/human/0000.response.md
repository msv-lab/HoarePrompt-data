To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and its logic.

The problem states that we have two rectangles:
1. The first rectangle is defined by the horizontal range [a, a + W] and the vertical range [0, 1].
2. The second rectangle is defined by the horizontal range [b, b + W] and the vertical range [1, 2].

We need to find the minimum distance the second rectangle must be moved horizontally so that it connects with the first rectangle.

### Given Program:
```python
(W, a, c) = map(int, raw_input().split())
b = a + W
d = c + W
if b < c:
    ans = c - b
elif d < a:
    ans = a - d
else:
    ans = 0
print(ans)
```

### Breakdown of the Program:
1. It reads three integers: W, a, and c (note that `c` should actually be `b` based on the problem description).
2. It calculates:
   - `b` as `a + W` (the right edge of the first rectangle).
   - `d` as `c + W` (the right edge of the second rectangle).
3. It checks:
   - If `b < c`, it means the first rectangle is to the left of the second rectangle, and the distance to move is `c - b`.
   - If `d < a`, it means the second rectangle is to the left of the first rectangle, so the distance to move is `a - d`.
   - If neither condition is met, it returns 0, indicating that the rectangles are already connected.

### Issues with the Program:
1. The variable `c` is misused as it should represent the left edge of the second rectangle, but in the code, it is being treated as `b`. The input format specifies that it should be `b`, and the calculation of `d` is incorrect because `d` is calculated from `c` rather than `b`.
2. The conditions for calculating the distance are based on the incorrect assignment of `b` and `d`. This can lead to incorrect results based on the input values.

### Example Case Where It Fails:
Letâ€™s test with the input:
```
W = 3
a = 2
b = 6
```

According to the correct logic:
- The first rectangle occupies [2, 5].
- The second rectangle (starting at 6) occupies [6, 9].
- The minimum distance to move the second rectangle is `6 - 5 = 1`, which is correct.

However, with the incorrect implementation:
- The code would treat `c` as `b` (6) and calculates `d` as `9`.
- It checks if `b < c` which is false (5 < 6) and then checks `d < a` which is false (9 < 2).
- It would return `0`, which is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The program contains logical errors stemming from the misassignment of variables. Therefore, it does not correctly implement the functionality required by the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**.
