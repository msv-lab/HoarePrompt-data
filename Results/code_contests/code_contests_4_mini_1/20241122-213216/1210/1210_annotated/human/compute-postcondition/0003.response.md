Functionality: ** The function accepts a string input and processes it based on its format. If the sixth character of the input is 'w', it calculates and prints a value based on the integer value of the first character. If it is not 'w', it evaluates a more complex expression involving the first two characters as an integer. The function does not handle invalid formats or out-of-range values explicitly, which may lead to runtime errors if the input is not in the expected format. **
