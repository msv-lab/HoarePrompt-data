The function `func` does not accept any parameters as it is defined without any input. However, it processes an input string that is expected to be in the format "x of week" or "x of month", where x is an integer. The integer x is constrained such that for "x of week", 1 <= x <= 7, and for "x of month", 1 <= x <= 31. Based on these inputs, the function will return a corresponding value based on the validity of the string format and the integer x specified. 

Functionality: **The function processes an input string in the format "x of week" or "x of month", where x is an integer within specified ranges, and returns a corresponding value based on the validity of the input format and integer constraints.**
