To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's break down the requirements and assess the implementation.

The problem requires us to calculate the number of candies Limak will save in the year 2016 based on two possible input formats:

1. "x of week" where x (1 ≤ x ≤ 7) denotes the day of the week.
2. "x of month" where x (1 ≤ x ≤ 31) denotes the day of the month.

**Analysis of the Program:**
```python
s = raw_input()
print(52 + (int(s[0]) / -2 == -3)) if s[5] == 'w' else 12 - (int(s[0]) == 3) - (int(s[:2]) == 31) * 4
```

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads input using `raw_input()`, which is appropriate for Python 2 but not for Python 3. For this analysis, we will assume the environment allows `raw_input()`.

2. **Handling "x of week"**:
   - The program checks if `s[5] == 'w'` to determine if the input is about the week.
   - It calculates `52 + (int(s[0]) / -2 == -3)`. Here, `int(s[0]) / -2 == -3` is an incorrect way to check if `int(s[0])` is 4 (the 4th day of the week). Instead, it should directly check if `int(s[0])` equals 4, which would yield 52 correctly for any valid day of the week (Monday to Sunday).

3. **Handling "x of month"**:
   - If the input is not about the week, the code executes the else part: `12 - (int(s[0]) == 3) - (int(s[:2]) == 31) * 4`.
   - Here, it checks if the day is 3 (March 30) and incorrectly removes 1 from the total. It also checks if the input day is 31, which would incorrectly subtract 4 candies for months with 31 days.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the input is "1 of month", it should return 12, which it does correctly.
   - If the input is "29 of month", it should also return 12, which is correctly handled.
   - However, "30 of month" should return 11, which is also handled correctly. But for the 31 of month input, it incorrectly subtracts 4 (for the 31-day months), which is not appropriate since it should only count months with the 31st day.

**Conclusion**:
The provided program does not correctly account for all edge cases and has logical flaws in its calculations. Specifically, it uses incorrect logic to derive the number of candies based on the day of the week and month. Thus, it does not meet the problem requirements for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
