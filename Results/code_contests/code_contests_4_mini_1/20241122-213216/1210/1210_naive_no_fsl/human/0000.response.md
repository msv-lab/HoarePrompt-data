To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the code and the requirements.

### Problem Breakdown
The program needs to calculate the number of candies Limak will save in the year 2016 based on two possible input formats:
1. "x of week" where x is a day of the week (1 to 7).
2. "x of month" where x is a day of the month (1 to 31).

**Expected Outputs:**
- For "x of week":
  - The output should be the number of occurrences of the specified day in the year 2016.
  - There are 52 occurrences of any specific day of the week (Monday to Sunday) in a typical year, plus one extra occurrence for the first day of the year if it is that day (which is Wednesday for 2016).
- For "x of month":
  - The output should be the number of months that include the specified day.
  - The 30th day exists in 11 months (all except February), so the output should be 11 if x is 30.
  - The 31st day exists in 7 months (January, March, May, July, August, October, December), so the output should be 7 if x is 31.
  - For x = 29, it exists in February in a leap year, so the output should be 12.
  - For x = 28, it exists in all months, so the output should be 12.

### Analyzing the Code
The provided code is as follows:
```python
s = raw_input()
print(52 + (int(s[0]) / -2 == -3)) if s[5] == 'w' else 12 - (int(s[0]) == 3) - (int(s[:2]) == 31) * 4
```

**Issues in the Code:**
1. **Weekday Calculation:**
   - The expression `(int(s[0]) / -2 == -3)` is intended to check if the input day corresponds to the first day of the year being Wednesday, but it is not a reliable check. The integer division used here can lead to unexpected results due to integer division in Python 2 (if `raw_input` is used). This could yield incorrect results for days of the week.

2. **Month Calculation:**
   - The calculation for month days is incorrect in how it handles days that exist in months:
     - The code `12 - (int(s[0]) == 3) - (int(s[:2]) == 31) * 4` does not properly account for all possible day inputs. For example:
       - If `x` is 30, it should yield `11`, but the code would yield `12 - 0 - 4 = 8`.
       - If `x` is 31, it should yield `7`, but the code would also yield incorrectly.
       - The condition for `int(s[0]) == 3` does not correctly handle the logic for February, which should yield a total of 12 for all days less than or equal to 29, and a specific count for 30 and 31.

### Conclusion
The program does not adhere to the problem description correctly for all potential cases, particularly in the month calculations and the week handling. 

**Correctness: False**
