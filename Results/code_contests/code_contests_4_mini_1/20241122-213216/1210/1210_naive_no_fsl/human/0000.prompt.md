You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Today is Wednesday, the third day of the week. What's more interesting is that tomorrow is the last day of the year 2015.

Limak is a little polar bear. He enjoyed this year a lot. Now, he is so eager to the coming year 2016.

Limak wants to prove how responsible a bear he is. He is going to regularly save candies for the entire year 2016! He considers various saving plans. He can save one candy either on some fixed day of the week or on some fixed day of the month.

Limak chose one particular plan. He isn't sure how many candies he will save in the 2016 with his plan. Please, calculate it and tell him.

Input

The only line of the input is in one of the following two formats: 

  * "x of week" where x (1 ≤ x ≤ 7) denotes the day of the week. The 1-st day is Monday and the 7-th one is Sunday. 
  * "x of month" where x (1 ≤ x ≤ 31) denotes the day of the month. 

Output

Print one integer — the number of candies Limak will save in the year 2016.

Examples

Input

4 of week


Output

52


Input

30 of month


Output

11

Note

Polar bears use the Gregorian calendar. It is the most common calendar and you likely use it too. You can read about it on Wikipedia if you want to – <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar>. The week starts with Monday.

In the first sample Limak wants to save one candy on each Thursday (the 4-th day of the week). There are 52 Thursdays in the 2016. Thus, he will save 52 candies in total.

In the second sample Limak wants to save one candy on the 30-th day of each month. There is the 30-th day in exactly 11 months in the 2016 — all months but February. It means that Limak will save 11 candies in total.
Program:
```
s = raw_input()
print(52 + (int(s[0]) / -2 == -3)) if s[5] == 'w' else 12 - (int(s[0]) == 3) - (int(s[:2]) == 31) * 4
```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
