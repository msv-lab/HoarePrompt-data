The code assigns the value `1` to the dictionary `m` with the key `a[i]`. Since `a[i]` is not already a key in the dictionary `m`, it will be added as a new key. The previous states of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `sm` is updated by adding `a[i]`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ `ai` ≤ 10^9; `m` now includes key `a[i]` with value 1; `cnt` is an integer; `diff` is an integer; `ans` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`sm` is updated by adding `a[i]`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ `ai` ≤ 10^9; `m` now includes key `a[i]` with value 1; `cnt` is an integer; `diff` is an integer; `ans` remains unchanged.**
