The variable `cnt` is assigned the value `0`. The previous value of `cnt` is unchanged, but now it is explicitly set to `0`. The other variables (`sm`, `diff`, `ans`, `i`, `a[i]`, and `n`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `sm` remains unchanged, `cnt` is 0, `diff` remains unchanged, `ans` remains unchanged, `i` is 0, `a[i]` exists in the dictionary `m`, and `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`sm` remains unchanged, `cnt` is 0, `diff` remains unchanged, `ans` remains unchanged, `i` is 0, `a[i]` exists in the dictionary `m`, and `n` remains unchanged**.
