The variable `diff` is assigned the value `0`. The previous state indicates that `diff` was unchanged, so now it is explicitly set to `0`. The other variables `sm`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `cnt`, and `ans` remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `diff`.

Output State: **`sm` is updated by adding `a[i]`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ 10^9, `i` is -1, `cnt` is 0, `diff` is 0, and `ans` is unchanged.**
