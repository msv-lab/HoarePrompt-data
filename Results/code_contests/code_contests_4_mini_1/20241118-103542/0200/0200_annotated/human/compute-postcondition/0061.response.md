To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the provided state and loop structure.

1. **Loop Structure**: The `for` loop is iterating over a range that starts from `n - 1` and goes down to `0` (inclusive). This means that the loop will execute for the values of `i` starting from `n - 1` down to `0`.

2. **Current State**: The state indicates that `sm` has been updated, but `diff`, `n`, `i`, and `cnt` remain unchanged. We don't have the actual values of these variables, but we know the following:
   - `i` must be within the bounds of the range defined in the loop (i.e., it should be between `0` and `n - 1`).
   - Since the loop iterates downwards, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be decremented by 1.

3. **Determining the Next State**: 
   - If the loop was in its last iteration with `i` at `0`, it would not execute again. Therefore, we need to set `i` to `-1` to indicate that the loop has reached its end.
   - If `i` was `1`, we can set `i` to `0` for the loop to execute again. The same goes for any other value of `i` that is greater than `0`.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to have `i` decreased by 1 from its previous value, which was `0` in the last iteration (the loop would not execute if `i` was already at `0`).

Thus, we conclude:
State: **`sm` is updated to `sm + a[i]`, `diff`, `n`, `i` is -1, `cnt` remains unchanged.**
