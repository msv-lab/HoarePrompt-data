The value of `diff` is incremented by `a[i] * m[a[i]]`. The previous value of `diff` is 0, and since `a[i]` exists in the dictionary `m`, `m[a[i]]` is accessible. Thus, `diff` will now hold the value `0 + a[i] * m[a[i]]`, which computes to `a[i] * m[a[i]]`. The states of other variables (`sm`, `cnt`, `ans`, `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `sm` remains unchanged, `cnt` is updated to `cnt + m[a[i]]`, `diff` is now `a[i] * m[a[i]]`, `ans` remains unchanged, and `i` is 0.

Output State: **`sm` remains unchanged, `cnt` is updated to `cnt + m[a[i]]`, `diff` is now `a[i] * m[a[i]]`, `ans` remains unchanged, `i` is 0**
