Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ `ai` ≤ 10^9, `m` is a dictionary, `cnt` is an integer, and `diff` is an integer. If `a[i] - 1` exists in the dictionary `m`, then `cnt` is increased by `m[a[i] - 1]` and `diff` is updated by adding `(a[i] - 1) * m[a[i] - 1]`. If `a[i] - 1` does not exist in `m`, then both `cnt` and `diff` remain unchanged. In all cases, the values of `cnt` and `diff` accurately reflect the contributions of the dictionary `m` and the current value `a[i]`.***
