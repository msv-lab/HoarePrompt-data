The variable `cnt` is incremented by the value of `m[a[i] - 1]`. Since `a[i] - 1` exists in the dictionary `m`, we can retrieve its corresponding value. The previous value of `cnt` is 0, so after this operation, `cnt` will equal `m[a[i] - 1]`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ `ai` ≤ 10^9, `sm` is 0, `m` is a dictionary, `ans` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `cnt` is `m[a[i] - 1]`, `diff` is 0**
