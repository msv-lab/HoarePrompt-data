The variable `ans` is initialized to 0. The values of the other variables (`n`, `a`, `sm`, and `m`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ `ai` ≤ 10^9; `sm` is 0; `m` is a dictionary; `ans` is 0.
