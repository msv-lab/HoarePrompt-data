The variable `a` is assigned a list created by mapping the `int` function over the result of `raw_input().split()`. The input is expected to be a space-separated string of integers, which will be converted into a list of integers. Since `n` is a positive integer indicating the number of integers to be read into the list, the state of `a` will now contain `n` integers that are input by the user. Other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ `ai` ≤ 10^9 based on user input.**
