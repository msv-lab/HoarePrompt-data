Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ `ai` ≤ 10^9, `sm` is 0, `m` is a dictionary, `ans` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `cnt` is increased by `m[a[i] + 1]` if `a[i] + 1` exists in `m`, and `diff` is updated to `diff + a[i] * m[a[i]]` if `a[i]` exists in `m`.**
