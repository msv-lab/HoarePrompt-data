The variable `sm` is assigned the value of `0`, and it does not affect any other variables in the initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of the variables without any changes to `n` and `a`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ `ai` ≤ 10^9; `sm` is 0**
