Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ `ai` ≤ 10^9, `sm` is 0, `m` is a dictionary, `ans` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `cnt` is 0, `diff` is 0, and the element `a[n - 1]` (which is `a[i]`) is present in the dictionary `m`.***
