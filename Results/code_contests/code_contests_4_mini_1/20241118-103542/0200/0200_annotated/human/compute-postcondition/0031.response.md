Output State: **`sm` is updated by adding `a[i]`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ 10^9, `i` is -1, `cnt` is increased by `m[a[i]]` (which is invalid), `diff` is updated by adding `a[i] * m[a[i]]`, and `ans` is unchanged.**
