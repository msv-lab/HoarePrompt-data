According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `n - 1`, which means the loop has already executed for `i = n - 1` down to `0`. For the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be decremented further. Thus, for the next iteration, `i` will be `-1`.

Since the loop condition allows `i` to be `-1`, and since we are not modifying any other state variables within the loop, we only need to adjust the value of `i`. There are no changes to `sm`, `n`, `a`, `m`, `cnt`, `diff`, or `ans`, as they remain unchanged according to the problem statement.

State: **`sm` is updated by adding `a[i]`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ 10^9, `i` is -1, `cnt` is unchanged, `diff` is unchanged, and `ans` is unchanged.**
