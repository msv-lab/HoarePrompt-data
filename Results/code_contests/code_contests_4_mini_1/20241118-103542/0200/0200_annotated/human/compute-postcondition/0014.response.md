To analyze the impact of the code snippet, we need to consider the initial state and the specific operations being performed:

### Initial State:
- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ `ai` ≤ 10^9
- `sm` is 0
- `m` is a dictionary
- `ans` is 0
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `cnt` is increased by `m[a[i] + 1]` if `a[i] + 1` exists in `m`
- `diff` is updated to `diff + a[i] * m[a[i]]` if `a[i]` exists in `m`

### Code Impact:
- The code updates `diff` by adding `(a[i] + 1) * m[a[i] + 1]` to it. 
- We need to check whether `a[i] + 1` exists in dictionary `m`. If it does, its value is multiplied by `a[i] + 1` and added to `diff`.
- Since we do not have specific values for `a[i]`, `m`, or `diff`, we can only describe how the state could change based on the existence of `a[i] + 1` in `m`.

### Output State:
Considering we do not know the specific values but the operations depend on the presence of `a[i] + 1` in `m`, the output reflects that `diff` is potentially updated but we do not have the exact value. So, the output state will indicate the possibility of the update based on the conditions provided.

Output State: **`diff` is potentially updated by adding the value of `(a[i] + 1) * m[a[i] + 1]` if `a[i] + 1` exists in `m`.**
