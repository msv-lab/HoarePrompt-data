The value of `cnt` is assigned to 0. Since `cnt` was already unchanged and is now explicitly set to 0, the output state reflects this assignment. The other variables, `sm`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `diff`, and `ans`, remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is `sm` is updated by adding `a[i]`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ 10^9, `i` is -1, `cnt` is 0, `diff` is unchanged, and `ans` is unchanged.

Output State: **`sm` is updated by adding `a[i]`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ 10^9, `i` is -1, `cnt` is 0, `diff` is unchanged, and `ans` is unchanged.**
