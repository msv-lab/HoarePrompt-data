Postcondition: ***`sm`, `cnt`, `diff`, and `ans` remain unchanged. If the index `i` is valid and `a[i]` exists in the dictionary `m`, then the count of `a[i]` in `m` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` does not exist in `m`, it is added with a count of 1. If the index `i` is invalid, no operations are performed, and all variables remain unchanged.***
