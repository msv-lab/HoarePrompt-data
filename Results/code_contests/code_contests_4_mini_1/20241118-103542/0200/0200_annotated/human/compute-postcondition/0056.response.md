The value of `ans` is updated by the expression `sm - diff - a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt)`. The variables `sm`, `diff`, `a[i]`, `n`, `i`, and `cnt` are involved in this calculation. Since `sm`, `diff`, `a[i]`, `n`, `i`, and `cnt` remain unchanged as stated, their previous values directly influence the outcome of the expression.

The output state indicates that `ans` has been modified, while `sm`, `diff`, `a[i]`, `n`, `i`, and `cnt` retain their previous values. Therefore, the output state is reflecting the new value of `ans` after the computation based on the current values of the involved variables.

Output State: **`sm`, `diff`, `n`, `i`, and `cnt` remain unchanged; `ans` is updated by adding `sm - diff - a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt)`**
