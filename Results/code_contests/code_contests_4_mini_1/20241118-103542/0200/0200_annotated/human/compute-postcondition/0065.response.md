Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It calculates a result based on the elements in `a` by keeping track of their sum and counts of each unique element. The function iterates through the list in reverse order, using a dictionary to count occurrences and compute a cumulative result (`ans`). Finally, it prints the accumulated result, which reflects the computations done throughout the iterations. There are no checks for empty input or invalid values, assuming valid input as per the constraints.**
