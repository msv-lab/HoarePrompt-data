The operation attempts to increment `sm` by `a[i]`, but access to `a[i]` is invalid due to an invalid index. As a result, none of the variables are modified, and the program cannot proceed with the access. Therefore, the output state reflects that no changes were made.

Output State: **`sm` is unchanged, `cnt` is unchanged, `diff` is unchanged, `ans` is unchanged, and operations cannot be performed due to invalid index access.**
