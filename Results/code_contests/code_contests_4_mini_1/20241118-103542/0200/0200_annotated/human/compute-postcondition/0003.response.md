The code initializes `m` as a new dictionary. The previous values of `n`, `a`, and `sm` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged state of the other variables and the new state of `m`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ `ai` ≤ 10^9; `sm` is 0; `m` is a dictionary**
