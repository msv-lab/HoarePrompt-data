The variable `diff` is updated by adding the product of `(a[i] - 1)` and `m[a[i] - 1]`. The value of `i` is given as `n - 1`, so `a[i]` corresponds to the last element of the list `a`. The variable `cnt` is also defined as `m[a[i] - 1]`, which will be used in the calculation.

Given that `n` is a positive integer in the specified range and `a[i]` satisfies the given constraints, the output state reflects the new value of `diff` after the update. However, since the specific values of `a`, `m`, and `diff` are not provided, we can only describe the impact of the code on the program in a general manner.

Output State: **`diff` is updated by adding (a[n - 1] - 1) * m[a[n - 1] - 1]**
