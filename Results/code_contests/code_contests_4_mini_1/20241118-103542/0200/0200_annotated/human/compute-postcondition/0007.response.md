The variable `diff` is assigned the value 0. The previous values of the other variables remain unchanged: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ `ai` ≤ 10^9, `sm` is 0, `m` is a dictionary, `ans` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, and `cnt` is 0. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the other variables along with the newly assigned value of `diff`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ `ai` ≤ 10^9, `sm` is 0, `m` is a dictionary, `ans` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `cnt` is 0, `diff` is 0**
