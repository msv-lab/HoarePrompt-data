Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ `ai` ≤ 10^9, `sm` is 0, `m` is a dictionary, `ans` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `cnt` is 0, and `diff` is 0. If `a[i] + 1` exists in the dictionary `m`, then `cnt` is increased by `m[a[i] + 1]`, and `diff` is updated to `diff + (a[i] + 1) * m[a[i] + 1]`. If `a[i] + 1` does not exist in `m`, then `cnt` and `diff` remain unchanged. In all cases, the values of `cnt` and `diff` accurately reflect the state of the dictionary `m` and the current value `a[i]`.***
