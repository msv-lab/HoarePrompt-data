Postcondition: ***`sm` is updated by adding `a[i]`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ 10^9, and `i` is -1. If `a[i] - 1` exists in `m`, `cnt` is increased by `m[a[i] - 1]`, and `diff` is updated by adding `(a[i] - 1) * m[a[i] - 1]`. If `a[i] - 1` does not exist in `m`, `cnt` and `diff` remain unchanged. In all cases, `ans` remains unchanged.***
