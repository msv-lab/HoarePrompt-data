The value of `cnt` is incremented by `m[a[i]]`, where `a[i]` is the last element of the list `a`. Given that `a[n - 1]` is present in the dictionary `m`, the previous value of `cnt` is 0. Therefore, `cnt` now holds the value of `m[a[i]]`. Other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ `ai` ≤ 10^9; `sm` is 0; `m` is a dictionary; `ans` is 0; `i` is `n - 1`; `cnt` is `m[a[i]]`; `diff` is 0; and `a[n - 1]` is present in the dictionary `m`.**
