Postcondition: ***`sm`, `ans`, and `n` remain unchanged. If `a[i] + 1` exists in the dictionary `m`, then `cnt` is updated by adding `m[a[i] + 1]`, and `diff` is increased by `(a[i] + 1) * m[a[i] + 1]`. If `a[i] + 1` does not exist in `m`, `cnt` and `diff` remain unchanged, while `sm`, `ans`, and `n` retain their original values.***
