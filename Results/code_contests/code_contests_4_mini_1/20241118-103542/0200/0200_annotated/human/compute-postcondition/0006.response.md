The variable `cnt` is initialized to 0. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `sm`, `m`, `ans`, `i`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this statement. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ `ai` ≤ 10^9, `sm` is 0, `m` is a dictionary, `ans` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, and `cnt` is 0.
