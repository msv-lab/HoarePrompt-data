The value of `sm` is incremented by the value of `a[i]`, while `diff`, `n`, `i`, and `cnt` remain unchanged. The previous value of `sm` affects the new value but is not specified, so we denote it as `sm + a[i]`. The output state reflects the updated variable.

Output State: **`sm` is updated to `sm + a[i]`, `diff`, `n`, `i`, and `cnt` remain unchanged**
