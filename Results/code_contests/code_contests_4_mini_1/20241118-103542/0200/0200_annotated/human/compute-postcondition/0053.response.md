The value of `cnt` is updated by adding `m[a[i] - 1]`. The values of `sm`, `ans`, and `n` remain unchanged as specified. The state of `cnt` will depend on the existing value of `m[a[i] - 1]`, which is unknown. Therefore, the output state reflects that `cnt` is increased by `m[a[i] - 1]`, while the other variables remain the same.

Output State: **`sm` remains unchanged, `ans` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, and `cnt` is increased by `m[a[i] - 1]**
