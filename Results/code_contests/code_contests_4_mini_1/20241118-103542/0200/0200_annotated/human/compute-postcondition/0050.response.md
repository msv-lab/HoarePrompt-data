The value of `cnt` is updated by adding `m[a[i] + 1]` to it. The values of `sm`, `ans`, and `n` remain unchanged, and the previous values of `cnt` and `m[a[i] + 1]` affect the new value of `cnt`. If `a[i] + 1` exists in the dictionary `m`, then `cnt` will increase accordingly; otherwise, it will remain the same if `m[a[i] + 1]` does not exist. 

Therefore, the output state is: `sm` remains unchanged, `ans` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, and `cnt` is updated based on the value of `m[a[i] + 1]`.

Output State: **`sm` remains unchanged, `ans` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, and `cnt` is updated based on the value of `m[a[i] + 1]**
