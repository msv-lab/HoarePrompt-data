Postcondition: ***`sm` is updated by adding `a[i]`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ 10^9. If `a[i]` already exists in the dictionary `m`, its value is incremented by 1; otherwise, `a[i]` is added to `m` with a value of 1. The integer `cnt`, the integer `diff`, and the variable `ans` remain unchanged.***
