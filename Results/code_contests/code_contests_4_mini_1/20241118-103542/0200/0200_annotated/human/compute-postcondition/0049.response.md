Postcondition: ***`sm`, `ans`, and `n` remain unchanged. If `a[i]` exists in the dictionary `m`, then `cnt` is updated to `cnt + m[a[i]]`, and `diff` is updated to `a[i] * m[a[i]]`. If `a[i]` does not exist in `m`, `cnt` and `diff` remain unchanged while `sm`, `ans`, and `n` still retain their original values.***
