Postcondition: ***`sm` is updated by adding `a[i]`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ `ai` ≤ 10^9; `m` is a dictionary containing `a[i]`, `cnt` is an integer, `diff` is an integer, and `ans` remains unchanged.***
