The expression `diff += (a[i] - 1) * m[a[i] - 1]` updates the value of `diff` by adding the product of `(a[i] - 1)` and `m[a[i] - 1]` to it. The previous value of `cnt` is not directly affected by this operation, but the computation relies on the values of `a` and `m`.

Assuming `a[i]` is defined and `m[a[i] - 1]` is accessible, the output state will reflect the new value of `diff`, but since `diff`'s initial value is not provided, we can only describe the impact of the operation. 

Therefore, the output state can be expressed as:
Output State: **`diff` is increased by (a[i] - 1) * m[a[i] - 1]**
