The variable `m` is being updated with the key `a[i]` and assigning it the value `1`. This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `i`, `sm`, `ans`, `cnt`, or `diff`. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables and the update made to `m`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `i` is `n - 1`; `sm` is updated to `sm + a[n - 2]`; `ans` is updated by adding `sm - diff - a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt)`; `cnt` and `diff` remain unchanged if `a[i] - 1` is not in `m`; `m[a[i]]` is set to 1.**
