According to the code, the loop will execute again if the value of `i` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 2`. Since `n` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 200000`, this means that `i` is at least `-1` (when `n` is 1). 

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust `i` to `n - 1`, which is the next value to be processed in the loop (i.e., the loop should start from `n - 1`).

Thus, we will also need to ensure that `n` remains unchanged as it doesn't need to be adjusted for the next iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `i` is `n - 1; sm` is the sum of `a[n - 1]` and `a[n - 2]; ans` is updated by adding `sm - diff - a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt); if `a[i]` is already a key in the dictionary `m`, its corresponding value is incremented by 1.**
