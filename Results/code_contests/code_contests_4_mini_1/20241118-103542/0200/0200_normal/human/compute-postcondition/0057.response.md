The value of `sm` is updated by adding `a[i]` to it. The previous value of `sm` was the sum of `a[n - 1]` and `a[n - 2]`, and the value of `a[i]` is `a[n - 2]` since `i` is `n - 1`. Therefore, `sm` now becomes `sm + a[n - 2]`. The other variables remain unchanged, so the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `i` is `n - 1`; `sm` is updated to `sm + a[n - 2]`; `ans` is updated by adding `sm - diff - a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt)`; `cnt` and `diff` remain unchanged if `a[i] - 1` is not in `m`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `i` is `n - 1`; `sm` is updated to `sm + a[n - 2]`; `ans` is updated by adding `sm - diff - a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt)`; `cnt` and `diff` remain unchanged if `a[i] - 1` is not in `m`.**
