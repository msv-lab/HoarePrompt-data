The variable `cnt` is initialized to `0`, but no other variables are affected by this assignment. The previous values of `n`, `i`, `sm`, and `ans` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `cnt` has been set to `0`, while the other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `i` is `n - 1`; `sm` is the sum of `a[n - 1]` and `a[n - 2]; ans` is updated by adding `sm - diff - a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt); `cnt` is 0.**
