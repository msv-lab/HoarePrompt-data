According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is a positive integer, which it is (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000). The loop iterates from `n - 1` down to `0`, and the loop variable `i` starts at `n - 1` and decrements until it reaches `0`. 

Before the loop starts, the values of `n`, `i`, and other variables are relevant. Since `i` will be initialized to `n - 1` when the loop starts, and since `n` is within its defined range, no adjustments are necessary for the execution of the loop itself. 

The state of `sm`, `m`, and `ans` does not influence the ability of the loop to execute, but for clarity, we note that `i` will start at `n - 1`. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `i` is `n - 1`, `sm` is 0, `m` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is 0**
