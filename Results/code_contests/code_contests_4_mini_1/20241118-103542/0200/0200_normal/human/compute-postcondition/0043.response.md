Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `i` is `n - 2`; `sm` is the sum of `a[n - 1]` and `a[n - 2]`; `ans` is updated by adding `sm - diff - a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt)`. If `a[i]` is already a key in the dictionary `m`, its corresponding value is incremented by 1; otherwise, `m[a[i]]` is initialized to 1.***
