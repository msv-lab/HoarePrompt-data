Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `i` is `n - 1`, `sm` is 0, `m` is a dictionary containing the key `a[i]` and its corresponding value, `ans` is 0. If `a[i] + 1` exists in `m`, then `cnt` is updated to `cnt + m[a[i] + 1]`, and `diff` is updated to include the product of `(a[i] + 1) * m[a[i] + 1]`. If `a[i] + 1` does not exist in `m`, the values of `cnt` and `diff` remain unchanged, preserving their previous values.***
