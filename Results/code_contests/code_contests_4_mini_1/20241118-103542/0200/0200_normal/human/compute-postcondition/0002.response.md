The variable `sm` is initialized to 0. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this assignment. The list `a` is also unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000; `a` is a list of integers derived from the raw input; `sm` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000; `a` is a list of integers derived from the raw input; `sm` is 0**
