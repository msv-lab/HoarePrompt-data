The value of `diff` is increased by the product of `(a[i] - 1)` and `m[a[i] - 1]`. The variable `i` is `n - 1`, so `a[i]` refers to the element at index `n - 1`. The values of `m[a[i] - 1]` and `a[i]` depend on the specific values in the array `a` and the dictionary `m`. 

Since `m` contains the key `a[i]`, we can assume `m[a[i] - 1]` is defined. The output state will reflect the updated value of `diff` based on the operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `i` is `n - 1`, `sm` is 0, `m` is a dictionary containing the key `a[i]` and its corresponding value, `ans` is 0, `cnt` is incremented by `m[a[i] - 1]`, and `diff` is updated by adding `(a[i] - 1) * m[a[i] - 1]`**.
