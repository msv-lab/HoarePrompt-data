Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `i` is `n - 1`, `sm` is 0, `m` is a dictionary containing the key `a[i]` and its corresponding value, `ans` is 0, and if `a[i] - 1` exists in `m`, then `cnt` is incremented by `m[a[i] - 1]` and `diff` is updated by adding `(a[i] - 1) * m[a[i] - 1]`. If `a[i] - 1` does not exist in `m`, the values of `cnt` and `diff` remain unchanged. This accounts for the case where `a[i]` could be the minimum value (1) where `a[i] - 1` would not exist in `m`, ensuring that `cnt` and `diff` are preserved.***
