Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `i` is `n - 1`; `sm` is updated to `sm + a[n - 2]`; `ans` is updated by adding `sm - diff - a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt)`; `cnt` and `diff` remain unchanged if `a[i] - 1` is not in `m`. The count of occurrences of `a[i]` in `m` is incremented by 1 if `a[i]` is already present; otherwise, it is initialized to 1.***
