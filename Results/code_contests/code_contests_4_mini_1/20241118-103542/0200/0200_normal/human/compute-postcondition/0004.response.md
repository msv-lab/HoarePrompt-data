The variable `ans` is initialized to 0. The previous values of `n`, `a`, `sm`, and `m` remain unchanged, as this line simply assigns a value to `ans`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `ans` is now 0, while the other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `a` is a list of integers derived from the raw input; `sm` is 0; `m` is an empty dictionary; `ans` is 0**
