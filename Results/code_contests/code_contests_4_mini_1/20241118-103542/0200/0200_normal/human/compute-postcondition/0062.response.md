Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `i` will take values from `n - 1` down to `0`; `sm` is the sum of elements in `a` from index `n - 1` down to `0`; `ans` will accumulate a value based on the calculations involving `sm`, `diff`, and `cnt` for each element processed; the dictionary `m` will contain counts of each element in `a` encountered so far. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute and `sm`, `ans`, and `m` remain unchanged (0 for `sm` and `ans`, and empty for `m`).**
