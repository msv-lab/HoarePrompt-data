The code snippet `m[a[i]] += 1` increments the value associated with the key `a[i]` in the dictionary `m`. The previous values of the affected variables are as follows: `a[i]` is an element of the list `a`, `m` is a dictionary containing the key `a[i]`, and the state of `m` will change by increasing the count of the occurrence of the element `a[i]`. The values of `n`, `i`, `sm`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `i` is `n - 1`, `sm` is `a[n - 1]`, `m` has the key `a[i]` with its value incremented by 1, and `ans` is updated by adding `sm - diff - a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt)`**
