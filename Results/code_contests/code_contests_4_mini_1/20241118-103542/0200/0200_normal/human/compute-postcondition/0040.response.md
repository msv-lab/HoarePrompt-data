The code `sm += a[i]` increments the value of `sm` by the value of `a[i]`. Given that `sm` was previously assigned the value `a[n - 1]`, after executing the code, the new value of `sm` becomes the sum of its previous value and `a[i]`. The variable `i` is `n - 2`, which allows us to access the value of `a[i]`. The states of other variables (`n`, `ans`, `cnt`, `diff`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `i` is `n - 2`; `sm` is the updated value `a[n - 1] + a[n - 2]`; `ans` is updated by adding `sm - diff - a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt)`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `i` is `n - 2`; `sm` is `a[n - 1] + a[n - 2]`; `ans` is updated by adding `sm - diff - a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt)`**.
