According to the code, the loop iterates from `n - 1` down to `0`. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 1`, which means it has just executed for the value `i = n - 1`. 

To execute the loop one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1. Therefore, `i` needs to be adjusted to `n - 2`. The loop will still be valid since `n` is a positive integer, and `n - 2` will be greater than or equal to `0` as long as `n` is at least `2`.

No other states need to be adjusted because `n`, `sm`, `ans`, and `m` do not depend on the loop's condition for the next iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `i` is `n - 2`, `sm` is `a[n - 1]`, `ans` is updated by adding `sm - diff - a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt)`, and `m` contains the key `a[i]` with its corresponding count.**
