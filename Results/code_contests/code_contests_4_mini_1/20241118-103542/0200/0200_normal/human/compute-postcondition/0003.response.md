The variable `m` is assigned an empty dictionary. The values of `n`, `a`, and `sm` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `a` is a list of integers derived from the raw input; `sm` is 0; `m` is an empty dictionary.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `a` is a list of integers derived from the raw input; `sm` is 0; `m` is an empty dictionary**
