The variable `diff` is assigned the value `0`. This assignment does not affect any other variables, as it is a standalone operation. The previous values of the affected variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `i` is `n - 2`; `sm` is `a[n - 1]`; `ans` is updated by adding `sm - diff - a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt)`; `m` contains the key `a[i]` with its corresponding count; `cnt` is 0; `diff` is 0.**
