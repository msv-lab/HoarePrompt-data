The code increments `cnt` by the value of `m[a[i] - 1]`. Since the initial state indicates that `n` is a positive integer, and consequently `i` is defined as `n - 1`, we need to check the value of `a[i] - 1`. However, without the specific values of `a` and `m`, we cannot determine the exact changes to `cnt`. 

Thus, the output state reflects that `cnt` is increased by the value of `m[a[i] - 1]`, but the exact value of `cnt` cannot be determined without additional information about `m` and the contents of the array `a`.

Output State: **`cnt` is increased by `m[a[i] - 1]`**
