Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `i` is `n - 2`; `sm` is `a[n - 1]`; if `a[i]` exists in the map `m`, then `cnt` is increased by `m[a[i]]`, and `diff` is updated to include the product of `a[i]` and `m[a[i]]`. The variable `ans` is updated by adding `sm - diff - a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt)`. If `a[i]` is not in `m`, `cnt` and `diff` remain unchanged.***
