Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `i` is `n - 1`, `sm` is 0, `m` is a dictionary containing the key `a[i]` and its corresponding value, `ans` is 0. If `a[i]` exists in `m`, then `cnt` is updated to the value `m[a[i]]`, and `diff` is updated to the product of `a[i]` and `m[a[i]]`. If `a[i]` does not exist in `m`, `cnt` and `diff` remain unchanged, preserving their values of 0.***
