The value of `cnt` is incremented by the value of `m[a[i] - 1]`. The variable `i` is `n - 1`, so `a[i]` corresponds to the value at index `n - 1` in the array `a`. The value of `a[i] - 1` exists as a key in the dictionary `m`, which means `m[a[i] - 1]` is defined and can be accessed. The previous values of `cnt` and the specific value of `m[a[i] - 1]` are not provided, but we know that `cnt` retains its previous value. Thus, the output state reflects the increment of `cnt` by the value of `m[a[i] - 1]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `i` is `n - 1`, `sm` is 0, `m` is a dictionary containing the key `a[i]` and its corresponding value, `ans` is 0, `cnt` is incremented by `m[a[i] - 1]`, and `diff` retains its previous value.**
