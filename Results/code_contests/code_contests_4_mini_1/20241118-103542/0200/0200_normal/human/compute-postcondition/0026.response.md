Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `i` is `n - 1`, `sm` is `a[n - 1]`, and `ans` is updated by adding `sm - diff - a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt)`. If `a[i]` is already a key in dictionary `m`, its value is incremented by 1; otherwise, `m` now contains the key `a[i]` with a value of 1.***
