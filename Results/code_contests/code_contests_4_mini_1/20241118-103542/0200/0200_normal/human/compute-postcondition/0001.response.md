The variable `a` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the input obtained from `raw_input()`. Since `n` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, the `list(map(int, raw_input().split()))` will create a list of integers based on the space-separated values provided as input. Other variables are not affected, so the output state indicates that `a` is a list of integers derived from the input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000; `a` is a list of integers derived from the raw input**
