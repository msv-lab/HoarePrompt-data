According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 1`, which means it was decremented after the last iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `n - 2`. 

Since `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `i` can take values from `n - 1` down to 0. Thus, if `i` was `n - 1` at the end of the last iteration, it will be `n - 2` at the start of the next iteration. 

No other states need to be adjusted since `sm`, `ans`, `cnt`, and `diff` are not specified to change during this loop's control.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `i` is `n - 2`; `sm` is updated to `sm + a[n - 2]`; `ans` is updated by adding `sm - diff - a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt)`; `cnt` and `diff` remain unchanged if `a[i] - 1` is not in `m`.**
