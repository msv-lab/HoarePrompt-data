Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `i` is `n - 1`; `sm` is the sum of `a[n - 1]` and `a[n - 2]; `ans` is updated by adding `sm - diff - a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt); if `a[i]` is in `m`, then `cnt` is increased by `m[a[i]]` and `diff` is updated by adding `a[i] * m[a[i]]`. If `a[i]` is not in `m`, `cnt` and `diff` remain unchanged.***
