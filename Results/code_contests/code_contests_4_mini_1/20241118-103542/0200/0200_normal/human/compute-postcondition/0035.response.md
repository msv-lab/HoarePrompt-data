Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `i` is `n - 2`; `sm` is `a[n - 1]`. If `a[i] + 1` exists in map `m`, then `cnt` is increased by `m[a[i] + 1]`, and `diff` is updated to include the product of `a[i] + 1` and `m[a[i] + 1]`, while `ans` remains unchanged. If `a[i] + 1` does not exist in `m`, then `cnt` and `diff` remain unchanged, and the values of `ans`, `sm`, and other variables are preserved.***
