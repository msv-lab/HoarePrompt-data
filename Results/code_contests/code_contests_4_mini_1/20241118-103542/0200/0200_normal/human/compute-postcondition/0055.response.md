Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `i` is `n - 1`; `sm` is the sum of `a[n - 1]` and `a[n - 2]`; `ans` is updated by adding `sm - diff - a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt)`. If `a[i] - 1` is present in the map `m`, then `cnt` is increased by `m[a[i] - 1]`, and `diff` is updated by adding `(a[i] - 1) * m[a[i] - 1]`. If `a[i] - 1` is not present in `m`, `cnt` and `diff` remain unchanged. All scenarios are properly handled, ensuring that `diff` only changes when `a[i] - 1` is in `m`.***
