The value of `sm` is incremented by `a[i]`, where `i` is `n - 1`. Since `i` is `n - 1`, `a[i]` refers to the last element of the array `a`, denoted as `a[n - 1]`. The previous value of `sm` is 0. Therefore, after executing the code, `sm` will be equal to `a[n - 1]`. Other variables (`n`, `i`, `m`, `ans`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `i` is `n - 1`, `sm` is `a[n - 1]`, `m` is a dictionary containing the key `a[i]`, `ans` is updated by adding `sm - diff - a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt)**
