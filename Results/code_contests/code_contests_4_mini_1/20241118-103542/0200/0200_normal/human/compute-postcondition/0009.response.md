The variable `cnt` is incremented by the value of `m[a[i]]`. Since `a[i]` is present in the dictionary `m`, the value of `m[a[i]]` is defined. The previous value of `cnt` is 0, so after execution, `cnt` becomes `0 + m[a[i]]`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `i` is `n - 1`, `sm` is 0, `m` is a dictionary containing at least the key `a[i]`, `ans` is 0, `cnt` is now `m[a[i]]`, and `diff` is 0.
