The code assigns the value `1` to the key `a[i]` in the dictionary `m`. The initial state indicates that `m` does not contain the key `a[i]`, so this operation will successfully add the key-value pair. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `sm`, `cnt`, `ans`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `i` is `n - 1`, `sm` is `a[n - 1]`, `m` now contains the key `a[i]` with value 1, and `ans` is updated by adding `sm - diff - a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt)`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `i` is `n - 1`, `sm` is `a[n - 1]`, `m` now contains the key `a[i]` with value 1, and `ans` is updated by adding `sm - diff - a[i] * (n - i - 1 - cnt)`**.
