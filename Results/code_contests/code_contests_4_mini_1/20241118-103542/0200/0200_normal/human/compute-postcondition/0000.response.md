The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`, which means it takes an input as a string and converts it to an integer. The other variables remain unchanged because this line only affects `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer and falls within the range of 1 to 200000, the output state will reflect that.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000**
