The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It processes the list in reverse order, calculating a cumulative value `ans` based on the sum of elements and their counts in a dictionary. The function prints the final computed value `ans`, which reflects the relationships between the elements in `a` and their adjacent values. If `n` is 0, no processing occurs, and the output is simply 0. However, the function does not handle cases where `n` is negative or not an integer, which could lead to erroneous behavior.
