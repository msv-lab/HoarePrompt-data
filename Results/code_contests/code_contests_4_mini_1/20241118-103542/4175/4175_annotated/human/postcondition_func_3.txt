The function accepts a sequence `v`, which is expected to be a list or similar collection of integers (0 or 1), and returns the result of `func_3(v)` concatenated with the tuple (0, 0). It assumes `func_3(v)` returns a sequence that can be concatenated with the tuple. The function does not handle cases where `func_3(v)` might fail or return an unexpected type.
