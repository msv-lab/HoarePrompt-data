The function accepts an integer `v`. If `v` is greater than 0, it returns a list of tuples where the first part contains tuples `(i, 0)` for `i` from 1 to `v`, followed by the tuples `(v, 1)` and `(v - 1, 1)`, and then continues with tuples `(i, 0)` for `i` from `v - 1` down to 1. If `v` is less than 0, it returns the reversed result of `func_3(-v)`. If `v` is equal to 0, the function does not specify a return value, which indicates undefined behavior.
