Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that `1 <= N <= 8`, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `ind` is 0. If the condition `(i >> ind) % 2 == 0` holds true and the element `s2[i + 2 ** ind]` is '1', then the variable `ok` is set to False. If either condition is not satisfied, the value of `ok` remains unchanged.***
