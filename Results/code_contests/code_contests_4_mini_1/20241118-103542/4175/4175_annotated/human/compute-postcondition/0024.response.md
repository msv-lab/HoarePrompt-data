The variable `ok` is assigned the value `False`. The values of the other variables (`N`, `n`, `i`, `ind`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that `1 <= N <= 8`, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `ind` is 0, and `ok` is False.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that `1 <= N <= 8`, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `ind` is 0, and `ok` is False**
