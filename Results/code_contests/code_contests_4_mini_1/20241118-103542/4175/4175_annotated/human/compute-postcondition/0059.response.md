The code executes a print statement that concatenates the string representations of the variables `x` and `y` with a space in between. The values of `x` and `y` are both 0. Therefore, the output of the print statement will be the string "0 0". The other variables remain unchanged after this operation.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that `1 <= N <= 8`, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `ret_path` is a list starting with (0, 0) followed by elements from `func_4(v)` for each `v` in `ret_gp`, `ok` is true, 'Possible' has been printed, the length of `ret_path` minus 1 has been printed, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, and the output is "0 0".**
