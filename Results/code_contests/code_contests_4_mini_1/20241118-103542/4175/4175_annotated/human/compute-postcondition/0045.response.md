According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `ind` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `ind` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `ind` is 1, and `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `ind` needs to be incremented by 1, so it will become 2. Since `n` is at least 2 (to allow for another iteration), we can conclude that for the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least 2.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that `1 <= N <= 8`, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, `s` is an empty list, `ind` is 2**
