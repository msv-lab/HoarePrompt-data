Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that `1 <= N <= 8`, `n` is a positive integer derived from `int(s1)` and is greater than or equal to 1, and `ret_path` is a list starting with (0, 0) followed by elements from `func_4(v)` for each `v` in `ret_gp`. If `ok` is true, the output is "Possible", the length of `ret_path` minus one, and each pair of integers from `ret_path` is printed. If `ok` is false, the output is "Impossible". If `ret_path` contains only the pair (0, 0), only that pair is printed, while if it contains additional pairs, those pairs are printed in order. The state of the program ensures that `ret_path` is never empty given the precondition.***
