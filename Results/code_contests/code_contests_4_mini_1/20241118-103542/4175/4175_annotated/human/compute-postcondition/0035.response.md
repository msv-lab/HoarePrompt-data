Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that `1 <= N <= 8`, `n` is a positive integer derived from `int(s1)` and is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, and `s` is [1]. If `s2[i]` is '0', the variable `ok` may change depending on the evaluations of the conditions in the loop for each `ind` from 0 to `n-1`, and `ret_gp` is incremented by the return value of `func_2(s)`. If `s2[i]` is not '0', the loop and the associated updates to `ok` and `ret_gp` are not executed.***
