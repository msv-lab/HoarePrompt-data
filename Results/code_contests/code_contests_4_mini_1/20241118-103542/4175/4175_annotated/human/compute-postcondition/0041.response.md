Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that `1 <= N <= 8`, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `s` is an empty list. If `i` shifted right by `ind` modulo 2 equals 0 and the element at index `i + 2 ** ind` in `s2` is '1', then `ok` is set to False. Otherwise, if the condition is not met, the value of `ok` remains unchanged.***
