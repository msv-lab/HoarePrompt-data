Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that `1 <= N <= 8`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `s` is either `[]` or `[2]`, the third element of `s2` (i.e., `s2[2]`) is '0'. If `i >> ind` is an even number and `s2[i + 2 ** ind]` is '1', then `ok` is set to False. Otherwise, there is no change to `ok`.***
