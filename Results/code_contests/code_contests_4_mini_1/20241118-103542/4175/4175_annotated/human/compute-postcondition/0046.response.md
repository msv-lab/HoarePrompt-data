The variable `ok` is assigned the value `False`. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed, and since there are no calculations or changes to other variables, the output state reflects the assignment of `ok`. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that `1 <= N <= 8`, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, `s` is an empty list, `ind` is 2, and `ok` is False**
