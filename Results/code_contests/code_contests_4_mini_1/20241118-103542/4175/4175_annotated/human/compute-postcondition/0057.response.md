The code executes a `print` statement that outputs the length of `ret_path` minus 1. The variable `ret_path` is a list that starts with (0, 0) and is followed by elements derived from `func_4(v)` for each `v` in `ret_gp`. The exact length of `ret_path` is not specified in the initial state, but it will be at least 1 since it starts with (0, 0). Therefore, `len(ret_path)` will be at least 1, making `len(ret_path) - 1` at least 0.

Since `ret_path` contains at least the initial element (0, 0), the output will depend on the total number of elements within `ret_path`. The program will print this length minus 1.

Thus, the output state will include the length of `ret_path` minus 1. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that `1 <= N <= 8`, `n` is a positive integer derived from `int(s1)` and is greater than or equal to 1, `ret_path` is a list starting with (0, 0) followed by elements from `func_4(v)` for each `v` in `ret_gp`, `ok` is true, and 'Possible' has been printed; the length of `ret_path` minus 1 has been printed.**
