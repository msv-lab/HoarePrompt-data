According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `ind` and `n`. The loop will continue as long as `ind` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `ind` is 0 and `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `ind` needs to be increased to 1.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that `1 <= N <= 8`, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `ind` is 1**
