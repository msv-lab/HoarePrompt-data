Output State: **`ret_path` contains pairs of integers with at least one pair (0, 0) at the start. If `ret_path` has at least one additional pair, the loop will execute and `x` and `y` will take the values of the current pair from `ret_path`. If `ret_path` only contains (0, 0), the loop will execute once, outputting "0 0". If `ret_path` is empty (which contradicts the initial state), the loop will not execute, and `x` and `y` will not be defined.**
