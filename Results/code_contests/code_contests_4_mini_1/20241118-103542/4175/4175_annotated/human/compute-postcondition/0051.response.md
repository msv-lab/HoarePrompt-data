Postcondition: ***If `s2[i]` is '0', then the loop will execute `n` times, checking that for each `ind`, if `(i >> ind) % 2 == 0` and `s2[i + 2 ** ind]` is '1', the variable `ok` remains unchanged. The function `func_2(s)` is called with `s`, which is an empty list. The state of `ret_gp` is updated based on the return value of `func_2(s)`. If `s2[i]` is not '0', no changes occur in the variables. Hence, after execution, `N` remains a positive integer between 1 and 8, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is still 0, and `s` remains an empty list, with `ret_gp` reflecting the results of `func_2(s)` if the conditions were met.***
