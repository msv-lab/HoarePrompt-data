According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `ind` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `ind` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `ind` is 2 and `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `ind` must be incremented from 2 to 3. Therefore, `ind` needs to be adjusted to 3, and `n` must be maintained as it is since it is already greater than or equal to 2.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that `1 <= N <= 8`, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `ind` is 3**
