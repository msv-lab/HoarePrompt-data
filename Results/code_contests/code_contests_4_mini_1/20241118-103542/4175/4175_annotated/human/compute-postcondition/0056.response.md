The `print` statement outputs the string 'Possible'. The values of the variables `N`, `n`, `ret_path`, and `ok` remain unchanged as the print operation does not affect them. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of these variables along with the printed output.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that `1 <= N <= 8`, `n` is a positive integer derived from `int(s1)` and is greater than or equal to 1, `ret_path` is a list starting with (0, 0) followed by elements from `func_4(v)` for each `v` in `ret_gp`, `ok` is true, and 'Possible' has been printed.**
