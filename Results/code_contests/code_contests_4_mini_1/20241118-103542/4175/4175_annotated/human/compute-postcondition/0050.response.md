Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that `1 <= N <= 8`, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `s` is an empty list, and the loop will execute `n` times, with conditions checking `(i >> ind) % 2 == 0`. The function `func_2(s)` is called for each valid condition, but without specific values for `s` and the result of `func_2(s)`, the output state remains unchanged.**
