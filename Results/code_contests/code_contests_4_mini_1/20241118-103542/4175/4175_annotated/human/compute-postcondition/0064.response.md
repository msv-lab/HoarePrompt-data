According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `ret_path`. The loop iterates over the elements in `ret_path`, specifically pairs of `(x, y)`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `ret_path` starts with `(0, 0)` and has at least 2 additional elements from `func_4(v)`, meaning it contains at least 3 pairs in total. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are more pairs to iterate over.

Given that `x` is the first element of the third pair in `ret_path` and `y` is the second element of the third pair, the loop must be modified to account for the next pair in `ret_path`. This means that for the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least 4 pairs in `ret_path`.

As a result, the states to be adjusted are:
1. The length of `ret_path` must be at least 4.
2. The new values of `x` and `y` should be updated to represent the fourth pair in `ret_path`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that `1 <= N <= 8`, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `ret_path` is a list starting with (0, 0) followed by at least 3 additional elements from `func_4(v)`, `ok` is true, 'Possible' has been printed, the length of `ret_path` minus 1 has been printed, `x` is the first element of the fourth pair in `ret_path`, `y` is the second element of the fourth pair in `ret_path`, and the output is "x y".**
