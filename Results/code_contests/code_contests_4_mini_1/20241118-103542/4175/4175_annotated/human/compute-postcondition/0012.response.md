Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that `1 <= N <= 8`, `n` is greater than 3, `i` is 2, `s` is either `[]` or `[2]`, the third element of `s2` (i.e., `s2[2]`) is '0', `ind` is 3, and if `(i >> ind) % 2 == 0` and `s2[i + 2 ** ind] == '1'`, then `ok` is set to False; otherwise, `ok` remains unchanged.***
