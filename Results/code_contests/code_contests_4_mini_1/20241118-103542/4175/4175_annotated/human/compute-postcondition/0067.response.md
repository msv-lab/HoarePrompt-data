The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'Impossible'. This does not change the values of any variables, which remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is a positive integer such that `1 <= N <= 8`, `n` is a positive integer derived from `int(s1)` and is greater than or equal to 1, `ret_path` is a list starting with (0, 0) followed by elements from `func_4(v)` for each `v` in `ret_gp`, and the condition `ok` is false.
