To determine the output state after executing the given code snippet, we need to analyze how the code operates based on the initial state provided.

Initial State: `N` is a positive integer such that `1 <= N <= 8`, `n` is a positive integer derived from `int(s1)` and is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, and `s` is [1].

The code snippet provided is:
```
s = [(v + 1) for v in range(n) if (i >> v) % 2 == 1]
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding the Range**: `range(n)` generates numbers from `0` to `n-1`.
2. **Bitwise Operation**: The expression `(i >> v) % 2` checks if the `v`-th bit of `i` is set (i.e., equals `1`). Since `i` is initially `0`, all bits are `0`. Consequently, the expression `(0 >> v) % 2` will always evaluate to `0` for any `v`, meaning the condition will never be satisfied.
3. **List Comprehension**: Since the condition is never met, the list comprehension will generate an empty list.

### Final State:
- The variable `s` is reassigned to an empty list `[]`.
- The values of `N`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged: 
  - `N` is a positive integer between `1` and `8`.
  - `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `1`.
  - `i` is `0`.

Thus, the output state reflecting the final values of the variables is:
Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that `1 <= N <= 8`, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `s` is []**
