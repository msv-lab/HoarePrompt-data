The code prints the values of `x` and `y` as a string, separated by a space. The variable `x` is the first element of the third pair in `ret_path`, and `y` is the second element of the third pair in `ret_path`. Since `ret_path` starts with (0, 0) and contains at least 2 additional elements, `x` and `y` are defined. The output format is "x y".

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that `1 <= N <= 8`, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `ret_path` is a list starting with (0, 0) followed by at least 2 additional elements from `func_4(v)`, `ok` is true, 'Possible' has been printed, the length of `ret_path` minus 1 has been printed, `x` is the first element of the third pair in `ret_path`, `y` is the second element of the third pair in `ret_path`, and the output is "x y".**
