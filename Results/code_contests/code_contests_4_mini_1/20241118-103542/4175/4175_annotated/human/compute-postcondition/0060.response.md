According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `ret_path` list. The loop will execute for each pair `(x, y)` in `ret_path`. At the end of the last iteration, `ret_path` has been established with at least one element (the starting point (0, 0)). 

Since `ret_path` starts with (0, 0), the next iteration will require that `ret_path` has more than one element for the loop to execute again. This means that for the loop to execute one more time, `ret_path` must contain at least two pairs, which includes the starting (0, 0) and at least one more pair derived from the elements of `func_4(v)`.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `ret_path` should contain at least two pairs of coordinates, which implies `ret_path` has at least one additional element apart from (0, 0). We also need to increment `x` and `y` to the next values in `ret_path`, which will be the second pair derived from the list.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that `1 <= N <= 8`, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `ret_path` is a list starting with (0, 0) followed by at least one additional element from `func_4(v)`, `ok` is true, 'Possible' has been printed, the length of `ret_path` minus 1 has been printed, `x` is the first element of the second pair in `ret_path`, `y` is the second element of the second pair in `ret_path`, and the output is "x y".**
