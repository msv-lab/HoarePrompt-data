The variable `ok` is assigned the value `False`. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is a positive integer such that `1 <= N <= 8`, `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 2, `s` is either `[]` or `[2]`, the third element of `s2` (i.e., `s2[2]`) is '0', `ind` is 4, and `ok` is set to `False`.
