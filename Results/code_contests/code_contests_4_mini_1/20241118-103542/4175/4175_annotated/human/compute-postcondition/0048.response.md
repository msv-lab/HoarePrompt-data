According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `ind` and `n`. The loop iterates from `0` to `n-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `ind` is 2 and `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `ind` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, it will be 3 for the next iteration. Since `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `n` must also be greater than 3 to ensure that the loop can execute again.

Thus, the necessary adjustments to the states are:
- `ind` should be updated to 3.
- `n` should be adjusted to be greater than 3.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that `1 <= N <= 8`, `n` is a positive integer greater than 3, `i` is 0, `s` is an empty list, `ind` is 3**
