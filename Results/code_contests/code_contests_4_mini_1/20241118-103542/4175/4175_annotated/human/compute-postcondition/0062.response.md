According to the code, the loop iterates over the elements in `ret_path`. The loop will continue executing as long as there are elements in `ret_path` to unpack into `(x, y)`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `ret_path` starts with (0, 0) followed by at least one additional element from `func_4(v)`, meaning there are at least 2 pairs in the list. The current values for `x` and `y` correspond to the first element of the second pair in `ret_path`.

For the loop to execute one more time, there needs to be at least one more pair in `ret_path` after the current pair being processed. Since the loop iterates over every pair in `ret_path`, `ret_path` must contain at least 3 pairs for the loop to execute again.

Thus, we need to adjust the state of `ret_path` such that it contains at least 3 pairs. The next pair after the current one will be unpacked into `x` and `y`. Therefore, we adjust the state accordingly.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that `1 <= N <= 8`, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `ret_path` is a list starting with (0, 0) followed by at least 2 additional elements from `func_4(v)`, `ok` is true, 'Possible' has been printed, the length of `ret_path` minus 1 has been printed, `x` is the first element of the third pair in `ret_path`, `y` is the second element of the third pair in `ret_path`, and the output is "x y".**
