Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that `1 <= N <= 8`, `n` is a positive integer derived from `int(s1)`, `i` is 2, and `s` is either `[]` or `[2]`. If `s2[i]` is '0' and `n` is greater than 0, `ret_gp` is incremented by the return value of `func_2(s)` after executing a loop `n` times that checks if `(i >> ind) % 2 == 0` and `s2[i + 2 ** ind]` is '1' for each `ind` in the range of `n`. If `n` is 0, `ret_gp` remains unchanged. Furthermore, `ok` is set to False if any of the conditions in the loop are satisfied.***
