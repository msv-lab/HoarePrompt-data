The value of `ok` is assigned `False`. The previous values of the affected variables do not change, and the state of the other variables remains the same. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is a positive integer such that `1 <= N <= 8`, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `s` is an empty list, `i` shifted right by `ind` modulo 2 equals 0, and `ok` is False.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that `1 <= N <= 8`, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `s` is an empty list, `i` shifted right by `ind` modulo 2 equals 0, and `ok` is False**
