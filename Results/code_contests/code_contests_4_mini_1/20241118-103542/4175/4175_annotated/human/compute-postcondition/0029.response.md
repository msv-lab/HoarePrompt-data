According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `ind` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `ind` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `ind` is 1, and `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `ind` needs to be incremented to 2, and `n` must be at least 2 (since `ind` must be less than `n` for the loop to continue).

Therefore, we need to adjust the state as follows:
- `ind` should be 2.
- `n` should be at least 2.

No other states need to be adjusted. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that `1 <= N <= 8`, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `ind` is 2**
