The variable `ok` is assigned the value `False`. The other variables `N`, `n`, `i`, and `ind` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `ok` along with the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that `1 <= N <= 8`, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `ind` is 1, `ok` is False**
