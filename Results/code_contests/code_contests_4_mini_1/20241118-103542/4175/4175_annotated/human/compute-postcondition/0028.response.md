Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that `1 <= N <= 8`, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `ind` is 1. If the condition `(i >> ind) % 2 == 0` is true and `s2[i + 2 ** ind]` equals '1', then `ok` is set to False. If either condition fails, the value of `ok` remains unchanged.***
