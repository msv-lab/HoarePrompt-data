The variable `ok` is assigned the value `False`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is a positive integer such that `1 <= N <= 8`, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `s` is an empty list, `ind` is 1, and `ok` is False.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that `1 <= N <= 8`, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `s` is an empty list, `ind` is 1, and `ok` is False**
