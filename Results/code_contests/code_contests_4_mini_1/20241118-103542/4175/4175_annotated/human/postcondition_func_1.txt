The function accepts a sequence `s` of binary values and returns a list that consists of the last element of `s` if the sequence without its last element is empty. If not, it returns a list that includes the last element followed by the result of recursively calling itself with the rest of the sequence, the result of calling another function `func_1` on that same recursive result, and the negative of the last element. The function does not handle cases where `func_1` might fail or be undefined, which could lead to errors.
