The function accepts an integer `v`. If `v` is positive, it returns a list of tuples consisting of pairs (i, 0) for i from 1 to `v`, followed by (v, 1), (v - 1, 1), and then pairs (i, 0) for i from `v - 1` down to 1. If `v` is negative, it returns the reversed result of `func_3` applied to the positive equivalent of `v`. The function does not handle the case where `v` equals 0, leading to no return value for that specific input.
