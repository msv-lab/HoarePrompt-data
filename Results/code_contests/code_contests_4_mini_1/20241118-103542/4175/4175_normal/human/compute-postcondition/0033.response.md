Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 8, `n` is at least 1, `ind` is in the range [0, n-1], `s2` is a string of length 2^N. `ok` is set to False if for any `ind` in the range `0` to `n-1`, the condition `((i >> ind) % 2) == 0` holds true and `s2[i + 2^ind]` is '1'. If `n` is 0 or less, the loop does not execute and `ok` remains unchanged.**
