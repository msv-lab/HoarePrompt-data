According to the code, the loop iterates over the `ret_path` list, which starts with (0, 0) and is followed by elements from `func_4(v)` for each `v` in `ret_gp`. The loop will execute again if there is at least one more element in `ret_path` after the current iteration.

At the end of the last iteration, the values of `x` and `y` were both 0, which means that the current element being processed was (0, 0). Since `ret_path` starts with (0, 0), it implies that there are additional elements in `ret_path` that were processed in previous iterations (the elements from `func_4(v)`).

For the loop to execute one more time, the next element in `ret_path` should be processed. Thus, we need to ensure that `ret_path` contains at least one more tuple after (0, 0). Therefore, we can adjust the state of `ret_path` to indicate that it contains at least one additional tuple, and we can also update `x` and `y` to reflect that the next tuple will be processed.

Since (0, 0) was the last processed tuple, we can assume the next tuple would be the first element from `func_4(v)` that followed (0, 0) in `ret_path`.

State: **`ret_path` is a list starting with (0, 0) and followed by at least one more element from func_4(v), ok is true, Possible is printed, x is the first element of the next tuple in ret_path, y is the second element of the next tuple in ret_path, and the corresponding values are printed.**
