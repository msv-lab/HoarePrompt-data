Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 8, `s2` is a string of length 2^N consisting of characters '0' and '1', `n` is at least 1, `i` is -1, `s` is [1, 2, ..., n], and `ind` is 1. If the condition `(i >> ind) % 2 == 0` holds true and the character at position `i + 2 ** ind` in `s2` is '1', then `ok` is set to False. If either condition is not met, the value of `ok` remains unchanged.***
