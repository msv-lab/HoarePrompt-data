Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 8, `n` is equal to `N`, `ret_gp` is an empty list, `i` is 2, `s` is [2], `s2` is a string of length 2^N, the character at index `i` of `s2` is '0', and `ind` is 2. If the condition `(i >> ind) % 2 == 0` is true and the character at index `i + 2 ** ind` of `s2` is '1', then `ok` is set to False. Otherwise, the value of `ok` remains unchanged.***
