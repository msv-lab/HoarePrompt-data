The code prints the values of `x` and `y` as strings. Given that `x` is the first element and `y` is the second element of the next tuple in `ret_path`, and that `ret_path` starts with (0, 0) followed by at least one more element from `func_4(v)`, the output will reflect the values of `x` and `y` derived from that subsequent tuple. The previous state of `ret_path` is not explicitly defined, but we know it contains at least one more element after (0, 0).

Therefore, the output state will include the printed values of `x` and `y` based on the next tuple in `ret_path`.

Output State: **`ret_path` is a list starting with (0, 0) and followed by at least one more element from `func_4(v)`; `x` is the first element of the next tuple in `ret_path`, `y` is the second element of the next tuple in `ret_path`, and the corresponding values are printed.**
