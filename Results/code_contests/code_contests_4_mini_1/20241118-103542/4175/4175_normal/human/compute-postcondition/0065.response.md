Output State: **`ret_path` is a list starting with (0, 0) and may contain elements from `func_4(v)` for each `v` in `ret_gp`. If `ret_path` contains at least one element, `x` and `y` will correspond to the first tuple in `ret_path`, and '0 0' will be printed for the first iteration. If `ret_path` contains multiple elements, `x` and `y` will be updated accordingly in subsequent iterations. If `ret_path` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `x` and `y` are undefined while `ret_path` remains as an empty list.`**
