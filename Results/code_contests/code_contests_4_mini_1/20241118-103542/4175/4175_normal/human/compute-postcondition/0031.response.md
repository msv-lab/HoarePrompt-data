Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 8, `n` is greater than 2, `ind` is 2, and `s2` is a string of length 2^N. If the bit at position `ind` of `i` is 0 and the character at the position `i + 2^ind` in `s2` is '1', then `ok` is set to False. If either condition is not met, the value of `ok` remains unchanged.***
