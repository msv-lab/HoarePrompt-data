Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 8, `s2` is a string of length 2^N consisting of characters '0' and '1', `ok` remains either True or False based on the conditions checked in the loop, and `ret_gp` is updated by adding the result of `func_2(s)` to it if `s2[i]` is '0'. The variable `i` is 2, and `s` is [2]. If `s2[i]` is '1', the body of the if statement does not execute, leaving `ok` and `ret_gp` unchanged. All potential cases concerning the conditions of `s2[i]` and the iterations over `ind` are considered in the postcondition.***
