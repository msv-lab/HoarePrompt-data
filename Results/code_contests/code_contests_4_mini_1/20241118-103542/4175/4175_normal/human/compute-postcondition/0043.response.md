The variable `ok` is assigned the value `False`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 8, `s2` is a string of length 2^N consisting of characters '0' and '1', `n` is at least 1, `i` is -1, `s` is [1, 2, ..., n], `ind` is 1, and `ok` is False.
