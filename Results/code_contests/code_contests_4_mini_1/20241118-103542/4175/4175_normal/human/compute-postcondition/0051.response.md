Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 8, `s2` is a string of length 2^N consisting of characters '0' and '1', `n` is at least 1, `i` is -1, and `s` is [1, 2, ..., n]. If `s2[i]` is '0', then `ret_gp` is increased by the return value of `func_2(s)`, while the values of `ok` and other variables remain unchanged. The conditions regarding the bits of `s2` and their indices are checked in the loop, ensuring that if the bit at `s2[i + 2 ** ind]` is '1' for any `ind` where `(i >> ind) % 2 == 0`, `ok` will be set to False. If the initial condition isn't met, the state of `ret_gp` remains unchanged.***
