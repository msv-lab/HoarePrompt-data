The variable `ok` is assigned the value `False`. The previous values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 8, `n` is equal to `N`, `ret_gp` is an empty list, `i` is 2, `s` is [2], `s2` is a string of length 2^N, the character at index `i` of `s2` is '0', and `ind` is 1; `ok` is False.
