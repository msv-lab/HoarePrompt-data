According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `ret_path` list. The loop will execute if `ret_path` contains at least one element, as it needs to iterate over the elements of `ret_path`. Given that `ret_path` starts with (0, 0) and is followed by elements from `func_4(v)` for each `v` in `ret_gp`, it implies that `ret_path` has at least one element initially.

At the end of the last iteration, the loop will iterate over each tuple in `ret_path`, and the variables `x` and `y` will take the values of the current tuple. Since `ret_path` starts with (0, 0), the first iteration will assign `x` as 0 and `y` as 0.

Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `ret_path` must contain at least one element, and the variables `x` and `y` will be initialized to the first tuple (0, 0).

State: **`ret_path` is a list starting with (0, 0) and followed by elements from func_4(v) for each v in `ret_gp`, `ok` is true, 'Possible' is printed, `x` is 0, `y` is 0**
