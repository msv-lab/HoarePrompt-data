Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 8, `s2` is a string of length 2^N consisting of characters '0' and '1', and `n` is at least 1. If `s2[i]` is '0', then for each `ind` in the range [0, n-1], if the condition `(i >> ind) % 2 == 0` holds true and `s2[i + 2 ** ind]` is '1', then `ok` is set to False; furthermore, `ret_gp` is increased by the result of `func_2(s)`. If `s2[i]` is not '0', `ok` remains unchanged and `ret_gp` does not change.***
