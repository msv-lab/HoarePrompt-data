According to the code, for the loop to execute again, `ret_path` must contain at least one more tuple after the current iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `ret_path` has at least three elements, and `x` and `y` correspond to the first and second elements of the third tuple in `ret_path`. 

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `ret_path` should have at least four elements. The tuple for the next iteration will be the fourth element in `ret_path`. Therefore, `x` and `y` need to be adjusted to reflect the first and second elements of the fourth tuple in `ret_path`.

State: **`ret_path` is a list starting with (0, 0) and followed by at least four elements from `func_4(v)`; `x` is the first element of the fourth tuple in `ret_path`, `y` is the second element of the fourth tuple in `ret_path`.**
