The code initializes `ret_gp` as an empty list. The previous values of the affected variables remain unchanged, as this code does not modify any existing variables. Therefore, the output state will reflect the unchanged variables and the new variable defined.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 8; `s2` is a string of length 2^N consisting of characters '0' and '1', where `s2[0]` is '1'; `ok` is True; `n` is assigned the value of `int(s1)` which is undefined; `ret_gp` is an empty list**.
