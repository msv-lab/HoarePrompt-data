The code prints the length of `ret_path` minus 1. The initial state indicates that `ret_path` starts with (0, 0) and is followed by elements derived from `func_4(v)` for each value `v` in `ret_gp`. Therefore, the length of `ret_path` can be calculated as the count of its elements.

Let `len(ret_path)` be the number of elements in the list `ret_path`. The value printed will be `len(ret_path) - 1`, which represents the count of elements in `ret_path` excluding the first element (0, 0).

Since the specific count of elements in `ret_path` is not provided, we will denote it as `N`. Thus, the output reflects that the length of `ret_path` minus 1 is `N - 1`.

Output State: **`ret_path` is a list starting with (0, 0) and followed by elements from func_4(v) for each v in `ret_gp`; `ok` is true; 'Possible' is printed; the length of `ret_path` minus 1 is N - 1.**
