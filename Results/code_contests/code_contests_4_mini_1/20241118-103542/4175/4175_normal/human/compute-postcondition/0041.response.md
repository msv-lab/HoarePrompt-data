Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 8, `s2` is a string of length 2^N consisting of characters '0' and '1', `n` is at least 1, `i` is -1, `s` is [1, 2, ..., n], and `ind` is 0. If `(i >> ind) % 2 == 0` and `s2[i + 2 ** ind] == '1'`, then `ok` is set to False. If the conditions are not met, the value of `ok` remains unchanged.***
