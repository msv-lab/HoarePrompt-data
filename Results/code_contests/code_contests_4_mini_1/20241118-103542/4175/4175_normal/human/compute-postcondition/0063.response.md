The code prints the string representation of `x` and `y`, which are the first and second elements of the third tuple in `ret_path`. The values of `x` and `y` are determined by the elements in `ret_path`, but their exact numeric values are not specified. Therefore, the output state reflects the values of `x` and `y` as they are derived from `ret_path`.

Output State: **`ret_path` is a list starting with (0, 0) and followed by at least two more elements from `func_4(v)`; `x` is the first element of the third tuple in `ret_path`, `y` is the second element of the third tuple in `ret_path`, and the output is the string representation of `x` and `y`.**
