The variable `ok` is assigned the value `False`. The other variables remain unchanged, as their values are unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `ok` along with the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 8, `s2` is a string of length 2^N consisting of characters '0' and '1', `n` is at least 2, `i` is -1, `s` is [1, 2, ..., n], `ind` is 2, and `ok` is False**
