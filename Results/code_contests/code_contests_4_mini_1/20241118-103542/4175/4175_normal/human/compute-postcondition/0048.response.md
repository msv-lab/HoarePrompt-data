According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `ind` and the value of `n`. The loop will continue executing as long as `ind` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `ind` is 2 and `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `ind` needs to be incremented to 3.

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows: `ind` will be 3 for the next iteration, and it should still satisfy the condition that `n` is at least 3 to ensure the loop can continue.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 8, `s2` is a string of length 2^N consisting of characters '0' and '1', `n` is at least 3, `i` is -1, `s` is [1, 2, ..., n], and `ind` is 3**
