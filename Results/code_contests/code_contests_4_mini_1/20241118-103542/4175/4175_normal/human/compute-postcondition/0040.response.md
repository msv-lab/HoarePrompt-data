The variable `ok` is assigned the value `False`, which means it is explicitly set to indicate a condition that is not met. The previous values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 8, `s2` is a string of length 2^N consisting of characters '0' and '1', `n` is at least 1, `i` is -1, `s` is [1, 2, ..., n], `ind` is 0, and `ok` is False.
