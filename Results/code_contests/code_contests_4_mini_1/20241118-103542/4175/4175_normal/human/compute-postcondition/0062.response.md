According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `ret_path` list. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more tuple in `ret_path` following the current `x` and `y`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `ret_path` starts with (0, 0) and has at least one more element from `func_4(v)`. Since `x` is the first element of the next tuple in `ret_path` and `y` is the second element of the next tuple, we need to ensure that the loop can access the next tuple.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust the state to reflect the presence of at least one additional tuple. Specifically, `ret_path` needs to have at least three elements (the initial (0, 0) plus two more tuples). Additionally, `x` and `y` must correspond to the next tuple in the list, which would be the third tuple in this case.

State: **`ret_path` is a list starting with (0, 0) and followed by at least two more elements from `func_4(v)`; `x` is the first element of the third tuple in `ret_path`, `y` is the second element of the third tuple in `ret_path`.**
