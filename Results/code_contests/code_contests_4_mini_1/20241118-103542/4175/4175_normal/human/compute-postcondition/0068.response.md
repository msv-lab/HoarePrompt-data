Postcondition: ***`ret_path` is a list starting with (0, 0) and may contain elements from `func_4(v)` for each `v` in `ret_gp`. If `ok` is true, the program prints 'Possible', the length of `ret_path` minus one, and each tuple from `ret_path`, which will be iterated with `x` and `y` corresponding to the elements of the list. If `ret_path` contains no elements after the initial tuple, the loop does not execute, and `x` and `y` remain undefined. If `ok` is false, the program prints 'Impossible', and the state of `ret_path` remains unchanged as a list starting with (0, 0).***
