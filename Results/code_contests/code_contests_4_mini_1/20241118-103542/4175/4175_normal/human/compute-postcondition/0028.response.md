Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 8, `n` is at least 1, `ind` is 1, and `s2` is a string of length 2^N. If the condition `(i >> ind) % 2 == 0` holds true and `s2[i + 2 ** ind]` is equal to '1', then `ok` is set to False. If the condition does not hold true or `s2[i + 2 ** ind]` is not '1', then `ok` remains unchanged.***
