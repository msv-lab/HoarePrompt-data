Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 8, `s2` is a string of length 2^N consisting of characters '0' and '1', `n` is at least 2, `i` is -1, `s` is [1, 2, ..., n], and `ind` is 2. If the condition `(i >> ind) % 2 == 0` is true and `s2[i + 2 ** ind]` is '1', then `ok` is set to False. If `(i >> ind) % 2` is not equal to 0 or `s2[i + 2 ** ind]` is '0', the value of `ok` remains unchanged.***
