Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 8, `n` is at least 1, `ind` is 0, `s2` is a string of length 2^N, `ok` is either True or False, `ret_gp` is unchanged, `s` is [1]. The value of `i` is such that ((i >> ind) % 2) equals 0, and the character at index `i + 2 ** ind` of `s2` is '1'.***
