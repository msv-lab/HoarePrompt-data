The variable `ok` is assigned the value `False`. The previous values of the affected variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged state of the other variables along with the new assignment for `ok`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 8, `n` is equal to `N`, `ret_gp` is an empty list, `i` is 2, `s` is [2], `s2` is a string of length 2^N, the character at index `i` of `s2` is '0', the value of `i` right-shifted by `ind` is even, the character at index `i + 2^ind` of `s2` is '1', `ind` is 0, and `ok` is False.**
