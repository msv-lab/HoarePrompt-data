Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 8, `s2` is a string of length 2^N consisting of characters '0' and '1', `n` is at least 1, `i` is -1, `s` is [1, 2, ..., n], `ind` is 0. The value of `i` right-shifted by `ind` is even, and the character at position `i + 2^ind` in `s2` is '1'.***
