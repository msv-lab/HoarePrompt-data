Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 8, `n` is equal to `N`, `ret_gp` is an empty list, `i` is 2, `s` is [2], `s2` is a string of length 2^N, the character at index `i` of `s2` is '0', and `ind` is 1. If the condition `(i >> ind) % 2 == 0` holds true and the character at index `i + 2 ** ind` of `s2` is '1', then `ok` is set to False. Otherwise, `ok` remains unchanged. This covers the cases where the specific bit check and the character in `s2` are considered.
