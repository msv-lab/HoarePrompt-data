Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 8, `n` is at least 1, `ind` is 0, `s2` is a string of length 2^N, `ok` is set to False if `((i >> ind) % 2) == 0` and `s2[i + 2**ind] == '1'`; otherwise, `ok` remains unchanged. The value of `ret_gp` remains unchanged, and `s` is [1].***
