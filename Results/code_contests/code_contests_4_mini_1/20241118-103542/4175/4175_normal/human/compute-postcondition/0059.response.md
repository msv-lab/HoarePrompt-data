The code prints a string that concatenates the values of `x` and `y`, which are both 0. Therefore, the output will be "0 0". The states of the other variables are not affected by this print statement. 

Output State: **`ret_path` is a list starting with (0, 0) and followed by elements from func_4(v) for each v in `ret_gp`, `ok` is true, 'Possible' is printed, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, and '0 0' is printed.**
