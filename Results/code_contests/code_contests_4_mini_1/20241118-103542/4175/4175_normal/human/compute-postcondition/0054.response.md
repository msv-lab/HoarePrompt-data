The code creates a list `ret_path`, which starts with the tuple `(0, 0)` and is appended with elements generated by a list comprehension. The list comprehension iterates over `ret_gp`, where for each element `v`, it calls `func_4(v)` and collects all returned values into the list. 

The initial state does not provide specific values for `ret_gp` or the output of `func_4(v)`, so we cannot determine the complete structure of `ret_path` beyond its first element. Therefore, we acknowledge that `ret_path` will contain at least the tuple `(0, 0)` and additional elements based on the output of `func_4(v)` for each `v` in `ret_gp`.

Output State: **`ret_path` is a list starting with (0, 0) and followed by elements from func_4(v) for each v in ret_gp**.
