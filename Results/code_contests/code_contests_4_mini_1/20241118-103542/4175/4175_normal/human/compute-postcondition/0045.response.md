According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `ind` and `n`. The loop will execute while `ind` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `ind` is 1, and `n` is at least 1, which means that for the loop to execute one more time, `ind` should be incremented to 2. Therefore, we need to adjust `ind` to 2.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 8, `s2` is a string of length 2^N consisting of characters '0' and '1', `n` is at least 2, `i` is -1, `s` is [1, 2, ..., n], and `ind` is 2.**
