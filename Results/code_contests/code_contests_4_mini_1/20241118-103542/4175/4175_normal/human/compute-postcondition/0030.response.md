The variable `ok` is assigned the value `False`. The values of the other variables (`N`, `n`, `ind`, and `s2`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 8, `n` is greater than 2, `ind` is 2, `s2` is a string of length 2^N, and `ok` is False.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 8, `n` is greater than 2, `ind` is 2, `s2` is a string of length 2^N, and `ok` is False**
