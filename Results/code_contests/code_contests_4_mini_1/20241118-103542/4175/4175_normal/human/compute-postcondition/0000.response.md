The variable `ok` is assigned the value `True`. This does not impact the values of `N` or `s2`. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of those variables along with the new value of `ok`. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 8, `s2` is a string of length 2^N consisting of characters '0' and '1', where s2[0] is '1'; `ok` is True**
