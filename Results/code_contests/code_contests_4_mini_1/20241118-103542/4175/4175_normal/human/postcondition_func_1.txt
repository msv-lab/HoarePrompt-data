The function accepts a sequence `s` of length `2^N` consisting of 0s and 1s, where `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 8 and `s[0] = 1`. If `s` has only one element (where `pre_s` is empty), it returns a list containing that last element. For longer sequences, it recursively processes the sequence (excluding the last element) by calling `func_2(pre_s)`, appending the last element `v`, the result of `func_1(func_2(pre_s))`, and `-v`. The function is expected to combine these elements into a single list but relies on the implementation of `func_1`, which is not defined here, potentially affecting the output.
