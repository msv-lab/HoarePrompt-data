The function accepts two strings, `s1` and `s2`, where `s1` is expected to represent an integer (N) in the range [1, 8] and `s2` is a binary string of length 2^N, with the first character guaranteed to be '1'. The function processes these inputs to create a list of tuples `ret_path`, starting with (0, 0). If the processed conditions are met, it prints 'Possible', the length of `ret_path` minus one, and each tuple in `ret_path`. If the conditions are not met, it prints 'Impossible'. The function may fail to handle cases where `s1` is not a valid integer or is outside the expected range, as well as potential issues if `s2` does not conform to the expected format or length.
