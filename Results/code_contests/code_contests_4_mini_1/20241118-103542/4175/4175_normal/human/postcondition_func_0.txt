The function accepts a list `a` of integers and returns a new list where each element is the negation of the corresponding integer in `a`. This means that if `a` contains 0s and 1s, the output will consist of 0s and -1s. The function does not handle non-integer values or empty lists explicitly, but it will still return a list with the negated values for any numeric input.
