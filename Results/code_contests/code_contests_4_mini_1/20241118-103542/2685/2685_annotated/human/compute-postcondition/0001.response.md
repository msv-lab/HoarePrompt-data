The variable `res` is initialized to 0. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `candy_array`, and `res_map`) are not affected by this code. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 100, `candy_array` is a list of integers where each element d_i satisfies 1 ≤ d_i ≤ 1,000,000,000, `res_map` is an empty dictionary, and `res` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 100, `candy_array` is a list of integers where each element d_i satisfies 1 ≤ d_i ≤ 1,000,000,000, `res_map` is an empty dictionary, `res` is 0**
