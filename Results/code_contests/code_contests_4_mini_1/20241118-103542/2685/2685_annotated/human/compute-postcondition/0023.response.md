Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `k` and a list of integers `candy_array`. It counts and returns the number of pairs of elements in `candy_array` such that the sum of their values is divisible by `k`. The function utilizes a dictionary to keep track of the counts of residues when elements are divided by `k`. If `candy_array` is empty, the function will output 0 pairs found. However, the function does not have a return statement; it only prints the result, which may lead to confusion regarding its output. **
