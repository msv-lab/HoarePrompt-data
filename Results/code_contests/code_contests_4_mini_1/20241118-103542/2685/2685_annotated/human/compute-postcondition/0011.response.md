The code modifies the value of `res_map` at the index `k - candy % k`. The variable `candy` is defined as the second element of `candy_array`, and its value will be used to compute the index for `res_map`. The value at that index is decreased by 1.

Since `res` is previously increased by 2, it does not affect the output state directly. We do not have the specific values for `res_map` or `candy_array`, but we know `candy` is accessible as the second element in `candy_array`.

Given these considerations, the output state is described as follows:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 100; `candy_array` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements; `candy` is the second element in `candy_array`; `res` is increased by 2; `res_map[k - candy % k]` is decreased by 1**
