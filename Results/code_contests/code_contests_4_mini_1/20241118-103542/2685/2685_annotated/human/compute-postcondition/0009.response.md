According to the code, the loop iterates over each element in the `candy_array`. At the end of the last iteration, `candy` is the first element in `candy_array`. For the loop to execute one more time, `candy` needs to be updated to the next element in the `candy_array`, and the state must reflect that.

Since `candy_array` is a list with at least 1 element, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `candy` corresponds to the next element in the list. If `candy` is currently the first element, we need to set it to the second element in the list, and the loop index (if relevant) would need to be adjusted accordingly (which is typically implicit in the loop structure).

Thus, the new state will include that `candy` is now the second element in the `candy_array`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 100; `candy_array` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements; `candy` is the second element in `candy_array`**
