Output State: **`res` is the count of pairs of elements in `candy_array` such that the sum of their values is divisible by `k`. `res_map` is a dictionary mapping the residues of the elements in `candy_array` when divided by `k` to their respective counts. If `candy_array` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `res` remains 0, with `res_map` staying empty. If `candy_array` has at least one element, the loop processes each element, incrementing `res` by 2 for each valid pair found, while updating `res_map` to maintain the counts of residues. The final state of `res_map` reflects the counts of each residue modulo `k` after processing all candies.**
