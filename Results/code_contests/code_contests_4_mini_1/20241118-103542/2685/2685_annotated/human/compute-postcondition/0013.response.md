Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 100; `candy_array` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements; `candy` is the second element in `candy_array`. If `res_map` contains the key `k - candy % k` and its value is greater than 0, then `res` is increased by 2 and `res_map[k - candy % k]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `res_map[candy % k]` is incremented by 1 if it exists; if not, it is initialized to 1. This ensures that `res_map` accurately reflects the counts of the residues modulo `k` after processing the current `candy`.***
