To determine the adjustments needed for the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we analyze the provided state at the end of the previous iteration and the loop structure.

1. **Current State**: 
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 200,000\)
   - `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 100\)
   - `candy_array` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements
   - `candy` is the third element in `candy_array`

2. **Loop Structure**:
   - The loop iterates through each element in `candy_array`, assigning the current element to `candy`.

3. **Current Conditions**:
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements left in `candy_array`. 
   - Since the current `candy` is the third element, it implies that `candy_array` contains at least 3 elements at the end of the previous iteration.

4. **Next Iteration Requirements**:
   - To execute one more time, we need to adjust the state to reflect the next element in the `candy_array`.
   - If we are currently at the third element, the next iteration will access the fourth element of `candy_array`.
   - Therefore, `candy` should be updated to the fourth element in `candy_array`.

5. **State Adjustment**:
   - We need to keep `n` and `k` unchanged as they are not affected by the loop iteration.
   - We also need to ensure `candy_array` still has enough elements for the loop to continue executing.

Thus, the adjusted state reflecting that the loop can execute one more time will be:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 100; `candy_array` is a list of integers with at least 4 elements; `candy` is the fourth element in `candy_array`**
