The code updates the `res_map` at the index `k - candy % k`. The current value of `candy` is the third element in `candy_array`, and since `k` is between 1 and 100, the expression `k - candy % k` computes an index for `res_map`. The value at that index is decreased by 1.

Since the initial values of `res_map` and `candy` are not specified, I will note the changes without specific numbers. The state of other variables remains unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 100; `candy_array` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements; `candy` is the third element in `candy_array`; `res` is increased by 2; `res_map[k - candy % k]` is decreased by 1.**
