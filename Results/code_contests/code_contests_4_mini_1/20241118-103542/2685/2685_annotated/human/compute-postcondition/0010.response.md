The value of `res` is incremented by 2, but the previous value of `res` is unknown. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 100; `candy_array` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements; `candy` is the second element in `candy_array`, and `res` is increased by 2.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 100; `candy_array` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements; `candy` is the second element in `candy_array`; `res` is increased by 2**
