According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `candy_array`. If the `candy_array` has at least one element, the loop will execute. The initial states indicate that `n` is within the specified range and `candy_array` is a list of integers, but we need to ensure that it contains at least one element for the loop to run. 

Given that `res` is initialized to 0 and `res_map` is an empty dictionary, these values do not affect the execution of the loop. We must also note that `candy` will take the value of each element in `candy_array` during the iterations.

To ensure the loop executes, we can state:

- `candy_array` must contain at least one element.
- `candy` will be assigned the value of the first element in `candy_array` during the first iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 100, `candy_array` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `candy` is the first element in `candy_array`, `res_map` is an empty dictionary, `res` is 0**
