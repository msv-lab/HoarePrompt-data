The code modifies the value associated with the key `k - candy % k` in the dictionary `res_map`. The previous value of `res_map[k - candy % k]` is greater than 0, so after the execution, the value will decrease by 1. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 100; `candy_array` is a list of integers with at least 1 element; `candy` is the first element in `candy_array`; `res_map` has the key `k - candy % k` with a value greater than 0, which is now decreased by 1; `res` is 2.**
