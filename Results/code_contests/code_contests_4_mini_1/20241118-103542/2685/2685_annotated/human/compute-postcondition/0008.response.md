Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 100; `candy_array` is a list of integers with at least 1 element; `candy` is the first element in `candy_array`. If `res_map` has the key `k - candy % k` with a value greater than 0, then `res` is increased by 2 and the value of `res_map[k - candy % k]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `res_map[candy % k]` is increased by 1, and if `k - candy % k` is not a key in `res_map`, it will be added with a value of 1. The overall state ensures that the conditions of `res_map` and `res` reflect the interactions with the `candy` value in relation to `k`, covering all edge cases for the keys and their respective values.***
