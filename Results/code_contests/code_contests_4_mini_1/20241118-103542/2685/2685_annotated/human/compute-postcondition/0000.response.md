The code initializes `res_map` as an empty dictionary. It does not affect the values of `n`, `k`, or `candy_array`. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged for those variables, and it indicates that `res_map` has been initialized.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 100, `candy_array` is a list of integers where each element d_i satisfies 1 ≤ d_i ≤ 1,000,000,000; `res_map` is an empty dictionary.**
