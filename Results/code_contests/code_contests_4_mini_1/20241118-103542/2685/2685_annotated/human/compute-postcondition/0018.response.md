Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 100; `candy_array` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements; `candy` is the third element in `candy_array`. If `res_map` contains the key `k - candy % k` and its value is greater than 0, then `res` is increased by 2 and `res_map[k - candy % k]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `res_map[candy % k]` is incremented by 1, or initialized to 1 if it does not exist. The state of `res` and `res_map` reflects the operations performed based on the conditions evaluated.***
