Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 100, `candy_array` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, and `candy` is the third element in `candy_array`. If `res_map` contains the key `k - candy % k` and its value is greater than 0, `res` is increased by 2, and the value of `res_map[k - candy % k]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `res_map[candy % k]` is updated to either its current value incremented by 1 or initialized to 1 if the key does not exist. This ensures that all possible relationships and updates to `res` and `res_map` are captured based on the condition of `candy`.***
