According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `candy_array`. The loop iterates over each element in `candy_array`. At the end of the last iteration, `candy` is the second element in `candy_array`. For the loop to execute one more time, the `candy_array` must have at least 3 elements, and `candy` should be updated to the third element in the `candy_array`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 100, `candy_array` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, and `candy` is the third element in `candy_array`.**
