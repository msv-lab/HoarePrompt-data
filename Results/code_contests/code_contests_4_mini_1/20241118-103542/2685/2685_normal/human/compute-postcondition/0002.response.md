According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `candy_array`. For the loop to execute, `candy_array` must contain at least 1 element, as the loop iterates over each candy in the array. Since `n` is a positive integer indicating the length of `candy_array`, it must be at least 1 to ensure the loop can run. At the start of the loop, the `candy` variable should be set to the first element in `candy_array`. 

Thus, for the loop to be executed, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `candy_array` must have at least 1 element.
- `candy` is the first candy in the `candy_array`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 100, `candy_array` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `candy` is the first element in `candy_array`, `res_map` is an empty dictionary, `res` is 0**
