Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 100, `candy_array` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, and `candy` is the second element in `candy_array`. If `res_map` has the key `k - candy % k` and its value is greater than 0, then `res` is increased by 2 and `res_map[k - candy % k]` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `res_map[candy % k]` is incremented by 1, or set to 1 if it was not previously present, thereby capturing the counts of remainders based on the modulus operation with `k`. This ensures that all potential cases regarding the existence of keys in `res_map` and the corresponding updates to `res` and `res_map` are accounted for correctly.***
