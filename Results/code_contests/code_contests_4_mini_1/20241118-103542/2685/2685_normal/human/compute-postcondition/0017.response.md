The code updates `res_map` based on the value of `candy % k`. It checks if `res_map` has the key `candy % k`. If it does, it increments the corresponding value by 1; if it does not, it initializes that key with the value of 1. The values of `n`, `k`, and `candy_array` do not change, but the state of `res_map` will be affected depending on the calculation of `candy % k`. 

Assuming `candy` is the third element in `candy_array`, we get `candy % k`. The specific value of `candy % k` will determine how `res_map` is updated. 

The output state will reflect the updated state of `res_map`, taking into account the previous state of `res_map` and whether the key `candy % k` existed before the operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 100, `candy_array` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `candy` is the third element in `candy_array`, and `res_map` is updated based on `candy % k`.**
