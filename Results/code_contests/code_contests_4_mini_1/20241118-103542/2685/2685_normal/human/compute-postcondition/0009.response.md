According to the code, the loop execution depends on the `candy_array`. If the loop is to execute one more time, it needs to process the next element in the `candy_array`. Currently, `candy` is the first element in `candy_array`. For the loop to execute again, `candy` should be updated to the second element in the `candy_array`, and the state of `candy_array` should reflect that it has more than one element. 

Thus, the necessary adjustments are:
- `candy` should be updated to `candy_array[1]`, which is the second element in the list.
- `candy_array` must contain at least 2 elements.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 100, `candy_array` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `candy` is the second element in `candy_array`, `res` is updated based on the conditions, `res_map` reflects the counts of remainders based on the modulus operation with `k`.**
