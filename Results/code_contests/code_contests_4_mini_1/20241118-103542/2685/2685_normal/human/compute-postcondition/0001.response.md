The variable `res` is initialized with the value `0`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged, as this line of code only affects `res`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 100, `candy_array` is a list of integers where each integer d_i (1 ≤ d_i ≤ 10^9) represents the number of candies in the i-th box, `res_map` is an empty dictionary, and `res` is 0.
