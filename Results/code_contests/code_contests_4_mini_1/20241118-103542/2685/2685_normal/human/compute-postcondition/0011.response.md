The operation updates the value in `res_map` at the index `k - candy % k`. The variable `candy` has the value of the second element in `candy_array`. The expression `candy % k` computes the remainder of `candy` when divided by `k`. This remainder is subtracted from `k` to find the index in `res_map` that will be affected. The value at that index is then decremented by 1. The other variables, including `n`, `k`, `candy_array`, and `res`, are not directly affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 100, `candy_array` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `candy` is the second element in `candy_array`, `res` is updated by adding 2, and `res_map[k - candy % k]` is decremented by 1.**
