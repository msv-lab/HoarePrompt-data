Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 100, `candy_array` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `candy` is the first element in `candy_array`, `res` is updated based on the conditions. If `res_map` contains the key `k - candy % k` with a value greater than 0, then `res` is increased by 2 and `res_map[k - candy % k]` is decremented by 1. If the key does not exist or has a value of 0, then `res_map[candy % k]` is incremented by 1 (or initialized to 1 if it does not exist), and `res` remains unchanged at 0. The state of `res_map` reflects the counts of remainders based on the modulus operation with `k`.***
