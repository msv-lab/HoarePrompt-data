Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 100; `candy_array` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements; `candy` is the second element in `candy_array`; `res` is updated based on the conditions; `res_map` reflects the counts of remainders based on the modulus operation with `k`; `res_map[candy % k]` is incremented by 1 or set to 1 if it was not previously present.**
