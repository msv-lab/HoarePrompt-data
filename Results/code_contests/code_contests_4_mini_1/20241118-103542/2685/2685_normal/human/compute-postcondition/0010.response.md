The value of `res` is increased by 2. The previous value of `res` is not specified, but it is updated based on the conditions. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 100, `candy_array` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `candy` is the second element in `candy_array`, and `res` is updated by adding 2.
