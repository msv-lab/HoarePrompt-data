The code initializes `res_map` as an empty dictionary. No other variables are affected, and the initial values of `n`, `k`, and `candy_array` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 100, `candy_array` is a list of integers where each integer d_i (1 ≤ d_i ≤ 10^9) represents the number of candies in the i-th box, and `res_map` is an empty dictionary.**
