The code modifies the `res_map` dictionary at the key `k - candy % k`. The variable `candy` is the third element of `candy_array`, but its specific value is not provided. Therefore, we can only express the impact of the operation in terms of its relationship to `k` and `candy`.

The value at `res_map[k - candy % k]` is decreased by 1. The state of other variables, including `res`, is not directly affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 100, `candy_array` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `candy` is the third element in `candy_array`, `res` is increased by 2, and `res_map[k - candy % k]` is decreased by 1.**
