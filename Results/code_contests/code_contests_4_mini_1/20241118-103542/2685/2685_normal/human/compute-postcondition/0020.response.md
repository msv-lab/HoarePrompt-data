Output State: **`res` is equal to the count of pairs of candy boxes that have complementary remainders when divided by `k`, `res_map` is a dictionary that tracks the number of occurrences of each remainder when the candies in the boxes are divided by `k`, `candy_array` is a list of integers with at least `n` elements, `candy` is the current element being processed from `candy_array`. If `candy_array` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `res` remains 0, while `res_map` remains an empty dictionary.**
