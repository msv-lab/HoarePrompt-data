The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `k` and `candy_array`. The parameter `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 100, and `candy_array` is a list of integers where each integer d_i (1 ≤ d_i ≤ 10^9) represents the number of candies in the i-th box. The function processes the input to produce a result based on the values in `candy_array` and the integer `k`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer k and a list of integers candy_array, and returns a result based on the distribution or calculation of candies in the boxes represented by candy_array, considering the value of k.**
