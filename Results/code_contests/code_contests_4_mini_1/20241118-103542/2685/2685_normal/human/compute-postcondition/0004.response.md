The value of `res` is incremented by 2, changing its previous value of 0 to 2. Other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 100, `candy_array` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `candy` is the first element in `candy_array`, `res_map` is a dictionary containing the key `k - candy % k` with a value greater than 0, and `res` is 2.
