The function accepts a positive integer `k` and a list of integers `candy_array`. It calculates the number of pairs of candies whose remainders are complementary when divided by `k`. Each pair contributes a count of 2 to the result. The function does not return any value but prints the result instead. If `candy_array` is empty, the result will be 0. Additionally, there is potential for a missing return statement, which means the result is not accessible to the caller.
