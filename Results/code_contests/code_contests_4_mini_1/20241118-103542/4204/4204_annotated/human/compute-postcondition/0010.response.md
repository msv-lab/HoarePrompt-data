Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `no[0]` is defined and valid, `grafo[no[0]]` is not empty, `visitados[no[0]]` is True, `vizinho` is the second element of `grafo[no[0]]`, and `visitados[vizinho]` is False. If `visitados[vizinho[0]]` is False, `depth` is incremented by 1 and `func_1` is called with `vizinho`, `grafo`, `visitados`, `depth + 1`, and `cand`. If `visitados[vizinho[0]]` is True, the function does not call `func_1` and no changes occur to `depth` or the visited states.***
