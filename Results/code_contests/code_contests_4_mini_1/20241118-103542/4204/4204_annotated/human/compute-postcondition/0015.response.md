Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `no[0]` is defined and valid, `grafo[no[0]]` is not empty, and `visitados[no[0]]` is True. If the `grafo[no[0]]` list is empty, the loop does not execute, and `visitados` remains unchanged, while `cand['value']` remains as it was prior to the loop execution. If `visitados[vizinho[0]]` is False for any `vizinho`, then `func_1` is called with parameters `vizinho`, `grafo`, `visitados`, `depth + 1`, and `cand`. If all elements of `grafo[no[0]]` are visited (`visitados[vizinho[0]]` is True for all), `func_1` is not called, and the state remains unchanged for `depth` and `cand['value']`.**
