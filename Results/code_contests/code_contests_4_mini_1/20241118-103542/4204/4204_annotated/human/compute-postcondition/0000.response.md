Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, and the edges are represented by three positive integers (xi, yi, ti) where 1 ≤ xi, yi ≤ n and ti is either 1 (not a problem road) or 2 (a problem road). The graph structure formed by the districts and roads is a tree. The variable `no[1]` is true.***
