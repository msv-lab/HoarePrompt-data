Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; if `no[1]` is true, then `cand['value']` may be updated to the maximum of its current value and `no[0]`, but since `no[0]` is undefined, the handling of this case is necessary; if `no[1]` is false, `cand['value']` remains unchanged; `visitados[no[0]]` is set to True.**
