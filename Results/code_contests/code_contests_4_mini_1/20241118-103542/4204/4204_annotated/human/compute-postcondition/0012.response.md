The function `func_1` is called with the parameters `vizinho`, `grafo`, `visitados`, `depth + 1`, and `cand`. The initial state indicates that `vizinho` is a valid index based on the `grafo` structure, and `visitados[vizinho]` is False, meaning this node has not been visited yet. The `depth` is increased by 1, which suggests further traversal in a graph or tree structure, along with the usage of a candidate variable `cand`. Other variables remain unchanged as the function call does not modify them directly.

Since the function is invoked but does not alter the state of the initial variables in this context, the output state reflects the unchanged variables along with the indication that the function has been called.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `no[0]` is defined and valid, `grafo[no[0]]` is not empty, `visitados[no[0]]` is True, `vizinho` is the third element of `grafo[no[0]]`, `visitados[vizinho]` is False, and the function `func_1` has been called with parameters `vizinho`, `grafo`, `visitados`, `depth + 1`, `cand`.**
