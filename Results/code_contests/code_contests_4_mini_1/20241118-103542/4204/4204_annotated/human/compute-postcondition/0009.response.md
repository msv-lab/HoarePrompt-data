The function `func_1` is called with parameters `vizinho`, `grafo`, `visitados`, `depth + 1`, and `cand`. The previous values indicate that `vizinho` is the second element of `grafo[no[0]]`, and `visitados[vizinho]` is currently False, indicating that this neighbor has not yet been visited. The `depth` is incremented by 1, affecting the recursive nature of the function call. However, the values of `n`, `no[0]`, and `cand` remain unchanged. The output state reflects the current values of the variables and the fact that the function is being called.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `no[0]` is defined and valid, `grafo[no[0]]` is not empty, `visitados[no[0]]` is True, `vizinho` is the second element of `grafo[no[0]]`, `visitados[vizinho]` is False, `depth` is incremented by 1, and `func_1` is called with `vizinho`, `grafo`, `visitados`, `depth + 1`, and `cand`.**
