Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `no[0]` is defined and valid, `grafo[no[0]]` is not empty, `visitados[no[0]]` is True, and `vizinho` is the third element of `grafo[no[0]]`. If `visitados[vizinho[0]]` is False, the function `func_1` is called with parameters `vizinho`, `grafo`, `visitados`, `depth + 1`, and `cand`, indicating that the node represented by `vizinho` has not been visited yet. If `visitados[vizinho[0]]` is True, then `func_1` is not invoked, and the state remains unchanged regarding the visitation status of `vizinho`.***
