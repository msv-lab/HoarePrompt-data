The function `func_1` accepts the following parameters: `no`, `grafo`, `visitados`, `depth`, and `cand`. 

- `no` is a positive integer representing a node in the tree. 
- `grafo` is a structure (likely a list or dictionary) that represents the edges of the tree, where each edge is defined by three positive integers (xi, yi, ti).
- `visitados` is a collection (such as a list or set) that keeps track of which nodes have been visited.
- `depth` is an integer that represents the current depth in the tree traversal.
- `cand` is a parameter that likely influences the selection of candidates or paths in the tree, though its specific type and purpose are not explicitly outlined.

Based on the output description, while the exact return value isn't provided, we can infer that the function likely performs some operations related to traversing the tree and may return a result based on the tree structure and the conditions specified by the parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `no`, `grafo`, `visitados`, `depth`, and `cand` to traverse a tree structure represented by `grafo`, keeping track of visited nodes with `visitados`, the current depth of traversal with `depth`, and potentially influencing selection with `cand`. The specific return value is not defined.**
