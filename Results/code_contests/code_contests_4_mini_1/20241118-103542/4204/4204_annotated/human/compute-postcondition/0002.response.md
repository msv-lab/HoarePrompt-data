Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5. If `no[1]` is true, then `cand['value']` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `no[0]`, which is an undefined value that must be handled appropriately to ensure that `cand['value']` reflects the maximum possible value without introducing errors. If `no[1]` is false, `cand['value']` remains unchanged.***
