To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the code and the annotations.

### Code Analysis:
The function `func_1` appears to be designed to traverse a tree structure (the districts and roads in the city) and determine which candidates are required to repair all the problem roads leading to the district 1 (where the city Parliament is located).

1. **Input Parameters**:
   - `no`: This seems to represent a node (district) and a boolean indicating if it is a problem road.
   - `grafo`: This is likely a representation of the graph (tree) where each node has edges to its neighbors.
   - `visitados`: A list to keep track of whether a district has been visited during the traversal.
   - `depth`: Used to track the depth in the tree during traversal (though it is not utilized meaningfully in the current code).
   - `cand`: A dictionary to keep track of the maximum candidate number that can repair the problem roads.

2. **Logic**:
   - The line `if no[1]` checks if the current node is a problem road (this assumes `no[1]` corresponds to the type of the road).
   - If it is a problem road, it updates `cand['value']` to the maximum candidate number that can repair it.
   - The traversal is performed using a depth-first search (DFS) approach with the `for` loop iterating through neighbors.

3. **Potential Issues**:
   - The program maintains a single `cand['value']`, which could lead to missing candidates if more than one path has problem roads. The logic does not seem to account for collecting all candidates that lead to problem roads, just the maximum one.
   - It does not seem to handle the case where multiple problem roads exist from various districts leading to district 1. The problem description requires determining a subset of candidates such that all problem roads are repaired, which implies that all necessary candidates should be included, not just the one with the maximum number.

### Example of Failure:
Consider the following input:
```
5
1 2 2
1 3 2
2 4 1
2 5 1
```
According to the description, candidates 2 and 3 should be elected to repair both problem roads leading to district 1. However, the current implementation would only recognize the maximum candidate (which is 3) and fail to collect candidate 2, thus providing an incomplete solution.

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the implementation does not satisfy the requirements of the problem description in all cases as it may miss out on necessary candidates for repairing all problem roads.

**Correctness: False**
