The function accepts a tuple `no`, a graph represented as `grafo`, a list `visitados` indicating visited nodes, an integer `depth`, and a dictionary `cand`. It updates `cand['value']` to the maximum of its current value and `no[0]` if `no[1]` is true. It marks `no[0]` as visited and recursively explores unvisited neighboring nodes in the graph, updating the `visitados` list accordingly. The function does not return any value explicitly, which may lead to confusion regarding its intended output.
