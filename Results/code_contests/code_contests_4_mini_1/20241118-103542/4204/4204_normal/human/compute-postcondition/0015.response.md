Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `no[0]` is a positive integer, `cand['value']` remains unchanged, `visitados[no[0]]` is True, `grafo[no[0]]` is a non-empty list of neighbors. If there are unvisited neighbors in `grafo[no[0]]`, then `func_1` is called for each unvisited neighbor, updating the visitados list accordingly. If `grafo[no[0]]` is empty or all neighbors are visited, the loop does not execute, and no changes occur to `visitados` or any other parameter.**
