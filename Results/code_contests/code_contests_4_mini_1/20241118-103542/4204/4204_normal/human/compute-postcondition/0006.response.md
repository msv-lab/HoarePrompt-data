The function `func_1` is invoked with the parameters `vizinho`, `grafo`, `visitados`, `depth + 1`, and `cand`. The state of the variables indicates that `visitados[no[0]]` is True, which implies that the current node has already been processed. The variable `cand['value']` remains unchanged, and `grafo[no[0]]` is a non-empty list, indicating there are neighbors to explore.

However, since `visitados[vizinho[0]]` is False, it suggests that the first neighbor has not yet been visited. The function call will potentially explore this neighbor at the next level of depth, but the current state of the variables remains unchanged until the function execution modifies them.

Therefore, the output state remains as follows, reflecting the unchanged values and the intention to explore further:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `no[0]` is a positive integer, `cand['value']` remains unchanged, `visitados[no[0]]` is True, `grafo[no[0]]` is a non-empty list, `visitados[vizinho[0]]` is False, and `func_1` is called with the specified parameters.**
