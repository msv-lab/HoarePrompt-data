According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `grafo[no[0]]` list, which contains the neighbors that the loop iterates over. The loop will execute as long as there are unvisited neighbors in `grafo[no[0]]`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `no[0]` corresponds to a node whose neighbors are in `grafo[no[0]]`, and it is guaranteed that `grafo[no[0]]` is a non-empty list. Since `visitados[vizinho[0]]` is checked for each neighbor during the loop, if `visitados[vizinho[0]]` is True for the first neighbor, the loop will not call `func_1` and will proceed to the next neighbor in the list during the next iteration.

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure either:
1. There are still unvisited neighbors left in `grafo[no[0]]`, or
2. Adjust the states as necessary to reflect the next neighbor being processed.

Since `visitados[vizinho[0]]` is True, we must ensure that the next `vizinho` processed is one that has not yet been visited.

Thus, we need to update the state to reflect that `vizinho` is the next neighbor in `grafo[no[0]]` that has not been visited yet. We do not have specific information about the exact number of neighbors or their states, but we know they exist since `grafo[no[0]]` is non-empty.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `no[0]` is a positive integer, `cand['value']` remains unchanged, `visitados[no[0]]` is True, `grafo[no[0]]` is a non-empty list, `vizinho` is an unvisited neighbor in `grafo[no[0]]`**
