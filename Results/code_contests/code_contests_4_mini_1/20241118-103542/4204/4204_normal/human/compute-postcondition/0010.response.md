Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `no[0]` is a positive integer, `cand['value']` remains unchanged, `visitados[no[0]]` is True, `grafo[no[0]]` is a non-empty list, and if `vizinho[0]` is an unvisited neighbor in `grafo[no[0]]`, then `func_1` is called with `vizinho`, `grafo`, `visitados`, `depth + 1`, and `cand`. If `vizinho[0]` is already visited, no action is taken.***
