According to the code, the loop iterates over the neighbors in `grafo[no[0]]`. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one unvisited neighbor in `grafo[no[0]]`. At the end of the last iteration, it is stated that `visitados[no[0]]` is True and `grafo[no[0]]` is a non-empty list. However, we need to consider the state of the loop variable `vizinho`.

Since `vizinho` is iterating over `grafo[no[0]]`, we need to ensure that there are still unvisited neighbors left. If `vizinho[0]` was an unvisited neighbor and `func_1` was called, it is likely that `visitados[vizinho[0]]` has now become True after the function call.

Therefore, for the loop to execute again, we need to adjust the state to reflect that we are iterating over the remaining unvisited neighbors in `grafo[no[0]]`. 

Assuming that `grafo[no[0]]` originally had unvisited neighbors and one has now been visited, we adjust it to indicate that there must be at least one unvisited neighbor remaining.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `no[0]` is a positive integer, `cand['value']` remains unchanged, `visitados[no[0]]` is True, `grafo[no[0]]` is a non-empty list with at least one unvisited neighbor, and `vizinho` is the next unvisited neighbor in `grafo[no[0]]`**
