The code assigns `True` to `visitados[no[0]]`. This means that the position indexed by `no[0]` in the list `visitados` is marked as visited. The value of `n`, `no[0]`, and `cand['value']` are not directly changed by this line of code.

Therefore, the output state reflects that the state of `visitados` has changed, specifically at the index `no[0]`, but the other variables remain the same.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5; `no[0]` is a positive integer; `cand['value']` remains unchanged; `visitados[no[0]]` is True**
