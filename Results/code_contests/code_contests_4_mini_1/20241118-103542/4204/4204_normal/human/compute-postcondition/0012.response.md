Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `no[0]` is a positive integer, `cand['value']` remains unchanged, `visitados[no[0]]` is True, `grafo[no[0]]` is a non-empty list with at least one unvisited neighbor, `vizinho` is the next unvisited neighbor in `grafo[no[0]]`, and the function `func_1` is called with the parameters `vizinho`, `grafo`, `visitados`, `depth + 1`, and `cand`.**
