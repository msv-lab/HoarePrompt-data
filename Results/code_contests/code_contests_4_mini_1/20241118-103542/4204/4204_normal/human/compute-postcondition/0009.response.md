The function `func_1` is called with the parameters `vizinho`, `grafo`, `visitados`, `depth + 1`, and `cand`. The state of `cand['value']` remains unchanged, and the variable `visitados[no[0]]` is already marked as True, indicating that the node represented by `no[0]` has been visited. The `grafo[no[0]]` is a non-empty list, which suggests that `vizinho` is a valid neighbor that is unvisited, allowing the function to proceed with the depth increment and other parameters.

Since the function invocation does not alter the existing variables, but rather processes the input parameters, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `n`, `no[0]`, and `cand['value']`, along with the updated depth.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5, `no[0]` is a positive integer, `cand['value']` remains unchanged, `visitados[no[0]]` is True, `grafo[no[0]]` is a non-empty list, `vizinho` is an unvisited neighbor in `grafo[no[0]]`, and depth is increased by 1.**
