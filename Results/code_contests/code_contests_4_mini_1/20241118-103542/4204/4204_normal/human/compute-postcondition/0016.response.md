The function `func_1` accepts the following parameters:
1. `no`: an integer representing a certain identifier or count.
2. `grafo`: a representation of the graph, likely involving the roads and connections described.
3. `visitados`: a collection (possibly a list or set) that keeps track of visited nodes or identifiers.
4. `depth`: an integer that indicates the current depth in a traversal or recursion.
5. `cand`: a collection that may represent candidate nodes or values.

The function's output is not explicitly stated in the provided details, but based on the structure of the parameters, it is likely involved in traversing the graph and managing the state of visited nodes and depth. The output could vary depending on the internal conditions and relationships managed by these parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters including an integer `no`, a graph representation `grafo`, a collection of visited nodes `visitados`, an integer `depth`, and a collection of candidates `cand`. The exact return value depends on the operations performed within the function based on these parameters.**
