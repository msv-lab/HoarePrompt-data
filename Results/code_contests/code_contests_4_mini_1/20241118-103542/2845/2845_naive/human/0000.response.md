Correctness: **False**.

The program attempts to calculate the expected number of unique elements in a randomly chosen segment of the array from index l to index r. However, it simply computes the number of unique elements in the entire array and then adds 1, dividing the result by 2. This approach does not correctly compute the expected value of unique elements in all possible segments of the array.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
1 2 1
```
The possible segments are:
1. Segment (1, 1): {1} → 1 unique element
2. Segment (1, 2): {1, 2} → 2 unique elements
3. Segment (1, 3): {1, 2} → 2 unique elements
4. Segment (2, 2): {2} → 1 unique element
5. Segment (2, 3): {2, 1} → 2 unique elements
6. Segment (3, 3): {1} → 1 unique element

The expected number of unique elements is:
(1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1) / 6 = 1.5

However, the program would output:
```
len(set(arr)) = 2
(req + 1) / 2 = (2 + 1) / 2 = 1.5
```

While this specific case gives the correct output, the program does not account for all possible segments correctly, especially when the distribution of numbers varies. For example, if the input were:
```
2
2 2
```
The expected value would be 1 as there's only one unique element, but the program would output 1.5.

Thus, the program fails to accurately calculate the expected number of unique elements for all potential input cases.
