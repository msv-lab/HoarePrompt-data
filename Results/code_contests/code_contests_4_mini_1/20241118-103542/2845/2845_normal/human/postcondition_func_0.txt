The function accepts a positive integer input `n` which represents the number of integers to be read from the user. It then reads a list of `n` integers, calculates the number of unique integers in that list, and returns half of that count (rounded down). However, the function does not handle cases where the input may be empty or not valid integers, which could lead to runtime errors. In its current form, it does not return a value but prints the result instead.
