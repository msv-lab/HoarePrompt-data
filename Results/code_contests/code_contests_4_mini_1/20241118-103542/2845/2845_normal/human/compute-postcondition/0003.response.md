To evaluate the code snippet, we have:

1. `req` is the number of unique integers in `arr`.
2. The code calculates `(req + 1) / 2`.

Given that `n` is a positive integer within the range, `arr` is a list of integers from input, and `req` is already defined as the number of unique integers in `arr`, we compute the expression.

Since `req` is a positive integer (the count of unique integers), `req + 1` will also be a positive integer, and dividing it by 2 will yield a float if `req` is odd or an integer if `req` is even.

Thus, the output state will mention that the operation has been performed without altering the values of `n` and `arr`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer within the range, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `req` is the number of unique integers in `arr`, and the result of (req + 1) / 2 has been computed.**
