The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly as per the provided signature. However, it operates on the following constraints: `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^6\), and `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^6\). The function is expected to return a result based on these inputs.

Since the specific output of the function is not provided in the prompt, I will describe the functionality based on the given constraints. 

Functionality: **The function operates on a positive integer n and a list arr of n positive integers, returning a result based on the defined constraints of the inputs.**
