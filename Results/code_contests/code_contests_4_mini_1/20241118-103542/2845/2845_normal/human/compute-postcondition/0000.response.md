The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since `n` is stated to be a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, its value is determined by the input provided. The state of the other variable `arr` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer within the range, and `arr` is a list of n positive integers.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer within the range, and `arr` is a list of n positive integers**
