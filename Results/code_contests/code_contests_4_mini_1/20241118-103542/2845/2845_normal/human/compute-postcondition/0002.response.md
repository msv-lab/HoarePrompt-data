The variable `req` is assigned the value of `len(set(arr))`. This means that `arr`, which is a list of integers obtained from the input, is converted to a set to remove any duplicate values, and then the length of that set is calculated. Since `n` is a positive integer but does not directly affect this operation, we only focus on `arr`. 

The output state will reflect that `req` holds the number of unique integers present in `arr`. Since the specific contents of `arr` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `req`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer within the range, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `req` is the number of unique integers in `arr`**.
