Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the expected number of unique elements in the chosen segment of the array from index l to index r, inclusive. 

Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Expected Value Calculation**: The program calculates the number of unique elements in the entire array using `len(set(arr))`, which is not relevant to the expected value of unique elements in a random segment. The expected value should consider all possible segments formed by pairs of indices (l, r) and their unique elements, not just the unique elements in the entire array.

2. **Improper Division**: The expression `(req + 1) / 2` does not correspond to any valid calculation for the expected number of unique elements. Given that the expected number should be computed based on the number of unique elements in all segments formed by pairs of indices, this formula is not appropriate.

3. **Missing Edge Cases**: The program does not handle the case where n is 1 or where all elements are the same properly. It also does not account for how many unique elements would be expected if we calculate the averages over all possible segments.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
1 1 2
```
The possible segments are: 
- (1, 1): unique elements = {1} => 1 unique
- (1, 2): unique elements = {1} => 1 unique
- (1, 3): unique elements = {1, 2} => 2 unique
- (2, 2): unique elements = {1} => 1 unique
- (2, 3): unique elements = {1, 2} => 2 unique
- (3, 3): unique elements = {2} => 1 unique

The expected number of unique elements would be the average of these values, which is (1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1) / 6 = 1.3333, not the output from the program which would incorrectly compute `len(set(arr)) + 1) / 2`.

Thus, the program fundamentally fails to meet the problem's requirements.
