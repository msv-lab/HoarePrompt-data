The code assigns the variable `arr` to the result of `map(int, raw_input().split(' '))`, which takes a string input, splits it by spaces, converts each split part into an integer, and produces an iterable map object. The previous state of `arr` is not defined, but it will now contain a list of integers based on the input provided. The value of `n` remains an integer between 1 and 10^6, and `arr` will contain `n` positive integers.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^6; `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers based on the input.**
