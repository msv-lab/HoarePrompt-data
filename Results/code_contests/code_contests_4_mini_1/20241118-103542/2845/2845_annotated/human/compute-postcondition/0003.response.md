To determine the output state, let's analyze the code snippet provided.

The expression `print(req + 1) / 2` indicates that we are taking the variable `req`, which represents the number of unique integers in the list `arr`, adding 1 to it, and then dividing by 2. However, the division is applied after the print statement, which will not affect the output state as it pertains to the state of the variables.

Since `req` is the number of unique integers in `arr`, the output of this code will not change the state of `n`, `arr`, or `req` values themselves. 

Therefore, we can conclude that:
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^6,
- `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers,
- `req` is the number of unique integers in `arr`, which can be any integer value based on the contents of `arr`.

The print statement will display the value of `(req + 1) / 2`, but since we are focusing on the output state of the variables and what is returned from the function, we note that the state of `n`, `arr`, and `req` is unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^6; `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers; `req` is the number of unique integers in `arr`.**
