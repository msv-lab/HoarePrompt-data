The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `n` is still within the range of 1 to 10^6, and the state of `arr` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^6, and `arr` is a list of n positive integers where each element is in the range 1 to 10^6.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^6, and `arr` is a list of n positive integers where each element is in the range 1 to 10^6**
