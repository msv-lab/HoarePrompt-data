The value of `req` is assigned the value of `len(set(arr))`, which calculates the number of unique elements in the list `arr`. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it only defines the length of the list, and `arr` is still the same list of integers. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values and the calculated value of `req`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^6; `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers based on the input; `req` is the number of unique integers in `arr`.**
