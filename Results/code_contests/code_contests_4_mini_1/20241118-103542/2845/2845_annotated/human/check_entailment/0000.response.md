To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the code and its logic.

### Problem Description
The task is to compute the expected number of unique elements in a randomly chosen segment of an array. Given two indices `l` and `r`, the program should handle cases where `l > r` by swapping them, then calculate the expected unique elements in the segment from `l` to `r`.

### Provided Code
```python
def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    arr = map(int, raw_input().split(' '))
    req = len(set(arr))
    print(req + 1) / 2
```

### Analysis of the Code
1. **Input Handling**: The code reads an integer `n` and then reads a list of `n` integers. This part is correctly implemented.
   
2. **Unique Elements Calculation**: The code calculates the number of unique elements in the entire array using `set(arr)`. This gives the count of unique elements correctly for the full array, but the problem requires us to compute the expected number of unique elements for all possible segments.

3. **Expected Value Calculation**: The code then calculates `(req + 1) / 2`. This is incorrect because it does not relate to the expected number of unique elements in any segment of the array. The expected value should consider all combinations of indices `l` and `r`, which this code does not do.

### Issues with the Program
- The program computes the number of unique elements in the entire array and simply averages it by dividing by 2, which is not aligned with the requirement to consider all possible segments.
- It does not handle the case of computing the expected value based on the combinations of segments that can be created from the array.
  
### Test Cases
Let's consider some test cases:
1. **Case with all unique elements**:
   - Input: `3\n1 2 3`
   - Expected Output: The expected number of unique elements is 2 (for segments [1,2], [1,3], [2,3]) and 3 (for the segment [1,1], [2,2], [3,3]).
   - The average is not simply `len(set(arr)) + 1 / 2`.

2. **Case with duplicates**:
   - Input: `4\n1 1 2 2`
   - The expected unique elements should vary based on different segments, but the program will not compute this correctly.

### Conclusion
The program does not implement the logic required to calculate the expected number of unique elements in any segment from `l` to `r`. Therefore, it is fundamentally incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
