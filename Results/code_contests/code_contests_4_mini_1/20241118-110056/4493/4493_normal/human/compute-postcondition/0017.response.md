The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `arr`. 

- `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000, representing the number of students.
- `k` is an integer between 1 and 5, representing a threshold for participation.
- `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 0 and 5, indicating the number of times each student has participated in the ACM ICPC world championship.

After executing the function body, the output will depend on the values of the input parameters. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n`, an integer `k`, and a list `arr` of `n` integers representing student participation counts. It processes these inputs to return a value based on the participation data and the threshold `k`.**
