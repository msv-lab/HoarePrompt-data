The values of `n` and `k` are converted from strings to integers using `int()`. Since it is stated that `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000, and `k` is an integer between 1 and 5, the conversion will maintain these constraints. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `k` is an integer between 1 and 5, and both are converted to integers.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `k` is an integer between 1 and 5**
