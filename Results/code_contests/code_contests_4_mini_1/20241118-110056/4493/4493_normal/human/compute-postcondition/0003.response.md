The variable `count` is initialized to `0.0`, without affecting any other variables. The previous values of `n`, `k`, and `arr` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is that `count` is now `0.0`, while `n`, `k`, and `arr` retain their initial values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `k` is an integer between 1 and 5, `arr` is a map of integers from user input, and `count` is 0.0**
