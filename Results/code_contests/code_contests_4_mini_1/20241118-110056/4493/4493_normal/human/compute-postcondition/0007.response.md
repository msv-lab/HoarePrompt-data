Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `i` is 0, `k` is an integer between 1 and 5, `arr` is a map of integers from user input, and `count` is 0.0. If the sum of `arr[i]` and `k` is less than or equal to 5, `count` is increased by 1.0; otherwise, `count` remains unchanged at 0.0. This accounts for all values of `arr[i]` that, when added to `k`, either meet or exceed 5, as well as the case where `arr[i]` leads to a sum that is exactly 5.***
