Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `i` is 2, `k` is an integer between 1 and 5, `arr` is a map of integers with at least 2 elements, and `count` is 0.0 initially. If the sum of `arr[i]` and `k` is less than or equal to 5, `count` is increased by 1.0. If the sum is greater than 5, `count` remains unchanged at 0.0.***
