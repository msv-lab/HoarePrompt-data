The code assigns `arr` the value of `map(int, raw_input().split())`, which processes input received from the user. The input is split into separate components and each component is converted into an integer. The initial state does not change, and the values of `n` and `k` remain the same. The specific integers that `arr` will contain depend on the user input, which is not specified.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `k` is an integer between 1 and 5, and `arr` is a map of integers from user input.**
