Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `i` is 1, `k` is an integer between 1 and 5, `arr` is a map of integers with at least 2 elements, and `count` is 0.0. If `arr[i] + k` is less than or equal to 5, then `count` is incremented by 1.0; otherwise, `count` remains unchanged at 0.0.***
