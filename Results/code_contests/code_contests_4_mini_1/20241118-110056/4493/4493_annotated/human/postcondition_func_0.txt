The function reads integers `n` and `k` from user input, reads a list of integers `arr`, counts how many students have a participation count plus `k` that is less than or equal to 5, and prints the integer number of complete teams (each containing 3 students) that can be formed from that count. If `n` is 0, it will print 0. It does not handle input validation.
