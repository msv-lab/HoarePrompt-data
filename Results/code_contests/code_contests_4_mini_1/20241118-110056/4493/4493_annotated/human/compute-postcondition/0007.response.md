Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `k` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers from user input, and `count` is a floating-point number. If the sum of `arr[i]` and `k` is less than or equal to 5, then `count` is incremented by 1. If the sum is greater than 5, `count` remains unchanged at 0.0.***
