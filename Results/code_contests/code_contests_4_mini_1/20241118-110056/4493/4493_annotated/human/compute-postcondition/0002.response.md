The variable `arr` is assigned the result of `map(int, raw_input().split())`, which takes input from the user, splits the input string into individual components, converts each component into an integer, and creates an iterable of these integers. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged, so the output state reflects that `arr` now contains the integers inputted by the user. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer representing the number of students (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), `k` is an integer representing the number of times each team must participate (1 ≤ k ≤ 5), and `arr` is a list of integers from user input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of students (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), `k` is an integer representing the number of times each team must participate (1 ≤ k ≤ 5), and `arr` is a list of integers from user input**.
