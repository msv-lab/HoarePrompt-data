The values of `n` and `k` are converted to integers using the `int()` function. However, since `n` and `k` are already stated to be integers within their respective bounds, their values remain unchanged. The output state reflects that both variables are confirmed to be integers.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of students (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), `k` is an integer representing the number of times each team must participate (1 ≤ k ≤ 5)**
