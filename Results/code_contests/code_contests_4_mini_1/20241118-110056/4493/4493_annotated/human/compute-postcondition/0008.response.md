According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. Since `i` is currently 0 and `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0, so for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` should be incremented to 1. The value of `n` does not need to be adjusted since it is already greater than 0, allowing for further iterations.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` to 1.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `k` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers from user input, and `count` is a floating-point number.**
