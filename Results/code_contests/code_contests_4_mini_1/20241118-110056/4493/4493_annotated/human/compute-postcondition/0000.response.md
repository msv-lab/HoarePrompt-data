The code takes input for `n` and `k`, which are both integers. The `raw_input()` function will receive a string input that gets split into two values. Then `n` and `k` will be assigned these values after converting them to integers. The other variables are not affected by this code.

The output state is therefore:
`n` is an integer representing the number of students (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), `k` is an integer representing the number of times each team must participate (1 ≤ k ≤ 5).

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of students (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), `k` is an integer representing the number of times each team must participate (1 ≤ k ≤ 5)**
