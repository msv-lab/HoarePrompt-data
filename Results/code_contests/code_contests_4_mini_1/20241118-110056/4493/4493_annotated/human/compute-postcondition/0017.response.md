The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `arr`. The parameter `n` is an integer representing the number of students, constrained such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2000. The parameter `k` is also an integer representing the number of times each team must participate, constrained such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 5. The parameter `arr` is a list of integers where each integer `yi` (0 ≤ yi ≤ 5) indicates the number of times the i-th student has participated in the ACM ICPC world championship. 

The function processes these inputs to produce an output based on the participation criteria defined by `n`, `k`, and the values in `arr`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: an integer n representing the number of students, an integer k representing the number of times each team must participate, and a list arr of integers indicating the participation counts of each student.**
