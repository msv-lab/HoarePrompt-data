Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how it works:

1. It reads the integer `n`, which represents the number of elements in the array.
2. It reads the array `a` from the input and reverses it. This allows the program to handle duplicates by processing the rightmost occurrences first.
3. It uses a set `vis` to keep track of the unique elements that have been encountered while iterating through the reversed array.
4. For each element in the reversed array, if the element has not been encountered before (i.e., it is not in `vis`), it is added to the `ans` list and marked as visited by adding it to the `vis` set.
5. Finally, it prints the length of the `ans` list (which contains the unique elements in the order of their rightmost occurrence) and the elements themselves in the correct order (reversed back to original).

The provided examples from the problem statement have been tested implicitly:
- In the first example, the program retains `5`, `6`, and `1`, which are the rightmost occurrences.
- In the second example, it retains `2` and `4`.
- In the third example, it retains `6`, which is the only element.

The logic used ensures that all edge cases (such as when all elements are the same or when there are no duplicates) are handled correctly. Thus, I do not find any potential case where the program fails to meet the requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.
