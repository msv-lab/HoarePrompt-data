The function reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers from standard input, then processes the list to remove duplicates while maintaining the order of their first appearances. It reverses the list before processing, creating a new list `ans` which contains only unique integers. Finally, it prints the count of unique integers and the unique integers in their original order. If `n` is outside the range of valid values or if the input list is empty, the function will still execute, but the behavior regarding those edge cases is not explicitly defined in the annotations.
