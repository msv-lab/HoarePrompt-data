The operation `vis.add(ai)` adds the value of `ai` to the set `vis`. The variable `ai` is the next integer in the list `a`, and `vis` remains unchanged except for the addition of `ai`. Since `vis` is updated to include `ai`, it will now contain one more element.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `a` is a list of `n` integers; `ans` is updated to include `ai`; `vis` now includes `ai`; `ai` is the next integer in `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `a` is a list of `n` integers; `ans` is updated to include `ai`; `vis` now includes `ai`; `ai` is the next integer in `a`.**
