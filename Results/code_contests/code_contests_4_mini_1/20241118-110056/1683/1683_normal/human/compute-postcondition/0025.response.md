The code prints the elements of the list `ans` in reverse order, converting each element to a string and joining them with spaces. The length of `ans` is not altered by this operation, so all variables remain unchanged aside from the output.

The output state reflects the printed result of the reversed list. 

Output State: **`ans` is a list containing unique integers from `a`, and the elements of `ans` are printed in reverse order, separated by spaces.**
