Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `a` is a list of `n` integers. If `ai` is already in `vis`, then `ans` remains unchanged, and we proceed to the next integer in `a`. If `ai` is not in `vis`, then `ai` is added to both `ans` and `vis`. This process ensures that `ans` contains only unique integers from `a`, while `vis` tracks all integers that have been processed.***
