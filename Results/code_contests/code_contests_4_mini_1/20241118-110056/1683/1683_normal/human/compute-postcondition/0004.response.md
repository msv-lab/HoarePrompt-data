The code initializes a variable `vis` as a set, which is a collection type that can hold unique elements. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed by this operation; `n`, `a`, and `ans` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the initialization of `vis`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `a` is the reverse of the original list of `n` integers; `ans` is an empty list; `vis` is an empty set**
