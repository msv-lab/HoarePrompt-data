Output State: **`ans` is a list containing unique integers from `a` in the order they first appear, `vis` is a set containing all integers that have been processed. If `a` contains duplicate integers, only the first occurrence of each integer will be included in `ans`. If `a` is an empty list, the loop does not execute, and both `ans` and `vis` remain empty. If `n` is outside the range of 1 to 50, the initial state is invalid.**
