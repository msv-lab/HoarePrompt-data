The list `a` is reversed using slicing `a[::-1]`. This operation does not change the value of `n`, which remains as an integer within the range 1 to 50. The content of the list `a` is altered to be its reverse. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged `n` and the new order of `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50; `a` is the reverse of the original list of n integers**
