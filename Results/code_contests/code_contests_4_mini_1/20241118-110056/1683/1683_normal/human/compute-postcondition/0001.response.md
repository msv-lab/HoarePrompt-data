The code assigns the value of `a` to a new list created by mapping the integers from the input. The input is read from standard input, split by spaces, and each segment is converted to an integer. The previous state indicates that `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, and `a` is a list of `n` integers, each between 1 and 1000. After executing the code, `a` will contain the integers provided in the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50; `a` is a list of n integers based on input values, where each integer satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000**
