According to the code, the loop iterates over the elements in the list `a`. For the loop to execute, the list `a` must contain at least one element. Given that `a` is the reverse of the original list of `n` integers, it will contain exactly `n` integers as long as `n` is at least 1, which is already ensured by the given state (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50). 

At the start of the loop, the variable `ai` will take on the values of each element in `a` as the loop iterates through it. Since `a` is based on `n`, `ai` will start from the first element of `a`.

Thus, for the loop to be executed, we must ensure that `a` has at least one integer and that `ai` is the first element in the list `a` during the first iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `a` is a list of `n` integers (the reverse of the original list), `ans` is an empty list, `vis` is an empty set, `ai` is the first element in `a`**
