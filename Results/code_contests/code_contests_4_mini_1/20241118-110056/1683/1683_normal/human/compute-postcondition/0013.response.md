The `continue` statement is executed, which causes the program to skip the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables `n`, `a`, `ans`, `vis`, and `ai` remain unchanged as the `continue` statement does not modify them. Therefore, the output state reflects that no changes occurred in the variable states.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `ans` remains unchanged, `vis` remains unchanged, `ai` is the next integer in `a**
