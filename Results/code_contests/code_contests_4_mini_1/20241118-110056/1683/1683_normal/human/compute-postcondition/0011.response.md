Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `a` is a list of `n` integers (the reverse of the original list), `ans` is a list that contains the first element of `a` if `ai` (the first element of `a`) was not previously in `vis`; otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged. `vis` is a set that contains `ai` if it was not previously in `vis`, otherwise `vis` remains unchanged. If `ai` is already in `vis`, the program continues without modifying `ans` or `vis`.***
