According to the code, the for loop iterates over each integer `ai` in the list `a`. The loop will continue as long as there are unprocessed integers in `a`. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, and `a` contains `n` integers. 

Since the loop processes each element of `a`, we need to determine the state of the iteration variables. If `ai` has already been processed (i.e., if it is in `vis`), then the loop moves to the next integer in `a`. The loop will execute again if there are still unprocessed integers left in `a`.

To adjust the state for the next iteration, we must account for the number of integers that have been processed already. If the last processed integer was the `k`-th integer in `a`, the next iteration will process the `(k+1)`-th integer.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `vis` to include the integers that have been processed up to that point, and we need to set `ai` to the next integer in the list.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `a` is a list of `n` integers; `vis` includes all integers processed so far; `ai` is the next integer in `a` that has not been processed yet.**
