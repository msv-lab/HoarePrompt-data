The code prints the length of the list `ans`. The variable `ans` is a list containing unique integers from `a` in the order they first appear. The previous values of `ans` directly affect the output of the `print` statement, but since we were not provided any specific values for `ans`, we cannot determine its length. 

Therefore, the output state is: `ans` is a list containing unique integers from `a`, and the length of `ans` is printed.

Output State: **`ans` is a list containing unique integers from `a`, and the length of `ans` is printed.**
