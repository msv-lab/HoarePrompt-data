The code `continue` does not change the values of any variables. It simply causes the loop to skip the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged in terms of variable values. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `a` is a list of `n` integers (the reverse of the original list), `ans` is an empty list, `vis` is a set that contains `ai`, and `ai` is the first element in `a`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
