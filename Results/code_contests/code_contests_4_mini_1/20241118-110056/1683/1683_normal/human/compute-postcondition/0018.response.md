The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since the values of `n`, `a`, `ans`, and `vis` are not modified by the `continue` statement, the output state remains unchanged in terms of these variables. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `a` is a list of `n` integers; `ans` remains unchanged; `vis` includes `ai` if it is not already present, and we are moving on to the next integer in `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `a` is a list of `n` integers; `ans` remains unchanged; `vis` includes `ai` if it is not already present, and we are moving on to the next integer in `a`.**
