The code appends the value of `ai` to the list `ans`. Since `ai` is the first element in `a` and is not in `vis`, the state of `ans` will now include this first element. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `a` is a list of `n` integers (the reverse of the original list), `ans` now contains the first element of `a`, `vis` is an empty set, and `ai` is the first element of `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `a` is a list of `n` integers (the reverse of the original list), `ans` now contains the first element of `a`, `vis` is an empty set, and `ai` is the first element of `a`.**
