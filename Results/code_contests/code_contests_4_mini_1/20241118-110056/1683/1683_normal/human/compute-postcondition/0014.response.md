The code appends the value of `ai` to the list `ans`. The variable `ai` represents the next integer in the list `a`, which means that the state of `ans` will now include that integer. The previous values of `ans`, `vis`, and `ai` remain unchanged except for the addition of `ai` to `ans`. Therefore, the output state will reflect this change.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `ans` is updated to include `ai`, `vis` remains unchanged, `ai` is the next integer in `a`**
