The code `ans.append(ai)` adds the current integer `ai` to the list `ans`. The variable `ai` is an integer from the list `a`, and it is only appended if `ai` is not already in the set `vis`. Assuming `vis` is updated accordingly, the state of `ans` changes to include `ai`. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ `n` â‰¤ 50; `a` is a list of `n` integers; `ans` now includes `ai`, `vis` includes `ai` if it wasn't present before.**
