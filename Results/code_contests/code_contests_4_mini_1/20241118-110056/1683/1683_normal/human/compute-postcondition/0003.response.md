The variable `ans` is initialized as an empty list. This does not affect any other variables, and the state of `n` and `a` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `a` is the reverse of the original list of `n` integers; `ans` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `a` is the reverse of the original list of `n` integers; `ans` is an empty list**
