The `vis.add(ai)` statement adds the value `ai` to the set `vis`. Since `vis` includes `ai` if it wasn't present before, after executing this line, `ai` will be part of the set `vis`. Other variables are not affected by this action. Therefore, the output state, considering that `n` is within the given range, `a` contains `n` integers, and `ans` currently includes `ai`, is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `a` is a list of `n` integers; `ans` now includes `ai`; `vis` includes `ai` after the addition.**
