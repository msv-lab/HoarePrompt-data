To assess the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze both the code and the expected behavior.

### Problem Description:
Petya wants to remove duplicate elements from an array while retaining only the rightmost occurrence of each element and preserving the order of the remaining unique elements.

### Program Code:
```python
import sys

n = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split(' ')))
a = a[::-1]
ans = []
vis = set({})
for ai in a:
    if ai in vis:
        continue
    else:
        ans.append(ai)
        vis.add(ai)
print(len(ans))
print(' '.join(map(str, ans[::-1])))
```

### Analysis of the Code:
1. The code reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`.
2. It reverses the list `a` and then iterates through this reversed list.
3. It uses a set `vis` to track which elements have already been added to the `ans` list.
4. If an element has not been seen yet, it appends it to `ans` and adds it to `vis`.
5. Finally, it prints the length of `ans` and the elements in `ans` in reverse order (to restore the original order).

### Output Hints:
The output hints state that the function processes the list to remove duplicates while maintaining the order of their first appearances. It mentions that if `n` is outside the valid range or the input list is empty, the function will still execute without defined behavior for those cases.

### Correctness Assessment:
- The code correctly handles the removal of duplicates by reversing the list, checking for seen elements, and then restoring the order before printing the result.
- It successfully meets the requirement to keep the rightmost occurrence of each element.
- The use of a set for tracking seen elements ensures that only unique values are added to the final list.
- The output format adheres to the requirement by first printing the count of unique elements followed by the unique elements themselves.

### Edge Cases:
- The hints mention that the behavior regarding edge cases like `n` being outside the valid range or the list being empty is not explicitly defined. However, the problem states that `n` will always be in the range `1 ≤ n ≤ 50`, so we do not need to worry about those edge cases.
- The program does not explicitly handle the case where `n = 1`, but it will still work correctly since there would be no duplicates to remove.

### Conclusion:
The program fulfills all the conditions specified in the problem description and handles the examples provided correctly. 

Therefore, the final assessment is:

Correctness: **True**. 

The code correctly removes duplicates while keeping only the rightmost occurrences and maintains the original order of the unique elements.
