The variable `vis` is assigned a new empty set, which initializes it as an empty collection. The previous values of the affected variables do not change, and the states of `n`, `a`, and `ans` remain the same. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `a` is a list of integers based on input values and has been reversed; `ans` is an empty list; `vis` is now an empty set.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `a` is a list of integers based on input values and has been reversed; `ans` is an empty list; `vis` is now an empty set.**
