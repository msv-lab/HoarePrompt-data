The `continue` statement does not modify any variables or data structures. It simply skips the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. Thus, the values of `n`, `a`, `ai`, `vis`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `ai` is the second element of `a`, `vis` contains all unique elements encountered so far including the first element of `a`, and `ans` contains the unique elements added during this operation including the first element of `a` if it was unique.**
