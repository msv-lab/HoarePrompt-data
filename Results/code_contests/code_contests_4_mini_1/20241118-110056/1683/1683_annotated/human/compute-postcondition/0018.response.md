The statement `continue` is used to skip the remaining part of the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables do not change, and we remain within the loop.

The output state reflects that we are continuing to the next iteration of the loop without any changes to the existing variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `ai` is the third element of `a`, `vis` contains all unique elements encountered so far including the first element of `a`, and `ans` contains the unique elements added during this operation including the first element of `a` if it was unique, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
