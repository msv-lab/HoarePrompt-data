The variable `ans` is initialized as an empty list. The initial state of `n` is preserved, and `a` remains reversed but the initialization of `ans` does not affect them. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `a` is a list of integers based on input values, and `a` is reversed; `ans` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `a` is a list of integers based on input values, and `a` is reversed; `ans` is an empty list**
