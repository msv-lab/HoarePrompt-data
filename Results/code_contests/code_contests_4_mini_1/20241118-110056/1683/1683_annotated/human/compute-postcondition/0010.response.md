The code `vis.add(ai)` adds the element `ai` to the set `vis`. Since it is mentioned that `vis` does not contain `ai`, it will now include `ai`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated state of `vis` while keeping the other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `a` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `ai` is the first element of `a`, `ans` contains the element `ai`, and `vis` now contains `ai`**
