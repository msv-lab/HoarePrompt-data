Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `a` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, and `ai` is the first element of `a`. If `ai` is already in the set `vis`, the program continues without making any changes to `ans` or `vis`. Otherwise, `ai` is appended to the list `ans`, and `ai` is added to the set `vis`. In either case, `vis` contains all unique elements encountered so far, and `ans` contains the unique elements added during this operation.***
