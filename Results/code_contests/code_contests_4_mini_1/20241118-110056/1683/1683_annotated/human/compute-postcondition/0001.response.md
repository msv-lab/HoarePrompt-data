The code assigns `a` the value of a list created by mapping the integers from the input line split by spaces. The variable `n` remains unchanged, but `a` is now populated with integers based on the input. The previous values of `a` are not known, but it is now a list of integers corresponding to the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `a` is a list of integers based on input values.**
