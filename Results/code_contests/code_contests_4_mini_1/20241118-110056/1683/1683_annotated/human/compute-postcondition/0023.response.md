Output State: **`ans` contains the unique elements from the list `a` in the order of their first appearance, `vis` contains all unique elements encountered during the loop execution. If `a` contains all duplicates, then `ans` will be empty after the loop, and `vis` will contain the unique elements from `a`. If `a` is empty, the loop will not execute, resulting in `ans` remaining empty and `vis` also remaining empty.**
