The code prints the length of `ans`. The initial state indicates that `ans` contains the unique elements from the list `a` in the order of their first appearance, while `vis` contains all unique elements encountered during the loop execution. Since the details of `ans` are not provided, the length of `ans` could be 0 (if all elements in `a` are duplicates) or a positive integer (if there are unique elements). The variable `vis` does not affect the output of this line. 

Consequently, the output state reflects the length of `ans`, which is either a non-negative integer or 0, depending on the content of `a`. 

Output State: **`len(ans)` is printed**
