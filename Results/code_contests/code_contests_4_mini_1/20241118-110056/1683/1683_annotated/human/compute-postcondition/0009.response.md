The code appends the value of `ai` to the list `ans`. Since `ai` is the first element of the list `a`, its value is known and will be added to `ans`. The variable `ans` changes from being an empty list to containing one element, which is `ai`. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `a` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `ai` is the first element of `a`, `ans` contains the element `ai`, and `vis` does not contain `ai`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `a` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `ai` is the first element of `a`, `ans` contains the element `ai`, and `vis` does not contain `ai`**.
