Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `a` from standard input, then processes the list to retain only the unique elements in the order of their first appearance (from the original list), but outputs them in reverse order. It prints the count of unique elements, followed by the unique elements themselves. If `a` contains all duplicates, the output will reflect that with a count of 0 and no unique elements printed. If `a` is empty, it will also result in a count of 0 with no output for the unique elements. **
