The statement `continue` does not change the values of any variables, but it instructs the program to skip the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration, if applicable. Since the values of `n`, `a`, `ai`, `ans`, and `vis` remain unchanged, the output state will reflect the current values of these variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `a` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `ai` is the first element of `a`, `ans` is an empty list, `vis` is a set containing `ai`**
