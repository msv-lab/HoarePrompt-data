The value of `ai` is appended to the list `ans`. Given that `ai` is the second element of `a`, it will either be unique or a duplicate of an existing element in `ans`. The initial state indicates that `ans` already contains the unique elements encountered so far, including the first element of `a`. Therefore, `ans` will be updated to include `ai` if it was not previously included. The values of `n`, `a`, and `vis` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `ai` is the second element of `a`, `vis` contains all unique elements encountered so far including the first element of `a`, and `ans` is updated to include `ai` if it was unique.**
