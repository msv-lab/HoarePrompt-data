Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `ai` is the second element of `a`, `vis` contains all unique elements encountered so far including the first element of `a`, and `ans` contains the unique elements added during this operation including the first element of `a` if it was unique. If `ai` is already in `vis`, it is not added again, and `vis` and `ans` remain unchanged. If `ai` is not in `vis`, it is added to both `vis` and `ans`, thereby ensuring that both collections maintain their unique elements, with `ans` potentially growing by including `ai` only if it was unique.***
