In the provided code snippet, `ans.append(ai)` is executed, which means that the value of `ai` (the third element of the list `a`) will be added to the list `ans`. The impact of this operation is that if `ai` is unique (not already in `ans`), it will be appended to `ans`. 

Since `n` is an integer with a defined range, and `a` is a list with at least 2 elements, we can assume `ai` has a defined value. The unique elements in `vis` already include the first element of `a`, and `ans` will include the first element of `a` if it is unique.

The state of `n`, `a`, and `vis` remains unchanged. The only change occurs in `ans`, where `ai` is appended.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `ai` is the third element of `a`, `vis` contains all unique elements encountered so far including the first element of `a`, and `ans` is updated to include `ai`**.
