The variable `vis` is updated to include the element `ai`, which is the third element of the list `a`. This means that `ai` is added to the set `vis`, which already contains all unique elements encountered so far, including the first element of `a`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `ai` is the third element of `a`, `vis` now includes `ai`, and `ans` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `ai` is the third element of `a`, `vis` now includes `ai`, and `ans` remains unchanged.**
