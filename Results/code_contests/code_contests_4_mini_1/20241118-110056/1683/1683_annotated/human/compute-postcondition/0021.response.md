Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, and `ai` is the third element of `a`. If `ai` is already in `vis`, we continue to the next iteration, leaving `ans` unchanged and `vis` unchanged. If `ai` is not in `vis`, then `ai` is added to `vis`, and `ai` is appended to `ans`, thereby ensuring that `ans` contains only unique elements encountered during this operation.***
