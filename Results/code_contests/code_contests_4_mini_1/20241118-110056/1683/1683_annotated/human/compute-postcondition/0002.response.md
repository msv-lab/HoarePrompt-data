The list `a` is reversed by the operation `a[::-1]`. The value of `n` does not impact this operation, and the previous state of `a` is based on input values. After executing the code, `a` will hold its elements in reverse order. Therefore, the output state reflects the original `a` as a list of integers and the new reversed version of `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `a` is a list of integers based on input values, and `a` is reversed.**
