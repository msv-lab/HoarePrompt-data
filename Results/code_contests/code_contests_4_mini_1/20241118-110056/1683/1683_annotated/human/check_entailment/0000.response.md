To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step.

### Problem Requirements:
1. Remove duplicate elements from an array while keeping only the rightmost occurrence.
2. The relative order of the remaining unique elements should not change.
3. Output the count of unique elements and the unique elements themselves.

### Code Analysis:
```python
def func():
    n = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())  # Read integer n
    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split(' ')))  # Read the array of integers
    a = a[::-1]  # Reverse the array to process from the rightmost side
    ans = []  # List to store unique elements
    vis = set({})  # Set to keep track of seen elements
    for ai in a:
        if ai in vis:  # If element is already seen, continue
            continue
        else:
            ans.append(ai)  # Add unique element to the answer
            vis.add(ai)  # Mark this element as seen
        
    # The state of the program after the loop has been executed:
    print(len(ans))  # Print the count of unique elements
    print(' '.join(map(str, ans[::-1])))  # Print the unique elements in original order
```

### Explanation of Logic:
1. The program reads the number of elements and the elements themselves.
2. It reverses the array to process the elements from the rightmost side, which allows it to easily track the last occurrence of each element.
3. It uses a set (`vis`) to track which elements have been encountered.
4. As it iterates through the reversed array, it appends elements to the `ans` list if they haven't been seen before, ensuring that only their last occurrence is kept.
5. Finally, it prints the count of unique elements and the unique elements in their correct order by reversing `ans` again.

### Potential Edge Cases:
1. If there are no duplicates (e.g., input: `5\n1 2 3 4 5`), the output should be `5\n1 2 3 4 5`, which is handled correctly.
2. If the input contains all duplicates (e.g., input: `5\n7 7 7 7 7`), the output should be `1\n7`, which is also handled correctly.
3. If the input has a single element (e.g., input: `1\n9`), the output should be `1\n9`, which is handled correctly.

### Conclusion:
After reviewing the code against the problem description and considering various edge cases, the program correctly implements the required functionality. I can't find a single case where the program does not work as expected according to the description.

Correctness: **True**
