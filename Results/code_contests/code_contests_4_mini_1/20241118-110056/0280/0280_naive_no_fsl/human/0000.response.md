Correctness: **False**

The given program aims to determine the minimal number of moves required to make the positions of four moles form a compact square. However, it fails to correctly handle various edge cases. 

One potential issue is that the code does not properly validate whether the moles can form a square or not after the rotation operations. Specifically, the logic in `func_12()` checks the distances between the moles but does not explicitly check for conditions that define a square (i.e., equal side lengths and equal angles). 

For example, consider the following input where all moles are at the same position, which means they cannot form a square:

```
1
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
```

In this case, the expected output should be `-1` because it's impossible to form a square with zero area, yet the program may not handle this correctly due to the flawed logic in distance evaluation.

Thus, there are cases where the output would not match the expected requirements of the problem, leading to a conclusion that the program is incorrect.
