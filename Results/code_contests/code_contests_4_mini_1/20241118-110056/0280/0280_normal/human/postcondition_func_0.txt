The function accepts two parameters, `n` (an integer that should be between 1 and 100) and `p` (an integer), and returns `n` raised to the power of `(p - 2)` modulo `p`. It does not handle cases where `p` is less than or equal to 2, which could lead to negative powers or invalid operations in a modular arithmetic context.
