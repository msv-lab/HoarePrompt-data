The function does not accept any parameters and returns a list of integers obtained by converting each element of the string output from `func_4()` into an integer after splitting the string by whitespace. If `func_4()` returns a string that cannot be fully converted to integers (for example, if it includes non-numeric characters), a ValueError may be raised during the conversion process.
