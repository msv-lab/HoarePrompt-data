According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `p` and `n`. The loop will execute if `p * p` is less than or equal to `n`, allowing the range to contain values. Since `n` is at least `p * p`, the loop can execute. Additionally, `i` should start at `p * p`, which is the first value in the range.

Given that `p` is increased by 1, we can adjust the state accordingly. 

State: **`p` is now increased by 1, `n` is at least `p * p`, `i` is `p * p`**
