Postcondition: ***If `prime[p]` is True and `n` is at least `p * p`, then `prime` is set to False for all indices `i` from `p * p` to `n` in steps of `p`. If `n` is less than `p * p`, the loop does not execute and `prime` remains unchanged. Additionally, `p` has been increased by 1 and `n` is at least `p * p`.***
