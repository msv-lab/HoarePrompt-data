The list `f` is an empty list initially. The code `f.append(p)` appends the value of `p` (which is 2) to the list `f`. Therefore, after execution, `f` will contain the value 2. The other variables (`n` and `prime`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`f` is [2], `n` is greater than 2, `p` is 2, and the value at index `p` in the list `prime` is true**.
