According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `(p * p) + (2 * p)`, and `n` is at least `p * p + p`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by `p` in the next iteration, making it `i + p`. Therefore, we need to ensure that this new value of `i` is still less than or equal to `n`. The current value of `i` is `(p * p) + (2 * p)`. Thus, to guarantee that the loop can execute once more, `n` must be at least `(p * p) + (2 * p) + p`, which simplifies to `p * p + 3 * p`.

So, we need to adjust `n` to be at least `p * p + 3 * p`. The value of `p` remains unchanged, and we will update `i` to be `(p * p) + (3 * p)` for the next iteration.

State: **`p` is now increased by 1, `n` is at least `p * p + 3 * p`, `i` is (p * p) + (3 * p), and `prime[i]` is set to False**
