According to the code, the loop iterates over a range starting from `p * p` up to `n + 1`, incrementing by `p`. For the loop to execute, the starting value of `i` (which is `p * p`) must be less than or equal to `n`. Given that `n` is greater than `p * p`, the loop can execute at least once. 

At the start of the loop, `i` should be initialized to the first value of the range, which is `p * p`. Since `p` has already been increased by 1, we need to ensure that `i` reflects the correct starting point for the loop.

Therefore, the adjusted states should be:
- `p` has been increased by 1 (so we need to account for that in the calculation of `p * p`).
- `n` must still be greater than `p * p`.
- `i` should be initialized to `p * p`.

State: **`p` is increased by 1, `n` is greater than `p * p`, `i` is `p * p`**
