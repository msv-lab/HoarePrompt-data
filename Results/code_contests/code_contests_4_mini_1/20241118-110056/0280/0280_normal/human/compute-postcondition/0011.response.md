Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100. If `prime[p]` is `True`, and `n` is at least 4, the elements of the `prime` list at indices 4, 6, 8, ..., up to `n` are set to `False`, indicating that those indices are not prime numbers. If `n` is less than 4, the `prime` list remains unchanged except for `prime[0]` and `prime[1]`, which are also `False`.***
