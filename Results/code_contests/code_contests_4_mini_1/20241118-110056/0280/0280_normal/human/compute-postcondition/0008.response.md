The code sets `prime[i]` to `False`, where `i` is 8. Since the initial state indicates that `prime` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to `True`, except for `prime[4]` and `prime[6]` which are `False`, this means that the element at index 8 will now be set to `False`. The other variables (`n`, `p`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the change made to the `prime` list.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 8, `prime` is a list of length `n + 1` with elements initialized to `True`, except `prime[4]` is `False`, `prime[6]` is `False`, and `prime[8]` is `False`; `p` is 2, `i` is 8**
