According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 6, and `n` is greater than or equal to 6. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be updated to the next value calculated by `i + p`, which would be `6 + 2 = 8`. 

Since `n` is at least 6, for the loop to execute again, it must also hold that `i` is less than or equal to `n`. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes again, we need to adjust the states accordingly.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 8, `prime` is a list of length `n + 1` with elements initialized to `True`, except `prime[4]` is `False`, `prime[6]` is `False`, `p` is 2, `i` is 8**
