The code sets the element at index `i` in the `prime` list to `False`. Given that `i` is 4, the value of `prime[4]` changes from `True` to `False`. The other variables (`n`, `prime`, `p`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects this change.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 4, `prime` is a list of length `n + 1` with elements initialized to `True`, except `prime[4]` is now `False`, `p` is 2, `i` is 4**
