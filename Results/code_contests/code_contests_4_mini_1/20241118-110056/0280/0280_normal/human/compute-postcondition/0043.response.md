The code appends the value of `p` (which is 3) to the list `f`. The initial state indicates that `f` is an empty list, so after executing the code, `f` will contain one element, which is `3`. The values of `n` and `p` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `f` is now [3], `n` is greater than 3, and `p` is 3.

Output State: **`f` is now [3], `n` is greater than 3, and `p` is 3**.
