According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i`, `n`, and `p`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, we have:
- `p` is increased by 1,
- `n` is greater than `p * p + 2 * p`,
- `i` is `p * p + 2 * p`,
- `prime[i]` remains False.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust the state of `i` and ensure it remains within the bounds set by `n`. Since `i` is currently `p * p + 2 * p`, the next value of `i` for the loop will be `i + p`, which is `p * p + 2 * p + p = p * p + 3 * p`.

To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to confirm that `n` is greater than this new value of `i`. Therefore, the condition on `n` should be adjusted to ensure that `n` is greater than `p * p + 3 * p`.

No other states need to be adjusted since `prime[i]` remaining False does not affect the loop execution.

State: **`p` is increased by 1, `n` is greater than `p * p + 3 * p`, `i` is `p * p + 2 * p`, and `prime[i]` remains False**
