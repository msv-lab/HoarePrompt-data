Output State: **`i` takes values starting from `p * p` to `n` in increments of `p`, and for each value of `i`, `prime[i]` is set to False. If `n` is less than or equal to `p * p`, the loop does not execute and `prime` remains unchanged. After the loop, if executed, `prime` will have all multiples of `p` from `p * p` to `n` set to False.**
