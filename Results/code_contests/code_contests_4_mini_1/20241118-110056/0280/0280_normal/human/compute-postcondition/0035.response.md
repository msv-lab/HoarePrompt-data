According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `p` and `n`. The loop will continue as long as `p * p` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `p` has been increased by 1, and `n` is greater than the previous value of `p * p`. 

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `n` must be greater than the new value of `p * p` after `p` has been incremented. Therefore, we need to adjust `n` to be greater than the new value of `p * p`.

State: **`p` has been increased by 1; `n` is greater than the previous value of `p * p` and `n` is greater than the new value of `p * p`**
