According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i`, `p`, and `n`. The loop is structured to start from `p * p` and continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4, `p` is 2, and `n` is greater than or equal to 4. To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we must check if `i` is still less than or equal to `n`. 

In this case, since `i` is 4, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust `i` to the next value calculated by the loop, which is `i + p`. This means `i` will be updated to 6 (4 + 2).

Now we need to ensure that the condition `i <= n` is still satisfied. Since `n` is greater than or equal to 4, it can also be equal to 4, so we need to specify that `n` must be greater than or equal to 6 for the loop to execute again.

Thus, the states need to be adjusted to reflect that `i` will be 6 and `n` must be at least 6.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 6, `prime` is a list of length `n + 1` with elements initialized to `True`, except `prime[4]` is now `False`, `p` is 2, `i` is 6**
