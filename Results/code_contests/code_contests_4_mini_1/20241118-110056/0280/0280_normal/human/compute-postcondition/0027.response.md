According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i`, `n`, and `p`. The loop iterates over `i` starting from `p * p` up to `n` (inclusive), incrementing `i` by `p` each time. 

At the end of the last iteration, the state indicates that `i` is `p * p`, and `n` is greater than `p * p`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than or equal to `n`. After the last iteration where `i` was `p * p`, it will be increased by `p` for the next iteration. Therefore, we need to set `i` to `p * p + p` and ensure it remains less than or equal to `n`.

Since `n` is already greater than `p * p`, we need to adjust it to be greater than `p * p + p` for the loop to execute again properly.

State: **`p` is increased by 1, `n` is greater than `p * p + p`, `i` is `p * p + p`, and `prime[i]` is set to False**
