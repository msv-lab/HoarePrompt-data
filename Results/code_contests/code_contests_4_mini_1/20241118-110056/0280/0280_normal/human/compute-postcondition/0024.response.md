According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the relationship between `p`, `n`, and the condition `p * p <= n`. At the end of the last iteration, `p` has been increased by 1, which means the current value of `p` is now greater than it was at the beginning of the iteration. The condition states that `p * p` must be less than or equal to `n` for the loop to continue executing.

Since `n` is at least `p * p`, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be strictly greater than the new value of `p * p`. Therefore, since `p` has been incremented by 1, `n` must be greater than `(p - 1) * (p - 1)`.

To summarize, we need to adjust the state to ensure that the condition for the loop is met for the next iteration:

State: **`p` has been increased by 1; `n` is greater than `p * p` and `prime` remains unchanged.**
