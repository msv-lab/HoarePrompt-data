According to the code, the loop is designed to iterate from `p * p` to `n + 1` with a step size of `p`. The starting point of the loop is `p * p`, and for the loop to execute, `p * p` must be less than or equal to `n`. Given that `p` is 2, `p * p` equals 4. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `n` must be at least 4. 

Since `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, we can conclude that if `n` is at least 4, then the loop will be able to execute.

Additionally, since `i` will start from `4` and can be incremented by `p` (which is `2`), the initial value of `i` should be set accordingly.

Thus, for the loop to execute, the state can be adjusted as follows:

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 4, `prime` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to `True`, `p` is 2, `i` is 4, the element at index `p` in the `prime` list is `True`**
