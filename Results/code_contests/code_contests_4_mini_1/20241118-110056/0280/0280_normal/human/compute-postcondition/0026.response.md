The code assigns `False` to the index `i` of the list `prime`. The value of `i` is `p * p`, and since `n` is greater than `p * p`, this assignment is valid. Other variables (`p`, `n`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment.

Output State: **`p` is increased by 1, `n` is greater than `p * p`, `i` is `p * p`, and `prime[i]` is set to False**
