The function `func_8` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100. After executing the function body, if `n` is greater than 2, the function returns a list of all prime numbers in the range from 2 to n-1. If `n` is not greater than 2, it returns an empty list. Additionally, if there are no prime numbers in the specified range, the returned list will also be empty. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_8` is to accept a positive integer `n` and return a list of prime numbers from 2 to n-1 if `n` is greater than 2; otherwise, it returns an empty list.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n and returns a list of all prime numbers in the range from 2 to n-1 if n is greater than 2; otherwise, it returns an empty list.**
