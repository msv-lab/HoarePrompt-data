The code sets `prime[i]` to `False`. The previous value of `i` is `p * p + p`, and since `n` is greater than this value, the operation modifies the `prime` array's value at index `i`. The values of `p` and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of the variables and the change made to `prime[i]`.

Output State: **`p` is increased by 1, `n` is greater than `p * p + p`, `i` is `p * p + p`, and `prime[i]` is set to False**
