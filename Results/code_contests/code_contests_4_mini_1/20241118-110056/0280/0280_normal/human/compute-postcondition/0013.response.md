According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `p` and the value of `n`. The condition for the loop to execute is `p * p` being less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `p` has been increased by 1. 

To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that `p * p` is still less than or equal to `n`. Since `p` was increased by 1, we denote the previous value of `p` as `p'`. Therefore, the new value of `p` is `p' + 1`.

For the loop to execute again, we must have:

\[
(p' + 1) * (p' + 1) \leq n
\]

Expanding this inequality gives:

\[
p'^2 + 2p' + 1 \leq n
\]

This means that, at the end of the last iteration, if `n` is not greater than or equal to `p'^2 + 2p' + 1`, we need to adjust `n` accordingly to allow for one more iteration.

However, we also know that `n` is a positive integer and is between 1 and 100. Additionally, the condition `p * p <= n` implies that `n` must be large enough to accommodate the new value of `p`.

Since the only variable that needs to be modified here is `n`, and it should be adjusted to ensure `p * p` can still be less than or equal to it, the adjusted state should reflect that `n` is at least `p'^2 + 2p' + 1`.

State: **variable `p` is increased by 1; `n` is at least `p * p`**
