The code assigns the value `False` to `prime[i]`, where `i` is calculated as `(p * p) + (2 * p)`. The initial values indicate that `p` has been increased by 1, and `n` is at least `p * p + p`. The value of `i` is determined based on the formula given. The state of the `prime` array is affected, but other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the values of `p`, `n`, and `i`, along with the change in `prime[i]`.

Output State: **`p` is now increased by 1, `n` is at least `p * p + p`, `i` is (p * p) + (2 * p), and `prime[i]` is set to False**
