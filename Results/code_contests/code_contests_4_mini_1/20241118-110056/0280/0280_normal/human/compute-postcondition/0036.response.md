Output State: **`if n >= 2 then prime` contains the boolean values indicating primality for each integer from 0 to n, with `prime[0]` and `prime[1]` being `False`. The value of `p` will be at least 11 or greater when the loop ends if n = 100. If n = 1, the loop does not execute and `prime` remains unchanged, with `prime[0]` and `prime[1]` being `False`. If n = 2, the loop executes once, and `p` will increment to 3, with `prime[2]` remaining `True`. If n = 3, the loop executes once, and `p` will increment to 3, with `prime[2]` and `prime[3]` remaining `True`.**
