The code sets `prime[i]` to `False`. The value of `i` is given as `(p * p) + p`, meaning it is calculated based on the current value of `p`. The state of the other variables is not affected by this assignment. 

Given that `prime[i]` is being modified, the output state reflects the current values of `p`, `n`, and `i`, along with the modification of the `prime` array.

Output State: **`p` is now increased by 1, `n` is at least `p * p + p`, `i` is (p * p) + p, and `prime[i]` is set to False**
