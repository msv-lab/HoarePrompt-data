The code `f.append(p)` appends the value of `p` (which is 4) to the list `f`. The initial state indicates that `f` is an empty list, so after executing the code, `f` will contain one element, which is 4. The values of `n` and `p` remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `f` is now [4], `n` is greater than 3, `p` is 4.

Output State: **`f` is now [4], `n` is greater than 3, `p` is 4**
