The code initializes a list called `prime` with a length of `n + 1`, where each element is set to `True`. The variable `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, meaning `n + 1` can range from 2 to 101. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `prime` is a list of length `n + 1`, with all elements initialized to `True`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `prime` is a list of length `n + 1`, with all elements initialized to `True`**
