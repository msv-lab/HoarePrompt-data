Postcondition: ***`p` has been increased by 1, `n` is greater than `p * p`, and `prime` remains unchanged unless `prime[p]` is True, in which case all multiples of `p` from `p * p` to `n` are set to False in the `prime` array. If `n` is less than or equal to `p * p`, then `prime` remains unchanged.***
