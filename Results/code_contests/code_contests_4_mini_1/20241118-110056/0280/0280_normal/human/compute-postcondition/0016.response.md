According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than or equal to `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we have:
- `p` is now increased by 1
- `n` is at least `p * p`
- `i` is `p * p` (which means `i` is equal to `n` in the worst-case scenario)

To execute the loop one more time, `i` would need to be increased by `p` (the step of the loop). Therefore, if `i` is currently `p * p`, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be adjusted to `i + p`, which is `(p * p) + p`. 

Also, we have to ensure that `n` must be at least `(p * p) + p` for the loop to execute one more time. Therefore, we can adjust `n` to be at least `p * p + p`.

Hence, the adjusted states are:
- `i` becomes `(p * p) + p`
- `n` becomes at least `p * p + p`

State: **`p` is now increased by 1, `n` is at least `p * p + p`, `i` is `(p * p) + p`, and `prime[i]` is set to False**
