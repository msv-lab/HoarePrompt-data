The value of `p` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `p` is unknown, so the output state is: variable `p` is increased by 1. The values of `n` and the `prime` list remain unchanged.

Output State: **variable `p` is increased by 1; `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, and the `prime` list remains unchanged except for `prime[0]` and `prime[1]` which are `False` if `n` < 4.**
