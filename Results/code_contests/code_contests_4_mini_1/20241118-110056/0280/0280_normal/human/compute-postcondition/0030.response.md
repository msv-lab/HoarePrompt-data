The statement `prime[i] = False` assigns the value `False` to the element at index `i` in the list or array `prime`. Since `i` is defined as `p * p + 2 * p`, and `prime[i]` was previously set to `False`, this assignment does not change the state of `prime[i]`. The other variables `p` and `n` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `p` is increased by 1, `n` is greater than `p * p + 2 * p`, `i` is `p * p + 2 * p`, and `prime[i]` remains `False`.

Output State: **`p` is increased by 1, `n` is greater than `p * p + 2 * p`, `i` is `p * p + 2 * p`, and `prime[i]` remains False**
