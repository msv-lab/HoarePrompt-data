According to the code, the loop executes for values of `i` starting from `p * p` up to `n`, incrementing `i` by `p` each time. The loop will execute again if `i` (after the last iteration) is less than or equal to `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is currently set to `(p * p) + p`, and `prime[i]` has been set to False. To allow the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust `i` to the next value, which would be `(p * p) + (2 * p)`. 

Since `n` is at least `p * p + p`, we don't need to adjust `n`. The only thing that needs to be adjusted is `i`, which must now be `p * p + 2 * p`.

State: **`p` is now increased by 1, `n` is at least `p * p + p`, `i` is (p * p) + (2 * p), and `prime[i]` is set to False**
