According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `p` has been increased by 1, `n` is greater than `p * p + p`, and `i` is `p * p + p`. 

To execute the loop one more time, we need to adjust `i` to the next value in the range, which would be `i + p`. Since `i` is currently `p * p + p`, the next value of `i` will be `(p * p + p) + p`, which simplifies to `p * p + 2 * p`. 

Additionally, we need to ensure that `n` is still greater than this new value of `i` for the loop to continue executing. Therefore, we need to adjust `n` to be greater than `p * p + 2 * p`.

State: **`p` is increased by 1, `n` is greater than `p * p + 2 * p, i` is `p * p + 2 * p`, and `prime[i]` is set to False**
