The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns a list of all prime numbers in the range from 2 to `n-1`. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, it returns an empty list. The function correctly identifies prime numbers using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm, and if there are no prime numbers in the specified range, the returned list will also be empty.
