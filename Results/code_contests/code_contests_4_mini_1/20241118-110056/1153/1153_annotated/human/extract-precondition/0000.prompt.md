You are given a programming problem description and a program that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Program:
```
R = 3
C = 3
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
	tc = [[0 for x in range(C)] for x in range(R)]
	tc[0][0] = cost[0][0]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		tc[i][0] = tc[i-1][0] + cost[i][0]
	for j in range(1, n+1):
		tc[0][j] = tc[0][j-1] + cost[0][j]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		for j in range(1, n+1):
			tc[i][j] = min(tc[i-1][j-1], tc[i-1][j], tc[i][j-1]) + cost[i][j]
	return tc[m][n]
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Program:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
  res = tuple(set(test_tup1) & set(test_tup2))
  return (res) 
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
import math
def is_not_prime(n):
    result = False
    for i in range(2,int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            result = True
    return result
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Program:
```
import heapq as hq
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
  largest_nums = hq.nlargest(n, nums)
  return largest_nums
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Program:
```
def count_ways(n):
  A = [0] * (n + 1)
  B = [0] * (n + 1)
  A[0] = 1
  A[1] = 0
  B[0] = 0
  B[1] = 1
  for i in range(2, n+1):
    A[i] = A[i - 2] + 2 * B[i - 1]
    B[i] = A[i - 1] + B[i - 2]
  return A[n] 
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Your task

Problem description: There is a card game called "Durak", which means "Fool" in Russian. The game is quite popular in the countries that used to form USSR. The problem does not state all the game's rules explicitly — you can find them later yourselves if you want.

To play durak you need a pack of 36 cards. Each card has a suit ("S", "H", "D" and "C") and a rank (in the increasing order "6", "7", "8", "9", "T", "J", "Q", "K" and "A"). At the beginning of the game one suit is arbitrarily chosen as trump. 

The players move like that: one player puts one or several of his cards on the table and the other one should beat each of them with his cards.

A card beats another one if both cards have similar suits and the first card has a higher rank then the second one. Besides, a trump card can beat any non-trump card whatever the cards’ ranks are. In all other cases you can not beat the second card with the first one.

You are given the trump suit and two different cards. Determine whether the first one beats the second one or not.

Input

The first line contains the tramp suit. It is "S", "H", "D" or "C".

The second line contains the description of the two different cards. Each card is described by one word consisting of two symbols. The first symbol stands for the rank ("6", "7", "8", "9", "T", "J", "Q", "K" and "A"), and the second one stands for the suit ("S", "H", "D" and "C").

Output

Print "YES" (without the quotes) if the first cards beats the second one. Otherwise, print "NO" (also without the quotes).

Program:

    s2 = raw_input().split()
    m1 = '6789TJQKA'
    i = 0
    for ts in m1:
        if ts == s2[0][0]:
            r1 = i
        i += 1
    i = 0
    for ts in m1:
        if ts == s2[1][0]:
            r2 = i
        i += 1
    if s2[0][1] != s2[1][1] and s2[0][1] == s[0]:
        print('YES')
    elif s2[0][1] == s2[1][1] and r1 > r2:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
```
