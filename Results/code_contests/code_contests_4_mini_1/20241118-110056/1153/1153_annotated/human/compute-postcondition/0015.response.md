Postcondition: ***`trump_suit` is a character representing the trump suit, `card1` and `card2` are strings representing cards, `s` is an input string, `s2` is a list of substrings derived from `s`, `m1` is '6789TJQKA', and `i` is 4. If `trump_suit` equals the first character of the first substring in `s2`, then `r1` is set to 4. If `trump_suit` does not equal the first character of `s2[0]`, the value of `r1` remains unchanged.***
