The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its previous value of 4 to 5. The states of the other variables (`s2`, `r1`, `m1`, `ts`, and `r2`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `s2` is a list with at least two substrings, `r1` is the index of the first occurrence of the first character of `s2[0]` in `m1`, `i` is 5, `m1` is not empty, `ts` is the fourth element in `m1`, and `r2` remains undefined.
