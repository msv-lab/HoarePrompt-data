According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in `m1`. For the loop to execute, `m1` must not be empty; otherwise, there will be no elements for the loop to iterate over. Since `s2` is specified to have at least one substring, we can assume it is not empty, but we need to ensure `m1` is also non-empty.

The current state specifies that `i` is 0, which is appropriate for the first iteration of the loop. However, we need to consider the state of `r1`, which indicates the index of the first occurrence of the first character of `s2[0]` in `m1`. If `m1` is empty, `r1` becomes irrelevant.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, we need to assert that `m1` is not empty, and `r1` should be defined based on the first character of the first substring in `s2`. 

State: **`s2` is a list with at least one substring, `r1` is the index of the first occurrence of the first character of `s2[0]` in `m1`, `i` is 0, `m1` is not empty**
