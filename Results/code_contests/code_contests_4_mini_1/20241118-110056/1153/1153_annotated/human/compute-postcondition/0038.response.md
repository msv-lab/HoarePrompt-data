Postcondition: ***`r2` is the index of the last occurrence of the first character of `s2[1]` in `m1` if it exists, otherwise `r2` remains undefined. `i` is the length of `m1` after the loop finishes, which could be greater than 0 if `m1` is not empty. `s2` is a list with at least one substring. `r1` is the index of the first occurrence of the first character of `s2[0]` in `m1`. The first character of `s2[0]` is equal to `s[0]`, `s2[0][1]` is equal to `s2[1][1]`, and `r1` is greater than `r2`.***
