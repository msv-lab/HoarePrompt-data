Postcondition: ***If the character at index 1 of `s2[0]` is not equal to the character at index 1 of `s2[1]` and is equal to the character at index 0 of `s`, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, if the character at index 1 of `s2[0]` is equal to the character at index 1 of `s2[1]` and `r1` is greater than `r2`, 'YES' is printed. In all other cases, 'NO' is printed. The variables `r2` and `i` retain their respective states based on the last occurrence of the first character of `s2[1]` in `m1` and the length of `m1`, with `r2` remaining undefined if no occurrence exists, and `i` being 0 if `m1` is empty. `s2` remains a list with at least one substring, and `r1` is the index of the first occurrence of the first character of `s2[0]` in `m1`.***
