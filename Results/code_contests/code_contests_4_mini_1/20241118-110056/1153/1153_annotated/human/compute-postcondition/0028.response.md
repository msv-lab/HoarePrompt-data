The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its previous value of 2 to 3. The values of `s2`, `r1`, `m1`, and `r2` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `s2` is a list with at least two substrings, `r1` is the index of the first occurrence of the first character of `s2[0]` in `m1`, `i` is 3, and `m1` is not empty; `r2` remains undefined.

Output State: **`s2` is a list with at least two substrings, `r1` is the index of the first occurrence of the first character of `s2[0]` in `m1`, `i` is 3, `m1` is not empty, and `r2` remains undefined**
