Postcondition: ***`r2` is the index of the last occurrence of the first character of `s2[1]` in `m1` if it exists, otherwise `r2` remains undefined; `i` is the length of `m1` after the loop finishes, which could be greater than 0 if `m1` is not empty; `s2` is a list with at least one substring; `r1` is the index of the first occurrence of the first character of `s2[0]` in `m1`; the first character of `s2[0]` is equal to `s[0]`; and it is false that both `s2[0][1]` equals `s2[1][1]` and `r1` is greater than `r2`.***
