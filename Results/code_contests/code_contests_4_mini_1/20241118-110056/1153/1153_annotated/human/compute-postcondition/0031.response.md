Postcondition: ***`s2` is a list with at least two substrings, `r1` is the index of the first occurrence of the first character of `s2[0]` in `m1`, `i` is 4, `m1` is not empty, and `ts` is the fourth element in `m1`. If `ts` is equal to the first character of `s2[1]`, then `r2` is set to 4; otherwise, `r2` remains undefined.***
