The value of `r1` is assigned the value of `i`, which is currently 0. Since `i` has not changed, `r1` will also be 0. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `trump_suit` is a character representing the trump suit, `card1` is a string representing a card, `card2` is a string representing a card, `s` is an input string, `s2` is a list of substrings from the input string, `m1` is '6789TJQKA', `i` is 0, `ts` is '6', and `r1` is 0.
