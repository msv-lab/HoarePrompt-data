The code assigns the value of `raw_input().split()` to `s2`. The `raw_input()` function will accept an input string, and the `split()` method will divide that string into a list of substrings based on whitespace. The previous values of `trump_suit`, `card1`, and `card2` are unaffected, and `s` remains as the input string. Therefore, the output state reflects the new variable `s2` as a list of substrings derived from the input string `s`.

Output State: **`trump_suit` is a character representing the trump suit, `card1` is a string representing a card, `card2` is a string representing a card, `s` is an input string, and `s2` is a list of substrings from the input string.**
