Postcondition: ***`s2` is a list with at least one substring, `r1` is the index of the first occurrence of the first character of `s2[0]` in `m1`, `i` is 0, `m1` is not empty. If `ts` is equal to the first character of the substring `s2[1]`, then `r2` is set to 0. If `ts` does not match the first character of `s2[1]`, `r2` remains unchanged, and its value is not defined in this context.***
