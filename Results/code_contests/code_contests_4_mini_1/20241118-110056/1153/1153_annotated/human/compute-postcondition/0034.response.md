Output State: **`r2` is the index of the last occurrence of the first character of `s2[1]` in `m1` if it exists, otherwise `r2` remains undefined. `i` is the length of `m1` after the loop finishes. If `m1` is empty, the loop does not execute, `i` remains 0, and `r2` remains undefined. `s2` is a list with at least one substring, and `r1` is the index of the first occurrence of the first character of `s2[0]` in `m1`.**
