Postcondition: ***`trump_suit` is a character representing the trump suit, `card1` and `card2` are strings representing cards, `s` is an input string, `s2` is a list of substrings derived from `s`, `m1` is '6789TJQKA', and `i` is 2. If the first character of `s2[0]` equals `ts` (which is '7'), then `r1` is set to 2. If the first character of `s2[0]` does not equal `ts`, the value of `r1` remains unchanged. Additionally, it is important to note that `s2` must have at least one element to avoid an index error when accessing `s2[0]`.***
