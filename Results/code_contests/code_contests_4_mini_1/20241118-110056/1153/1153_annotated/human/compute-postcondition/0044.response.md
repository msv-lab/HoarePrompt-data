The function `func` accepts three parameters: `trump_suit`, `card1`, and `card2`. The parameter `trump_suit` is a character representing the trump suit, which can be one of "S", "H", "D", or "C". The parameters `card1` and `card2` are strings representing two different cards, each consisting of a rank (one of "6", "7", "8", "9", "T", "J", "Q", "K", "A") followed by a suit (one of "S", "H", "D", "C"). Based on these inputs, the function will determine the output based on the rules of the card game being implemented. However, specific return values are not provided in the output description. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a character `trump_suit` representing the trump suit and two strings `card1` and `card2` representing two different cards, and processes these inputs according to the rules of the card game.**
