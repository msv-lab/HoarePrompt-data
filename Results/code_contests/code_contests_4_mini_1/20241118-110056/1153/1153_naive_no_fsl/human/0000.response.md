To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description for the card game "Durak", let's analyze the program logic step by step.

### Program Logic Overview:
1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the trump suit and two cards.
2. **Rank Mapping**: It creates a string `m1` representing the ranks in increasing order.
3. **Rank Identification**: It determines the ranks of the two cards by finding their indices in the `m1` string.
4. **Beat Logic**:
   - If the suits of the two cards are different, it checks if the first card is a trump card.
   - If the suits are the same, it checks if the rank of the first card is higher than the second card.

### Key Points of the Game Rules:
- A card beats another if:
  - Both cards have the same suit and the first card has a higher rank.
  - The first card is a trump card and the second card is not.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:
- **Input Handling**: The program uses `raw_input()`, which is appropriate for Python 2 but would need to be changed to `input()` for Python 3.
- **Rank Comparison**: The rank comparison is done correctly by checking the indices in `m1`.
- **Beat Condition**:
  - The condition `s2[0][1] != s2[1][1] and s2[0][1] == s[0]` checks if the first card is a trump and the second card is not.
  - The condition `s2[0][1] == s2[1][1] and r1 > r2` checks if both cards have the same suit and if the first card's rank is higher.

### Edge Case Analysis:
1. **Same Suit and Same Rank**: If both cards have the same suit and rank, the program should return "NO". This is handled correctly by the conditions.
2. **Different Suits**: If the first card is the trump suit and the second card is not, it should return "YES". This is correctly handled.
3. **Different Suits with the First Card Not Being Trump**: If the first card is not trump and the second card is not trump either, it should return "NO". The program correctly handles this since the first condition fails and it leads to the "NO" output.

### Potential Issues:
- The program does not account for incorrect inputs, such as invalid rank or suit values. However, the problem description does not specify how to handle such cases, so we assume inputs will always be valid as per the game's rules.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the program with the conditions of the game and the examples provided, it appears that the program correctly implements the rules of the card game "Durak". All cases that I could think of have been handled correctly.

Correctness: **True**
