Postcondition: ***`r1` is the index of the first character in `m1` that matches `s2[0][0]` if such a character exists, `i` is the length of `m1`, `m1` may have any number of characters, and `trump_suit`, `card1`, and `card2` remain unchanged. If `s2[0][1]` is not equal to `s2[1][1]` and `s2[0][1]` is equal to `s[0]`, the output is 'YES'. If `s2[0][1]` is equal to `s2[1][1]` and `r1` is greater than `r2`, the output is also 'YES'. In all other cases, including when `s2[0][1]` is equal to `s2[1][1]` but `r1` is not greater than `r2`, or if `s2[0][1]` is not equal to `s2[1][1]`, the output is 'NO'. Additionally, if `m1` is empty, the loop does not execute, `i` remains 0, and `r2` is unchanged.***
