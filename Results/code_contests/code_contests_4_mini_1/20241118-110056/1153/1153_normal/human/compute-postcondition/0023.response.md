Postcondition: ***`r1` is the index of the first character in `m1` that matches `s2[0][0]` if such a character exists, `i` is 0, `m1` is not empty, `trump_suit` is unchanged, `card1` is unchanged, `card2` is unchanged, and if `ts` is equal to `s2[1][0]`, then `r2` is set to 0. If `ts` is not equal to `s2[1][0]`, `r2` remains unchanged.***
