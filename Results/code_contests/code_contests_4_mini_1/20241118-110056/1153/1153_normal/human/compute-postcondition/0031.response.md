Postcondition: ***`r1` is the index of the first character in `m1` that matches `s2[0][0]` if such a character exists, `i` is 4, `m1` has at least 4 characters, `trump_suit` is unchanged, `card1` is unchanged, and `card2` is unchanged. If `ts` matches `s2[1][0]`, then `r2` is set to 4; otherwise, `r2` remains unchanged.***
