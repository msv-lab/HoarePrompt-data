Postcondition: ***`r1` is the index of the first character in `m1` that matches `s2[0][0]` if such a character exists, `i` is the length of `m1`, and `m1` may have any number of characters. If `s2[0][1]` is equal to `s2[1][1]` and `r1` is greater than `r2`, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, if `s2[0][1]` is not equal to `s2[1][1]` or `r1` is less than or equal to `r2`, 'NO' is printed. The values of `trump_suit`, `card1`, and `card2` remain unchanged.***
