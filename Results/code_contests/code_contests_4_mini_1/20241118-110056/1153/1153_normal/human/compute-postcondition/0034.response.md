Output State: **`r1` is the index of the first character in `m1` that matches `s2[0][0]` if such a character exists. `i` is the length of `m1`, `m1` may have any number of characters, `trump_suit` is unchanged, `card1` is unchanged, `card2` is unchanged. If `m1` is empty, the loop does not execute, `i` remains 0, and `r2` is unchanged. If no character in `m1` matches `s2[1][0]`, then `r2` remains unchanged.**
