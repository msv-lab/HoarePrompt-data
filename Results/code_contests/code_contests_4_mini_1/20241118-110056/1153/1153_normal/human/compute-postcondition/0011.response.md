Postcondition: ***`trump_suit` is one of the characters "S", "H", "D", or "C"; `card1` and `card2` are strings representing cards; `s2` is a list of substrings from the input string `s`; `m1` is '6789TJQKA'; `i` is 2; `ts` is '8'; if `ts` is equal to the first character of the first substring in `s2`, then `r1` is set to 2, otherwise, `r1` remains unchanged.***
