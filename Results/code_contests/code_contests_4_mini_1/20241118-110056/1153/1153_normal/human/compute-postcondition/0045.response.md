Functionality: ** The function accepts user input for two playing cards and evaluates their ranks based on a predefined ordering. It checks if the second character of the first card is the same as the second character of the second card and compares their ranks (determined by their first characters) to print 'YES' or 'NO' based on specific conditions. If the first characters of the two cards are the same, it prints 'NO' regardless of the trump suit. Additionally, if the input is not provided correctly (e.g., if `s2` is not long enough), it may result in an index error, which is not handled in the code. **
