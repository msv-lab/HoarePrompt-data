The variable `s2` is assigned the value of `raw_input().split()`, which takes an input string `s`, splits it into a list of substrings based on whitespace, and assigns this list to `s2`. The other variables `trump_suit`, `card1`, and `card2` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `trump_suit` is one of the characters "S", "H", "D", or "C"; `card1` is a string representing a card; `card2` is a string representing a card; `s2` is a list of substrings from the input string `s`.

Output State: **`trump_suit` is one of the characters "S", "H", "D", or "C"; `card1` is a string representing a card; `card2` is a string representing a card; `s2` is a list of substrings from the input string `s`.**
