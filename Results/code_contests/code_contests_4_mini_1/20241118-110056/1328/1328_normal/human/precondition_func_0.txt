t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000) representing the number of items in each test case, W is a positive integer (1 ≤ W ≤ 10^18) representing the knapsack capacity, and w_i are positive integers (1 ≤ w_i ≤ 10^9) representing the weights of the items, with the total number of items across all test cases not exceeding 200,000.
