To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the provided variables and their conditions.

1. **Understanding `args`:** The loop iterates over `args`. For the loop to execute at least once, `args` must be a non-empty iterable (it must contain at least one element).

2. **Values of other variables:** The current values of `t`, `n`, `W`, `w_i`, `sep`, `file`, and `at_start` do not directly affect the execution of the loop itself, as they are not involved in the iteration. However, they might be relevant for the loop body, but since it's omitted, we focus solely on `args`.

3. **Initial conditions:** The current state specifies that `at_start` is `True`, but this does not impact the ability of the loop to run.

Based on this analysis, the necessary adjustment is to ensure `args` contains at least one element.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `W` is a positive integer (1 ≤ W ≤ 10^18), `w_i` is a list of `n` positive integers (1 ≤ w_i ≤ 10^9), `sep` is either ' ' or a specified separator, `file` is either `sys.stdout` or a specified file object, `at_start` is True, `args` is a non-empty iterable**
