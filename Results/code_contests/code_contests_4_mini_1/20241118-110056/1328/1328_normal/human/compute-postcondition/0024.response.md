Postcondition: ***`at_start` is False after the loop executes, `args` contains the elements processed in the loop, and `file` is written with the value of `kwargs.pop('end', '\n')`. If the key 'flush' was present in `kwargs` and its value was True, the flush operation has been executed; otherwise, the flush operation has not been executed.***
