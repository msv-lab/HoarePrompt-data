The function `func_2` does not explicitly accept parameters in its definition. Instead, it relies on external input to fulfill its intended purpose. Based on the provided constraints, the function is designed to process multiple test cases. Each test case consists of the following:

- `t`, a positive integer representing the number of test cases, where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- For each test case:
  - `n`, a positive integer representing the number of items, where \(1 \leq n \leq 200,000\).
  - `W`, a positive integer representing the capacity of the knapsack, where \(1 \leq W \leq 10^{18}\).
  - `w_i`, a list of `n` positive integers representing the weights of the items, where \(1 \leq w_i \leq 10^9\).

The function processes these inputs to compute a result for each test case. Though the specific output of the function is not detailed, it is implied that the function returns a result based on the knapsack problem logic for the given weights and capacity.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases related to the knapsack problem, where each test case includes the number of items, the knapsack capacity, and the weights of the items, and returns a result based on these inputs.**
