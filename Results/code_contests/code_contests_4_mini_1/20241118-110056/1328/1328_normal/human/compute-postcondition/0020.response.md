Output State: **`at_start` is False after the loop executes, and `args` contains the elements processed in the loop. If `args` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `at_start` remains True. If `args` has at least one element, the first element is written to `file`, and subsequent elements are written with `sep` before them.**
