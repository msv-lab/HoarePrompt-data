The code snippet uses `kwargs.pop()` to remove and return the values associated with the keys 'sep' and 'file' from the `kwargs` dictionary, assigning them to the variables `sep` and `file`. If these keys do not exist, it defaults to ' ' (a space) for `sep` and `sys.stdout` for `file`. 

Since the initial state does not specify the values of `sep` and `file` in `kwargs`, we cannot determine these specific values. The initial state describes `t`, `n`, `W`, and `w_i`, which remain unaffected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `W` is a positive integer (1 ≤ W ≤ 10^18), `w_i` is a list of `n` positive integers (1 ≤ w_i ≤ 10^9), and `sep` is either ' ' or a specified separator, `file` is either `sys.stdout` or a specified file object.**
