Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000), `W` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `W` ≤ 10^18), `w_i` is a list of `n` positive integers (1 ≤ `w_i` ≤ 10^9), `sep` is either ' ' or a specified separator, `file` is either `sys.stdout` or a specified file object, `at_start` is False, `args` contains at least 3 elements, and `x` is the third element in `args`. The variable `at_start` is assigned the value False, which does not change the state of other variables.**
