The code writes the string representation of `x` to `file`. The initial state indicates that `x` is the second element in `args`, which is guaranteed to exist, and `sep` has already been written to `file`. The values of other variables (`t`, `n`, `W`, `w_i`, `at_start`) are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `x` has been written to `file`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000), `W` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `W` ≤ 10^18), `w_i` is a list of `n` positive integers (1 ≤ `w_i` ≤ 10^9), `sep` is either ' ' or a specified separator, `file` is either `sys.stdout` or a specified file object, `at_start` is False, `args` contains at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element in `args`, and `x` has been written to `file`.**
