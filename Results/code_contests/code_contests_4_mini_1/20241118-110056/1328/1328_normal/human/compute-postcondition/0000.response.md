The code snippet provided is a comment string that does not affect any variables or the state of the program. It merely describes the behavior of a print function, but does not execute any operation or change any values.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), for each test case `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `W` is a positive integer (1 ≤ W ≤ 10^18), and `w_i` is a list of `n` positive integers (1 ≤ w_i ≤ 10^9).**
