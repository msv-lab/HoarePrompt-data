Correctness: **False**

The provided code is incomplete and does not implement the logic required to solve the given problem description. The two functions defined, `func_1` and `func_2`, do not contain any relevant logic for processing the test cases or determining which items can fit into the knapsack based on their weights.

Specifically:

1. **func_1** is an empty placeholder and does not perform any operations.
2. **func_2** is a function that appears to be designed for printing values but does not relate to the problem of selecting items for the knapsack.

The program is missing the core logic to read inputs, process the weights of the items, calculate whether the weights can meet the criteria of being between ⌈W/2⌉ and W, and then output the appropriate results.

For example, a simple case is when:
- `n = 1`
- `W = 5`
- `weights = [3]`

The expected output should be:
```
1
1
```
However, since the code does not implement any of the necessary logic to handle this input, it does not provide the correct output.

Thus, the program is incorrect as it does not fulfill the problem's requirements in any potential case.
