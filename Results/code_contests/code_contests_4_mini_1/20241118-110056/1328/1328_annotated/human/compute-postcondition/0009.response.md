According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `args`. If `args` has more elements, then the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is the first element in `args`, and since `at_start` is False, we can infer that the loop has already processed the first element. 

To execute one more time, `x` needs to be updated to the next element in `args`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `x` reflects the second element of `args` and that `args` has at least 2 elements. 

State: **`sep` is either the value from `kwargs` or ' '; `file` is either the value from `kwargs` or sys.stdout; `at_start` is False; `x` is the second element in `args`**
