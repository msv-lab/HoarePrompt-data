Postcondition: ***`sep` is either the value from `kwargs` or ' '; `file` is either the value from `kwargs` or sys.stdout; `at_start` is False; `x` is the third element in `args`; `file` has written `str(x)`, and if `at_start` is False, `file` now writes `sep`. If `at_start` is True, `sep` is not written to `file`.***
