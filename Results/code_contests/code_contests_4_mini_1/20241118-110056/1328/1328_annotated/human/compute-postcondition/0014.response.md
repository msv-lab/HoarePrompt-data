According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `args` iterable. If `args` has more than 2 elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is the second element in `args`, which implies that there is at least one more element in `args` after the current position. To execute the loop one more time, the `x` must be updated to the next element in `args`. 

Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `x` should be the third element in `args`, and `at_start` will remain `False` as it seems to indicate whether the loop is at its starting point.

State: **`sep` is either the value from `kwargs` or ' '; `file` is either the value from `kwargs` or sys.stdout; `at_start` is False; `x` is the third element in `args`, and `file` has written `str(x)`**
