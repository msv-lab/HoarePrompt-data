The code `file.write(str(x))` writes the string representation of `x` to the `file`. The values of `sep`, `file`, and `at_start` remain unchanged by this operation. The output state reflects that `file` has now written the string representation of `x`.

Output State: **`sep` is either the value from `kwargs` or ' '; `file` is either the value from `kwargs` or sys.stdout; `at_start` is False; `x` is the third element in `args`; `file` has written `str(x)`**
