The code assigns the values of `sep` and `file` from the `kwargs` dictionary using the `pop` method. This method removes the specified keys from the dictionary and returns their values. The default values for `sep` and `file` are set to `' '` (a space) and `sys.stdout`, respectively, if the keys are not present in `kwargs`. However, since the initial state indicates that no variables are affected by this code, the output state reflects that the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **The code does not change the state of any variables; `sep` is either the value from `kwargs` or ' ', and `file` is either the value from `kwargs` or sys.stdout.**
