The value of `at_start` is explicitly set to `False`, but it does not affect any other variables since its previous value is already `False`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `at_start` remains `False`, and the other variables are unchanged. 

Output State: **`sep` is either the value from `kwargs` or ' '; `file` is either the value from `kwargs` or sys.stdout; `at_start` is False; `x` is the third element in `args`; `file` has written `str(x)`**
