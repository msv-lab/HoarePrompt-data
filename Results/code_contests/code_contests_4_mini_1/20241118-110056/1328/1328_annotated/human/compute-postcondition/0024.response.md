Postcondition: ***`file` has written the string representation of all elements in `args` separated by `sep`, and `at_start` is False; `sep` retains its value from `kwargs` or is ' '. The `end` value has been popped from `kwargs`, defaulting to '\n', and written to `file`. If the `flush` option from `kwargs` is True, the file buffer is flushed; otherwise, the buffer remains unchanged.***
