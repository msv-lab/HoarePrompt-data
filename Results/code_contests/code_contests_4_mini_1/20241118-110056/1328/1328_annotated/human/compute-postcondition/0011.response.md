Postcondition: ***`sep` is either the value from `kwargs` or ' '; `file` is either the value from `kwargs` or sys.stdout; `at_start` is False; `x` is the second element in `args`. If `at_start` is False, the `file.write` method writes `sep` to the file, ensuring that the content of `sep` is outputted unless `at_start` is True, in which case no action is taken.***
