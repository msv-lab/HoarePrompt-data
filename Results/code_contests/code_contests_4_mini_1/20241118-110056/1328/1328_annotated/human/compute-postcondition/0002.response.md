The variable `at_start` is assigned the value `True`. The values of `sep` and `file` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state is: `sep` is either the value from `kwargs` or ' '; `file` is either the value from `kwargs` or sys.stdout; `at_start` is True.

Output State: **`sep` is either the value from `kwargs` or ' '; `file` is either the value from `kwargs` or sys.stdout; `at_start` is True**.
