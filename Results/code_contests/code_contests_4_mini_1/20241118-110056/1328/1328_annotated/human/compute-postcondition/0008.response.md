The variable `at_start` is assigned the value `False`, changing its previous state if it was `True`. The other variables `sep`, `file`, and `x` remain unchanged, as they are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated state of `at_start` while maintaining the other variables' descriptions.

Output State: **`sep` is either the value from `kwargs` or ' '; `file` is either the value from `kwargs` or sys.stdout; `at_start` is False; `x` is the first element in `args`**
