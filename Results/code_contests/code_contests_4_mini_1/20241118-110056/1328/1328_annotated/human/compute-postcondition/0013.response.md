The value of `at_start` is assigned to `False`, but it was already `False` before this assignment. Therefore, the state of the other variables remains unchanged. Consequently, the output state is: `sep` is either the value from `kwargs` or ' '; `file` is either the value from `kwargs` or sys.stdout; `at_start` is False; `x` is the second element in `args`, and `file` has written `str(x)`.

Output State: **`sep` is either the value from `kwargs` or ' '; `file` is either the value from `kwargs` or sys.stdout; `at_start` is False; `x` is the second element in `args`, and `file` has written `str(x)`**.
