Postcondition: ***`sep` is either the value from `kwargs` or ' ', `file` is either the value from `kwargs` or sys.stdout, `at_start` is a boolean, `x` is the first element in `args`, and `args` is a list with at least 1 element. If `at_start` is False, then `file` writes `sep`. If `at_start` is True, nothing is written to `file`.***
