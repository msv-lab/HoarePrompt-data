The function `func_2` does not explicitly accept any parameters as defined in its signature. However, it operates under the constraints provided which involve multiple test cases. 

Based on the output conditions described, the function processes `t` test cases, each with a specified number of items `n`, a knapsack capacity `W`, and a series of weights `w_i` for each item. The function likely returns results based on the knapsack problem's solution for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases with parameters t (number of test cases), n (number of items), W (capacity of the knapsack), and w_i (weights of the items), and returns results based on the knapsack problem for each test case.**
