Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not satisfy the problem description for all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to handle cases where multiple items are needed to achieve the required weight in the knapsack.

### Potential Case for Failure:
1. **Input Case**:
   ```
   1
   3 10
   1 1 1
   ```
   - Here, we have 3 items each weighing 1. The knapsack capacity is 10.
   - The condition requires that the total weight \( C \) must satisfy \( \lceil 10/2 \rceil \leq C \leq 10 \), which means \( 5 \leq C \leq 10 \).
   - The only possible way to achieve this is to take all three items, which gives a total weight of 3, still less than 5, and therefore it doesn't fulfill the requirement.
   - However, the implementation would check individual weights first and would not consider combinations effectively or return -1 for this case when it should.

2. **Another Input Case**:
   ```
   1
   5 10
   1 1 1 1 10
   ```
   - Here, we have weights 1, 1, 1, 1, and 10. The knapsack capacity is 10.
   - The requirement is still \( 5 \leq C \leq 10 \). The only way to reach at least 5 is by taking four 1's, which sums to 4, less than 5.
   - The implementation might falsely return one of the items instead of recognizing that achieving the required weight is impossible.

The logic implemented in the code does not account for combinations of weights effectively, which leads to incorrect outputs for various inputs. Therefore, the program is deemed incorrect.
