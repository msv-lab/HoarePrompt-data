To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program.

The problem requires that each blog should be assigned a topic based on its already written neighbors. The key requirements are:
1. Each blog should have a unique topic.
2. If two blogs are connected (i.e., have a reference), they must cover different topics.
3. If it's impossible to assign topics according to these rules, the output should be -1.

Let's break down the provided code:
- The function `func_1` checks if any pair of blogs that are connected have the same topic. If they do, it returns -1, indicating that it is impossible to satisfy the conditions. If the condition is satisfied for all pairs, it simply returns a sequence of blog numbers from 1 to n.

### Analyzing Edge Cases
1. **Case with No References (m = 0)**: If there are blogs with the same topic and no references, the program would incorrectly return a sequence (1 to n) even though it is impossible to assign different topics to the blogs that share the same topic.

   Example:
   ```
   Input:
   3 0
   1 1 1
   Output:
   1 2 3 (incorrect, should be -1)
   ```

2. **Case with All Blogs Having the Same Topic**: The program would not correctly identify that when all blogs have the same topic, it is impossible to meet the requirement due to the references.

   Example:
   ```
   Input:
   3 3
   1 2
   2 3
   3 1
   1 1 1
   Output:
   -1 (correct), but the function does not handle it if m = 0.
   ```

3. **Valid Cases**: The logic correctly identifies when two connected blogs have the same topic and outputs -1 accordingly.

In summary, the program does not handle all edge cases correctly. Specifically, it fails in scenarios where there are no references but multiple blogs share the same topic. Therefore, the program does not always satisfy the conditions laid out in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.
