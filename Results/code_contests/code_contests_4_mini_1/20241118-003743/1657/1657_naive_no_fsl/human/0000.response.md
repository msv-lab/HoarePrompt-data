Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fully satisfy the requirements of the problem description. Specifically, it fails to account for the situation where multiple blogs may have the same desired topic and are connected by references. The logic in the function `func_1` only checks if there are any direct references between blogs that have the same topic, returning `-1` immediately if it finds such a case. 

However, the problem description allows for the possibility that blogs can be written in a specific order such that the topic assignment can still satisfy the constraints, even if some blogs share the same topic. For instance, if one blog is written first and has no references to another blog with the same topic, it can be assigned that topic without issue, provided that the other blog is written later.

A crucial test case demonstrating this issue is as follows:

### Test Case:
Input:
```
4 3
1 2
2 3
3 4
1 1 1 1
```

In this case:
- Blogs 1, 2, 3, and 4 all want to be assigned the same topic, which is 1.
- Blogs are connected in a linear reference structure: 1 ↔ 2 ↔ 3 ↔ 4.

The expected output is `-1` because the program will find that blogs 1 and 2, or 2 and 3, etc., have the same topic when they are directly connected. However, it is possible to write them in a sequence that satisfies the conditions of the problem, for example, writing them in the order of 1, 2, 3, and 4, assigning topic 1 to blog 1, and then subsequently allowing blogs 2, 3, and 4 to also have the same topic without violating the constraints.

Thus, the logic in the code is insufficient to cover all potential valid scenarios, leading to an incorrect conclusion in cases where a valid writing order exists.
