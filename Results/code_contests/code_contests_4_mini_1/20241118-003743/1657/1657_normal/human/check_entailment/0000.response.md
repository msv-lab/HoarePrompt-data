To assess the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze both the problem description and the code.

### Problem Description
The task is to determine an order of writing blogs such that each blog receives a distinct topic number, and no two connected blogs (those with references to each other) can have the same topic. The order should allow Johnny to pick topics according to the constraints defined by the already written blogs.

### Program Analysis
1. **Graph Construction**: The program reads pairs of blogs and constructs a list of references (edges in a graph).
2. **Topic Validation**: The function `func_1` checks if any two connected blogs (from `arr`) have the same topic. If they do, it returns -1, indicating that it's impossible to assign distinct topics as required.
3. **Output**: If no connected blogs have the same topic, it simply returns a sequence of numbers from 1 to n, which, while syntactically correct, does not ensure the order in which the blogs should be written to satisfy the topic assignment strategy.

### Edge Cases
- The program fails to consider cases where the order of writing matters. Simply returning the sequence `1, 2, ..., n` does not guarantee that the topics will be assigned correctly based on the neighbors' topics.
- The output hints indicate that if any two blogs connected by an edge have the same topic, it results in -1. However, the code does not handle the scenario where the topics need to be assigned based on the writing order after ensuring that the references don't conflict.

### Output Hints Analysis
The output hints suggest that the function checks for conflicts in topics between connected blogs and returns -1 if any conflicts are found. However, they also imply that if no conflicts are found, it simply returns the sequence from 1 to n, which does not address the requirement to consider the neighbors' topics during assignment.

### Conclusion
The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, it fails to handle the proper order of writing blogs based on the neighbors' topics correctly, which is crucial for ensuring that the topics are assigned as intended. 

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not account for the necessity of writing blogs in an order that allows Johnny to choose the smallest unassigned topic based on already written neighbors, which could lead to invalid assignments even if no direct conflicts are present in the graph.
