Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a non-negative integer, and `arr` is a list of tuples containing at least two tuples. If the elements at indices `a - 1` and `b - 1` in the `topic` list are equal, the function returns -1; otherwise, there is no change to the state of the program.***
