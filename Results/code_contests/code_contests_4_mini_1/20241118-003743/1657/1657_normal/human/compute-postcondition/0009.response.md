Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a non-negative integer, and `arr` is a list of tuples containing at least two tuples. If the elements at indices `a-1` and `b-1` in `topic` are equal, the function returns -1. If they are not equal, the function does not return a value, and thus the execution continues without any changes to the variables.***
