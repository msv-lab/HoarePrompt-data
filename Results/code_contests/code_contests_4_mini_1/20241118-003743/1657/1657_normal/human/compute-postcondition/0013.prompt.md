You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for describing the functionality of a Python function. You will be provided with the constraints and relationships between the input parameters, as well as the resulting output of the function based on these inputs. Your task is to organize this information and describe the functionality of the function. Please avoid describing how the function operates or details such as how local variables are initialized—only describe what parameters the function accepts and what it returns. If there are multiple return points in the function we will split them in Cases with an arithmetic counter and remember if one case is fullfilled none of the others are. You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: **functionality**.


Example1:
Parameter constraints and relationships: `number` is an integer.
```
def func(number):
```
Output: `number` is an integer. If `number` is even, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer1:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `number`. `number` is an integer. After executing the function body, if number is even, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `number`, and if `number` is even, it returns True. If `number` is not even, it returns False.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter number, returns `True` if `number` is even. If `number` is not even, it returns `False`.**


Parameter constraints and relationships: `age` is an integer.
```
def func(age):
```
Output: Case_1:`number` is an integer. If `number` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative; 
        Case_2: `number` is an integer. If `number` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult".
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `age`. `age` is an integer. If `age` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative. If `age` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult". Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `age`  and return if the person is a minor or an adult based on the age while handling wrong negative input values.


Your Task:
Parameter constraints: n is a positive integer representing the number of blogs (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^5), m is a non-negative integer representing the number of references (0 ≤ m ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^5), arr is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two distinct integers (a, b) representing a bidirectional reference between blogs (1 ≤ a, b ≤ n), and topic is a list of integers where each integer t_i (1 ≤ t_i ≤ n) denotes the desired topic number for the i-th blog.
```
def func_1(n, m, arr, topic):
```
Output: Case_1: If `arr` is a list with at least one tuple, the loop checks each tuple `(a, b)` for equality of the topics at indices `a - 1` and `b - 1`. If any pair of topics are the same, the function returns -1; otherwise, no return statement is executed and the function continues to execute. If `arr` is empty, the loop does not execute, and the function does not return -1, which means it may proceed or return some default value depending on additional code not shown. Therefore, `n` remains a positive integer, `m` remains a non-negative integer, and `arr` remains a list of tuples.

Case_2: The program returns a string of numbers from 1 to n, joined by spaces

Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?
