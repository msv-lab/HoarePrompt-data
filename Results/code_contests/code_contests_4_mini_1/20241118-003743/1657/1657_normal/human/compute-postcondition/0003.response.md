Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a non-negative integer, and `arr` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple where `a` is the first element and `b` is the second element of the first tuple in `arr`. If the elements indexed by `a - 1` and `b - 1` in `topic` are equal, the function returns -1. If they are not equal, no return statement is executed, and the function does not return a value. This ensures that the function only returns -1 when the topics are the same, handling the cases where `a` and `b` might point to the same or different values in `topic`.***
