To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the given information about the loop and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

1. The loop iterates over `arr`, which is a list of tuples. Since the state indicates that `arr` contains at least two tuples, there are at least two pairs `(a, b)` to process.

2. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are tuples left in `arr` to iterate over. After the previous iteration, we need to consider which tuples have already been processed.

3. Since the loop body is omitted, we do not know how many tuples have been processed, but we do know that the loop processes one tuple per iteration. 

4. If `arr` has at least two tuples initially, the first iteration would process the first tuple (let's say `(a1, b1)`), and on the next iteration, it would process the second tuple `(a2, b2)`, and so on.

5. After the previous iteration, if the loop is to execute one more time, it must be that there is still at least one tuple left in `arr` to process.

Given that `arr` is a list of tuples containing at least two tuples, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust the state to reflect that one tuple has been processed and there is still one left.

Thus, we need to adjust the state as follows:

- `arr` still contains tuples, but now it must be specified that it has at least one tuple remaining after processing one.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a non-negative integer, and `arr` is a list of tuples containing at least one tuple remaining.**
