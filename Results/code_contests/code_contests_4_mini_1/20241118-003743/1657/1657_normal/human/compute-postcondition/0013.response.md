The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `arr`, and `topic`. 

- `n` is a positive integer representing the number of blogs (with the constraint 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^5).
- `m` is a non-negative integer representing the number of references (with the constraint 0 ≤ m ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^5).
- `arr` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two distinct integers (a, b) representing a bidirectional reference between blogs (with the constraint 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n).
- `topic` is a list of integers where each integer t_i (with the constraint 1 ≤ t_i ≤ n) denotes the desired topic number for the i-th blog.

After executing the function body, there are two cases for the return value:
- Case_1: If `arr` contains at least one tuple, the function checks each tuple `(a, b)` to see if the topics at indices `a - 1` and `b - 1` are the same. If any pair of topics is the same, the function returns -1; otherwise, it proceeds without returning -1.
- Case_2: If `arr` is empty, the function does not return -1, and instead proceeds to return a string of numbers from 1 to n, joined by spaces.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept parameters that define blogs and their topics, check for conflicting topics based on references, and return a specific output based on the presence of references. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (positive integer), m (non-negative integer), arr (list of tuples of distinct integers), and topic (list of integers). It returns -1 if any referenced blogs share the same topic; otherwise, it returns a string of numbers from 1 to n, joined by spaces.**
