Output State: **If `arr` is a list with at least one tuple, the loop checks each tuple `(a, b)` for equality of the topics at indices `a - 1` and `b - 1`. If any pair of topics are the same, the function returns -1; otherwise, no return statement is executed and the function continues to execute. If `arr` is empty, the loop does not execute, and the function does not return -1, which means it may proceed or return some default value depending on additional code not shown. Therefore, `n` remains a positive integer, `m` remains a non-negative integer, and `arr` remains a list of tuples.**
