Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n`, a non-negative integer `m`, a list of tuples `arr`, and a list `topic`. It checks if any pair of indices from the tuples in `arr` refer to the same topic in `topic`. If they do, it returns -1. If no such pair exists, or if `arr` is empty, it returns a string of numbers from 1 to `n`, joined by spaces. **
