The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `arr`, and `topic`. 

- `n` is a positive integer representing the number of blogs (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^5).
- `m` is a non-negative integer representing the number of references (0 ≤ m ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^5).
- `arr` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two distinct integers (a, b) representing a reference between blogs (1 ≤ a, b ≤ n).
- `topic` is a list of n integers where each integer t_i denotes the desired topic number for the i-th blog (1 ≤ t_i ≤ n).

The functionality of the function is as follows:

**Case 1:** If `m` is greater than 0, the function checks each tuple in `arr` to see if the topics of the referenced blogs are equal. If any pair of blogs has the same topic, the function returns -1. If `m` is 0, the loop does not execute and the function implicitly returns None.

**Case 2:** If no pairs of blogs have the same topic and the loop completes without returning -1, the function returns a string of integers from 1 to n, joined by spaces.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (positive integer), m (non-negative integer), arr (list of tuples representing blog references), and topic (list of integers representing desired topics). If any referenced blogs have the same topic, it returns -1; if no topics are the same and m is greater than 0, it returns a string of integers from 1 to n. If m is 0, it implicitly returns None.**
