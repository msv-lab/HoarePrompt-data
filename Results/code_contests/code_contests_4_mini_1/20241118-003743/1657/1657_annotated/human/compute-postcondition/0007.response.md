According to the code, for the loop to execute again, it needs to iterate over the elements in the `arr` list. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` has at least two tuples, and the loop is set to unpack these tuples into the variables `a` and `b`. For the next iteration, the loop will continue to the next tuple in the `arr` list. 

Since `arr` has at least two tuples, and assuming we have already processed the first tuple, we need to adjust `a` and `b` to refer to the next tuple in `arr`. If `arr` has at least 2 tuples, and one tuple has been processed, the next tuple will be the second one, thus `a` and `b` need to reflect the values of the second tuple.

Therefore, we need to adjust `arr` to have at least 3 tuples, and `a` and `b` will take the values from the next tuple, which is the third tuple in the list.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 0, `arr` is a list of tuples with at least 3 tuples, `a` is the first integer in the third tuple of `arr`, and `b` is the second integer in the third tuple of `arr`.**
