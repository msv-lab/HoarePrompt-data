Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 0, `arr` is a list of tuples with at least 3 tuples, `a` is the first integer in the third tuple of `arr`, and `b` is the second integer in the third tuple of `arr`. If the elements at index `a-1` and `b-1` in the `topic` list are equal, the function returns -1. If they are not equal, there is no return value (the function implicitly returns None).***
