Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 0, `arr` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple, `a` is the first integer in the first tuple of `arr`, and `b` is the second integer in the first tuple of `arr`. If the elements at indices `a - 1` and `b - 1` in the `topic` list are equal, the function returns -1. If they are not equal, there is no return value from this fragment. This covers the edge case where `a` and `b` are within valid bounds, ensuring that the indices do not lead to accessing out-of-bounds elements in the `topic` list.***
