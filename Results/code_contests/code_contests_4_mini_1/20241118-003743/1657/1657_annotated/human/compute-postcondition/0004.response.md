According to the code, whether the loop can execute one more time depends on the `arr` list. Since `arr` is a list of tuples and we want the loop to iterate over it, the loop will continue as long as there are tuples left in `arr`. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` contains at least one tuple, and `a` and `b` are the first integers in that first tuple.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that there is at least one more tuple in the `arr` list for the next iteration. This means `arr` must have at least two tuples. Additionally, `a` and `b` need to be adjusted to reflect the values from the next tuple in `arr`.

Assuming that the first tuple in `arr` is (a, b), and for the loop to continue we need to reference the second tuple in `arr`, we can express this as follows:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 0, `arr` is a list of tuples with at least two tuples, `a` is the first integer in the second tuple of `arr`, and `b` is the second integer in the second tuple of `arr`.**
