Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of tuples containing references between blogs, and `topic` is a list of integers representing the desired topic numbers for the blogs. If `m` is greater than 0, the loop will execute for each tuple in `arr`, checking if the topics of the referenced blogs are equal. If they are equal for any tuple, the function returns -1. If `m` is 0, the loop does not execute, and there is no return value from this fragment (the function implicitly returns None). If at least one pair of blogs has the same topic, the output will be -1; otherwise, the loop completes without returning a value.**
