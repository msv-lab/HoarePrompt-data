Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than 0, `arr` is a list of tuples with at least two tuples, `a` is the first integer in the second tuple of `arr`, and `b` is the second integer in the second tuple of `arr`. If the elements at indices `a - 1` and `b - 1` in the `topic` list are equal, the function returns -1. Otherwise, there is no return value, and the program continues executing with the same variable states.***
