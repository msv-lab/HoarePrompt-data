The function accepts a positive integer `n`, a non-negative integer `m`, a list of tuples `arr` representing references between blogs, and a list of integers `topic` indicating the desired topics for the blogs. It checks if any two referenced blogs in `arr` have the same topic; if they do, it returns -1. If `m` is 0, the loop does not execute, leading to an implicit return of None. If no pairs have the same topic, it returns a string of integers from 1 to `n`, joined by spaces. Therefore, if `m` is 0, the function could mistakenly return None rather than a string, which is a potential edge case.
