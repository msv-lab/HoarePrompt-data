The value of `neg` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `neg` is unknown, so the output state is that `neg` has increased by 1 while the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `numbers` is a map object containing at least two integers, `num` is the second integer from `numbers`, `num_zeros` remains unchanged, `neg` has increased by 1, and `needed_coins` remains unchanged**
