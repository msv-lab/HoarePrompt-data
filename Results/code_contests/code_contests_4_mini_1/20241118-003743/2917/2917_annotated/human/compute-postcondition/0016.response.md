Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `numbers` is a map object containing at least two integers, `num` is the second integer from `numbers`, `num_zeros` remains unchanged, and `needed_coins` remains unchanged. If `num` is less than 0, `neg` is increased by 1; otherwise, `neg` remains unchanged.***
