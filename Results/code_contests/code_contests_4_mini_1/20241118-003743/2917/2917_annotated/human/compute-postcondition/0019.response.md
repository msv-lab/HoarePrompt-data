Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `numbers` is a map object containing at least two integers, and `num` is the second integer from `numbers`. If `num` is zero, `num_zeros` is increased by 1, while `needed_coins` and `neg` remain unchanged. If `num` is non-zero, `needed_coins` is increased by `abs(num) - 1`, and both `num_zeros` and `neg` remain unchanged. Additionally, if `num` is less than 0, `neg` is increased by 1, although this does not affect the other variables.***
