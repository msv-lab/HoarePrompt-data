The variable `needed_coins` is incremented by `abs(num) - 1`. Since `num` is greater than 0, `abs(num)` is simply `num`. Thus, the calculation becomes `needed_coins += num - 1`. The values of `neg` and `num_zeros` remain unchanged at this point, as the operation does not affect them. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `numbers` is a map object containing at least one integer, `num` is the first integer from `numbers`, `neg` is unchanged, `num_zeros` remains 0, and `needed_coins` is increased by `num - 1`.
