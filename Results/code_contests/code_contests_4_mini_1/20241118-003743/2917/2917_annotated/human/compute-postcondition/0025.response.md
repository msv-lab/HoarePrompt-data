Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 100000), `numbers` is a map object containing at least three integers, and `num` is the third integer from `numbers`. If `num` is zero, `num_zeros` is increased by 1. If `num` is negative, `needed_coins` is increased by `abs(num) - 1`, and `neg` is increased by 1. If `num` is positive, `needed_coins` is increased by `num - 1`, and `neg` remains unchanged.***
