The value of `needed_coins` is incremented by `num_zeros`. Since `num_zeros` is greater than 0, `needed_coins` will increase by that positive integer value. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `needed_coins`.

Output State: **`neg` is an odd integer greater than or equal to 1, `num_zeros` is greater than 0, `needed_coins` is updated by adding `num_zeros`**
