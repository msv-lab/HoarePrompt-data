Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `numbers` is a map object containing at least one integer, `num` is the first integer from `numbers`. If `num` is less than 0, then `neg` is increased by 1, while `num_zeros` remains 0 and `needed_coins` remains 0. If `num` is 0 or greater, then `neg` remains unchanged at 0, with `num_zeros` and `needed_coins` also remaining at 0.***
