Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 100000), `numbers` is a map object containing at least one integer, and `num` is the first integer from `numbers`. If `num` is 0, then `num_zeros` is increased by 1, while `neg` and `needed_coins` remain unchanged at 0. If `num` is greater than 0, then `num_zeros` remains 0, `neg` is unchanged, and `needed_coins` is increased by `num - 1`.***
