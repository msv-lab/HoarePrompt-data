Postcondition: ***`neg` is the count of negative numbers in `numbers`, `num_zeros` is the count of zeros in `numbers`, and `needed_coins` is the total number of coins needed calculated as the sum of `abs(num) - 1` for all non-zero numbers in `numbers`. If `neg` is an odd integer greater than or equal to 1, then `needed_coins` is increased by `num_zeros` if `num_zeros` is greater than 0; otherwise, it is increased by 2. If `neg` is even, then `needed_coins` is updated by adding `num_zeros` to it. If `numbers` is empty, `neg`, `num_zeros`, and `needed_coins` remain 0.***
