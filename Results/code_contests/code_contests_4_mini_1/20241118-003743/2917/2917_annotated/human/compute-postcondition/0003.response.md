The variable `num_zeros` is initialized to 0. This assignment does not affect the previous values of `n`, `numbers`, or `neg`. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of the variables without any changes to them.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `numbers` is a map object of integers from user input, `neg` is 0, `num_zeros` is 0**
