According to the code, the loop iterates over the `numbers` map object. The loop can execute again if there are more integers in the `numbers` object beyond the third integer that has already been processed. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `num` is the third integer in `numbers`. For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that there are at least four integers in `numbers`. Since `num` is the third integer, the next integer (`num`) will be the fourth integer.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `numbers` must contain at least four integers.
- `num` must be adjusted to the fourth integer from `numbers`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 100000), `numbers` is a map object containing at least four integers, and `num` is the fourth integer from `numbers`.**
