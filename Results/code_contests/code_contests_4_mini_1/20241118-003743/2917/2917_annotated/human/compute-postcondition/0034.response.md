Postcondition: ***`neg` is an even count of negative numbers in `numbers`, `num_zeros` is the count of zeros in `numbers`, `needed_coins` is the total number of coins needed calculated as the sum of `abs(num) - 1` for all non-zero numbers in `numbers`. If `numbers` is empty, then `neg`, `num_zeros`, and `needed_coins` remain 0.***
