The statement `num_zeros += 1` increments the value of `num_zeros` by 1. The previous value of `num_zeros` is 0, so after execution, `num_zeros` will be 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `numbers` is a map object containing at least one integer, `num` is 0, `neg` remains unchanged, `num_zeros` is 1, and `needed_coins` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `numbers` is a map object containing at least one integer, `num` is 0, `neg` remains unchanged, `num_zeros` is 1, and `needed_coins` is 0**
