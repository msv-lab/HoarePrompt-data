Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of integers input by the user, counts the number of negative numbers and zeros, and calculates the total number of "needed coins" based on the conditions of the input. If the count of negative numbers is odd, it adjusts the needed coins based on the presence of zeros; otherwise, it simply adds the count of zeros to needed coins. The function then prints the total needed coins. If no integers are input, the function does not handle this case gracefully, and the output is undefined.**
