The variable `needed_coins` is initialized to 0. This does not affect any of the previously defined variables (`n`, `numbers`, `neg`, and `num_zeros`). Therefore, the output state remains focused on the newly defined variable and the unchanged previous values.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `numbers` is a map object of integers from user input, `neg` is 0, `num_zeros` is 0, `needed_coins` is 0**
