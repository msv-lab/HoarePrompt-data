The value of `needed_coins` is increased by `abs(num) - 1`. Since `num` is the second integer from the `numbers` map object and can be a positive or negative integer, we first calculate `abs(num)`. The previous value of `needed_coins` remains unchanged before this operation. The overall state of the other variables does not change with this operation. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `numbers` is a map object containing at least two integers, `num` is the second integer from `numbers`, `num_zeros` remains unchanged, `needed_coins` is increased by `abs(num) - 1`, and `neg` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `numbers` is a map object containing at least two integers, `num` is the second integer from `numbers`, `num_zeros` remains unchanged, `needed_coins` is increased by `abs(num) - 1`, and `neg` remains unchanged.**
