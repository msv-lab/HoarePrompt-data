The variable `neg` is initialized to 0, and there are no other variables affected by this code snippet. The previous value of `neg` was not defined before this statement, but it is now clearly set to 0. Therefore, the output state reflects this initialization.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `numbers` is a map object of integers from user input, `neg` is 0**
