The `numbers` variable is assigned the result of `map(int, raw_input().split())`, which means it will contain a map object of integers parsed from the input string. Since the initial state specifies that `n` is a positive integer, it does not directly affect the `numbers` variable. The output state will indicate that the `numbers` variable is now a map object containing integers based on the user input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), and `numbers` is a map object of integers from user input**
