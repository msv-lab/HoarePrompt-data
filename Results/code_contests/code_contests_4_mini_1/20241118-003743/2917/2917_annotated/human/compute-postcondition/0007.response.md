The value of `neg` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `neg` is 0, so after execution, `neg` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `numbers` is a map object containing at least one integer, `num` is the first integer from `numbers` and is less than 0, `neg` is 1, `num_zeros` is 0, `needed_coins` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `numbers` is a map object containing at least one integer, `num` is the first integer from `numbers` and is less than 0, `neg` is 1, `num_zeros` is 0, `needed_coins` is 0**
