The variable `num_zeros` is incremented by 1. The values of `n`, `numbers`, and `num` do not change, and the impact of this code only alters `num_zeros`. The previous state of `num_zeros` is not specified, but the operation indicates it is increased. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `numbers` is a map object containing at least three integers, `num` is the third integer from `numbers`, and `num_zeros` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `numbers` is a map object containing at least three integers, `num` is the third integer from `numbers`, and `num_zeros` is increased by 1**
