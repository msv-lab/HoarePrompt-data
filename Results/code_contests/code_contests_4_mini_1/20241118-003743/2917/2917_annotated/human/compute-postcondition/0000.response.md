The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since `n` is defined as a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), its value will be set based on the input provided. Other variables are not affected at this point. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000).

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000)**
