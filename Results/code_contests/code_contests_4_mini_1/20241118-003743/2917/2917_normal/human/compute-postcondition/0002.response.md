The variable `neg` is initialized to 0. The previous values of `n` and `numbers` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the initial state of the variables without any changes to `n` and `numbers`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `numbers` is a list of integers from input, `neg` is 0**
