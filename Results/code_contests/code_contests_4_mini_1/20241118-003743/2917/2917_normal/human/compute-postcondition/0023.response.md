The code increments the value of `num_zeros` by 1. The values of `n`, `numbers`, and `num` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `numbers` is a list of integers with at least one integer remaining, `num` is the next integer in `numbers`, and `num_zeros` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `numbers` is a list of integers with at least one integer remaining, `num` is the next integer in `numbers`, and `num_zeros` is increased by 1**
