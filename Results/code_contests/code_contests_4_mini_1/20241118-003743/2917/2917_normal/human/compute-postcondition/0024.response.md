The value of `needed_coins` is updated by adding `abs(num) - 1` to it. Since `num` is an integer from the list `numbers`, `abs(num)` will give the absolute value of `num`. The previous value of `needed_coins` is not specified but will be increased by `abs(num) - 1`. The other variables (`n`, `numbers`, `neg`) remain unaffected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `numbers` is a list of integers with at least one integer remaining, `num` is the next integer in `numbers`, and `needed_coins` is increased by `abs(num) - 1`**
