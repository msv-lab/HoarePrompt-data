Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer, `neg` is 0 or 1 depending on the value of `num`, `num_zeros` is 0, `needed_coins` is 0, and `num` is the first integer in `numbers`. If `num` is less than 0, then `neg` is increased by 1. If `num` is 0 or greater, `neg` remains 0.***
