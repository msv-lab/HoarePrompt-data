Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `numbers` is a list of integers with at least one integer, and `num` is the next integer in `numbers`. If `num` is 0, `num_zeros` is increased by 1, while `neg` and `needed_coins` remain unchanged. If `num` is greater than 0, `needed_coins` is increased by `abs(num) - 1`, while `num_zeros` and `neg` remain unchanged. If `num` is less than 0, the variable `neg` is increased by 1, but this case is not directly addressed in the program fragment. Overall, after execution, `num_zeros` will reflect the count of zeros encountered, and `needed_coins` will account for positive integers processed, while `neg` will only be affected by negative integers outside this fragment.***
