The value of `needed_coins` is increased by the value of `num_zeros`. Since `num_zeros` is greater than 0, `needed_coins` will increase by a positive amount. The values of `neg` and `num_zeros` do not change. Therefore, the output state is: `neg` is the count of negative integers in `numbers` (odd), `num_zeros` is greater than 0, and `needed_coins` has increased by `num_zeros`.

Output State: **`neg` is the count of negative integers in `numbers` (odd), `num_zeros` is greater than 0, and `needed_coins` has increased by `num_zeros**
