The value of `num_zeros` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `num_zeros` is 0, so after execution, `num_zeros` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer, `neg` is 0, `num_zeros` is 1, `needed_coins` is 0, `num` is 0, the first integer in `numbers`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer, `neg` is 0, `num_zeros` is 1, `needed_coins` is 0, `num` is 0, the first integer in `numbers`**
