Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer, and `num` is the next integer in `numbers`. If `num` is less than 0, the variable `neg` is increased by 1. If `num` is greater than or equal to 0, `neg` remains unchanged. The variables `num_zeros` and `needed_coins` remain unchanged throughout the execution.***
