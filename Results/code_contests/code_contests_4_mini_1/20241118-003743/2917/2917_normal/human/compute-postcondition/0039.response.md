Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It counts the number of negative integers and zeros in the list, then calculates the total number of "needed coins" based on the absolute values of the positive integers. If the count of negative integers is odd, the function adds either the number of zeros or 2 (if there are no zeros) to the needed coins. The function prints the final value of needed coins, which indicates how many coins are required to make all numbers non-negative. If the input list is empty, the output will be 0 since no calculations will be performed. **
