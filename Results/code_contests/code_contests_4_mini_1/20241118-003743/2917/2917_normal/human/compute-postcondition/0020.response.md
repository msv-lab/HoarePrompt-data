According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `numbers` list. Since `numbers` is a list of integers with at least one integer, and `num` is the next integer in `numbers`, we need to ensure that there are still integers left in the list to process in the next iteration. 

At the end of the last iteration, `num` represents the current integer being processed from `numbers`. The loop will execute again if there is another integer in the list after `num`. This means that we need to adjust the state to reflect that we will be processing the next integer in the list.

If `numbers` had at least one integer before the loop started, and since `num` has been processed, the next state should account for the next integer in the list and that there are still integers left to iterate over.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state for the next iteration, where `num` will be the next integer in the list, and the length of the list will be decremented by 1 (since we have processed one integer).

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `numbers` is a list of integers with at least one integer remaining, and `num` is the next integer in `numbers` after the current one.**
