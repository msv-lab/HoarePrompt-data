Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `numbers` is a list of integers with at least one integer remaining, and `num` is the next integer in `numbers`. If `num` is equal to 0, then `num_zeros` is increased by 1. If `num` is any positive integer, `needed_coins` is increased by `abs(num) - 1`. If `num` is negative, then `neg` is increased by 1, but `num_zeros` and `needed_coins` remain unchanged.***
