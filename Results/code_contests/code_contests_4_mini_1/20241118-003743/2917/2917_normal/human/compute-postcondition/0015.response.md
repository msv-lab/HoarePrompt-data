The value of `neg` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `neg` is unknown. The other variables `n`, `numbers`, `num`, `num_zeros`, and `needed_coins` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer, `num` is the next integer in `numbers`, `num_zeros` is unchanged, `needed_coins` is unchanged, and `neg` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer, `num` is the next integer in `numbers`, `num_zeros` is unchanged, `needed_coins` is unchanged, and `neg` is increased by 1**
