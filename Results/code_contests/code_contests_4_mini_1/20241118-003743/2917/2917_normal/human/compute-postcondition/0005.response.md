According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the `numbers` list. Since `n` is a positive integer, it implies that the `numbers` list should have at least one element for the loop to be executed. Furthermore, at the start of the loop, `num` should be initialized to the first element of the `numbers` list.

Therefore, the required adjustments to the state are that `numbers` must contain at least one integer, and `num` should be set to the first integer in the `numbers` list.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer, `neg` is 0, `num_zeros` is 0, `needed_coins` is 0, `num` is the first integer in `numbers`**
