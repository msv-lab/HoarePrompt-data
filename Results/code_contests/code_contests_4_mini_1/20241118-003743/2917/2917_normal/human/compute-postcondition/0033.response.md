Postcondition: ***`neg` is the count of negative integers in `numbers` (odd), `num_zeros` is the count of zeros in `numbers`, and `needed_coins` is the sum of `abs(num) - 1` for all positive integers in `numbers`. If `num_zeros` is greater than 0, `needed_coins` is increased by `num_zeros`. If `num_zeros` is 0, `needed_coins` is increased by 2.***
