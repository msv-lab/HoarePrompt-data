The variable `numbers` is assigned the value of `map(int, raw_input().split())`, which processes the input from `raw_input()`, splits it into individual string elements, converts those elements to integers, and creates an iterable of those integers. The initial state indicates that `n` is a positive integer representing the number of integers, but it does not provide specific values for the input. Therefore, `numbers` will hold a list of integers based on the provided input.

The output state will reflect that `n` is still a positive integer and that `numbers` now contains the list of integers converted from the input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `numbers` is a list of integers from input**
