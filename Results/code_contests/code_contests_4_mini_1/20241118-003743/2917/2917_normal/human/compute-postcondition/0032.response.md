The value of `needed_coins` is incremented by 2, but the previous value of `needed_coins` is unknown. The counts of zeros and negative integers are unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `neg` is odd, `num_zeros` is 0, and `needed_coins` is increased by 2.

Output State: **`neg` is odd, `num_zeros` is 0, and `needed_coins` is increased by 2**
