The value of `neg` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `neg` is unknown, so the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `numbers` is a list of integers with at least one integer remaining, `num` is the next integer in `numbers`, and `neg` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `numbers` is a list of integers with at least one integer remaining, `num` is the next integer in `numbers`, and `neg` is increased by 1**
