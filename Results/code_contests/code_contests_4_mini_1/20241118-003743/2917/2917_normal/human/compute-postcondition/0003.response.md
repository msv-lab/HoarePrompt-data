The variable `num_zeros` is initialized to 0. This does not affect the previous values of `n`, `numbers`, or `neg`, which remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `numbers` is a list of integers from input, `neg` is 0, and `num_zeros` is initialized to 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `numbers` is a list of integers from input, `neg` is 0, and `num_zeros` is initialized to 0**
