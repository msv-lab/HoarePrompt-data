The value of `num_zeros` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `num_zeros` is unknown, so the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer, `num` is the next integer in `numbers`, `neg` remains unchanged, and `num_zeros` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer, `num` is the next integer in `numbers`, `neg` remains unchanged, and `num_zeros` is increased by 1**
