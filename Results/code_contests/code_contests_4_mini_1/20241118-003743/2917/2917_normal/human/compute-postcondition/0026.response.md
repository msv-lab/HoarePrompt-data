According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `numbers`. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are integers remaining in the `numbers` list. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `numbers` has at least one integer remaining, and `num` is the next integer in that list.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that there is at least one more integer in `numbers` after the current `num`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect that there is at least one more integer remaining in the list. Since `num` was the next integer, we can conclude that the next integer must be in the list as well.

Thus, the adjusted state should indicate that there is at least one more integer left in `numbers`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `numbers` is a list of integers with at least two integers remaining, and `num` is the next integer in `numbers`.**
