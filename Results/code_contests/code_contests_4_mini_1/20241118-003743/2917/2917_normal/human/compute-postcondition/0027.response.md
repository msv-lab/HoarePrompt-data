Output State: **`neg` is the count of negative integers in `numbers`, `num_zeros` is the count of zeros in `numbers`, `needed_coins` is the sum of `abs(num) - 1` for all positive integers in `numbers`. If `numbers` is an empty list, the loop does not execute, and `neg`, `num_zeros`, and `needed_coins` all remain 0.**
