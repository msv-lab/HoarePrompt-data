Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer and `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer. If `num` is 0, then `num_zeros` is increased by 1 and `needed_coins` remains 0. If `num` is greater than 0, then `num_zeros` remains 0 and `needed_coins` is set to `num - 1`. If `num` is less than 0 (which alters `neg`), it does not affect the outcome directly since `num` cannot be negative at this stage. Thus, `neg` can only be 0 or 1 based on the initial value of `num`, while `num_zeros` and `needed_coins` are updated accordingly based on the value of `num`.***
