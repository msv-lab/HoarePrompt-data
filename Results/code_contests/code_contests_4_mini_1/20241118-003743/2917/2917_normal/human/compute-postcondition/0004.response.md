The variable `needed_coins` is initialized to 0, which sets its value without affecting any other variables. The previous values of the affected variables (`n`, `numbers`, `neg`, `num_zeros`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects this initialization.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `numbers` is a list of integers from input, `neg` is 0, `num_zeros` is 0, and `needed_coins` is 0**
