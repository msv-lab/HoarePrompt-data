The value of `neg` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `neg` is 0. Therefore, after execution, `neg` becomes 1. The states of the other variables (`n`, `numbers`, `num_zeros`, `needed_coins`, and `num`) are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer, `neg` is 1, `num_zeros` is 0, `needed_coins` is 0, `num` is the first integer in `numbers`, and `num` is less than 0**
