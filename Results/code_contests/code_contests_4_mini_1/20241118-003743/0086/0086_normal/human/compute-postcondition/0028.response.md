Postcondition: ***`X` is a string of even length consisting of an equal number of characters 'S' and 'T'; `s` is a non-empty string; `i` is 2; if `stack` is not empty and the last element is 'S', then the last element is removed from `stack`. If `stack` is empty or the last element is not 'S', then `s[2]` is appended to `stack`, provided `s[2]` is 'S'. If `s[2]` is not 'S', `stack` remains unchanged. Thus, after execution, `stack` either has the last element removed or has `s[2]` appended if certain conditions regarding `s[2]` and `stack` hold true.***
