Postcondition: ***`X` is a string of even length consisting of an equal number of characters 'S' and 'T'; `s` is a non-empty string; `i` is 1; if `stack` is not empty and the last character of `stack` is 'S', it is removed from `stack`. If `stack` is empty and we attempt to pop from it, an error occurs. If the last character of `stack` is not 'S', `s[1]` is appended to `stack`.***
