Postcondition: ***`X` is a string of even length consisting of an equal number of characters 'S' and 'T'; `s` is a non-empty string; `i` is 1. If `s[1]` is 'T' and the `stack` is not empty with 'S' at the top, 'S' is removed from the `stack`. If the `stack` is empty or the last character of `stack` is not 'S', `s[1]` ('T') is appended to the `stack`. If `s[1]` is not 'T', the `stack` remains unchanged and we proceed to the next iteration. An error occurs if we attempt to pop from an empty stack.***
