Postcondition: ***`X` is a string of even length consisting of an equal number of characters 'S' and 'T', `s` is a non-empty string, `stack` is a list containing the character `s[i]` if `stack` was originally empty or if `s[i]` is 'S', and `i` remains 0. The character at index `i` of `s` is 'T', and if `stack` was not empty, it remains unchanged.***
