The statement `continue` is used to skip the rest of the current iteration in a loop and move to the next iteration. In this case, while the values of the variables do not change, the execution flow is affected. The initial values of `X`, `s`, `i`, and `stack` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that we move to the next iteration without modifying any variables.

Output State: **`X` is a string of even length consisting of an equal number of characters 'S' and 'T'; `s` is a non-empty string; `i` is 1; `stack` is updated to include the character `s[1]`, and we continue to the next iteration.**
