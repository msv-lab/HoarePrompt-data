Postcondition: ***`X` is a string of even length consisting of an equal number of characters 'S' and 'T'; `s` is a non-empty string; if the last element of `stack` is 'S', it is removed from `stack`. If `s[i]` is 'T' and the last element of `stack` is not 'S', the character `s[i]` is added to `stack`, and `i` remains 0. The state of `stack` changes accordingly, either by removing the last 'S' or by adding 'T', while maintaining the initial conditions of the variables.***
