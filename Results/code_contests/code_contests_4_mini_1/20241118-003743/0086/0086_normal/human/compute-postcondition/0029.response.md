Postcondition: ***`X` is a string of even length consisting of an equal number of characters 'S' and 'T'; `s` is a non-empty string; `i` is 2; if `s[2]` is 'T' and `stack` is not empty with the last element being 'S', then the last element is removed from `stack`. If `stack` is empty or the last element is not 'S', and if `s[2]` is 'S', then `s[2]` is appended to `stack`. If `s[2]` is 'T', and `stack` is empty or the last element is not 'S', then `stack` remains unchanged. Thus, after execution, `stack` may either have its last element removed or have `s[2]` appended if it is 'S', or remain unchanged if `s[2]` is 'T' and `stack` conditions do not allow any modifications.***
