Output State: **`X` is a string of even length consisting of an equal number of characters 'S' and 'T'; `s` is a non-empty string; `i` is 2; if `stack` is empty or `s[2]` is 'S', then `s[2]` is appended to `stack`, and the loop continues to the next iteration; if `stack` is not empty and `s[2]` is not 'S', the program does not alter `stack` and proceeds without any modification; `stack` has an item removed by `stack.pop()`**
