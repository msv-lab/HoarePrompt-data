Postcondition: ***`X` is a string of even length consisting of an equal number of characters 'S' and 'T'; `s` is a non-empty string; if `s[i]` is 'T' and the last element of `stack` is 'S', then the last 'S' is removed from `stack`. If `s[i]` is 'T' and the last element of `stack` is not 'S', then the character `s[i]` (which is 'T') is added to `stack`. If the `stack` was originally empty and `s[i]` is 'T', the `stack` remains unchanged. The variable `i` remains 0 throughout this operation. The final state of `stack` reflects these operations while adhering to the initial conditions of the variables.***
