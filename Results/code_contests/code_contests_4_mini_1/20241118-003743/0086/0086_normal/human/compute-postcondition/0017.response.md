Postcondition: ***`X` is a string of even length consisting of an equal number of characters 'S' and 'T'; `s` is a non-empty string; `i` is 1; if the `stack` is empty or `s[1]` is 'S', then `s[1]` is appended to `stack`, and we proceed to the next iteration. If the `stack` is not empty and `s[1]` is 'T', then the `stack` remains unchanged and we continue to the next iteration.***
