The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables directly. It simply causes the loop to skip the remaining code in the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration. Hence, the values of `X`, `s`, `stack`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`X` is a string of even length consisting of an equal number of characters 'S' and 'T', `s` is a string with length greater than 0, `stack` is a list with one element which is `s[i]`, `i` is 0, and `stack` is empty or the character at index `i` of `s` is 'S' and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
