Postcondition: ***`X` is a string consisting of an even number of characters with half 'S' and half 'T', `s` is a non-empty string, `stack` is a list that contains 'S' if `s[i]` is 'S' or if `stack` was initially empty. Additionally, `i` remains 0, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `s[i]` is 'T' and `stack` is not empty, then `stack` does not change.***
