Postcondition: ***`X` is a string consisting of an even number of characters with half 'S' and half 'T', `s` has a length of at least 3, and `i` is 2. If `s[2]` is 'T' and the last element of `stack` is 'S', then the last element of `stack` is removed. If `s[2]` is 'T' and the `stack` is empty or the last element of `stack` is not 'S', then `s[2]` ('T') is appended to `stack`. If `s[2]` is not 'T', the state of `stack` remains unchanged. Thus, if `s[2]` is 'T', either an 'S' is removed from `stack` or 'T' is added, depending on the state of `stack`, while no modifications occur if `s[2]` is 'S'.***
