Postcondition: ***`X` is a string consisting of an even number of characters with half 'S' and half 'T', `s` has a length of at least 3, and `i` is 2. If `stack` is not empty and the last element of `stack` is 'S', the last element is removed from `stack`. If `stack` is empty or the last element of `stack` is not 'S', `s[2]` is appended to `stack`. Therefore, after the execution, if the last element of `stack` was 'S', it has been removed; otherwise, `s[2]` has been added to `stack`.***
