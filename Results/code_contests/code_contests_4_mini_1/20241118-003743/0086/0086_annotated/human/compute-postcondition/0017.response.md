Postcondition: ***`X` is a string consisting of an even number of characters with half 'S' and half 'T', `s` is a non-empty string, and `i` is 1. If `stack` is empty or the second character of `s` (i.e., `s[i]`) is 'S', then `s[i]` is appended to `stack` and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop; otherwise, no change occurs to `stack`.***
