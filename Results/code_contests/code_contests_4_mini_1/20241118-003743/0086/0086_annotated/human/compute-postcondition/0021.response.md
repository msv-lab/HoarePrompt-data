Postcondition: ***`X` is a string consisting of an even number of characters with half 'S' and half 'T', `s` is a non-empty string, and `i` is 1. If the last character of `stack` is 'S', it is removed from `stack`. If `stack` is empty or `s[1]` is 'S', then `s[1]` is appended to `stack`. If `s[1]` is 'T' and `stack` is not empty, and the last character of `stack` is not 'S', then `s[1]` (which is 'T') is appended to `stack`. In all other cases, `stack` remains unchanged.***
