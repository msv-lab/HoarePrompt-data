The statement `continue` does not change the values of any variables but causes the program to skip the current iteration of the loop and continue with the next iteration. Therefore, the output state reflects that the program will continue without any modifications to the variables.

Output State: **`X` is a string consisting of an even number of characters with half 'S' and half 'T', `s` is a non-empty string, `stack` contains ['S'], `i` is 0 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
