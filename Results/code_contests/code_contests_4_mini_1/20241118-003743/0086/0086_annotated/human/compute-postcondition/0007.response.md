Postcondition: ***`X` is a string consisting of an even number of characters with half 'S' and half 'T', `s` is a non-empty string, `stack` is a list that contains 'S' if `s[i]` is 'S' or if `stack` was initially empty, and `i` remains 0. Additionally, `s[i]` is 'T', and `stack` remains unchanged if it is not empty.***
