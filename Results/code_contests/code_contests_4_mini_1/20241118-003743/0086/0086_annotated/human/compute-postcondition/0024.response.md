The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration in a loop and move to the next iteration. The values of the variables do not change as a result of this statement. Therefore, the output state remains as it was before the `continue` statement.

Output State: **`X` is a string consisting of an even number of characters with half 'S' and half 'T', `s` has a length of at least 3, `i` is 2, and `s[2]` is appended to `stack`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
