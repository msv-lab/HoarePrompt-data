Postcondition: ***`X` is a string consisting of an even number of characters with half 'S' and half 'T', `s` is a non-empty string, and `i` remains 0. If the last element of `stack` was 'S', it has been removed, and `stack` no longer contains that 'S'. If the last element of `stack` was not 'S', the first character of `s` has been added to `stack`, preserving its previous elements. In either case, the state of `stack` is updated accordingly.***
