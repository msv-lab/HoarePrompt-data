Functionality: ** The function accepts a string input consisting of characters 'S' and 'T'. It processes the string by using a stack to remove occurrences of 'S' when immediately followed by 'T'. After processing, it prints the length of the stack, which represents the number of unmatched 'S' and 'T' characters. If the input string is empty or contains characters other than 'S' and 'T', the function will not handle these cases properly, and the output could be misleading. Additionally, there are no checks for the validity of the input string length or content. **
