Postcondition: ***`X` is a string consisting of an even number of characters with half 'S' and half 'T', `s` is a non-empty string, and `i` remains 0. If `s[i]` is 'T' and the last element of `stack` is 'S', then that 'S' is removed from `stack`. If `s[i]` is 'T' and the last element of `stack` is not 'S', then 'T' is appended to `stack`, preserving its previous elements. If `s[i]` is not 'T', the state of `stack` remains unchanged. In either case, the state of `stack` is updated accordingly, reflecting the operations performed based on the conditions.***
