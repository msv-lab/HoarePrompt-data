The `stack.pop()` method removes and returns the last element of the `stack`. Since the last element of `stack` is 'S', this element will be removed from the list. The state of other variables is not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`X` is a string consisting of an even number of characters with half 'S' and half 'T'; `s` is a non-empty string; `stack` no longer contains the last 'S'; `i` remains 0; the last element of `stack` has been removed.**
