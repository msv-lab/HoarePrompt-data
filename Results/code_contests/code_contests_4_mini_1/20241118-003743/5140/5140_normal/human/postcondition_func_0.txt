The function accepts a list of 8 strings representing a grid (surface) and two integers (x, y) indicating the coordinates of a bomb. It sets the value at the specified coordinates to 0 and recursively checks in both horizontal and vertical directions (within a range of 3 units in either direction) for other bombs. If it finds additional bombs in the specified ranges, it calls itself to process those bombs as well. The function effectively marks the bomb and all connected bombs (in a straight line) as processed by setting their respective grid values to 0.
