According to the code, the loop executes based on the values of `start`, `end`, and `i`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `end`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `end - 1`. 

Given that `end` is `x + 5` and `i` is currently `end - 1`, the next value for `i` will be `end`, which is equal to `x + 5`. For the loop to execute one more time, `end` must be adjusted such that `i` is still less than `end`. 

Since `x` is greater than or equal to 3, `end` must be set to a value greater than `end` (which is `x + 5` for the next iteration) to allow one more iteration. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `start` is `x - 3`, `end` is `x + 5`, and `i` is `end - 1`. To allow the loop to execute one more time, `end` should be adjusted to be greater than `x + 5`.

State: **`surface` is a list of 8 strings representing the plane with bombs, `start` is `x - 3`, `end` is greater than `x + 5`, `x` is greater than or equal to 3, and `i` is `end - 1`**
