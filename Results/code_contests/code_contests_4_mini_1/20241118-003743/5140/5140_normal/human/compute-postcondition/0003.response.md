To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the variables involved:

1. **`start`** is assigned the value of `x - 3`. For `start` to be a valid starting point in the range, we must ensure that it is less than `end`.
2. **`end`** can be either `x + 4` or `8`. This means `end` can vary depending on the value of `x`.
3. The loop variable `i` will take on values starting from `start` and ending at `end - 1`.

To ensure the loop executes at least once, we need the following conditions:
- **`start` must be less than `end`**, which translates to `(x - 3) < end`. This will ensure that the loop has a valid range to iterate over.
- The values of `start` and `end` should also fall within the valid indices of the `surface` list. Since `surface` has a length of 8, we need to ensure that both start and end indices are within this range, i.e., `0 <= start < 8` and `0 < end <= 8`.

Now, let's summarize the states:
- Since `start = x - 3`, we need to ensure `x - 3 >= 0` (which means `x >= 3`) for `start` to be a valid index.
- We also need to ensure `end` is set properly based on the value of `x`. For the loop to execute at least once, we can choose `end = x + 4`, considering that it will always be greater than `start` if `x` is sufficiently large (specifically, `x` should be at least 3).

Putting all this together, we can state the necessary conditions:

State: **`surface` is a list of 8 strings representing the plane with bombs, `start` is `x - 3`, `end` is `x + 4`, `x` is greater than or equal to 3**.
