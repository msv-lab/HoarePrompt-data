Output State: **If `x` is less than 3, the loop does not execute, and the `surface` remains unchanged. If `x` is greater than or equal to 3, the loop iterates from `start` (which is `x - 3`) to `end` (which is either `x + 4` or `8`), checking the value of `surface[y][i]` for each `i`. If `surface[y][i]` is true, `func_1` is called with `surface`, `i`, and `y` as parameters; otherwise, if `surface[y][i]` is false, the function is not called, and the state of `surface` remains unchanged. After the loop execution, `surface` is a list of 8 strings representing the plane with bombs, `start` is `x - 3`, `end` is either `x + 4` (if it is less than or equal to 8) or `8`, and `i` will take values from `start` to `end - 1`.**
