Postcondition: ***`start` is either `y - 3` (if `y > 3`) or 0; `end` is either `y + 5` (if `y < 4`) or 9; `i` has been decremented by 1. If `surface[i][x]` is true, then `func_1(surface, x, i)` is called. If `surface[i][x]` is false, `func_1` is not executed, and the values of `start`, `end`, and `i` remain unchanged.***
