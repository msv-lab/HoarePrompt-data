The value of `end` is assigned based on the condition `y + 4 < 8`. If `y + 4` is less than 8, then `end` will be `y + 4`. If not, `end` will be set to 8. The values of `x`, `surface`, and `y` do not change, so the output state will reflect the unchanged variables and the calculated value of `end`.

Output State: **`start` is calculated as `y - 3` if `y - 3 > 0` else 0; `x`, `surface`, and `y` remain unchanged; `end` is either `y + 4` (if `y + 4 < 8`) or 8.**
