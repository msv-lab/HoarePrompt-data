To determine the output state, we first analyze the given initial state and the impact of the provided code.

Initial State: `surface` is a list of 8 strings representing the plane with bombs; `start` is assigned the value of `x - 3` if `x - 3 > 0` else 0.

The code snippet `end = x + 4 if x + 4 < 8 else 8` checks the value of `x` and assigns a value to `end`.

1. If `x + 4 < 8`, then `end` will be assigned the value of `x + 4`.
2. If `x + 4 >= 8`, then `end` will be assigned the value of `8`.

Since we do not have the specific value of `x`, we cannot determine the exact value of `end`. However, we can express `end` in terms of `x`.

Thus, the output state will include:
- The value of `surface` remains unchanged.
- The value of `start` remains unchanged.
- The value of `end` can either be `x + 4` (if `x < 4`) or `8` (if `x >= 4`).

Output State: **`surface` is a list of 8 strings representing the plane with bombs; `start` is assigned the value of `x - 3`, and `end` is either `x + 4` or `8`**
