To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the variables involved:

1. The variable `start` is defined as `y - 3` if `y - 3 > 0`, otherwise it is 0. This means that for the loop to have a valid starting point, `start` must be calculated correctly based on the value of `y`.
2. The variable `end` is defined as `y + 4` if `y + 4 < 8`, otherwise it is set to 8. This means that `end` must also be defined correctly based on the value of `y`.
3. The loop runs from `start` to `end`, so we need to ensure that `start` is less than `end` for the loop to execute at least once.

Considering these points, we can summarize the necessary conditions:

- If `y - 3 > 0`, then `start` is `y - 3`. 
- If `y - 3 <= 0`, then `start` is 0.
- For the loop to execute, we must also have `start < end`.

Thus, we can derive the necessary state modifications based on the possible values of `y`:

1. If `y - 3 > 0` and `y + 4 < 8`, then `start = y - 3` and `end = y + 4`. We need to ensure that `y - 3 < y + 4`, which is always true.
2. If `y - 3 > 0` and `y + 4 >= 8`, then `start = y - 3` and `end = 8`. We need to ensure that `y - 3 < 8`, meaning `y < 11`.
3. If `y - 3 <= 0`, then `start = 0`. For the loop to execute, we need `0 < end`, which is always satisfied if `end` is 8 or `y + 4` (if `y + 4 < 8`).

In summary, the necessary conditions to ensure the loop executes will depend on the values of `y`. 

Therefore, the adjusted state must include:
- `y` must be such that it satisfies the conditions for `start` and `end` to ensure `start < end`.

Hereâ€™s the final adjusted state:

State: **`start` is either `y - 3` (if `y > 3`) or 0, `end` is either `y + 4` (if `y < 4`) or 8, and `y` must be greater than 3 for the loop to potentially execute with `start` greater than 0.**
