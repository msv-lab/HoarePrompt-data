The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `surface`, `x`, and `y`. The parameter `surface` is a list containing 8 strings, each string consists of 8 characters ('0' or '1'), representing a grid where '1' indicates the presence of a bomb. The parameters `x` and `y` are integers representing the coordinates of the bomb to explode, with the constraints that 1 <= x <= 8 and 1 <= y <= 8. 

Based on the given input and the output described, the functionality of the function is to process the grid represented by `surface` and determine the outcome of exploding the bomb located at the specified coordinates `(x, y)`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of 8 strings representing a grid of bombs and two integers for the bomb's coordinates, and it performs operations based on the bomb at the specified coordinates.**
