The function `func_1` is called with parameters `surface`, `x`, and `i`. The values of `start`, `end`, and `i` are determined based on the conditions provided:

1. `start` can either be `y - 3` if `y > 3` or `0` if `y <= 3`.
2. `end` can either be `y + 5` if `y < 4` or `9` if `y >= 4`.
3. The value of `i` is decremented by `1`.

However, the specific values of `surface`, `x`, and the current value of `i` are not provided, nor is the context of the function `func_1` shown, meaning we can't determine the changes in those variables or their interactions within the function.

Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `start`, `end`, and `i`, including the fact that `i` has been decremented by `1`.

Output State: **`start` is either `y - 3` (if `y > 3`) or 0; `end` is either `y + 5` (if `y < 4`) or 9; `i` is `i - 1`**
