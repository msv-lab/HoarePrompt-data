The function call `func_1(surface, x, i)` does not alter the values of the variables `start`, `end`, or `i` in the current context. The values of `start` and `end` depend on the value of `y`, which is not specified. The only variable that is mentioned to be incremented is `i`, but since the code snippet provided does not show the increment operation being executed, we cannot assume that `i` changes during this function call.

Therefore, the output state reflects the current state of the variables without any changes due to the function call. 

Output State: **`start` is either `y - 3` (if `y > 3`) or 0; `end` is either `y + 4` (if `y < 4`) or 8; `i` is `i + 1`**
