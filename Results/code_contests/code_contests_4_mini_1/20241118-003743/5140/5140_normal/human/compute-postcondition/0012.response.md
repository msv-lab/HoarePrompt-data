Postcondition: ***`surface` is a list of 8 strings representing the plane with bombs. If `surface[y][i]` is true, then the function `func_1` is called with parameters `surface`, `i`, and `y`. There are no further actions taken if `surface[y][i]` is false. The values of `start`, `end`, and `x` remain unchanged, with `start` being `x - 3`, `end` being greater than `x + 5`, and `x` being greater than or equal to 3.***
