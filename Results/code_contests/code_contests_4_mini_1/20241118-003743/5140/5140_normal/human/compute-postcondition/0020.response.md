Postcondition: ***`start` is either `y - 3` (if `y > 3`) or 0, and `end` is either `y + 4` (if `y < 4`) or 8. If `surface[i][x]` is true, the function `func_1(surface, x, i)` is called. If `y` is greater than 3, `start` will be greater than 0, allowing the loop to potentially execute. If `surface[i][x]` is false, `func_1(surface, x, i)` will not be called, and no other actions are taken.***
