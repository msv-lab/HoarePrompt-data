Output State: **If `y` is greater than 3, then `start` is `y - 3`, and if `y` is 3 or less, `start` is 0. `end` is `y + 4` if `y` is less than 4, otherwise it is 8. The loop will execute from `start` to `end - 1`. If `surface[i][x]` is true for a given `i`, `func_1(surface, x, i)` will be called. If `y` is 3 or less, the loop will not execute and `start` will be 0, `end` will be 8, and no calls to `func_1` will be made. Additionally, the loop will not execute if `start` is equal to `end`, meaning that if `y` is such that `y - 3` equals `y + 4` or greater, `start` will not initiate the loop.**
