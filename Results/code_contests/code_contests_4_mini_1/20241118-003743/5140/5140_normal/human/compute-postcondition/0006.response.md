Postcondition: ***`surface` is a list of 8 strings representing the plane with bombs, `start` is `x - 3`, `end` is `x + 4`, and `x` is greater than or equal to 3. If `surface[y][i]` is true (indicating the presence of a bomb or a non-empty string), the function `func_1` is called with `surface`, `i`, and `y` as parameters. If `surface[y][i]` is false (indicating no bomb or an empty string), `func_1` is not called, and the state of `surface` remains unchanged.***
