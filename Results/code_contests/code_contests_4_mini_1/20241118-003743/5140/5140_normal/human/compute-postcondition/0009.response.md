Postcondition: ***`surface` is a list of 8 strings representing the plane with bombs, `start` is `x - 3`, `end` is `x + 5`, `x` is greater than or equal to 3, and `i` is `end - 1`. If there is a bomb at the position `surface[y][i]`, the function `func_1` is called with the parameters `surface`, `i`, and `y`. If there is no bomb at that position, `func_1` is not called, and the state of `surface` remains unchanged.***
