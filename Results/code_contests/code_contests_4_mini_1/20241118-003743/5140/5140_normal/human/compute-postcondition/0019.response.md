The function `func_1(surface, x, i)` is called, but the impact on the state depends on the implementation of `func_1`, which is not provided. However, we know that `start` is either `y - 3` (if `y > 3`) or 0, and `end` is either `y + 4` (if `y < 4`) or 8, with the additional condition that `y` is greater than 3 for the loop to potentially execute.

Since `y` is greater than 3, it implies that `start` is `y - 3`, and `end` can either be `y + 4` or 8 depending on the value of `y`. The variable `surface[i][x]` is true, which indicates that the condition in the function may be initialized correctly, but without the function's logic, we cannot determine any changes or returns.

Thus, the output state captures the existing values and the function call. The output state is:

Output State: **`start` is `y - 3`, `end` is either `y + 4` or 8, `surface[i][x]` is true, and the function `func_1(surface, x, i)` is called.**
