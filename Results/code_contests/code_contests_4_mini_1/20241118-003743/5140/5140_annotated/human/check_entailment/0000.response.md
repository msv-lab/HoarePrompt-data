To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we first need to analyze the code and the problem description carefully.

### Problem Description Recap:
- The program is supposed to simulate a grid where bombs are placed.
- When a bomb explodes, it affects the squares above, below, left, and right of the bomb, potentially causing a chain reaction.
- The program takes the initial state of the grid and the coordinates of the first bomb to explode, and it must output the final state of the grid after all explosions.

### Analyzing the Code:
The provided function `func_1(surface, x, y)` is designed to handle the explosion logic. The key parts of the code are:

1. **Initial Explosion**: The bomb at (x, y) is set to 0 (indicating it has exploded).
2. **Horizontal Explosion**: The loop iterates from `start` to `end` to check the row of the bomb for any other bombs (1s) and triggers a recursive explosion for each.
3. **Vertical Explosion**: A similar logic is applied for the column of the bomb.

### Key Observations:
- The `start` and `end` values are calculated to ensure that we don't go out of bounds of the 8x8 grid.
- The function is recursive, meaning that if a bomb explodes, it can cause further explosions in its vicinity (both horizontally and vertically).

### Potential Issue:
The program does not account for the fact that when a bomb explodes, it affects not just the adjacent squares but also any bombs in those squares. However, the recursive nature of the function should handle this as long as it correctly identifies all bombs that are affected.

### Test Cases:
1. **Basic Case**:
   - Input: A grid with one bomb at (4, 6).
   - Expected Output: Other bombs in the vicinity should explode.
   - The program correctly handles this as described.

2. **Edge Case** (No bombs):
   - Input: A grid with no bombs (all zeros) and any coordinates.
   - Expected Output: The output should remain all zeros.
   - The program will handle this correctly since there are no bombs to explode.

3. **Chain Reaction**:
   - Input: A grid with multiple bombs close to each other.
   - Expected Output: All bombs should explode in a chain reaction.
   - The program should also handle this correctly due to the recursive calls.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the code and considering various potential cases, it appears that the program handles the explosion logic correctly without missing edge cases or logic flaws. Thus, we conclude that there is no case where the program fails to meet the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
