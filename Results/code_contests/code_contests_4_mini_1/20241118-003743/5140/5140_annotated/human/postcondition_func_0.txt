The function accepts a 2D list `surface`, which represents a grid of 8x8 where bombs are located, and two integers `x` and `y` which represent the coordinates of a bomb. It sets the value at `surface[y][x]` to 0 to indicate that the bomb has exploded, then recursively checks horizontally and vertically for other bombs in the vicinity (within three units) and triggers their explosions as well. This continues until there are no more adjacent bombs to trigger. The function effectively simulates a chain reaction of bomb explosions starting from the specified coordinates.
