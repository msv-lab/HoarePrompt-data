Output State: **If `y >= 3`, `start` is `y - 3` and `end` is `8`. If `y < 3`, `start` is `0` and `end` is `y + 4`. The loop will execute a number of times equal to `end - start`. If `start` is greater than or equal to `end`, the loop does not execute, and `i` has no value assigned. If the loop executes, `i` will take values from `start` to `end - 1`, and for each value of `i`, if `surface[i][x]` is true, `func_1(surface, x, i)` is called; otherwise, no action is taken.**
