Output State: **`surface[y][x]` is 0, `start` is either `0` or `x - 3`, `end` is either `x + 4` or `8`, and `start` is less than `end`. If `start` is greater than or equal to `end`, the loop does not execute and there are no calls to `func_1`. If the loop executes, `i` takes values from `start` to `end - 1`, and `func_1` is called for each non-zero value of `surface[y][i]`. If `surface[y][i]` is zero, `func_1` is not executed. The loop handles cases where `x` is less than 3 (resulting in `start` being 0) or greater than or equal to 4 (where `end` could be capped at 8).**
