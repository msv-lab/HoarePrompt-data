Postcondition: ***`start` is either `y - 3` (if `y >= 3`) or 0 (if `y < 3`); `end` is either `y + 4` (if `y < 4`) or 8 (if `y >= 4`); `i` is set to `start`. If the value at `surface[i][x]` is true, then `func_1` is called with parameters `surface`, `x`, and `i`. If `surface[i][x]` is false, no action is taken.***
