To determine the output state, we first analyze the code provided.

1. The code assigns a value to `end` based on the value of `x`.
2. If `x + 4 < 8`, then `end` is assigned the value `x + 4`.
3. Otherwise, `end` is assigned the value `8`.

We also know that:
- `surface[y][x]` is set to `0`, but this doesn't impact the calculation of `end`.
- `start` can either be `x - 3` (if `x >= 3`) or `0` (if `x < 3`), but this does not affect the calculation of `end` either.

Now, we need to consider the possible values of `x`:
- If `x < 4`, then `end` will be `8` since `x + 4` will be less than `8`.
- If `x >= 4`, then `end` will be `x + 4`, which will still be less than or equal to `8` due to the constraint provided.

Therefore, the output state will cover both conditions for `end` based on the value of `x`.

Output State: **`surface[y][x]` is set to 0; `start` is either `x - 3` (if `x >= 3`) or 0 (if `x < 3); `end` is either `x + 4` (if `x + 4 < 8`) or 8 (if `x + 4 >= 8)`**
