Postcondition: ***`surface[y][x]` is 0, `start` is either `0` or `x - 3`, `end` is either `x + 4` or `8`, and `start` is less than `end`. If `surface[y][i]` is truthy, then `func_1(surface, i, y)` is called, where `i` is `start + 2`. If `surface[y][i]` is falsy, no action is taken. The value of `surface[y][i]` determines whether `func_1` is executed or not, allowing for the handling of edge cases concerning the values at `surface[y][i]`.***
