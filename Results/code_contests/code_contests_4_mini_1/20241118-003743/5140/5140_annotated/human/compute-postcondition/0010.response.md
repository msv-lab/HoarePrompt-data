According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `start` and `end`. The loop executes for values of `i` in the range defined by `start` and `end`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `start + 1`, which means `i` is currently one more than `start`. 

To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be less than `end`. Since `start` is either `0` or `x - 3`, and `end` is either `x + 4` or `8`, we know that `start` is less than `end`. 

Now, for the loop to execute again:
- The current value of `i` is `start + 1`, which needs to be less than `end`, meaning we need `i` to be updated to `start + 2`.
- The condition `start < end` remains valid, so `start` can stay the same.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be updated to `start + 2`.

State: **`surface[y][x]` is 0, `start` is either `0` or `x - 3`, `end` is either `x + 4` or `8`, and `start` is less than `end`, `i` is `start + 2`**
