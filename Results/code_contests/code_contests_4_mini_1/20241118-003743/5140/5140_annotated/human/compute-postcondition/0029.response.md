The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `surface`, which is a list of 8 strings, each string containing 8 characters that are either '0' or '1', representing a plane with bombs. Additionally, it accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, both of which are integers between 1 and 8 inclusive, representing the coordinates of the bomb that explodes first. 

After executing the function body, the output behavior is not explicitly detailed in the provided information. However, the functionality of the function is to process the `surface` based on the coordinates `(x, y)`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of 8 strings representing a plane with bombs and two integers representing the coordinates of the first exploding bomb.**
