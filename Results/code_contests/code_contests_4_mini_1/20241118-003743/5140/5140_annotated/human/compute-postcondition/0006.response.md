Postcondition: ***`surface[y][x]` is 0, `start` is either `0` or `x - 3`, `end` is either `x + 4` or `8`, and `start` is less than `end`. If the value of `surface[y][i]` is non-zero, the function `func_1` is called with parameters `surface`, `i`, and `y`. If `surface[y][i]` is zero, there is no change to the state of the program.***
