According to the code, the loop will execute for values of `i` starting from `start` and ending before `end`. At the end of the last iteration, `start` is either `0` or `x - 3`, `end` is either `x + 4` or `8`, and `start` is less than `end`. 

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, the value of `i` must be less than `end`. Since the loop iterates from `start` to `end - 1`, we need to ensure that `i` is less than `end`. Given that the last value of `i` would be `end - 1`, for the loop to execute again, `start` must be less than `end` and `i` must be adjusted to the next value, which is `i + 1`.

Since `i` starts at `start` and increments on each iteration, we can conclude that for the loop to run one more time, we need to set `i` to `start` (the current position) and verify that `i` is still less than `end`.

Therefore, `start` remains unchanged, but `end` must be increased to allow for one more iteration, and `i` must reflect the current index.

State: **`surface[y][x]` is 0, `start` is either `0` or `x - 3`, `end` is either `x + 5` or `9`, and `start` is less than `end`.**
