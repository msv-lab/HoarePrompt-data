To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the conditions for the `start` and `end` variables based on the value of `y`.

1. The `start` variable depends on `y`:
   - If `y >= 3`, then `start = y - 3`.
   - If `y < 3`, then `start = 0`.

2. The `end` variable also depends on `y`:
   - If `y < 4`, then `end = y + 4`.
   - If `y >= 4`, then `end = 8`.

For the loop `for i in range(start, end)` to execute at least once, `start` must be less than `end`. 

Considering the ranges based on the two cases of `y`:

- **Case 1: When `y >= 4`**
  - `start = y - 3` (which is at least 1 since `y` is at least 4).
  - `end = 8`.
  - In this case, `start < end` will always hold true as long as `y` is at least 4.

- **Case 2: When `y < 4`**
  - If `y < 3`, then `start = 0` and `end = y + 4` (which is greater than 0). Therefore, the loop will execute since `0 < y + 4`.
  - If `y = 3`, then `start = 0` and `end = 7` (since `3 + 4 = 7`). The condition `0 < 7` holds true, so the loop will execute.

In all cases:
- For `y >= 4`, `start` will be at least 1, and `end` will be 8, ensuring at least one iteration.
- For `y < 4`, `start` will be 0, and `end` will be at least 4 (when `y = 0`), ensuring at least one iteration.

Thus, to summarize the states:

State: **`start` is either `y - 3` (if `y >= 3`) or 0 (if `y < 3`), `end` is either `y + 4` (if `y < 4`) or 8 (if `y >= 4`), `i` is `start`**
