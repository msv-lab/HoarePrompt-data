Postcondition: ***`surface[y][x]` is 0, `start` is either `0` or `x - 3`, `end` is either `x + 4` or `8`, and `start` is less than `end`. If `surface[y][i]` is true, then the function `func_1(surface, i, y)` is called, indicating that `surface[y][i]` is not 0. Otherwise, if `surface[y][i]` is false, `func_1(surface, i, y)` is not executed. The value of `i` is `start + 1`, which remains within the bounds defined by `start` and `end`.***
