The function `func_1` is called with the parameters `surface`, `x`, and `i`. The variable `i` is set to `start`, which can either be `y - 3` (if `y >= 3`) or 0 (if `y < 3`). The variables `start` and `end` are dependent on the value of `y`. The function call does not change the values of `start`, `end`, or `y`.

Therefore, the output state reflects the initial conditions of the variables without any changes from the function call. The output state is determined by the conditions of `y`.

Output State: **`start` is either `y - 3` (if `y >= 3`) or 0 (if `y < 3`); `end` is either `y + 4` (if `y < 4`) or 9 (if `y >= 4`); `i` is set to `start`.**
