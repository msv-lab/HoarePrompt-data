The function `func_1` is called with the arguments `surface`, `x`, and `i`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but since the previous value of `i` is not specified, we cannot determine its exact new value. The variables `start` and `end` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `i` has been incremented but does not specify its final value. 

Output State: **`start` remains as is, `end` remains as is, `i` is incremented by 1, and `func_1(surface, x, i)` is called.**
