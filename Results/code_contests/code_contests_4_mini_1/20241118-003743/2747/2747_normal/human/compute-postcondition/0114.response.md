Postcondition: ***`count` is equal to `len(order)`, `lol` is an empty list, and either `temp` has been reset to an empty list, or `same` contains `temp[0]` appended to it, based on the conditions of the if statement. If `temp[0]` or `lol` was in `same`, `temp` and `lol` are cleared, and `count` is incremented. Otherwise, if the length of `same` equals `int(inp[1])`, the loop breaks; otherwise, `temp[0]` is appended to `same`, and both `temp` and `lol` are cleared, with `count` being incremented.***
