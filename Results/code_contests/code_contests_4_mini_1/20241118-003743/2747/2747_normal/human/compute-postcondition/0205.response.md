Postcondition: ***`count` is incremented by 1. If `temp[0]` or `lol` is in `same`, both `temp` and `lol` are reset to empty lists. If `len(same)` equals `int(inp[1])`, the program breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, `temp[0]` is appended to `same`, and both `temp` and `lol` are reset to empty lists. The variable `order` remains a list with at least one element throughout the execution.***
