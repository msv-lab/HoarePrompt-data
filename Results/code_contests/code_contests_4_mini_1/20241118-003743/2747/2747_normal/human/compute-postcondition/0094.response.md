Postcondition: ***`count` is 0, `c` is in the range from 0 to `len(order) - 1`, `order` has at least 1 element, `temp` contains [[order[0], order[0]]], and `lol` contains [order[0], order[0]], the pair `temp[0]` is not in `same`, `lol` is not in `same`, and if the length of `same` is equal to the integer value of `inp[1]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, the loop continues.***
