The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or the most internal conditional statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is 2, `len(order)` is greater than or equal to 3, `temp` is updated with values from `order[i]` and `order[count]`, `temp[0][1]` has been appended to `lol`, and `temp[0][0]` has been appended to `lol`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
