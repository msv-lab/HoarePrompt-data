The code appends `temp[0][1]` to the list `lol`. The variable `temp` has an additional element which is `[order[i], order[count]]`. Therefore, `temp[0]` is `order[i]`, and `temp[1]` is `order[count]`. 

Since `temp[0]` is `order[i]`, `temp[0][1]` accesses the second element of `order[i]`. The output state will indicate that `lol` is updated with `order[i][1]`, but the values of `count` and `temp` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`count` is an integer less than `len(order) - 1`, `temp` has an additional element which is `[order[i], order[count]]`, and `lol` is updated with `temp[0][1]`**
