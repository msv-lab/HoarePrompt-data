The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is an integer less than `len(order) - 1`, `temp` has an additional element which is `[order[i], order[count]]`, `lol` is updated with `temp[0][1]`, and `lol` now contains `order[i]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
