Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `l` is a positive integer less than or equal to 10^18, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of strings from user input, `inp` is a list with at least 2 elements and `inp[1]` is a positive integer, `order` contains `a[0]`, `same` is an empty list, and `int(inp[0])` is at least equal to `count`. After executing the program fragment, `c` is reset to 0 and `count` is incremented by 1 if `c` equals `len(a) - 1`, otherwise `c` is incremented by 1 and `count` is still incremented by 1. Therefore, `count` will always increase by 1, and `c` will either wrap around to 0 or increment by 1, depending on its previous value.***
