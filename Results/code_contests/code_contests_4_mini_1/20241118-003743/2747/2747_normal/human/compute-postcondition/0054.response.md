Output State: **`count` is less than or equal to `int(inp[0])`, then `count` will be equal to `int(inp[0]) + 1` after the loop finishes; `c` will reset to 0 if it reached `len(a) - 1` or will be one more than its previous value otherwise; `count` remains 0; `c` remains unchanged; `int(inp[1])` is greater than `i + 1`; `order` is updated to include `a[c]`.**
