Postcondition: ***`count` is an integer that is increased by 1 and is equal to 2 after the execution of the program fragment. If `temp[0]` is in `same` or if `lol` is in `same`, `temp` and `lol` are both set to empty lists. Otherwise, if the length of `same` equals `int(inp[1])`, the loop is broken; if not, `temp[0]` is added to `same`, and both `temp` and `lol` are set to empty lists. In either case, `count` is incremented by 1. The program ensures that `temp` and `lol` are always empty at the end of the execution.***
