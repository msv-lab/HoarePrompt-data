The code appends `temp[0][0]` to the list `lol`. The value of `temp[0][0]` is unknown based on the provided initial state, but it does not affect other variables. Therefore, the output state will reflect the change made to `lol`. 

Output State: **`count` is equal to `len(order) - 1`, `lol` now contains the value of `temp[0][1]` and `temp[0][0]` has been appended to it.**
