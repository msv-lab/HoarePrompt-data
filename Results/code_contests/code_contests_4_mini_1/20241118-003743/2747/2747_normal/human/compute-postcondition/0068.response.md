Postcondition: ***`count` is an integer, initially equal to 1, and `int(inp[0])` is greater than or equal to 1. If `c` equals `len(a) - 1`, then `c` is reset to 0 and `count` is incremented to 2. Otherwise, `c` is incremented by 1 and `count` is also incremented to 2. In both cases, after the if-else block, `count` will be 2, and `c` will be either 0 or greater than 0, but less than `len(a)`.***
