Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `l` is a positive integer less than or equal to 10^18, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of strings from user input, `inp` is a list with at least 2 elements and `inp[1]` is a positive integer, `order` contains `a[0]`, `same` is an empty list, and `count` is increased by 1. If `c` was initially equal to `len(a) - 1`, then `c` is reset to 0. Otherwise, `c` is increased by 1 but remains less than `len(a) - 1.***
