The variable `lol` is assigned an empty list `[]`. The previous state of `lol` was that it contained `order[i]`, but now it has been reset to an empty list. The other variables `count` and `temp` are unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is `count` is an integer less than `len(order) - 1`, `temp` is an empty list, and `lol` is an empty list.

Output State: **`count` is an integer less than `len(order) - 1`, `temp` is an empty list, and `lol` is an empty list**
