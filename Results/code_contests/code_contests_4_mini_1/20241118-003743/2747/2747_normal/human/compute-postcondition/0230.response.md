Postcondition: ***`count` is an integer less than `len(order) - 1`. If the length of `same` equals `int(inp[1])`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, while `temp` contains an additional element `[order[i], order[count]]`, and `lol` is updated to include `order[i]`. If `len(same)` is not equal to `int(inp[1])`, no changes are made to the state, and the program continues executing.***
