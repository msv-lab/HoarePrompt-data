Output State: **`if count is less than or equal to len(order) - 1 then the loop executes, count will be incremented by 1 for each iteration until it reaches len(order). temp and lol will always be emptied after each iteration. If temp[0] or lol is in same, they will not be added to same. If the length of same equals int(inp[1]), the loop will break. If count starts at 0 and len(order) is greater than 0, count will eventually equal len(order). If len(order) is 0, the loop will not execute, and count will remain 0, with temp, lol, and same remaining unchanged.**
