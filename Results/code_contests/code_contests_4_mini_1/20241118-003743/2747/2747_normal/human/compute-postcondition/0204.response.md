The value of `count` is incremented by 1, and since its initial value is 0, after execution, `count` will be 1. The values of the other variables (`order`, `lol`, `same`, and `temp`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is 1, `order` is a list with at least one element, `lol` is [], `same` includes `temp[0]`, and `temp` is an empty list.

Output State: **`count` is 1, `order` is a list with at least one element, `lol` is [], `same` includes `temp[0]`, and `temp` is an empty list**
