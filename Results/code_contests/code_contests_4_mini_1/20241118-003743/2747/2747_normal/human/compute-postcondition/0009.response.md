The variable `c` is assigned the value `0`. Previously, `c` was calculated as `len(a) - 1`, but now it is explicitly set to `0`. This change updates the value of `c`, while the other variables remain unaffected. The output state reflects this change.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is a positive integer less than or equal to 10^18, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of strings from user input, `inp` is a list with at least 2 elements and `inp[1]` is a positive integer, `order` contains `a[0]`, `same` is an empty list, `c` is 0, and `count` is 0.**
