The code appends the second element of the first sublist in `temp` to `lol`. The previous value of `temp` indicates that it contains at least one element, specifically `temp[0]`, which is a list that includes two items (order[i] and order[count]). The value of `temp[0][1]` is determined by the specific contents of `temp`. The state of `count` remains unchanged at 0, and `lol` will now contain one element, which is the value of `temp[0][1]`. 

Output State: **`count` is 0, `temp` contains one new element [order[i], order[count]], `lol` contains one element temp[0][1], and `same` contains elements depending on whether `temp[0]` or `lol` was in `same.**
