Output State: **`if count is less than or equal to len(order) - 1 then count` will be the number of iterations completed, `temp` will be empty, `lol` will be empty, and `same` will contain the unique elements appended from `temp[0]` as long as they weren't already in `same`. If the loop breaks because `len(same)` equals `int(inp[1])`, then `same` will contain exactly `int(inp[1])` unique elements. If `count` starts at 0 and if `len(order)` is greater than or equal to 1, then the loop will execute at least once; otherwise, if `order` is empty, the loop won't execute and `count` remains 0, `temp` remains empty, `lol` remains empty, and `same` remains unchanged with fewer than `int(inp[1])` elements.**
