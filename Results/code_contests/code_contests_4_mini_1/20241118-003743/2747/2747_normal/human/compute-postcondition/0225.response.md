The code snippet initializes `temp` as an empty list. The previous state indicates that `temp` had an additional element which was `[order[i], order[count]]`. However, after the execution of `temp = []`, the contents of `temp` are cleared, and it no longer holds any values. 

Other variables such as `count`, `order`, and `lol` remain unaffected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects the changes specifically related to `temp`.

Output State: **`count` is an integer less than `len(order) - 1`, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` now contains `order[i]`**
