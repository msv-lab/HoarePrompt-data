The `pass` statement does not change any variable states. The variable `count` was already increased by 1, and the variables `temp` and `lol` remain empty. Therefore, the output state reflects the current state of the variables without any change from the `pass` statement.

Output State: **`count` is an integer less than `len(order) - 1`, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, and `count` is increased by 1**
