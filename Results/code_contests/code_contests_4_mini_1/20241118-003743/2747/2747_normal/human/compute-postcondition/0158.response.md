The variable `lol` is reassigned to an empty list, which overwrites its previous value (which contained the elements `order[1]` and `order[i]`). The other variables (`count` and `temp`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects that `lol` is now an empty list.

Output State: **`count` is 1, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list**
