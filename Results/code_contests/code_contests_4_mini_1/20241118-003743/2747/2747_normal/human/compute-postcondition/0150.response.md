The variable `lol` is reassigned to an empty list `[]`. The previous value of `lol` which contained two elements is now lost. The values of `count`, `temp`, and `same` remain unchanged since they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is 0, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, and `same` includes `temp[0]`.

Output State: **`count` is 0, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, and `same` includes `temp[0]**
