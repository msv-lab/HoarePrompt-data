Postcondition: ***`count` is equal to `len(order) - 1`, `lol` contains the value of `temp[0][1]` with `temp[0][0]` appended to it. If the length of `same` equals `int(inp[1])`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, the program continues execution without breaking, maintaining the values of `count` and `lol`.***
