The code `lol.append(temp[0][0])` appends the first element of the first sublist in `temp` to the list `lol`. 

Given that `temp` contains one element, which is a list of `order[i]` and `order[1]`, `temp[0][0]` refers to the first element of that list, which is `order[i]`. The value of `lol` before the operation is `order[1]`, and after executing the append operation, it will now also include `order[i]`.

The output state will therefore reflect the new contents of `lol`.

Output State: **`count` is 1, `temp` contains one element: a list of `order[i]` and `order[1]`, `lol` contains the elements `order[1]` and `order[i]`**
