The code appends the value of `temp[0][1]` to the list `lol`. The value of `temp` is not provided, but it is assumed that `temp` is a list containing at least one element, which itself is a list (given that `temp[0]` is accessed). The state of `count` is not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, we can describe the output state based on the previous context provided.

Output State: **`count` is equal to `len(order) - 1`, and `lol` now contains the value of `temp[0][1]` appended to it.**
