The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is `len(order) - 1`, so the new value of `count` will be `len(order)`. The states of `lol` and `temp` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `count` is equal to `len(order)`, `lol` is an empty list, `temp` is an empty list.

Output State: **`count` is equal to `len(order)`, `lol` is an empty list, `temp` is an empty list**
