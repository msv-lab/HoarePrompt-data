The value of `count` is incremented by 1; it was initially 1, so after execution, `count` becomes 2. The variable `c` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `count` is 2, `c` is increased by 1 (but its specific value is unknown).

Output State: **`count` is 2, `c` is increased by 1**
