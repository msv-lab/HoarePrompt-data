The code appends `temp[0][0]` to the list `lol`. The value of `temp[0][0]` is `order[0]`, which is the first element of the list `order`. Thus, `lol` will have the first element of `order` added to it. The initial state indicates that `lol` already contains `[order[0]]`, and after the operation, it will have two instances of `order[0]`. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`count` is 0, `c` is in the range from 0 to `len(order) - 1`, `order` has at least 1 element, `temp` contains [[order[0], order[0]]], and `lol` contains [order[0], order[0]]**
