Postcondition: ***`count` is 0, `temp` contains one new element [order[i], order[count]], `lol` contains two elements including temp[0][1] and temp[0][0], and `same` does not include `temp[0]` or `lol`. If the length of `same` is equal to the integer value of `inp[1]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, the program continues execution without breaking.***
