The variable `temp` is initialized as an empty list. This does not affect the previous values of `count` or `same`, which remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `count` is an integer less than `len(order) - 1`, `same` is updated to include `order[i]`, and `temp` is an empty list.

Output State: **`count` is an integer less than `len(order) - 1`, `same` is updated to include `order[i]`, and `temp` is an empty list**.
