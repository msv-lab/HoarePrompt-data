The variable `lol` is assigned an empty list, which means it will no longer contain the previous elements `order[1]` and `order[i]`. The other variables `count`, `temp`, and `same` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is 1, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, and `same` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`count` is 1, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, and `same` remains unchanged**
