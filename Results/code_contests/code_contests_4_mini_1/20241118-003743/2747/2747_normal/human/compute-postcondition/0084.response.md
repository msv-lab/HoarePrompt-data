The code appends `temp[0][1]` to the list `lol`. Since `temp` contains `[[order[0], order[0]]]`, `temp[0][1]` will be equal to `order[0]`. The variable `count` remains unchanged at 0, `c` is still within its range, and `order` still has at least one element. The list `lol` is updated to include the element `order[0]`.

Output State: **`count` is 0, `c` is in the range from 0 to `len(order) - 1`, `order` has at least 1 element, `temp` contains [[order[0], order[0]]], and `lol` contains [order[0]]**
