The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is 1, so after execution, `count` becomes 2. The state of the variable `c` remains unchanged as the code does not directly affect it. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is 2, `c` is increased by 1 (but its current value is not specified).

Output State: **`count` is 2, `c` is increased by 1**
