The variable `lol` is assigned an empty list (`[]`). The previous value of `lol`, which contained the value of `temp[0][1]` and `temp[0][0]` appended to it, is overwritten. The other variables, `count` and `temp`, remain unchanged, with `temp` being an empty list. Therefore, the output state is: `count` is equal to `len(order) - 1`, `lol` is an empty list, and `temp` is an empty list.

Output State: **`count` is equal to `len(order) - 1`, `lol` is an empty list, `temp` is an empty list**
