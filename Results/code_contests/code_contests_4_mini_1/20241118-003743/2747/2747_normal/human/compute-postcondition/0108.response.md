The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is equal to `len(order) - 1`, `lol` now contains the value of `temp[0][1]` and `temp[0][0]` has been appended to it, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
