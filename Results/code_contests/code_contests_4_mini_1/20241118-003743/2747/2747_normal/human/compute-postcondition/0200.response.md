Postcondition: ***`count` is 0, `order` is a list with at least one element, `lol` has a new element appended from `temp`, neither `temp[0]` is in `same` nor `lol` is in `same`. If the length of `same` is equal to the integer value of `inp[1]`, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop; otherwise, the program continues without breaking.***
