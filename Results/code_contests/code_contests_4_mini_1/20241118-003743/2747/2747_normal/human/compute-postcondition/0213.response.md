The `pass` statement does not change the value of any variables or modify the state of the program. The values of `count`, `temp`, and `lol` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `count` is now incremented by 1, `temp` is [], `lol` is [] and no changes occur due to `pass`.

Output State: **`count` is now incremented by 1, `temp` is [], `lol` is [] and no changes occur due to `pass`.**
