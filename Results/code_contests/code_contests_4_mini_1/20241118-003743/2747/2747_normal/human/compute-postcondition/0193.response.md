The code `temp = []` assigns an empty list to the variable `temp`. The previous values of the affected variables are `count` is 0, `order` is a list with at least one element, `lol` has a new element appended from `temp`, and either the first element of `temp` is in `same` or `lol` is in `same`. The assignment of an empty list to `temp` does not affect these other variables.

Output State: **`count` is 0, `order` is a list with at least one element, `lol` has a new element appended from `temp`, and either the first element of `temp` is in `same` or `lol` is in `same; temp is an empty list**
