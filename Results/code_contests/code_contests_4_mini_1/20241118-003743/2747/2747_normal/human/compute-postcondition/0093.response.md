The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is 0, `c` is in the range from 0 to `len(order) - 1`, `order` has at least 1 element, `temp` contains [[order[0], order[0]]], `lol` contains [order[0], order[0]], the pair `temp[0]` is not in `same`, `lol` is not in `same`, and the length of `same` is equal to the integer value of `inp[1]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
