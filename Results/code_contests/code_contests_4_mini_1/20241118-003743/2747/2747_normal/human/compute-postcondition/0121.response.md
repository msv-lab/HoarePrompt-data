The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is `len(order) - 1`, so after execution, `count` becomes `len(order)`. The states of the other variables (`lol` and `temp`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is now `len(order)`, `lol` is an empty list, `temp` is an empty list.

Output State: **`count` is now `len(order)`, `lol` is an empty list, `temp` is an empty list**
