Postcondition: ***If the length of `same` is equal to the integer value of `inp[1]`, then the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Additionally, `count` is 2, `len(order)` is greater than or equal to 3, `temp` is updated with values from `order[i]` and `order[count]`, and both `temp[0][1]` and `temp[0][0]` have been appended to `lol`.***
