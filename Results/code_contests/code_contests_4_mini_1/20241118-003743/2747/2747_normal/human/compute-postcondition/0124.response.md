Postcondition: ***`count` is equal to `len(order) - 1`, `lol` contains the last element of `order` plus `temp[0][0]`, and `temp` contains the tuple `[order[i], order[count]]`. If the length of `same` is equal to `int(inp[1])`, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise, the program continues without breaking.***
