Postcondition: ***`count` is 1 and remains less than or equal to `int(inp[0])`. `int(inp[1])` is greater than `i`, which is `n`. The element `a[c]` is appended to `order`. If `c` was equal to `len(a) - 1`, then `c` is reset to 0 after incrementing `count`. Otherwise, `c` is incremented by 1 while `count` is still incremented by 1.***
