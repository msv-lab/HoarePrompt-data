The code appends a list containing two elements to the `temp` list. The first element is `order[i]` and the second element is `order[count]`. Since `count` is an integer and is less than `len(order) - 1`, it indicates that both `i` and `count` are valid indices for the `order` list. The state of the other variables is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `count` is an integer less than `len(order) - 1, `temp` has an additional element which is `[order[i], order[count]]`.

Output State: **`count` is an integer less than `len(order) - 1, `temp` has an additional element which is `[order[i], order[count]]`**
