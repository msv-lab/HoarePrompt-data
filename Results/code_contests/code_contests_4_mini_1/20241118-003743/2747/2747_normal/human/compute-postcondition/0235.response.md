Postcondition: ***`count` is an integer less than `len(order) - 1`. If `temp[0]` is in `same` or `lol` is in `same`, `temp` and `lol` are both reset to empty lists, and `count` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if the length of `same` equals `int(inp[1])`, the loop breaks; if not, `temp[0]` is appended to `same`, `temp` and `lol` are reset to empty lists, and `count` is incremented by 1.***
