The variable `c` is assigned the value `0`. The other variables, `count` and `int(inp[0])`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `count` is 1, `int(inp[0])` is greater than or equal to 1, and `c` is 0.

Output State: **`count` is 1, `int(inp[0])` is greater than or equal to 1, and `c` is 0**
