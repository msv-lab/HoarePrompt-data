The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `count` is equal to `len(order) - 1`, `lol` contains the last element of `order` plus `temp[0][0]`, `temp` contains the tuple `[order[i], order[count]]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
