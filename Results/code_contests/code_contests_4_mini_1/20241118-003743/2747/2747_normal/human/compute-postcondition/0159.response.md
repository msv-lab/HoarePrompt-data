The value of `count` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The states of `temp` and `lol` remain unaffected as they are empty lists. Therefore, the output state is: `count` is 2, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list.

Output State: **`count` is 2, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list**
