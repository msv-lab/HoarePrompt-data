The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is `len(order) - 1`. Therefore, after execution, `count` becomes `len(order)`. The states of the other variables (`lol` and `temp`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`count` is `len(order)`, `lol` is an empty list, `same` has `temp[0]` appended to it, and `temp` is an empty list**
