Postcondition: ***`count` is an integer equal to 3, `len(order)` is greater than or equal to 3. If `temp[0]` or `lol` is in `same`, both `temp` and `lol` are reset to empty lists, and `count` is incremented by 1. If neither is in `same` and the length of `same` equals `int(inp[1])`, the loop breaks; otherwise, `temp[0]` is appended to `same`, and both `temp` and `lol` are reset to empty lists while `count` is incremented by 1.***
