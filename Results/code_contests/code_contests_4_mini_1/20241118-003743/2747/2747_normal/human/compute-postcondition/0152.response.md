Postcondition: ***`count` is incremented by 1 and set to 1, `temp` is an empty list, and `lol` is an empty list. If either `temp[0]` or `lol` is found in `same`, those elements are not added to `same`. If `same` contains a number of elements equal to `int(inp[1])`, the loop breaks; otherwise, `temp[0]` is appended to `same`.***
