The `temp.append([order[i], order[count]])` line of code adds a new list containing the elements `order[i]` and `order[count]` to the `temp` list. The value of `count` is previously defined as `len(order) - 1`. This means `count` refers to the last index of the `order` list.

The state of `order` is not provided, so we cannot determine specific values for `order[i]` or `order[count]`. However, we can conclude that if `i` is a valid index in `order`, then `order[count]` will always be the last element of `order`.

Therefore, the output state indicates that a new list containing `order[i]` and the last element of `order` has been appended to `temp`.

Output State: **`count` is equal to `len(order) - 1`, and a new list containing `order[i]` and `order[count]` has been appended to `temp`**
