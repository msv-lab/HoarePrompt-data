The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is less than `len(order) - 1`, `temp` is updated to include a new list consisting of `order[i]` and `order[count]`, `temp[0][1]` is appended to `lol`; `lol` now includes `temp[0][0]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
