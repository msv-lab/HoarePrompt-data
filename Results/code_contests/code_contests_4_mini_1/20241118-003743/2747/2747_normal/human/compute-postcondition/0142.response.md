The value of `count` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. The other variables `temp` and `lol` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is 1, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, and either `temp[0]` or `lol` is present in `same`.

Output State: **`count` is 1, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, and either `temp[0]` or `lol` is present in `same`**
