The code appends the second element of the first sublist in `temp` to the list `lol`. Given that `temp` contains one element which is a list of `order[i]` and `order[1]`, `temp[0][1]` refers to the value of `order[1]`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of `count`, `temp`, and the updated state of `lol`.

Output State: **`count` is 1, `temp` contains one element: a list of `order[i]` and `order[1]`, `lol` contains the element `order[1]`**
