The code initializes `temp` as an empty list. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed directly by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the new state of `temp`, while `count`, `lol`, and `same` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`count` is 1, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` contains the elements `order[1]` and `order[i]`, and `same` remains unchanged.**
