The code appends the second element (index 1) of the first tuple in the `temp` list to the `lol` list. The variable `temp` contains the tuple `[order[i], order[count]]`, where `order[i]` is the first element and `order[count]` is the second. The value of `temp[0][1]` is `order[count]`. 

Since `count` is equal to `len(order) - 1`, `order[count]` refers to the last element of the `order` list. Since `lol` is currently an empty list, after executing the code, `lol` will contain the last element of `order`.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated values of the variables:

Output State: **`count` is equal to `len(order) - 1`, `lol` contains the last element of `order`, `temp` contains the tuple `[order[i], order[count]]`**.
