The variable `temp` is initialized as an empty list. The initial values of `count` and `c` are not affected by this operation, and the state of the `order` variable remains unchanged as well. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is now 0, `c` is in the range from 0 to `len(order) - 1`, `order` has at least 1 element, and `temp` is an empty list.

Output State: **`count` is now 0, `c` is in the range from 0 to `len(order) - 1`, `order` has at least 1 element, and `temp` is an empty list**
