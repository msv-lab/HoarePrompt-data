The value of `count` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. The states of the other variables (`order`, `lol`, and `temp`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `count` is 1, `order` is a list with at least one element, `lol` is an empty list, and `temp` is an empty list.

Output State: **`count` is 1, `order` is a list with at least one element, `lol` is an empty list, and `temp` is an empty list**
