Postcondition: ***`count` is incremented by 1. If `temp[0]` is in `same` or `lol` is in `same`, then `temp` and `lol` are empty lists, and no changes occur due to the pass statement. If neither condition is true and the length of `same` equals `int(inp[1])`, the loop breaks. Otherwise, `temp[0]` is appended to `same`, and both `temp` and `lol` are reset to empty lists. In all cases, `c` is within the range from 0 to `len(order) - 1`, and `order` contains at least one element.***
