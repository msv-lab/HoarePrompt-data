Output State: **`if count is less than or equal to len(order) - 1, then count` is equal to `len(order)`, `temp` and `lol` are empty lists, and `same` contains elements depending on whether `temp[0]` or `lol` was in `same`. If `temp[0]` is in `same` or `lol` is in `same`, then `temp` and `lol` are reset to empty lists, and `count` is incremented. If neither condition is true and the length of `same` equals `int(inp[1])`, the loop breaks, otherwise `temp[0]` is appended to `same` and both `temp` and `lol` are reset. If `count` starts greater than `len(order) - 1`, the loop does not execute, leaving `count` at its initial value of 0, and both `temp` and `lol` remain empty.**
