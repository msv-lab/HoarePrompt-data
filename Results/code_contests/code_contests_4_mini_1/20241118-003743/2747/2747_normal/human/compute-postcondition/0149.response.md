The code assigns an empty list to `temp`, which means that `temp` is now `[]`. The previous values of other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `count` is 0, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` contains two elements including `temp[0][1]` and `temp[0][0]`, `same` includes `temp[0]`, and we continue execution without breaking.

Output State: **`count` is 0, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` contains two elements including `temp[0][1]` and `temp[0][0]`, `same` includes `temp[0]`, and we continue execution without breaking.**
