Postcondition: ***`count` is equal to `len(order)`, `lol` is an empty list, and `temp` is an empty list. If `temp[0]` or `lol` is in `same`, then `same` remains unchanged and the `count` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if the length of `same` is equal to `int(inp[1])`, the loop breaks; if not, `temp[0]` is appended to `same`, and `count` is incremented by 1.***
