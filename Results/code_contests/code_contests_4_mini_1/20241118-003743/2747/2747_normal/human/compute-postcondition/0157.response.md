The code initializes `temp` as an empty list, which means it clears any previous contents it might have had. Since `temp` is now empty, and the other variables (`count`, `lol`) remain unaffected, the output state reflects the current state of these variables.

Output State: **`count` is 1, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` contains the elements `order[1]` and `order[i]`**
