The variable `lol` is assigned an empty list `[]`, replacing its previous value. The initial state of `count`, `temp`, and `same` remains unchanged, as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `count` is 0, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, and either `temp[0]` or `lol` is present in `same`.

Output State: **`count` is 0, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, and either `temp[0]` or `lol` is present in `same`**.
