The value of `count` is incremented by 1, starting from a value of 2. Therefore, after execution, `count` becomes 3. The values of `c` and `int(inp[0])` are not affected. Hence, the output state is: `count` is 3, `int(inp[0])` is greater than or equal to 2, `c` is 0.

Output State: **`count` is 3, `int(inp[0])` is greater than or equal to 2, `c` is 0**
