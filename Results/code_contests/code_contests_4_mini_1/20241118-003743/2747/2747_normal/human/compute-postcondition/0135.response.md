The value of `lol` is assigned an empty list. The previous state of `count`, `temp`, and `same` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `count` is 0, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, and `same` contains elements depending on whether `temp[0]` or `lol` was in `same`.

Output State: **`count` is 0, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, and `same` contains elements depending on whether `temp[0]` or `lol` was in `same.**
