The code appends `temp[0][0]` to the list `lol`. Since `temp` contains one new element, `temp[0][0]` will be the first element of that new element, and `lol` will grow by one element.

The previous state indicates that `lol` already contains one element. After appending, `lol` will contain two elements: its original element and the new element `temp[0][0]`.

The state of the other variables (`count`, `temp`, and `same`) remains unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`count` is 0, `temp` contains one new element [order[i], order[count]], `lol` contains two elements including temp[0][1] and temp[0][0], and `same` contains elements depending on whether `temp[0]` or `lol` was in `same.**
