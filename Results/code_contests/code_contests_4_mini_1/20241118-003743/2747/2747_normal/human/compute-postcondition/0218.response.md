The variable `lol` is assigned an empty list `[]`. This assignment does not affect the previous values of the other variables, which remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `count` is less than `len(order) - 1`, `temp` is [], `lol` includes `temp[0][0]`, and the length of `same` is appended with `temp[0]`, and `lol` is now an empty list.

Output State: **`count` is less than `len(order) - 1`, `temp` is [], `lol` includes `temp[0][0]`, the length of `same` is appended with `temp[0]`, and `lol` is []**
