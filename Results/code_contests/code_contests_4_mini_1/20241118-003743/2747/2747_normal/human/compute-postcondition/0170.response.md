The line of code `lol.append(temp[0][1])` appends the value of `temp[0][1]` to the list `lol`. The initial state mentions that `temp` is updated with values from `order[i]` and `order[count]`, but the actual contents of `temp` are not specified. However, since `count` is 2, `temp[0][1]` refers to the first element of `temp` at index 0 and the second element of that sub-array. 

The states of other variables, `count`, `len(order)`, and `temp`, are not directly altered by this operation, but the value appended to `lol` will depend on the current value of `temp[0][1]`. Since the specific value of `temp[0][1]` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact output. 

Therefore, the output state reflects that the value has been appended to `lol`, but we cannot specify the exact value.

Output State: **`count` is 2, `len(order)` is greater than or equal to 3, `temp` is updated with values from `order[i]` and `order[count]`, and the value of `temp[0][1]` has been appended to `lol`**.
