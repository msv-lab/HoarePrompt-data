The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is 1, so after execution, `count` becomes 2. The states of `temp`, `lol`, and `same` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is 2, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, and `same` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`count` is 2, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, and `same` remains unchanged**
