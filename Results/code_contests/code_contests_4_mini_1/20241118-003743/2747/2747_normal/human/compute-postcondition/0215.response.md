Postcondition: ***`count` is less than `len(order) - 1`, `temp` is updated to include a new list consisting of `order[i]` and `order[count]`, and `temp[0][1]` is appended to `lol`; `lol` now includes `temp[0][0]`, and if the length of `same` is equal to `int(inp[1])`, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the length of `same` is not equal to `int(inp[1])`, the program continues without any changes to the lists or variables.***
