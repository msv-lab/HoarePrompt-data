The variable `temp` is assigned an empty list, which does not change its previous state since it was already an empty list. The other variables `count`, `lol`, and `same` remain unaffected as their values are dependent on conditions related to `temp` or `lol`. Therefore, the output state is: `count` is 0, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, `same` contains elements depending on whether `temp[0]` or `lol` was in `same`.

Output State: **`count` is 0, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, `same` contains elements depending on whether `temp[0]` or `lol` was in `same**
