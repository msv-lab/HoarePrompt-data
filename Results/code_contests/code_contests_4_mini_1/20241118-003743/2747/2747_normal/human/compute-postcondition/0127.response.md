The variable `lol` is assigned an empty list `[]`. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed by this assignment, so the states of `count`, `temp`, and `same` remain as they were. Therefore, the output state is: `count` is equal to `len(order) - 1`, `lol` is an empty list, `temp` contains the tuple `[order[i], order[count]]`, and `same` now includes `temp[0]`; `temp` is now an empty list.

Output State: **`count` is equal to `len(order) - 1`, `lol` is an empty list, `temp` contains the tuple `[order[i], order[count]]`, and `same` now includes `temp[0]`; `temp` is now an empty list.**
