Postcondition: ***`count` is 1, `temp` contains one element: a list of `order[i]` and `order[1]`, and `lol` contains the elements `order[1]` and `order[i]`. If the length of `same` is equal to `int(inp[1])`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. There are no conditions regarding the state of `same` or `inp[1]` in the else case, as there is no else part. Hence, if the condition is not met, the program continues executing without breaking.***
