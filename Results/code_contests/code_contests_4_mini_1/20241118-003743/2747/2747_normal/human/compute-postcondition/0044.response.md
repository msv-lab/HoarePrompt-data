Postcondition: ***`count` is an integer initially set to 1 and remains less than or equal to `int(inp[0])`. If `c` is equal to `len(a) - 1`, then `c` is reset to 0 and `count` is incremented to 2. If `c` is not equal to `len(a) - 1`, then `c` is increased by 1 and `count` is also incremented to 2. In both cases, after the execution, `count` will be 2, and `c` will either be 0 or one more than its previous value, ensuring that `c` does not exceed `len(a) - 1`.***
