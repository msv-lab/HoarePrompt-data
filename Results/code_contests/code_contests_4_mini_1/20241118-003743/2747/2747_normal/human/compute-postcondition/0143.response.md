The `pass` statement does not change any variable values or states; it is a no-operation statement. Therefore, the values of `count`, `temp`, and `lol` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`count` is 1, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list, and either `temp[0]` or `lol` is present in `same`**.
