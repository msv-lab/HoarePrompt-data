The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is 1, `temp` contains one element: a list of `order[i]` and `order[1]`, `lol` contains the elements `order[1]` and `order[i]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
