The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `count` is 0, `same` is a list with a length equal to `int(inp[1]}`, `order` has at least 2 elements, `temp` contains at least one list with `order[i]` and `order[0]`, `lol` contains `temp[0][1]` and `temp[0][0]`, and neither `temp[0]` is in `same` nor `lol` is in `same`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
