The variable `temp` is initialized as an empty list. This does not affect the previous values of `lol`, `count`, or `same`. Therefore, the output state will include the new value of `temp` and mention that the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`lol` contains two elements, `count` is equal to `len(order)`, `same` is augmented by appending `temp[0]`, and `temp` is an empty list**.
