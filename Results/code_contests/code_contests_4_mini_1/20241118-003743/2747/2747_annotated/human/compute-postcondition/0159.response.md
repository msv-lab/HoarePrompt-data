The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is `len(order) - 1`, so after execution, `count` becomes `len(order)`. The states of the other variables, `temp` and `lol`, are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is equal to `len(order)`, `temp` is an empty list, and `lol` is now an empty list.

Output State: **`count` is equal to `len(order)`, `temp` is an empty list, and `lol` is now an empty list**
