The variable `lol` is assigned an empty list. This assignment does not change the values of the previously defined variables `count`, `same`, `order`, and `temp`. Therefore, the output state remains based on their initial values. 

Output State: **`count` is 0, `same` is empty, `order` has at least 2 elements, `temp` is an empty list, and `lol` is an empty list**.
