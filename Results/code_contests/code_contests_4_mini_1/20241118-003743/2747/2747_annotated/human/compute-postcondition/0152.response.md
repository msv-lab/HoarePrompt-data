Postcondition: ***`count` is incremented by 1. If `temp[0]` or `lol` is in `same`, then `temp` and `lol` are set to empty lists and `same` remains unchanged. If neither are in `same` and the length of `same` is equal to `int(inp[1])`, the loop breaks; otherwise, `temp[0]` is appended to `same`, `temp` and `lol` are set to empty lists, and `count` is incremented by 1, resulting in `same` having a length of `int(inp[1]) + 1`. The variable `order` contains at least 2 elements, `temp` is empty, and `lol` is empty in both scenarios.***
