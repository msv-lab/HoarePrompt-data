The variable `lol` is assigned an empty list. The previous state of `lol` is that it had been updated by appending `temp[0][0]`, but since `temp` is an empty list, `temp[0][0]` would not be defined. The other variable `count` remains unchanged as it is equal to `len(order)`, and `temp` is still an empty list. 

Thus, after the execution, `lol` is now an empty list, and the previous values of `count` and `temp` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`lol` is an empty list, `count` is equal to len(order), `temp` is an empty list**
