Postcondition: ***`count` is equal to `len(order) - 1`; `temp` is updated to include `[order[i], order[count]]`; `lol` now includes `temp[0][1]`, and `lol` is updated to append `temp[0][0]`. If the length of `same` is equal to `int(inp[1])`, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. This implies that the condition is met, and the program exits the loop at that point, while maintaining the updates made to `temp` and `lol`.***
