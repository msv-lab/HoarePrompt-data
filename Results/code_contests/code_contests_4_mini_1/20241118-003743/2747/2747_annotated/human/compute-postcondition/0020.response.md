Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `l` is a positive integer less than or equal to 10^18, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of strings from user input, `inp` is a list of strings from user input with `inp[1]` as a positive integer string, `order` contains the first element of `a`, `same` is an empty list, and `count` is incremented by 1. If `c` was equal to the length of `a` minus 1, then `c` is reset to 0. Otherwise, `c` is incremented by 1, and `i` remains 0.***
