The variable `temp` is initialized as an empty list. The previous values of the affected variables (`lol` and `count`) remain unchanged as the initialization does not affect them. Therefore, the output state is: `lol` now contains two elements, `count` is equal to len(order), and `temp` is an empty list.

Output State: **`lol` now contains two elements, `count` is equal to len(order), and `temp` is an empty list**
