The variable `temp` is assigned an empty list `[]`. The other variables `count`, `same`, and `order` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `count` is 0, `same` is empty, `order` has at least 2 elements, and `temp` is an empty list.

Output State: **`count` is 0, `same` is empty, `order` has at least 2 elements, and `temp` is an empty list**
