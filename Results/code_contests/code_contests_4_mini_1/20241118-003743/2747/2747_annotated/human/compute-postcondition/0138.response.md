The code `lol.append(temp[0][0])` appends the value of `temp[0][0]` to the list `lol`. The state of `temp` contains at least one list where `temp[0]` has at least 2 elements, so `temp[0][0]` is a valid element that can be appended. The variable `lol` initially contains `temp[0][1]`, and after the execution, it will contain an additional element which is `temp[0][0]`.

Therefore, the output state is: `count` is 0, `same` is empty, `order` has at least 2 elements, `temp` contains at least one list with `order[i]` and `order[0]`, `lol` contains `temp[0][1]` and now also `temp[0][0]`.

Output State: **`count` is 0, `same` is empty, `order` has at least 2 elements, `temp` contains at least one list with `order[i]` and `order[0]`, `lol` contains `temp[0][1]` and `temp[0][0]`**
