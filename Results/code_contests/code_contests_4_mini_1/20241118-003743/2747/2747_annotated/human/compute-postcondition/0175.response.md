The `pass` statement is a no-operation statement in Python, which means it does nothing and is often used as a placeholder. The values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `count` is equal to `len(order)`, `temp` is an empty list `[]`, `lol` is an empty list `[]`.

Output State: **`count` is equal to `len(order)`, `temp` is an empty list `[]`, `lol` is an empty list `[]`**
