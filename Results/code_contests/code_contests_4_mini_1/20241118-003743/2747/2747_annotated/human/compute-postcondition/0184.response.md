Output State: **`if count is less than or equal to len(order) - 1, then the loop executes until either count equals len(order), or len(same) equals int(inp[1]). If count reaches len(order) then the loop exits and `same` contains unique pairs from `order`, and `count` is equal to len(order). If count was less than or equal to len(order) - 1 and len(same) equals int(inp[1]), then the loop breaks with `same` containing at most int(inp[1]) pairs, and `count` is incremented accordingly. If `count` is initially greater than len(order) - 1, the loop does not execute, and `same` remains empty, `temp` is empty, `lol` is empty, and `count` is 0. Additionally, if `temp[0]` or `lol` is in `same` during any iteration, `temp` and `lol` will be reset to empty lists.**
