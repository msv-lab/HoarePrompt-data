The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is equal to `len(order)`, but the specific value of `len(order)` is not provided. Therefore, the output state reflects the increment of `count` without affecting the other variables. 

Output State: **`lol` is an empty list, `count` is equal to `len(order) + 1`, `same` is augmented by appending `temp[0]`, and `temp` is an empty list**
