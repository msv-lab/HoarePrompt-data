The `pass` statement is a no-operation statement in Python, which means it does not change the state of any variables or affect the program's flow. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged. The output state indicates that `count` is equal to `len(order)`, `temp` is an empty list, and `lol` is also an empty list.

Output State: **`count` is equal to `len(order)`, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list**
