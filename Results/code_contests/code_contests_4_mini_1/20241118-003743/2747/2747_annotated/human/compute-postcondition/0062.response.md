Postcondition: ***`count` is 1 after the execution of the program fragment. If `c` was equal to `len(a) - 1`, then `c` is reset to 0 and `order` has the value `a[0]` appended to it. Otherwise, `c` is incremented by 1, and `order` has the value `a[c]` appended to it, where `c` is now between 1 and `len(a) - 1`. In both cases, `inp[1]` remains greater than or equal to 1, and the precondition that `c` is unchanged before execution and `order` had the value `a[c]` appended to it holds true.***
