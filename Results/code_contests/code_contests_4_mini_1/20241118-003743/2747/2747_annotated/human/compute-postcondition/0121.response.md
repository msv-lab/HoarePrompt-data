The value of `count` is incremented by 1. Since `count` was previously equal to `len(order) - 1`, the new value of `count` will be `len(order)`. The values of `order`, `i`, `temp`, and `lol` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `order` is a non-empty list, `i` is 0, `count` is equal to `len(order)`, `temp` is an empty list, and `lol` is an empty list.

Output State: **`order` is a non-empty list, `i` is 0, `count` is equal to `len(order)`, `temp` is an empty list, `lol` is an empty list**
