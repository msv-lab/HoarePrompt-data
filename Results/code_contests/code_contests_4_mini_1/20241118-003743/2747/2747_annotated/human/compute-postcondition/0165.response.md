The variable `lol` is assigned an empty list `[]`. The previous values of the affected variables are `count` (which is equal to `len(order) - 1`), `temp` (which is an empty list `[]`), and `same` (which is updated to include `temp[0]`). Since `lol` is now an empty list, the states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `count` is equal to `len(order) - 1`, `temp` is an empty list [], `lol` is an empty list [], and `same` is updated to include `temp[0]`.

Output State: **`count` is equal to `len(order) - 1`, `temp` is an empty list [], `lol` is an empty list [], and `same` is updated to include `temp[0]`**
