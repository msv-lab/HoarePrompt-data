The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `order` is a non-empty list, `i` is 0, `inp[1]` is greater than 0, `count` is equal to `len(order) - 1`, `temp` contains [order[0], order[len(order) - 1]], and `lol` includes `temp[0][1]` and `temp[0][0]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
