The `temp` list is being appended with a new element, which is a list containing two elements: `order[i]` and `order[count]`. The value of `count` is equal to `len(order)`, which indicates that `count` holds the length of the `order` list. 

However, since `lol` is an empty list, the state of `temp` is not known, and the values of `order[i]` and `order[count]` depend on the specific values in the `order` list, which are not provided. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact values that will be appended to `temp`.

The output state, therefore, will describe the changes without specific values for `order[i]` and `order[count]`.

Output State: **`lol` is an empty list; `count` is equal to len(order); `temp` is appended with [order[i], order[count]]**
