The code assigns an empty list to `lol`. The previous value of `lol` was already an empty list, so it remains unchanged. The initial state of `temp` is also empty, and the condition regarding the elements of `temp` or `lol` being in `same` does not affect the output state directly since no operations are performed on those variables. Therefore, the output state reflects that `lol` is still an empty list.

Output State: **`lol` is an empty list, `temp` is an empty list**
