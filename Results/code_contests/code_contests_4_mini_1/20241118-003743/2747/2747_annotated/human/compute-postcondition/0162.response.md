Postcondition: ***`count` is equal to `len(order) - 1`, `temp` includes [order[i], order[len(order) - 1]], `lol` includes `temp[0][1]` and is updated to include `temp[0][0]`. If the length of `same` is equal to `int(inp[1])`, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the lengths are not equal, the program continues executing without breaking.***
