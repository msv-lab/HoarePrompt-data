The code snippet `temp = []` assigns an empty list to the variable `temp`, which results in the previous contents of `temp` being discarded. Other variables remain unaffected and retain their previous values. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `temp`.

Output State: **`order` is a non-empty list, `i` is 0, `inp[1]` is greater than 0, `count` is equal to `len(order) - 1`, `temp` is [], and `lol` now includes `temp[0][1]` and `temp[0][0]**
