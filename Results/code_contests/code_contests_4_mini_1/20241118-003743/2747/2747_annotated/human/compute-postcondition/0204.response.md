The value of `count` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `count` is unknown, as it is not provided in the initial state. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `lol` is an empty list, `same` contains `temp[0]` (but `temp` is empty, so this is problematic), and `count` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`lol` is an empty list, `same` contains `temp[0]` (but `temp` is empty), and `count` is increased by 1**
