Postcondition: ***`order` is a non-empty list, `i` is 0, `count` is equal to len(order) - 1, `temp` includes [order[0], order[len(order) - 1]], and `lol` now includes both temp[0][1] and temp[0][0]. If the length of `same` is equal to the integer value of inp[1], then the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, the loop continues processing without any changes made to the variables.***
