According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the length of the `order` list, which determines how many iterations the loop will perform. For the loop to execute, `order` must contain at least one element, meaning its length must be greater than 0.

1. If `inp[1]` is less than or equal to 0 or if `inp[0]` is less than 0, then `order` is an empty list, and the loop will not execute.
2. If `inp[1]` is greater than 0 and `inp[0]` is 0, `order` will contain the first element of `a` repeated `inp[1]` times, thus having a length of `inp[1]`, which is greater than 0.
3. If `inp[1]` is greater than 0 and `inp[0]` is greater than or equal to 1, `order` will contain elements from `a` indexed cyclically, ensuring that its length is also greater than 0.

To ensure that the loop can execute, `inp[1]` must be greater than 0. 

Therefore, the necessary states to adjust are:
- `inp[1]` must be greater than 0 to ensure that `order` is not empty.
- The initial value of `i` should be 0, as the loop starts iterating from the first index.

State: **`order` is a non-empty list, `i` is 0, `inp[1]` is greater than 0**
