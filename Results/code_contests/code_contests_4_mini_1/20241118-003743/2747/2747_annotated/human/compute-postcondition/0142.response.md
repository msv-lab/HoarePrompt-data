The value of `count` is incremented by 1, changing it from 0 to 1. The values of the other variables (`same`, `order`, `temp`, and `lol`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `count` is 1, `same` is empty, `order` has at least 2 elements, `temp` is [], and `lol` is an empty list.

Output State: **`count` is 1, `same` is empty, `order` has at least 2 elements, `temp` is [], and `lol` is an empty list**
