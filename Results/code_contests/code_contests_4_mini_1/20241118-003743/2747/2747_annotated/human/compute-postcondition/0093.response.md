The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `order` is a non-empty list, `i` is 0, `inp[1]` is greater than 0, `count` is 0, `temp` is now [[order[0], order[0]]], `lol` is now [order[0], order[0]], `temp[0]` is not in `same`, `lol` is not in `same`, and the length of `same` is equal to `int(inp[1])`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
