The variable `lol` is assigned an empty list `[]`. This means that the previous values of the variables remain unchanged. Specifically, `count` is still 0, `same` is still a list with a length equal to `int(inp[1]) + 1`, `order` still has at least 2 elements, `temp` is still an empty list, and neither `temp[0]` is in `same` nor `lol` is in `same`. Therefore, the output state is: `count` is 0, `same` is a list with a length equal to `int(inp[1]) + 1`, `order` has at least 2 elements, `temp` is an empty list, and `lol` is now an empty list.

Output State: **`count` is 0, `same` is a list with a length equal to `int(inp[1]) + 1`, `order` has at least 2 elements, `temp` is an empty list, and `lol` is now an empty list.**
