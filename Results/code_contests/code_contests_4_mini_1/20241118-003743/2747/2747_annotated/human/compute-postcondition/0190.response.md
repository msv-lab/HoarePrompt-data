The code `lol.append(temp[0][1])` attempts to append the value at the index `[0][1]` of the `temp` list to the `lol` list. 

First, we need to evaluate the `temp` list. The `temp` list is defined as `[order[len(order)], order[0]]`. However, since `len(order)` is assumed to be a valid index, `order[len(order)]` would raise an IndexError because list indexing in Python is zero-based, and `len(order)` points to one position beyond the last index of the list.

Since the initial conditions do not define the state of `order`, we cannot determine the value of `temp[0][1]`. Therefore, without knowing the structure of `order`, the output state cannot accurately define the state of `lol` or the append operation.

Thus, the output state is: variable `lol` is an empty list and `attempted to access an invalid index in `order` leading to an IndexError.
Output State: **variable `lol` is an empty list and attempted to access an invalid index in `order` leading to an IndexError.**
