The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `lol` is an empty list, neither `temp[0]` is in `same` nor `lol` is in `same`, and the length of `same` is equal to the integer value of `inp[1]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
