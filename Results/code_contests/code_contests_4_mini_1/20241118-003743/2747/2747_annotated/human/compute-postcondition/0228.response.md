The `pass` statement does not change any variable values or the state of the program; it serves as a placeholder for future code. Therefore, the values of `lol`, `count`, and `temp` remain unchanged. The output state reflects this:

Output State: **`lol` is an empty list, `count` is equal to `len(order) + 1`, `temp` is an empty list**
