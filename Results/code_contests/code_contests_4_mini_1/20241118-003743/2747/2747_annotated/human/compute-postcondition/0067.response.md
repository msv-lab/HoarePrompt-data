`count` is assigned the value `count + 1`. Since `count` is initially 1, after execution, `count` becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is 2; `inp[0]` is greater than or equal to 1; variable `c` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`count` is 2; `inp[0]` is greater than or equal to 1; variable `c` is increased by 1**
