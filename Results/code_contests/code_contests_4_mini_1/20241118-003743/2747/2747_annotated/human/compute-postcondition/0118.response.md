The variable `lol` is updated by appending `temp[0][0]` to it. The previous value of `temp` is `[order[0], order[len(order) - 1]]`, and `temp[0][0]` refers to the first element of `temp`, which is `order[0]`. The list `lol` now includes `temp[0][1]`, which means it already has a value before this operation. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `order` is a non-empty list, `i` is 0, `count` is equal to len(order) - 1, `temp` includes [order[0], order[len(order) - 1]], and `lol` now includes both temp[0][1] and temp[0][0].

Output State: **`order` is a non-empty list, `i` is 0, `count` is equal to len(order) - 1, `temp` includes [order[0], order[len(order) - 1]], and `lol` now includes both temp[0][1] and temp[0][0]**
