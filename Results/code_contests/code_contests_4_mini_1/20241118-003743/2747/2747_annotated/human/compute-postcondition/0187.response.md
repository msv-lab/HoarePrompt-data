The code initializes an empty list `temp`. The variable `count` remains unchanged at 0, and `i` retains its value, which is equal to `len(order)`. The execution of this line does not affect any of the existing variables but creates a new list. Therefore, the output state is: `count` is 0, `i` is equal to `len(order)`, and `temp` is an empty list.

Output State: **`count` is 0, `i` is equal to len(order), and `temp` is an empty list**
