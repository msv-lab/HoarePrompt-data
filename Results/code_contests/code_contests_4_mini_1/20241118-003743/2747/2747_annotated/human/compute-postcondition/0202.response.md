The variable `temp` is assigned an empty list, so `temp` is now `[]`. The previous values of the affected variables are `lol` (which is still an empty list) and `same` (which contains `temp[0]`). However, since `temp` is empty, trying to access `temp[0]` would raise an IndexError if referenced later. The state of `lol` remains unchanged, and `same` may not have a valid reference anymore. Therefore, the output state is: `lol` is an empty list, `same` now contains `temp[0]`, but `temp` is empty, leading to potential issues.

Output State: **`lol` is an empty list, `same` now contains `temp[0]`, but `temp` is empty**
