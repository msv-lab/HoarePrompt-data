Postcondition: ***`count` is 1, `c` is either reset to 0 or incremented by 1 depending on whether `c` was equal to `len(a) - 1`. `i` is an integer equal to `inp[1]`, and `order` includes `a[c]`. If `c` was at the last index of `a`, `c` is set to 0; otherwise, `c` is incremented by 1, ensuring `c` remains within the bounds of the array `a`.***
