Postcondition: ***`count` is equal to `len(order)` plus one if `temp[0]` or `lol` is in `same`, resulting in `temp` and `lol` being empty lists. If neither `temp[0]` nor `lol` is in `same`, and `len(same)` equals `int(inp[1])`, the program breaks out of the loop; otherwise, `temp[0]` is appended to `same`, and then `temp` and `lol` are reset to empty lists, with `count` incremented by one.***
