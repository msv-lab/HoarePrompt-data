Output State: **`if count is less than or equal to len(order) - 1 then lol` remains an empty list, `count` increments after each iteration, and `temp` is reset to an empty list. If `temp[0]` or `lol` is in `same`, then both `temp` and `lol` are cleared, and `count` is incremented. The loop breaks if the length of `same` reaches `int(inp[1])`. If `count` exceeds `len(order) - 1`, the loop does not execute, and the initial values of `temp`, `lol`, and `same` remain unchanged, with `count` still at 0.**
