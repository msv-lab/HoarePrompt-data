The `pass` statement does not change any variable values or the state of the program. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged. The output state is: `lol` is an empty list, `count` is equal to `len(order) + 1`, and `temp` is an empty list.

Output State: **`lol` is an empty list, `count` is equal to `len(order) + 1`, `temp` is an empty list**
