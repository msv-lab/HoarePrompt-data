According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `count` and the length of `order`. The loop will continue executing as long as `count` is less than or equal to `len(order) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `count` is equal to the length of `order`, which means `count` needs to be incremented to allow the loop to execute one more time. Thus, `count` should be adjusted to `count + 1`.

No other states need to be adjusted since `order` is already a non-empty list, and `i` is not relevant for the continuation of the loop.

State: **`order` is a non-empty list, `i` is 0, `count` is equal to the length of `order` plus 1**
