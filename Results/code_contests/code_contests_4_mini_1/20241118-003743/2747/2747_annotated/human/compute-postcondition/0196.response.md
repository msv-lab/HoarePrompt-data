The `pass` statement does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `lol`, `temp`, and `count` remain unchanged. The output state is: `lol` is an empty list, `temp` is an empty list, and `count` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`lol` is an empty list, `temp` is an empty list, and `count` is increased by 1**
