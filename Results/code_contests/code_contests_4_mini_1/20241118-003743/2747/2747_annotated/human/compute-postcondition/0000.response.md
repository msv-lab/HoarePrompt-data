The variable `inp` is assigned the value of `raw_input().split()`, which takes an input from the user, splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace, and stores it in `inp`. The values of `n`, `l`, `k`, and the array `a` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is a positive integer less than or equal to 10^18, `k` is a positive integer, the array `a` consists of `n` positive integers each less than or equal to 10^9, and `inp` is a list of strings from user input.**
