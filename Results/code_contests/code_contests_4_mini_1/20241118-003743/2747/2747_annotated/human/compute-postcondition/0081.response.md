The variable `temp` is assigned an empty list. The values of the other variables `order`, `i`, `inp[1]`, and `count` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `order` is a non-empty list, `i` is 0, `inp[1]` is greater than 0, `count` is 0, and `temp` is an empty list.

Output State: **`order` is a non-empty list, `i` is 0, `inp[1]` is greater than 0, `count` is 0, and `temp` is an empty list**
