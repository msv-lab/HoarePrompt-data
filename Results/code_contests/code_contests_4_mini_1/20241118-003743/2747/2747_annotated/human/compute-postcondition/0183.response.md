According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `count` and the length of `order`. The loop will execute as long as `count` is less than or equal to `len(order) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `count` is equal to `len(order)`, which means it is not less than or equal to `len(order) - 1`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `count` needs to be less than or equal to `len(order) - 1`. Therefore, `count` must be adjusted to `len(order) - 1`.

State: **`count` is equal to `len(order) - 1`**
