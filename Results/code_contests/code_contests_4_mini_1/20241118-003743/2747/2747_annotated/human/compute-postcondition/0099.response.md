Postcondition: ***`order` is a non-empty list, `i` is 0, `inp[1]` is greater than 0, and `count` is increased by 1. If `temp[0]` is in `same` or `lol` is in `same`, then both `temp` and `lol` are set to empty lists. If `len(same)` equals `int(inp[1])`, a break occurs. Otherwise, `temp[0]` is appended to `same`, and both `temp` and `lol` are set to empty lists. In either case, `count` is incremented by 1.***
