According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `count` and the length of `order`. The loop can execute again if `count` is less than or equal to `len(order) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `count` is equal to `len(order) + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `count` needs to be adjusted to be less than or equal to `len(order) - 1`. 

Thus, we need to adjust `count` to `len(order)` for the loop to proceed. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`lol` is an empty list, `count` is equal to `len(order)`, and if `temp[0]` or `lol` is in `same`, then `temp` is also an empty list. Otherwise, `same` is augmented by appending `temp[0]`, and `temp` remains an empty list.**
