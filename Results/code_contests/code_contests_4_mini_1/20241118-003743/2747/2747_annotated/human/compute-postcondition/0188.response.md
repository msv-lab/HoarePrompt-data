The line `lol = []` initializes `lol` as an empty list. This operation does not affect the values of the previously defined variables `count`, `i`, or `temp`. Therefore, the output state remains consistent with the initial values of those variables, while `lol` is now defined as an empty list.

Output State: **`count` is 0, `i` is equal to len(order), `temp` is an empty list, and `lol` is an empty list**
