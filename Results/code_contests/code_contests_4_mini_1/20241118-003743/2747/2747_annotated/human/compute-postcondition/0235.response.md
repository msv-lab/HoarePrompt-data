Postcondition: ***`lol` is an empty list, `count` is increased by 1, and `temp` is an empty list. If `temp[0]` or `lol` is in `same`, then `temp`, `lol`, and `same` are reset, and `count` is incremented by 1. If the length of `same` equals `int(inp[1])`, the loop breaks; otherwise, `temp[0]` is appended to `same`.***
