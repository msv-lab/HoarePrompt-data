Postcondition: ***`count` is 0, `same` is a list with a length equal to `int(inp[1]}`, `order` has at least 2 elements, `temp` contains at least one list with `order[i]` and `order[0]`, `lol` contains `temp[0][1]` and `temp[0][0]`, and neither `temp[0]` is in `same` nor `lol` is in `same`. If the length of `same` equals `int(inp[1])`, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the length of `same` is not equal to `int(inp[1])`, no changes occur in the variables.***
