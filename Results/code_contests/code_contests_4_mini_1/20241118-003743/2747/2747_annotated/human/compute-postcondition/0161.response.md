The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or the most internal structure we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is equal to `len(order) - 1`, `temp` includes [order[i], order[len(order) - 1]], `lol` now includes `temp[0][1]`, and `lol` is updated to include `temp[0][0]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
