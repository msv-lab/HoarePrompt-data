The code appends a list containing two elements: `order[i]` and `order[count]` to `temp`. The values of `i` and `count` are known: `i` is 0 and `count` is equal to `len(order) - 1`, which means `order[count]` is the last element of the `order` list. 

Since `order` is a non-empty list, `order[i]` is the first element and `order[count]` is the last element. Therefore, the output state reflects that `temp` now includes a new list with the first and last elements of `order`.

Output State: **`order` is a non-empty list, `i` is 0, `count` is equal to len(order) - 1, and `temp` now includes [order[0], order[len(order) - 1]]**
