The `same` list is modified by appending `temp[0]`, which is equal to `[order[0], order[0]]`. This means that `temp[0]` is added to the `same` list. The previous values of the affected variables are as follows: `temp` contains `[[order[0], order[0]]]`, so `temp[0]` is `[order[0], order[0]]`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Since the length of `same` is now increased by 1 (as `temp[0]` is appended), the output state will indicate that `temp[0]` has been added to `same`.

Output State: **`order` is a non-empty list, `i` is 0, `inp[1]` is greater than 0, `count` is 0, `temp` is now [[order[0], order[0]]], `lol` is now [order[0], order[0]], `temp[0]` is not in `same`, and `lol` is not in `same`; `temp[0]` has been appended to `same`.**
