Postcondition: ***`order` is a non-empty list, `i` is 0, `inp[1]` is greater than 0, `count` is equal to `len(order) - 1`, `temp` contains the first and last elements of `order`, and `lol` includes the two elements from `temp`. If the length of `same` equals `inp[1]`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, the program continues executing without any modifications to the variables involved.***
