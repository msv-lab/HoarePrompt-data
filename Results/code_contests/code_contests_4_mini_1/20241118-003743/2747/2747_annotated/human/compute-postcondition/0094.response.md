Postcondition: ***`order` is a non-empty list, `i` is 0, `inp[1]` is greater than 0, `count` is 0, `temp` is now [[order[0], order[0]]], `lol` is now [order[0], order[0]], `temp[0]` is not in `same`, and `lol` is not in `same`. If the length of `same` is equal to `int(inp[1])`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise, the program continues execution without any changes to the variables.***
