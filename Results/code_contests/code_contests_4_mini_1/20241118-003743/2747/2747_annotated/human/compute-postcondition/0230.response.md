Postcondition: ***`lol` has been updated by appending `temp[0][0]`, `count` is equal to `len(order)`, and `temp` is a list containing `[order[i], order[count]]`. If the length of `same` is equal to the integer value of `inp[1]`, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, there are no changes made by this fragment.***
