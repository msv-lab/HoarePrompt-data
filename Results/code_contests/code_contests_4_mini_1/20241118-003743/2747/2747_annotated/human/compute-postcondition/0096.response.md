The variable `temp` is assigned an empty list `[]`, which means that the previous value of `temp`, which was `[[order[0], order[0]]]`, is replaced with an empty list. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `order` is a non-empty list, `i` is 0, `inp[1]` is greater than 0, `count` is 0, `temp` is now an empty list, `lol` is now [order[0], order[0]], `temp[0]` is not in `same`, and `lol` is not in `same`; `temp[0]` has been appended to `same`.

Output State: **`order` is a non-empty list, `i` is 0, `inp[1]` is greater than 0, `count` is 0, `temp` is now an empty list, `lol` is now [order[0], order[0]], `temp[0]` is not in `same`, and `lol` is not in `same`; `temp[0]` has been appended to `same`.**
