Postcondition: ***`count` is equal to `len(order)`; if `temp[0]` is in `same` or `lol` is in `same`, both `temp` and `lol` are reset to empty lists, and `count` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if the length of `same` equals `int(inp[1])`, the program breaks; if not, `temp[0]` is appended to `same`, `temp` and `lol` are reset to empty lists, and `count` is incremented by 1.***
