Postcondition: ***`order` is a non-empty list, `i` is 0, `inp[1]` is greater than 0, and `count` is incremented by 1. If `temp[0]` or `lol` is found in `same`, then `temp` and `lol` are reset to empty lists. Otherwise, if the length of `same` is equal to `inp[1]`, the execution breaks. If `temp[0]` is not present and the length of `same` is not equal to `inp[1]`, `temp[0]` is appended to `same`, and `temp` and `lol` are reset to empty lists. In all cases, the state of `temp` and `lol` will be empty after execution.***
