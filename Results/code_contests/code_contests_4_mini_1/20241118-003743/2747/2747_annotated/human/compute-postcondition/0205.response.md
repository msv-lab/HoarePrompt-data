Postcondition: ***`lol` is an empty list. If `temp[0]` is in `same` or if `lol` is in `same`, both `temp` and `lol` are set to empty lists, and `count` is increased by 1. If `lol` is still an empty list and the length of `same` is equal to `int(inp[1])`, the loop breaks. Otherwise, `temp[0]` is appended to `same`, `temp` and `lol` are cleared, and `count` is increased by 1.***
