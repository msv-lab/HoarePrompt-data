The variable `c` is assigned the value `0`. The previous value of `c` is not specified, but the operation directly sets `c` to `0`. The other variables `count` and `inp[0]` are unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `count` is 2, `inp[0]` is greater than or equal to 2, and `c` is 0.

Output State: **`count` is 2, `inp[0]` is greater than or equal to 2, and `c` is 0**
