The variable `count` is assigned the value of `count + 1`. The previous value of `count` is 0, so after execution, `count` becomes 1. The states of the other variables (`c`, `inp[1]`, and `order`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is 1, `c` is incremented by 1, `inp[1]` is greater than or equal to 1, and `order` has the value `a[c]` appended to it.

Output State: **`count` is 1, `c` is incremented by 1, `inp[1]` is greater than or equal to 1, and `order` has the value `a[c]` appended to it.**
