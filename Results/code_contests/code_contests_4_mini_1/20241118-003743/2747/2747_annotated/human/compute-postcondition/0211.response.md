The variable `lol` is assigned an empty list `[]`, which overwrites its previous value that contained two elements. The other variables `count` and `temp` remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of all relevant variables.

Output State: **`lol` is an empty list, `count` is equal to len(order), `temp` is an empty list**
