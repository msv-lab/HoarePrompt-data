The code assigns an empty list to `lol`. Since `lol` is already an empty list, its value remains unchanged. The variable `same` is mentioned to contain `temp[0]`, but since `temp` is empty, accessing `temp[0]` would typically cause an error. However, since the code snippet only involves the assignment to `lol`, the state of `same` is not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`lol` is an empty list, `same` now contains `temp[0]`, but `temp` is empty**
