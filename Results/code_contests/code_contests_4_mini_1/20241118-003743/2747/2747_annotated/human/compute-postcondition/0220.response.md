Postcondition: ***`lol` is an empty list, `count` is equal to `len(order) + 1`, and if `temp[0]` or `lol` is in `same`, then `temp` is also an empty list. Otherwise, `same` is augmented by appending `temp[0]`, and `temp` remains an empty list. The program breaks when the length of `same` equals `int(inp[1])`, covering all edge cases.***
