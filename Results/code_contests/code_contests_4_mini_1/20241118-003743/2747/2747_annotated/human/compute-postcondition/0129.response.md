Postcondition: ***`order` is a non-empty list, `i` is 0, and `count` is equal to the length of `order`. If `temp[0]` or any element in `lol` is found in `same`, both `temp` and `lol` are reset to empty lists, and `count` is incremented by 1. If the length of `same` equals `int(inp[1])`, the loop breaks. Otherwise, `temp[0]` is appended to `same`, and both `temp` and `lol` are reset to empty lists while `count` is incremented by 1. In all cases, `temp` and `lol` will be empty after execution, and `same` may include `temp[0]` if the condition was not met.***
