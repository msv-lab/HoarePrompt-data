The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is equal to `len(order)`, but since the specific length of `order` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact new value of `count`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `lol` is an empty list, `count` is equal to `len(order) + 1`, and `temp` is an empty list.

Output State: **`lol` is an empty list, `count` is equal to `len(order) + 1`, `temp` is an empty list**
