The code assigns the value of `func_2(u)` to `par[func_2(v)]`. The function `func_2` is called with the arguments `u` and `v`, but their values are not specified in the initial state. Thus, the output state cannot explicitly determine the results of `func_2(u)` and `func_2(v)`, as it depends on the implementation of the function `func_2`, which is unknown.

Since the initial state mentions that `n` is an integer between 1 and 3, and `x`, `y`, and `r` are within their specified ranges, we can conclude that `par` is being modified at an index determined by the result of `func_2(v)`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `x` and `y` are integers in the range [-10, 10]; `r` is an integer in the range [1, 10]; `par[func_2(v)]` is assigned the value of `func_2(u)`**.
