Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `v` and uses a recursive approach to find and return the root of a union-find structure represented by the list `par`. If `par[v]` is not equal to `v`, it updates `par[v]` to the result of calling `func_2` on `par[v]`, effectively flattening the structure to ensure that every element points directly to its root. The function returns the final value of `par[v]`, which may be updated during the recursion. There are no explicit edge cases handled in the function, but it assumes that `v` is a valid index in the `par` list.**
