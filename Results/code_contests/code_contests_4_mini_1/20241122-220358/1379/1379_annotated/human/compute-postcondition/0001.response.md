The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `v` and `u`. The parameter `v` is an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, representing the number of circles. For each circle, the parameters `x` and `y` are integers in the range [-10, 10], representing the coordinates of the center of the circle, and `r` is an integer in the range [1, 10], representing the radius of the circle. After executing the function body, the output will depend on specific conditions related to the circles defined by these parameters. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: v, an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3), and u, which consists of sets of integers x, y ([-10, 10]) for circle centers and an integer r (1 ≤ r ≤ 10) for the radius of each circle. The function returns results based on the properties of the defined circles.**
