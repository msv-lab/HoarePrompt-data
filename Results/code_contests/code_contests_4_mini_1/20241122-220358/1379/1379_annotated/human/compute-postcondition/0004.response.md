The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `v`. The parameter `v` is an integer that represents an index which is used to access the value from the list `par`. The function may update the value of `par[v]` based on certain conditions before returning it. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept an integer index `v` and return the value of `par[v]`, potentially modified based on internal conditions. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter v, and returns the value of par[v] after potentially updating it based on internal conditions.**
