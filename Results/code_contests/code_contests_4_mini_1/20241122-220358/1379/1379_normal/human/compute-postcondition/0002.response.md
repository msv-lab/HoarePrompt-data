Functionality: ** The function accepts two parameters, `v` and `u`, where `v` is expected to be an integer between 1 and 3. It calls `func_2` on both `v` and `u`, and assigns the result of `func_2(u)` to a dictionary `par` using the result of `func_2(v)` as the key. However, without additional context on `func_2` or the structure of `par`, the specific behavior and implications of this assignment are unclear. The function does not appear to handle any errors or edge cases related to the inputs or the assignment to `par`.**
