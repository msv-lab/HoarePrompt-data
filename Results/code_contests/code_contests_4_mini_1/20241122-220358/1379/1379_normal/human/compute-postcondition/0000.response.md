To analyze the provided code snippet, we first recognize that `par` is being indexed with the result of `func_2(v)`, and the value being assigned to that index is the result of `func_2(u)`. 

However, we do not have specific values for `u` and `v`, nor do we know the implementation details or return values of the function `func_2`. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact outcomes for `par[func_2(v)]` and `func_2(u)`. We only know that `n` is constrained between 1 and 3, and the values for `x`, `y`, and `r` are also within specified ranges.

Since the state of `par`, `u`, and `v` cannot be determined without further information, we conclude that the code affects the `par` array based on the results of `func_2` applied to `u` and `v`, but we cannot specify exact values for any variables.

Output State: **The assignment modifies par based on func_2(u) and func_2(v) without providing specific values for u, v, or par**.
