The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `v`. `v` is an integer that represents an index for the list `par`, which is expected to be updated based on certain conditions. The constraints specify that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, and for each circle defined by its center (x, y) and radius r, x and y are integers in the range -10 to 10, while r is an integer in the range 1 to 10. After executing the function body, the program returns the value of `par[v]`, which may be unchanged or updated based on conditions involving the function itself. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept an integer index `v` and return the value from the list `par` at that index, which may or may not be modified during the function execution. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter v, and returns the value of par[v], which may be either unchanged or updated based on certain conditions.**
