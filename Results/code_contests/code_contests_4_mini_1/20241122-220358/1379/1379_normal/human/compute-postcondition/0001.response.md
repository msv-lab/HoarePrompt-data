The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `v` and `u`. The parameter `v` is an integer representing the number of circles, constrained such that 1 ≤ v ≤ 3. Each circle is defined by its center coordinates `x` and `y`, which are integers in the range -10 to 10, and a radius `r`, which is an integer in the range 1 to 10. The parameter `u` is assumed to be related to the circles but its specific constraints and relationship are not provided.

The function returns a value based on the parameters and the defined constraints. However, since the output details for specific cases based on the parameters `v` and `u` have not been provided, I will summarize the functionality based on the available information.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, v (an integer between 1 and 3) and u (related to the circles), and is designed to work with circles defined by their center coordinates (x, y) and radius (r).**
