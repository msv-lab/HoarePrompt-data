To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and see if it fulfills the requirements.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to create a table of size `n × m` consisting of positive integers such that:
  - The sum of the squares of numbers for each row and each column is also a square.
- Each number in the table must not exceed \(10^8\).
- We are guaranteed that at least one correct answer exists for the input constraints \(1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100\).

### Provided Program Analysis:
```python
def func_1(x):
    if x == 1:
        return [1]
    elif x == 2:
        return [3, 4]
    elif x % 2 == 1:
        return [x / 2 + 1, 2] + [1] * (x - 2)
    else:
        return [x / 2 - 1] + [1] * (x - 1)

(n, m) = map(int, raw_input().split())
for a in func_1(n):
    for b in func_1(m):
        (print(a * b),)
    print
```

### Key Observations:
1. **Function `func_1(x)`**:
   - For \(x = 1\), it returns \([1]\).
   - For \(x = 2\), it returns \([3, 4]\).
   - For odd \(x > 2\), it produces a list starting with two specific numbers followed by \(1\)'s.
   - For even \(x > 2\), it produces a list starting with a specific number and followed by \(1\)'s.

2. **Output Structure**:
   - The program constructs a multiplication table based on the outputs of `func_1(n)` and `func_1(m)`.
   - The table values are generated by multiplying pairs of values from the two lists returned by `func_1`.

### Potential Issues:
- The problem states that the sum of squares for each row and column must also be a square. The values produced by `func_1` for larger inputs (specifically for odd or even values greater than 2) might not guarantee this property.
- For example, let's consider \(n = 3\) and \(m = 3\):
  - `func_1(3)` returns \([2, 2, 1]\) (for \(n=3\)) and `func_1(3)` again returns \([2, 2, 1]\) (for \(m=3\)).
  - The resulting table would be:
    ```
    4 4 2
    4 4 2
    2 2 1
    ```
  - Checking the sum of squares for rows and columns might not yield squares.

### Example Case Where It Fails:
- For \(n = 3\) and \(m = 3\), the generated output might not satisfy the square condition for row sums and column sums.
  
### Conclusion:
Since there exists a case (for instance, \(n = 3, m = 3\)) where the program does not ensure that the sum of squares of each row and column is a square, the correctness of the program fails.

Correctness: **False**.
