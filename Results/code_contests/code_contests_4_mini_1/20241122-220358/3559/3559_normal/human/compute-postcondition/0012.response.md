Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 100. If `x` is equal to 1, the function returns the list [1]. If `x` is equal to 2, the function returns the list [3, 4]. If `x` is an odd integer greater than or equal to 3, the function returns a list starting with `(x / 2 + 1)`, followed by the integer `2`, and then `(x - 2)` instances of the integer `1`. If `x` is an even integer greater than or equal to 3, the function returns a list starting with `(x / 2 - 1)` and followed by `(x - 1)` instances of the integer `1`. All outputs are structured to ensure valid lists according to the specified conditions.***
