Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 100, and `x` is not equal to 1 and `x` is not equal to 2. If `x` is an odd integer, the function returns a list where the first element is `(x / 2 + 1)`, the second element is `2`, followed by `(x - 2)` instances of the integer `1`. If `x` is an even integer, the function returns a list where the first element is `(x / 2 - 1)`, followed by `(x - 1)` instances of the integer `1`. The values of `x` must also be greater than or equal to 3 to ensure valid outputs for both cases.***
