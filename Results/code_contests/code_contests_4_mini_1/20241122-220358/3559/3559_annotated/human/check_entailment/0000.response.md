To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and the requirements step by step.

### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to create a table of size n × m filled with positive integers such that:
1. The sum of squares of numbers in each row is a perfect square.
2. The sum of squares of numbers in each column is also a perfect square.
3. The values in the table must not exceed \(10^8\).
4. The dimensions \(n\) and \(m\) can range from 1 to 100.

### Analyzing the Code:
The function `func_1(x)` is designed to generate a list based on the input integer `x`.

- For `x == 1`, it returns `[1]`.
- For `x == 2`, it returns `[3, 4]`.
- For odd integers greater than 2, it returns `[x / 2 + 1, 2] + [1] * (x - 2)`.
- For even integers greater than 2, it returns `[x / 2 - 1] + [1] * (x - 1)`.

### Issues with the Code:
1. The function does not generate a complete n × m table, only a single row or column based on the input `x`.
2. The output for each row/column does not guarantee that the sum of squares for the entire table will be a perfect square.
3. Using `x / 2` results in floating-point values which will not yield integers unless `x` is even.
4. There is no mechanism provided to generate multiple rows or columns to form a complete table of size n × m.

### Example Cases:
- If we call `func_1(1)`, we get `[1]`, which is acceptable for a 1 × 1 table. This case works.
- If we call `func_1(2)`, we get `[3, 4]`, which also works for a 1 × 2 table. This case works.
- However, if we try to build a 2 × 2 table using the function for `x = 2`, we do not have any mechanism to ensure that both rows and columns meet the requirements.

### Conclusion:
Given that the program does not output a full n × m table, and based on the reasoning above, it fails to meet the problem requirements for any input size beyond trivial cases (1 × 1 or 1 × 2).

Correctness: **False**. 

The function does not generate the required n × m table, nor does it guarantee the conditions regarding the sums of squares, failing to handle the complete problem as described.
