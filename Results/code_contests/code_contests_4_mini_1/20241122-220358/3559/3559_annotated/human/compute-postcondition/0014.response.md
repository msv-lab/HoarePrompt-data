Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `x` and returns different lists based on its value. If `x` is 1, it returns the list `[1]`. If `x` is 2, it returns the list `[3, 4]`. For odd integers greater than 2, it returns a list starting with `(x / 2 + 1)`, followed by the integer `2`, and then `(x - 2)` instances of the integer `1`. For even integers greater than 2, it returns a list containing `(x / 2 - 1)` followed by `(x - 1)` instances of the integer `1`. Note that the function does not handle cases where `x` is less than 1 or non-integer values, which could lead to unexpected behavior or errors.**
