Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 100, and `x` is not equal to 1 or 2. If `x` is an odd integer, the function returns a list starting with `(x / 2 + 1)`, followed by `2`, and then `(x - 2)` instances of the integer `1`. If `x` is an even integer, the function returns a list containing `(x / 2 - 1)` followed by `(x - 1)` instances of the integer `1`. The function handles all instances of `x` being odd or even, ensuring that the generated list reflects these conditions accurately.***
