The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `x`. The parameter `x` is an integer. If `x` is 1, the function returns the list [1]. If `x` is 2, the function returns the list [3, 4]. If `x` is an odd integer greater than 2, the function returns a list starting with `(x / 2 + 1)`, followed by `2`, and then `(x - 2)` instances of the integer `1`. If `x` is an even integer greater than 2, the function returns a list containing `(x / 2 - 1)` followed by `(x - 1)` instances of the integer `1`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `x` and return a list based on the value of `x` while handling both odd and even integers appropriately.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter x, returns [1] if x is 1, [3, 4] if x is 2, a list starting with (x / 2 + 1) followed by 2 and (x - 2) instances of 1 if x is an odd integer greater than 2, and a list containing (x / 2 - 1) followed by (x - 1) instances of 1 if x is an even integer greater than 2.**
