The function reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `arr`. It counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`, calculates the number of unique integers, and then computes a value `ans` based on the unique integers encountered as it processes the list. The final computed value `ans` is printed. If `arr` is empty, the function will print 0. The function does not explicitly handle cases where the input may be non-integer or if `n` does not match the length of `arr`.
