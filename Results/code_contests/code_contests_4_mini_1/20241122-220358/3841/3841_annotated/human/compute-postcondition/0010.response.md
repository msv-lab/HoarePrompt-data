According to the code, the loop iterates over each element in the list `arr`. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` has `n` integers, and `i` represents the current element being processed in the loop. Since `freq[i]` was increased by 1, this indicates that `i` is valid within the range of values in `arr`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `arr` must still contain at least one more element after the current iteration. This can be determined by observing that `i` will take on the next value in `arr` during the next iteration. Therefore, to ensure there is a next value for `i`, we need to adjust the remaining number of elements in `arr` that has not yet been processed.

Since `n` is a positive integer, to allow for the loop to execute again, we need to ensure that `arr` has at least one more element left after the current iteration. Specifically, if `arr` is of length `n`, and if `i` is the current element, we can conclude that the next value of `i` will be the next element in `arr`. 

Thus, if `i` is the last element in `arr`, then we need to adjust the state to reflect that the loop cannot execute again. Therefore, we assume that there are still more elements in `arr` to process.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000; `arr` is a list of `n` integers; `i` is the next integer in `arr` (not yet processed)**
