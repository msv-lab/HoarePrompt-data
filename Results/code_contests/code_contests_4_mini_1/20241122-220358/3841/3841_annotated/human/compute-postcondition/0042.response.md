The value of `rem` is decremented by 1. The previous state of `rem` is not specified, but it is affected directly by this operation. The other variables (`freq[i]`, `vis[i]`, `arr`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `freq[i]` is decremented by 1, `vis[i]` is 1, `arr` has at least one more element, `i` is the next element in `arr`, and `rem` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`freq[i]` is decremented by 1, `vis[i]` is 1, `arr` has at least one more element, `i` is the next element in `arr`, and `rem` is decreased by 1**
