The code initializes a variable `freq` as an empty dictionary. The previous state of the program does not change any existing variables; it simply creates a new variable. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged state of `n` and `arr`, along with the new variable.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000; `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100000; `freq` is an empty dictionary**
