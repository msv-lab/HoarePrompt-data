The variable `vis` is updated to have a key `i` with a value of `0`. The initial state indicates that `i` is the first integer in `arr`, which already has a frequency of `0` in the `freq` dictionary. The other variables (`n`, `arr`, `freq`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects the update to the `vis` dictionary.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `freq` is a dictionary with at least the key `i` mapping to 0, `vis` is a dictionary with key `i` having value 0**
