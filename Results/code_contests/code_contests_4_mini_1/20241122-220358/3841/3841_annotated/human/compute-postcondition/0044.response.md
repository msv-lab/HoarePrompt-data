The value of `ans` is incremented by `rem`. The variable `rem` remains unchanged if `freq[i]` was originally greater than zero before decrementing, or it is decreased by 1 if `freq[i]` was originally zero. Since `rem` can either stay the same or decrease by 1 based on the condition of `freq[i]`, the output state considers both scenarios.

Output State: **`freq[i]` is decremented by 1, `vis[i]` is 1, `arr` has at least one more element, `i` is the next element in `arr`; `ans` is updated to `ans + rem`, where `rem` may be unchanged or decreased by 1 depending on the original value of `freq[i]`.**
