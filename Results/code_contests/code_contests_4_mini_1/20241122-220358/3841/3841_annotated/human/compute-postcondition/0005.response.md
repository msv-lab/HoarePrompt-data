The code assigns the value of `freq[i]` using the `get` method on the `freq` dictionary. The method `get(i, 0)` retrieves the current frequency of the integer `i` from the `freq` dictionary. If `i` is not already a key in `freq`, it returns 0. Since `freq` is currently an empty dictionary, `freq[i]` will be assigned the value 0.

Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `freq` is now `{i: 0}`, `vis` is an empty dictionary, and `i` is the first integer in `arr`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `freq` is now `{i: 0}`, `vis` is an empty dictionary, `i` is the first integer in `arr`**
