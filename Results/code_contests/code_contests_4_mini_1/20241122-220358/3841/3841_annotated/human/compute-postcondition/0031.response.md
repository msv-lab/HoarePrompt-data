The code assigns the value `1` to `vis[i]`, indicating that the element at index `i` in the `vis` array is now marked as visited. The initial state specifies that `vis[i]` is false, so after this assignment, `vis[i]` will be true (or 1). The other variables (`freq[i]`, `rem`, `ans`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `vis[i]` has been updated while the others stay the same.

Output State: **`freq[i]` is decremented by 1, `vis[i]` is 1, `rem` is greater than or equal to 0, `ans` is `rem`, `i` is the first element of `arr`**
