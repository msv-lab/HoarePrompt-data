To determine the necessary adjustments to the states for the loop to execute one more time, we analyze the provided information carefully.

1. **Understanding the Loop Conditions**: The loop iterates over `arr`, which means it will continue to execute as long as there are more elements in `arr`.

2. **Current State Analysis**: We know that `arr` has at least one more element at the end of the previous iteration, which means there are still elements left for the loop to process.

3. **Implications of Loop Execution**:
   - The loop variable `i` will take on the next value from `arr` in the next iteration.
   - Since `arr` has at least one more element, we will need to adjust the state to reflect that `i` will now point to the next element in `arr`.

4. **Updating States**:
   - Since `arr` has at least one more element, we can conclude that after the current iteration, the next value of `i` will be the next element in `arr`.
   - We do not need to adjust `freq[i]`, `vis[i]`, `ans`, or `rem` directly for the next iteration since they will be handled in the loop body.

5. **Final State Adjustment**:
   - We need to ensure that `i` reflects the next element in `arr`. However, since we don't have the current length of `arr`, we will indicate that `i` now corresponds to the next element in `arr`.

State: **`freq[i]` is decremented by 1, `vis[i]` is set to 1, `arr` has at least one more element, `i` is the next element in `arr`**
