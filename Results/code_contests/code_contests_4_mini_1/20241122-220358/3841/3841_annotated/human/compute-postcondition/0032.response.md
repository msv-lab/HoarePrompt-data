Postcondition: ***`freq[i]` has been decremented by 1, `vis[i]` is set to 1, `rem` remains unchanged if `freq[i]` was originally greater than 0; otherwise, `rem` is decremented by 1. The value of `ans` is equal to `rem` if `vis[i]` was initially 0. The variable `i` is the first element of `arr`, and `rem` is greater than or equal to 0.***
