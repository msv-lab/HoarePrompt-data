The function `func` accepts a parameter `n`, which is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100000\), and a parameter `arr`, which is a list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 100000\). After executing the function body, it processes the input based on the provided constraints and relationships. 

Since the specific output of the function has not been detailed, we can summarize the functionality based on the accepted parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n and a list of n integers arr, where each integer is between 1 and 100000.**
