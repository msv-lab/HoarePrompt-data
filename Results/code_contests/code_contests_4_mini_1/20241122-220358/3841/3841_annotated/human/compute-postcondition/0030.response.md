The code increments `ans` by the value of `rem`. Given that `ans` is initially 0, the new value of `ans` will be equal to `rem`. The other variables, including `freq[i]`, `vis`, and `rem`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `ans` and the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`freq[i]` is decremented by 1, `vis` remains unchanged, `rem` is greater than or equal to 0, `ans` is `rem`, `i` is the first element of `arr`, and `vis[i]` is false**.
