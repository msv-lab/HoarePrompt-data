The `print(ans)` statement outputs the value of `ans`. Since there are no changes made to any variables and `ans` retains its previous value, we need to consider the initial state.

Given the initial state indicates that if `arr` is empty, `ans` remains 0. Therefore, the output will reflect the unchanged state of the variables.

Output State: **`freq` contains the counts of occurrences for each integer in `arr` decremented by the number of times they were processed, `vis` contains the keys from `arr` that were encountered for the first time with values set to 1 for those keys, `rem` is 0, `ans` is 0, and the function prints 0.**
