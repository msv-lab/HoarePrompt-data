Output State: **`freq` contains the counts of occurrences for each integer in `arr` decremented by the number of times they were processed, `vis` contains the keys from `arr` that were encountered for the first time with values set to 1 for those keys, `rem` is the number of unique elements in `arr` decremented by the number of keys in `freq` that reached 0, `ans` is the accumulated count of unique elements encountered multiplied by the number of unique elements remaining at each step; if `arr` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `ans` remains 0, `rem` stays 0, `freq` and `vis` remain unchanged.**
