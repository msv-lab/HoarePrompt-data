The code increments the value of `freq[i]` by 1. Prior to this operation, `freq[i]` could either be 0 or a positive integer. If `freq[i]` was 0, it means that `i` was added to the `vis` dictionary with a value of 0 in the previous operations. However, after executing this line, `freq[i]` will no longer be 0 and thus will not affect `vis` anymore. The previous states of `n`, `arr`, and `vis` are not directly impacted by this operation. The main effect is on `freq`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000; `arr` is a list of `n` integers; `freq[i]` is increased by 1; if `freq[i]` was 0, then `vis` included the key `i` with a value of 0, but this state will not change after this operation.**
