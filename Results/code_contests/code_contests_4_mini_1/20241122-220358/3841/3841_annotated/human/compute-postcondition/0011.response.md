The line `freq[i] = freq.get(i, 0)` assigns to `freq[i]` the value of `freq.get(i, 0)`. This means it checks if `i` exists as a key in the dictionary `freq`. If `i` does exist, it retrieves its current value; if not, it defaults to `0`. The value of `n` and `arr` do not change, and `i` is the next integer in `arr` that is being processed. The state of the `freq` dictionary is updated, but without knowing the previous state of `freq`, we cannot specify the exact value of `freq[i]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000; `arr` is a list of `n` integers; `i` is the next integer in `arr` (not yet processed); `freq[i]` is set to the current frequency of `i` or 0 if `i` is not yet in `freq`.**
