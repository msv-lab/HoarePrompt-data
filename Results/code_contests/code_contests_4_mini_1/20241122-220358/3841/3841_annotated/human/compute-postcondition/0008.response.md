Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `freq` is a dictionary with at least the key `i` mapping to 0. If `freq[i]` is 0, then `vis` is updated to include the key `i` with a value of 0. If `freq[i]` is not 0, there is no change to `vis`.***
