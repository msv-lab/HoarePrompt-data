According to the code, the loop will execute for each element in the list `arr`. The variable `i` will take each value in `arr` one by one. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` has `n + 1` integers, and since `n` is a positive integer, this means `n + 1` is at least 2 and at most 100001.

For the loop to execute one more time, `arr` must have at least one more integer than it did in the previous iteration. We know that `arr` currently has `n + 1` integers. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, we need to adjust the state so that `arr` has `n + 2` integers.

Since `i` in the loop corresponds to the current element of `arr`, and considering the previous iteration where `freq[i]` was updated, we need to ensure that `i` refers to the next element in the updated list. 

Thus, we need to reflect that `arr` contains `n + 2` integers, and the loop will process one more integer than it previously handled.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` + 2 ≤ 100000; `arr` is a list of `n + 2` integers; `freq[i]` is now `freq[i] + 1`, and if `freq[i]` was previously 0, then `vis[i]` is set to 0; otherwise, `vis[i]` remains unchanged.**
