The value of `vis[i]` is assigned 0. The initial state mentions that `vis[i]` is unchanged unless `freq[i]` was previously 0, but we do not have information about `freq[i]`. Therefore, since we are only assigning `0` to `vis[i]`, the output state will reflect that `vis[i]` has been updated to `0`, while other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` + 1 ≤ 100000; `arr` is a list of `n + 1` integers; `freq[i]` is now either its previous value or 0; `vis[i]` is now 0.**
