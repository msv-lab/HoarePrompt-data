The variable `arr` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the result of `raw_input().split()`. The `raw_input()` function accepts a string of space-separated integers, and the `split()` method splits this string into a list of substrings. Each substring is then converted to an integer by the `int` function. The initial state indicates that `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100,000, and `arr` will contain `n` integers, each between 1 and 100,000.

Therefore, after running the code, `n` remains unchanged, and `arr` is now a list of integers based on the input provided.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000; `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100000**
