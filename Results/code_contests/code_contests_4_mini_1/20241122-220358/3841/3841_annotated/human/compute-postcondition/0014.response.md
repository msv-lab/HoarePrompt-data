The value of `freq[i]` is incremented by 1. If `freq[i]` was previously 0, it indicates that `i` has now been processed for the first time, and `vis[i]` was set to 0. If `freq[i]` was greater than 0 before this operation, `vis[i]` remains unchanged. The state of `n` and `arr` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the changes to `freq` and potentially `vis`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000; `arr` is a list of `n` integers; `freq[i]` is incremented by 1; if `freq[i]` was 0, then `vis[i]` is 0; otherwise, `vis[i]` remains unchanged.**
