Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000; `arr` is a list of `n` integers; `i` is the next integer in `arr` (not yet processed); if the frequency `freq[i]` is 0 (indicating that `i` has not been processed yet), then `vis[i]` is set to 0. If `i` has been processed before (i.e., `freq[i]` > 0), the value of `vis[i]` remains unchanged.***
