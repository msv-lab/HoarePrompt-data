The value of `vis[i]` is assigned to 1, but it is already 1 based on the initial state. Therefore, there is no change to `vis[i]`. The states of the other variables (`freq`, `arr`, `ans`, and `rem`) are unaffected by this assignment. 

Output State: **`freq[i]` is decremented by 1, `vis[i]` is 1, `arr` has at least one more element, `i` is the next element in `arr`, and `ans` is updated to `ans + rem`, where `rem` may be unchanged or decreased by 1 depending on the original value of `freq[i]`.**
