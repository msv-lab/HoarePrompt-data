The code increments the value of `freq[i]` by 1. Since `freq[i]` is being modified, the value of `freq[i]` changes from its previous value to the new value, which is `freq[i] + 1`. The other variables, `n`, `arr`, and `vis`, remain unchanged in this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the change to `freq[i]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` + 1 ≤ 100000; `arr` is a list of `n + 1` integers; `freq[i]` is now `freq[i] + 1`, and if `freq[i]` was previously 0, then `vis[i]` is set to 0; otherwise, `vis[i]` remains unchanged.**
