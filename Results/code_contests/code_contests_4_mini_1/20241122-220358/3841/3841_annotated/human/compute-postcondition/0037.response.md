The variable `ans` is incremented by the value of `rem`. The initial state indicates that `rem` can either be unchanged or decremented by 1, depending on the previous value of `freq[i]`. 

If `freq[i]` was greater than 0, `rem` remains unchanged, and if `freq[i]` was 0, `rem` is decremented by 1. Therefore, the final value added to `ans` will either be the original value of `rem` or `rem - 1`.

Since we have no specific values for `ans` or `rem`, we cannot determine the exact numerical result, but we can summarize the changes:

- If `freq[i] > 0`: `ans` increases by `rem`.
- If `freq[i] == 0`: `ans` increases by `rem - 1`.

Thus, the output state will reflect these possibilities.

Output State: **`ans` is increased by `rem` or `rem - 1` depending on the initial value of `freq[i]`.**
