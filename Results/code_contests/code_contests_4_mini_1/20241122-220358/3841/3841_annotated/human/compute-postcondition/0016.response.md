The code assigns `freq[i]` the value of `freq.get(i, 0)`, which retrieves the current value of `freq[i]` if it exists, or defaults to 0 if it does not. This affects the state of `freq[i]`, but the state of `vis[i]` remains unchanged unless `freq[i]` was previously 0, in which case `vis[i]` is set to 0. The other variables remain unaffected.

Since `freq[i]` is being accessed but not modified directly in this line, the output state reflects that `freq[i]` is now equal to its previous value or 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` + 1 ≤ 100000; `arr` is a list of `n + 1` integers; `freq[i]` is now either its previous value or 0; `vis[i]` is unchanged unless `freq[i]` was previously 0.**
