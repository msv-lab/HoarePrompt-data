The variable `freq[i]` is decremented by 1. If `freq[i]` was originally greater than 0, `rem` remains unchanged. If `freq[i]` was originally 0, `rem` is decremented by 1. The variable `vis[i]` is set to 1. The value of `ans` is equal to `rem` if `vis[i]` was initially 0. The variable `i` refers to the second element of `arr`, and `rem` is greater than or equal to 0.

Since `freq[i]` has been decremented, we need to consider both possible scenarios for `freq[i]`:

1. If `freq[i]` was initially greater than 0, then `rem` remains unchanged, `vis[i]` is now 1, and `ans` is not affected.
2. If `freq[i]` was initially 0, then `rem` is decremented by 1, `vis[i]` is set to 1, and `ans` is updated to be equal to the new value of `rem`.

The output state will depend on the initial value of `freq[i]`. Therefore, the output state is as follows:

Output State: **`freq[i]` is decremented by 1; `vis[i]` is set to 1; `rem` is unchanged if `freq[i]` was initially greater than 0; otherwise, `rem` is decremented by 1.**
