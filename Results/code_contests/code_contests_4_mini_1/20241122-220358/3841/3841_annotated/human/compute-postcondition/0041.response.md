The value of `freq[i]` is decremented by 1, which means that the count associated with the index `i` in the `freq` array is reduced by 1. The value of `vis[i]` is already set to 1, indicating that the index `i` has been visited. The state of `arr` remains unchanged, as there is at least one more element in it, and `i` continues to point to the next element in `arr`. 

Therefore, the output state is `freq[i]` is decremented by 1, `vis[i]` is 1, `arr` has at least one more element, and `i` is the next element in `arr`.

Output State: **`freq[i]` is decremented by 1, `vis[i]` is 1, `arr` has at least one more element, and `i` is the next element in `arr`**
