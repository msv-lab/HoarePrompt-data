The code assigns the value `1` to `vis[i]`, indicating that the index `i` has been marked as visited. The values of `ans` and `rem` are not affected directly by this assignment. Since we do not have specific values for `i`, `ans`, or `rem`, the output state will reflect that `vis[i]` has been updated while indicating the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans` is increased by `rem` or `rem - 1` depending on the initial value of `freq[i]`, and `vis[i]` is set to 1**
