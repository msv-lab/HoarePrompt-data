According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the `arr` list. Since `n` is a positive integer and `arr` contains `n` integers, the loop will execute if `arr` has at least 1 element. Given that `n` is at least 1, `arr` is guaranteed to have elements. 

At the start of the first iteration, the variable `i` will take the value of the first element in `arr`. Since `arr` has at least one integer, we can say that `i` will be the first integer in the list.

Thus, to summarize the required state adjustments for the loop to execute:

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `vis` is an empty dictionary, `i` is the first integer in `arr`**
