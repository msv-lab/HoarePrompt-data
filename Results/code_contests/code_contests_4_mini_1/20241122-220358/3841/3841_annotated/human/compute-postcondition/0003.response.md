The code initializes a new dictionary called `vis`. The state of the other variables, `n`, `arr`, and `freq`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000; `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100000; `freq` is an empty dictionary, and `vis` is an empty dictionary.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100000; `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100000; `freq` is an empty dictionary; `vis` is an empty dictionary**
