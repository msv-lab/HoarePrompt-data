The code decrements `rem` by 1. The value of `rem` was greater than 0, so after the execution, `rem` will be reduced to a value that is greater than or equal to 0 (specifically one less than its previous value). The other variables `freq[i]`, `vis`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `rem` and the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`freq[i]` is decremented by 1, `vis` remains unchanged, `rem` is greater than or equal to 0, `ans` is 0, `i` is the first element of `arr`.**
