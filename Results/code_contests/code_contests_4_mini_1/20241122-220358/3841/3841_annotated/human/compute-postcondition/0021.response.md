Output State: **`freq` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `arr` and its value is the count of occurrences of that integer in `arr`; `vis` is a dictionary containing the keys from `arr` that were encountered for the first time, each with a value of 0; if `arr` is empty, then `freq` remains an empty dictionary and `vis` remains an empty dictionary; if `arr` contains at least one element, the loop executes for each element in `arr`.**
