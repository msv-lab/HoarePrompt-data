The line of code `ans += rem` adds the current value of `rem` to `ans`. The statement indicates that the value of `rem` is unchanged, regardless of the conditions described for `freq[i]`. Therefore, the value of `ans` will increase by the current value of `rem`, while `freq`, `vis`, `arr`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`freq`, `vis`, `arr`, and `n` remain unchanged; `ans` is increased by `rem`.**
