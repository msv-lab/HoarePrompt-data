The value of `freq[i]` is incremented by 1. Since `freq[i]` starts at 2, after the execution, `freq[i]` will be 3. The state of `vis[i]` remains unchanged because `freq[i]` was not 0. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in `arr`, `freq[i]` is 3, and `vis[i]` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in `arr`, `freq[i]` is 3, and `vis[i]` remains unchanged.**
