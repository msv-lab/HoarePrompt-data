The value at index `i` in the `vis` list is updated to `1`, indicating that the integer at that index has been visited. The other variables (`freq`, `arr`, `n`, and `ans`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `vis[i]` is now `1`.

Output State: **`freq` contains the updated frequency count for the integer at index `i`, `vis[i]` is 1, `arr` remains unchanged, `n` is a positive integer, and `ans` is increased by `rem`.**
