According to the code, the loop will continue to execute for each element in `arr`. The variable `i` takes on the value of each element in `arr` during the iterations. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the third element in `arr`. Since `arr` has at least 3 elements, we need to ensure that `i` is adjusted to the next element in `arr` for the loop to execute again.

If `i` is currently the third element, then for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be adjusted to the fourth element in `arr`. The state of `n`, `freq[i]`, and `vis[i]` does not need to change because they do not directly affect the ability of the loop to continue.

Therefore, the adjusted state should reflect that `i` is now the fourth element in `arr`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of integers with at least 4 elements, `i` is the fourth element in `arr`, `freq[i]` is 3, and `vis[i]` remains unchanged.**
