The variable `rem` is decreased by 1, but its previous value is unknown, and the other variables (`freq`, `vis`, `arr`, and `n`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `rem` has been decremented by 1 while the other variables stay the same.

Output State: **`freq`, `vis`, `arr`, and `n` remain unchanged; `rem` is decreased by 1**
