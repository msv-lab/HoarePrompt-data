The value of `freq[i]` is incremented by 1. Since the initial value of `freq[i]` is 1, after execution, `freq[i]` becomes 2. The other variables, `n`, `arr`, `i`, and `vis[i]`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in `arr`, `freq[i]` is 2, and `vis[i]` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in `arr`, `freq[i]` is 2, and `vis[i]` remains unchanged**.
