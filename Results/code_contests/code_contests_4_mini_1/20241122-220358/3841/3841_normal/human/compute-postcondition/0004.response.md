According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the `arr` variable. Since `arr` is a list created from the input, it should have at least one integer for the loop to execute. The variable `i` will take on each value from `arr` during the iterations of the loop. Given that `n` is a positive integer, we can conclude that `arr` should contain exactly `n` integers.

For the loop to be executed, we must ensure that `arr` has at least one integer and that `i` starts from the first element in the `arr`. Since `freq` and `vis` are empty dictionaries, they do not affect the loop execution.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in `arr`, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `vis` is an empty dictionary**
