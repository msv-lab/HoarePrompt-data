The variable `vis` is assigned an empty dictionary. The previous values of `n`, `arr`, and `freq` are not affected by this line of code, so they retain their respective states. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `arr` is a list of integers created from the input where each integer satisfies (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^5), `freq` is an empty dictionary, and `vis` is an empty dictionary.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `arr` is a list of integers created from the input where each integer satisfies (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^5), `freq` is an empty dictionary, and `vis` is an empty dictionary**.
