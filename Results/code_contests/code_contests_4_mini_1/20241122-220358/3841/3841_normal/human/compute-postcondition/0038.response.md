The value of `vis[i]` is set to 1, indicating that the element at index `i` in `arr` has now been visited. The other variables `freq`, `arr`, `n`, and `ans` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `freq` remains unchanged, `vis` shows the next element in `arr` that has not been visited, `arr` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, and `ans` is increased by `rem`.

Output State: **`freq` remains unchanged, `vis` shows the next element in `arr` that has not been visited, `arr` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, and `ans` is increased by `rem`.**
