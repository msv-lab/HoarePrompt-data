Postcondition: ***`freq`, `vis`, `arr`, and `n` remain unchanged. If `vis[i]` is false, then `ans` is increased by `rem` and `vis[i]` is set to 1, indicating that the element at index `i` in `arr` has now been visited. If `vis[i]` is true, there is no change to `ans` or `vis[i]`. If `freq[i]` is zero, then `rem` is decreased by 1; otherwise, `rem` remains unchanged.***
