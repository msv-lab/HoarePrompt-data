According to the code, the loop iterates over the elements in `arr`. For the loop to execute one more time, `arr` must have at least one more element that has not been processed yet. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the current element being processed from `arr`. If `vis[i]` was initially 0, then `vis[i]` is set to 1, indicating that this element has been processed. If `vis[i]` was already 1, it means that the element has already been considered in previous iterations. 

Since `n` is a positive integer and represents the number of elements in `arr`, if `vis[i]` is 1, we need to move to the next element of `arr` that has not been visited yet. Therefore, `i` needs to be adjusted to the next index that has not been marked in `vis`. 

If `arr` has more elements that have not been visited, `vis[i]` should reflect this by having a value of 0 for the next element, and `ans` might need to be adjusted based on the value of `freq`.

State: **`freq` remains unchanged, `vis` should show the next element in `arr` that has not been visited (i.e. `vis[next_i]` where `next_i` is the next index with `vis[next_i]` as 0), `arr` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `ans` remains unchanged, `rem` remains unchanged.**
