The code initializes `freq` as an empty dictionary. The initial state does not change the existing variables `n` and `arr`, but introduces a new variable `freq`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `arr` is a list of integers created from the input where each integer satisfies (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^5), and `freq` is an empty dictionary.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `arr` is a list of integers created from the input where each integer satisfies (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^5), and `freq` is an empty dictionary**
