The value of `n` is assigned from `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input value and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous state indicates that `n` is a positive integer within the range (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), and `arr` remains unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `arr` is a list of integers where each integer a_i satisfies (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^5), and `n` is assigned an input integer.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `arr` is a list of integers where each integer a_i satisfies (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^5), and `n` is assigned an input integer**
