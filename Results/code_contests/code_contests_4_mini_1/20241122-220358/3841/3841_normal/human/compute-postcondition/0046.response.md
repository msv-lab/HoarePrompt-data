Postcondition: ***`freq`, `vis`, `arr`, and `n` remain unchanged. If `vis[i]` is 0, then `vis[i]` is updated to 1 and `ans` is increased by `rem`. If `vis[i]` is already 1, then `ans` remains unchanged and `vis[i]` still equals 1. Additionally, if `freq[i]` is 0, then `rem` is decreased by 1, but this does not affect `ans` or `vis`.***
