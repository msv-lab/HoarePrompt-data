Postcondition: ***`freq` contains the updated frequency count for the integer at index `i`, `vis` remains unchanged, `arr` remains unchanged, `n` is a positive integer, if `freq[i]` is 0, then `rem`, which is the count of unique integers in `arr`, is decreased by 1, and `ans` is 0; otherwise, `rem` remains unchanged.***
