The value of `vis[i]` is set to `1`, indicating that the index `i` in the `vis` array is marked as visited. The variables `freq`, `arr`, and `n` remain unchanged, and there is no impact on their values. The variable `ans` is increased by `rem`, but the value of `rem` is not specified, so we cannot determine the new value of `ans`. Therefore, the output state is: `freq` remains unchanged, `vis` is updated at index `i` to 1, `arr` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, and `ans` is increased by `rem`.

Output State: **`freq` remains unchanged, `vis` is updated at index `i` to 1, `arr` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, and `ans` is increased by `rem**
