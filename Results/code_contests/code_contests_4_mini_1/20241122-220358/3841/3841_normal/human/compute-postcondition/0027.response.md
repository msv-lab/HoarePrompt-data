The value of `rem` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `rem` is the count of unique integers in `arr`, and since `rem` is reduced by 1, it will now reflect one less unique integer. The other variables (`freq`, `vis`, `arr`, `n`, `ans`, `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `freq` contains the updated frequency count for the integer at index `i`, `vis` remains unchanged, `arr` remains unchanged, `n` is a positive integer, `rem` is the count of unique integers in `arr` decreased by 1, `ans` is 0, and `i` is the first element of `arr`.

Output State: **`freq` contains the updated frequency count for the integer at index `i`, `vis` remains unchanged, `arr` remains unchanged, `n` is a positive integer, `rem` is the count of unique integers in `arr` decreased by 1, `ans` is 0, `i` is the first element of `arr`**
