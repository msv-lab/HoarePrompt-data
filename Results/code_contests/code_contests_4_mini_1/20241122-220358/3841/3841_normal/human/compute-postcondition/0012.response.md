The value of `vis[i]` is set to 0, changing the value at the index `i` in the list `vis`. The initial value of `i` is the second element in the list `arr`, and `freq[i]` remains unchanged at 1. The other variables `n` and `arr` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in `arr`, `freq[i]` is 1, and `vis[i]` is now 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in `arr`, `freq[i]` is 1, and `vis[i]` is now 0**
