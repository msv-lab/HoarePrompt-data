The value of `freq[i]` is incremented by 1. Since `freq` initially maps `i` to 0, after execution, `freq[i]` will be 1. As a result, if the frequency of `i` in `freq` was zero, `vis[i]` would be set to 0, but since `freq[i]` is now 1, `vis` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of integers with at least one element, `i` is the first element in `arr`, `freq[i]` is 1, and `vis` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of integers with at least one element, `i` is the first element in `arr`, `freq[i]` is 1, and `vis` remains unchanged**
