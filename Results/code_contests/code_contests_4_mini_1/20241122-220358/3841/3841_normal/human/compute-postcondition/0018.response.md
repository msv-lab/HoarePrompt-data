Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, and `i` is the third element in `arr`. If `freq[i]` is 0, then `vis[i]` is set to 0. If `freq[i]` is not 0, `vis[i]` remains unchanged. Given that `freq[i]` starts at 2, `vis[i]` will not be altered in this execution.***
