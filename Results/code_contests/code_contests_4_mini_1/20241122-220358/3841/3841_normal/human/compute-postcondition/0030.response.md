The value of `ans` is incremented by `rem`. The previous state of `rem` remains unchanged if `freq[i]` is not 0, and we don't have specific values for `freq`, `rem`, or `ans` provided. Therefore, the output state reflects that the count of `ans` has been increased by the current value of `rem`, but the specific values of `rem` and `ans` are unknown.

Output State: **`freq` contains the updated frequency count for the integer at index `i`, `vis` remains unchanged, `arr` remains unchanged, `n` is a positive integer, `vis[i]` is false, and `ans` is increased by `rem`.**
