The variable `vis` is updated to include a key `i` with a value of 0. The initial state indicates that `i` is the first element of `arr`, and `vis` was previously an empty dictionary. Therefore, after the execution, the state of `vis` will now include `i` mapped to 0. The other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in `arr`, `freq` is a dictionary with `i` mapped to 0, `vis` is a dictionary with `i` mapped to 0, and the frequency of `i` in `freq` is zero.**
