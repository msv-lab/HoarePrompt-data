The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. It operates on the constraints that `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and `arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^5). The function's output depends on these two conditions. However, the specifics of the output based on these inputs are not provided in the prompt. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact return value.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and a list of integers arr where each integer a_i satisfies (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^5), but the specific return value based on these inputs is not defined.**
