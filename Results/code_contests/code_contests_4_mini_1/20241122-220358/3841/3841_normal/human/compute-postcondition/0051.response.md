The function `func` accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of integers `arr` read from user input. It calculates the number of unique integers in `arr` that have not been visited before, incrementing a counter `ans` each time a new unique integer is encountered. The counter reflects how many unique integers have been seen for the first time while iterating through `arr`. At the end of the execution, it prints the value of `ans`, which is the total count of these unique integers processed.

However, the function does not explicitly return any value; it only prints the result, which could lead to confusion if the user expects a return value. Additionally, if `arr` is empty, the function will still attempt to execute, leading to no output since there would be no integers to process.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of integers `arr`, calculates the number of unique integers that are encountered for the first time in `arr`, and prints this count. Note that if `arr` is empty, no output is produced, and the function does not return any value. **
