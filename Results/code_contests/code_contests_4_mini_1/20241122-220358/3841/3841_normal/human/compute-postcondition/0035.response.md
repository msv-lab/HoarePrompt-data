The value of `rem` is decreased by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `rem`.

Output State: **`freq` remains unchanged, `vis` shows the next element in `arr` that has not been visited, `arr` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `ans` remains unchanged, and `rem` is decreased by 1**.
