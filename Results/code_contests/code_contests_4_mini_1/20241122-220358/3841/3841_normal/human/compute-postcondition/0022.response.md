The variable `rem` is assigned the value of `len(set(arr))`, where `set(arr)` creates a set from the list `arr`, effectively removing any duplicate integers and allowing us to count the unique integers. The value of `rem` will therefore be the number of unique integers in `arr`. The previous states of the variables `freq` and `vis` are not affected. 

Thus, the output state is: `freq` contains the frequency count of each unique integer in `arr`, `vis` contains keys for each unique integer in `arr` that appears for the first time, `arr` is a list of integers with at least `n` elements, `n` is a positive integer, and `rem` is the count of unique integers in `arr`.
