The value of `freq[i]` is decremented by 1, but the previous value of `freq[i]` is not specified, so the specific result of this operation cannot be determined. The values of `freq`, `vis`, `arr`, and `n` remain unchanged, and the state of `i` is defined as the next element in `arr`. Therefore, the Output State is: `freq`, `vis`, `arr`, and `n` remain unchanged; `freq[i]` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`freq`, `vis`, `arr`, and `n` remain unchanged; `freq[i]` is decreased by 1**
