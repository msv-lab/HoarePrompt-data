Postcondition: ***`freq` contains the updated frequency count for the integer at index `i`, `vis` remains unchanged, `arr` remains unchanged, `n` is a positive integer, if `vis[i]` was initially 0, then `vis[i]` is set to 1, and `ans` is increased by `rem`. If `vis[i]` was already 1, then `ans` remains unchanged. If `freq[i]` is 0, then `rem` is decreased by 1, and `ans` is set to 0; otherwise, `rem` remains unchanged.***
