Output State: **`freq` contains the updated frequency counts for each integer in `arr`, `vis` indicates which integers have been visited, `arr` remains unchanged, `n` is a positive integer, `rem` is the count of unique integers that have not been visited, and `ans` is the total count incremented by `rem` for each unique integer visited for the first time. If `arr` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `freq`, `vis`, `rem`, and `ans` remain unchanged. If all integers in `arr` have been visited before the loop completes, `rem` will equal 0 at the end, and `ans` will not be incremented further.**
