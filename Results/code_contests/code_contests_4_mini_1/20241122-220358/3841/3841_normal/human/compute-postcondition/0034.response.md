The value of `freq[i]` is decremented by 1. The specific value of `i` is necessary to determine the new value of `freq[i]`, but it remains unchanged in the output state as we do not know its previous value. The other variables (`vis`, `arr`, `n`, `ans`, `rem`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `freq` remains unchanged, `vis` shows the next element in `arr` that has not been visited, `arr` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `ans` remains unchanged, `rem` remains unchanged, and `freq[i]` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`freq` remains unchanged, `vis` shows the next element in `arr` that has not been visited, `arr` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `ans` remains unchanged, `rem` remains unchanged, and `freq[i]` is decreased by 1.**
