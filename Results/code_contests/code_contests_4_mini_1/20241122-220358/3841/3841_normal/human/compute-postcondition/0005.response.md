The code `freq[i] = freq.get(i, 0)` checks if the key `i` exists in the dictionary `freq`. If `i` is present in `freq`, it retrieves its value; otherwise, it returns `0`. The value retrieved (or `0` if `i` is not present) is then assigned to `freq[i]`. 

Since `freq` is currently an empty dictionary and `i` is the first element in `arr`, the assignment will set `freq[i]` to `0`, as `i` is not present in `freq` initially.

The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in `arr`, `freq` is {i: 0}, `vis` is an empty dictionary**
