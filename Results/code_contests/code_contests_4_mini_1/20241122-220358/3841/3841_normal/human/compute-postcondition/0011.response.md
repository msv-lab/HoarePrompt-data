The code snippet assigns `freq[i]` the value of `freq.get(i, 0)`. The `get` method checks if the key `i` exists in the `freq` dictionary. If `i` exists, it returns the current value associated with `i`, which is 1 (as stated in the initial conditions). If `i` does not exist, it would return the default value 0. Since `freq[i]` is currently 1, after the assignment, `freq[i]` will still be 1, and no other variables are affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in `arr`, `freq[i]` is 1 (remains unchanged), and `vis` remains unchanged**.
