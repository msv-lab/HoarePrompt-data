Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of integers with at least one element, `i` is the first element in `arr`, `freq` is a dictionary with `i` mapped to 0, and `vis` is a dictionary. If the frequency of `i` in `freq` is zero, then `vis[i]` is set to 0. In all other cases, `vis` remains unchanged.***
