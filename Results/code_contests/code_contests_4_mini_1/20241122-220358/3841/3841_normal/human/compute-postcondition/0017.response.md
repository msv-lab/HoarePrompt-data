The value of `vis[i]` is assigned 0, where `i` is the third element in `arr`. The previous value of `vis[i]` remains unchanged before this assignment. Since `freq[i]` is given as 2, it is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in `arr`, `freq[i]` is 2, and `vis[i]` is now 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in `arr`, `freq[i]` is 2, and `vis[i]` is now 0**
