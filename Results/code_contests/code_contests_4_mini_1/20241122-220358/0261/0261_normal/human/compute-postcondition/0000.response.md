The variable `alphabet` is assigned the value obtained from `raw_input()`, which accepts an input as a string. The values of `a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, and `a_4` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code. Therefore, the output state is: `a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, and `a_4` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100; `alphabet` is an input string.

Output State: **`a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, and `a_4` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100; `alphabet` is an input string**
