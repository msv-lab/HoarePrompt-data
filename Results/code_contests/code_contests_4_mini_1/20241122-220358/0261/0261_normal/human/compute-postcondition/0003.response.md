The `sort()` method is called on the list `data`, which arranges its elements in ascending order. The integers `a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, and `a_4` are not directly affected by this operation, as they are separate variables. The output state reflects the sorted state of the list `data`.

Output State: **`a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, and `a_4` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100; `data` is sorted in ascending order**
