The code `data = [int(i) for i in data]` converts each element in the list `data` from a substring to an integer. The initial state indicates that `data` is a list of substrings derived from the `alphabet`, and we do not have specific values for `data` at this moment. Therefore, the output state is dependent on the conversion of each element in `data`, which will now be integers.

Output State: **`a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, and `a_4` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100; `data` is a list of integers.**
