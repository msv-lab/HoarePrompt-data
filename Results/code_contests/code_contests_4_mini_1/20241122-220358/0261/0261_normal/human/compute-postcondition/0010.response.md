Functionality: ** The function reads a line of input consisting of four space-separated integers, splits them into a list, converts them to integers, and sorts the list. It then checks if either the sum of the smallest and largest integers equals the sum of the middle two integers or if the sum of the three smallest integers equals the largest integer. It prints 'YES' if either condition is met; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not explicitly handle cases where the input does not contain exactly four integers or where the input values are outside the 1 to 100 range, which could lead to runtime errors or incorrect outputs. **
