The code executes a print statement that outputs 'NO'. The values of the variables `a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, and `a_4` do not change, and the state of `data` is not altered by this print operation. Therefore, the output state is the unchanged values of the variables along with the print output.

Output State: **`a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, and `a_4` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100; `data` is sorted in ascending order; the output is 'NO'**
