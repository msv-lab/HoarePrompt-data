The variable `data` is assigned the value of `alphabet.split()`, which splits the `alphabet` string into a list of substrings based on whitespace. The values of `a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, and `a_4` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this operation. The output state will reflect the unchanged integer values of `a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, and `a_4`, and the new variable `data`, which is a list of substrings derived from the string `alphabet`.

Output State: **`a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, and `a_4` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100; `data` is a list of substrings from `alphabet`**
