Postcondition: ***`a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, and `a_4` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100, and `data` is sorted. If the sum of `data[0]` and `data[3]` equals the sum of `data[1]` and `data[2]`, or if the sum of `data[0]`, `data[1]`, and `data[2]` equals `data[3]`, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. This captures all scenarios, including cases where the sums are equal or not, while ensuring the values of `a_i` remain within the specified range.***
