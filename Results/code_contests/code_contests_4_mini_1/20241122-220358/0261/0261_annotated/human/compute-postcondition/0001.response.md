The `alphabet` string is split into a list of substrings based on whitespace, and the result is assigned to `data`. The initial values of `a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, and `a_4` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, and `a_4` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100; `data` is a list of substrings from `alphabet`.

Output State: **`a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, and `a_4` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100; `data` is a list of substrings from `alphabet`**
