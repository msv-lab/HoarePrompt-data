Functionality: ** The function accepts input from the user, which is expected to be a space-separated string of four integers (a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4) in the range of 1 to 100. It checks if either the sum of the smallest and largest integers equals the sum of the two middle integers, or if the sum of the three smallest integers equals the largest integer. It prints 'YES' if either condition is true and 'NO' otherwise. The function does not return any values; it only prints output. **
