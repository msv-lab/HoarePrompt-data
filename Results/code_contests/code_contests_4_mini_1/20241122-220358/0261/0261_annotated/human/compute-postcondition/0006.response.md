Postcondition: ***`a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, and `a_4` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100; `data` is now sorted. The sum of the first and fourth elements of `data` is not equal to the sum of the second and third elements, and the sum of the first, second, and third elements of `data` is not equal to the fourth element.***
