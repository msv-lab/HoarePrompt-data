The `data` list is sorted in ascending order. The previous values of `a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, and `a_4` are not directly affected by the sorting of `data`, but the order of the elements within `data` will change. The output state reflects that `data` is now sorted, while the values of `a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, and `a_4` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, and `a_4` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100; `data` is now sorted.**
