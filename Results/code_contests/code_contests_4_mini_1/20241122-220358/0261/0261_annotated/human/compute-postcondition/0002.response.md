The variable `data` is assigned a new value, which is a list created by converting each substring in the original `data` list to an integer using a list comprehension. Since `data` contains substrings and we are converting them to integers, the new value of `data` will be a list of integers.

The initial values of `a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, and `a_4` do not influence the transformation of `data`, and the state of these integer variables remains unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, and `a_4` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100; `data` is now a list of integers derived from its previous substrings.

Output State: **`a_1`, `a_2`, `a_3`, and `a_4` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100; `data` is now a list of integers derived from its previous substrings.**
