To determine the correctness of the provided program, we analyze its logic against the problem description.

The problem requires us to check if it's possible to distribute four bags of candies to two friends such that both friends receive the same total amount of candies. Each bag must be given to one of the friends, and we cannot keep any bags.

The program sorts the list of candies and checks two conditions:
1. If the sum of the smallest and largest bag equals the sum of the two middle bags.
2. If the sum of the three smallest bags equals the largest bag.

Let's consider some cases to see if the program handles all scenarios correctly.

### Case Analysis:

1. **Input: `1 7 11 5`**
   - Sorted: `[1, 5, 7, 11]`
   - Condition 1: `1 + 11 == 5 + 7` → `12 == 12` (True)
   - Output: `YES` (Correct)

2. **Input: `7 3 2 5`**
   - Sorted: `[2, 3, 5, 7]`
   - Condition 1: `2 + 7 == 3 + 5` → `9 == 8` (False)
   - Condition 2: `2 + 3 + 5 == 7` → `10 == 7` (False)
   - Output: `NO` (Correct)

3. **Input: `2 2 2 2`**
   - Sorted: `[2, 2, 2, 2]`
   - Condition 1: `2 + 2 == 2 + 2` → `4 == 4` (True)
   - Output: `YES` (Correct)

4. **Input: `4 4 4 4`**
   - Sorted: `[4, 4, 4, 4]`
   - Condition 1: `4 + 4 == 4 + 4` → `8 == 8` (True)
   - Output: `YES` (Correct)

5. **Input: `1 1 1 1`**
   - Sorted: `[1, 1, 1, 1]`
   - Condition 1: `1 + 1 == 1 + 1` → `2 == 2` (True)
   - Output: `YES` (Correct)

6. **Input: `1 1 1 2`**
   - Sorted: `[1, 1, 1, 2]`
   - Condition 1: `1 + 2 == 1 + 1` → `3 == 2` (False)
   - Condition 2: `1 + 1 + 1 == 2` → `3 == 2` (False)
   - Output: `NO` (Correct)

### Potential Edge Case:
Consider the input `1 2 3 4`:
- Sorted: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`
- Condition 1: `1 + 4 == 2 + 3` → `5 == 5` (True)
- Output: `YES` (Correct)

However, let's consider the case `1, 2, 2, 3`:
- Sorted: `[1, 2, 2, 3]`
- Condition 1: `1 + 3 == 2 + 2` → `4 == 4` (True)
- Output: `YES` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
After evaluating various test cases and edge cases, the program consistently produces the correct output according to the problem description. The conditions checked by the program effectively cover all possible distributions of bags.

Correctness: **True**
