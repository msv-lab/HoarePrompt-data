To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the code:

1. The problem requires finding the nth integer \( z_n \) for which the equation is unsolvable in positive integers.
2. The provided code seems to use a predefined list of integers \( a \) which appears to correlate with precomputed values of \( z \) for given indices.
3. The input \( n \) is taken from the user, which must be an integer in the range \( 1 \leq n \leq 40 \).
4. The program computes a value based on \( a[n] \).

Now, let's examine the specific line of code that performs the computation:
```python
print(pow(2, a[n], 2 * (10 ** 9 + 7)) / 2 - 1) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
```
The key issues to consider are:

- **Indexing**: Python uses 0-based indexing, but the problem's example inputs suggest 1-based indexing. Thus, providing \( n = 1 \) would access \( a[1] = 2 \), which is the second element, not the first. This discrepancy leads to incorrect results for all values of \( n \) provided as input.

- **Division and Modulo**: The division by 2 could lead to issues with integer division in Python 3, especially since the result of the `pow` function is used directly in a float operation before applying the modulo. This could cause inaccuracies.

- **Output**: The output may not correspond correctly to the expected output as stated in the problem description due to the above issues.

Let's consider a specific case:
- If we input \( n = 1 \):
  - The code attempts to access \( a[1] \) which is \( 2 \).
  - It calculates \( pow(2, 2, 2000000014) / 2 - 1 \).
  - This will not yield the expected output of \( z_1 \) which is \( 1 \).

Since the program does not handle the indexing correctly and potentially produces incorrect results due to division before taking modulo, we can decisively conclude:

Correctness: **False** 

The program fails to correctly implement the logic required by the problem description for various inputs, specifically due to the indexing issue and how the calculations are done.
