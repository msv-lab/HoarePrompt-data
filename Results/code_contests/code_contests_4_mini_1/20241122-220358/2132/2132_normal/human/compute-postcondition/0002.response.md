To compute the output state based on the provided code and initial state, we need to analyze the code snippet step by step.

The initial state is:
- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 40.
- `a` is a list of integers.

The code snippet:
```
print(pow(2, a[n], 2 * (10 ** 9 + 7)) / 2 - 1) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
```

1. The expression `pow(2, a[n], 2 * (10 ** 9 + 7))` calculates \( 2^{a[n]} \mod (2 \times (10^9 + 7)) \).
2. The value of `a[n]` depends on the value of `n`. The list `a` has predefined values, and we can substitute `a[n]` accordingly.
3. The result of `pow(2, a[n], 2 * (10 ** 9 + 7))` is then divided by 2.
4. After that, we subtract 1 from the result of the division.
5. Finally, we take the result modulo \( (10^9 + 7) \).

As an example, if we assume `n = 5`, we substitute `a[5]` which is `13`. Thus, we compute:
- \( 2^{13} \mod (2 \times (10^9 + 7)) \)
- Then divide the result by 2 and subtract 1.
- Finally, take that result modulo \( (10^9 + 7) \).

However, since `n` is unspecified in the problem statement, we will denote the output state generically based on the calculations performed. The final output state will reflect the variables `n`, `a[n]`, and the printed result, which is a mathematical expression depending on `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 40; `a[n]` is the corresponding value from the list, and the result is calculated from pow(2, a[n], 2 * (10 ** 9 + 7)) / 2 - 1) % (10 ** 9 + 7)**.
