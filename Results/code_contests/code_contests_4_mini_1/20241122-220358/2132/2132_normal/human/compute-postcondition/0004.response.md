Functionality: ** The function does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer input `n`, which should be within the range 0 to 40 (inclusive). It uses this input to index into a predefined list of integers, computes a value using the formula `(2^a[n] / 2 - 1) % (10^9 + 7)`, and then prints the result. However, if `n` is outside the valid range (0 to 40), the function will raise an `IndexError` due to attempting to access an invalid index in the list `a`. Additionally, the division by 2 in the calculation could lead to floating-point inaccuracies, but the output is intended to be an integer modulo `10^9 + 7`.**
