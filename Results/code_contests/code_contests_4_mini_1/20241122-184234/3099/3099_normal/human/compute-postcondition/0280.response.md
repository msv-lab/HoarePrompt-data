The value of `y0` is assigned `False`, changing its previous value from `True` to `False`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected, so the output state is: `good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`, `pattern` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?", and at most one "*", `n` is greater than 0, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `y0` is False, `i` is 1, `p0len` is greater than 1, and the output is 'NO'.
