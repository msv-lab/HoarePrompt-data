Postcondition: ***`plen` is greater than 0, `y` is True, `p` and `q` are strings of equal length, and for every index `i`, if `p[i]` is equal to `q[i]` or if `p[i]` is '?' and `q[i]` is in `good_letters`, then `y` remains True. Additionally, if `p[i]` is '?' and `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, or if `p[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, then `y` would have been False, but since we are in the if condition where `y` is True, it indicates that these conditions do not hold for all valid indices.`**
