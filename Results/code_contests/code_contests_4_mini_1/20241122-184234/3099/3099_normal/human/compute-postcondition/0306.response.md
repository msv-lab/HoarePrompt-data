The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `y0` is True, `y1` is False, `p1len` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, the first element of `p1` at index `i` is equal to '?', and the value of `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
