The variable `y` is assigned the value `False`. The previous value of `y` was `True`, so after executing the code, `y` changes to `False`. The values of `i` and `plen` remain unaffected. The output state reflects these changes.

Output State: **`y` is False, `i` is 2, `plen` is greater than 0, and 'NO' is printed**
