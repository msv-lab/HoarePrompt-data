The value of `y1` is assigned `False`, and it does not depend on the previous value of `y1`. The variables `y0` remains unchanged, `i` is 2, and `p1len` is greater than 2, while the output is 'NO'. Therefore, the Output State is: `y0` remains unchanged, `y1` is False, `i` is 2, `p1len` is greater than 2, and the output is 'NO'.

Output State: **`y0` remains unchanged, `y1` is False, `i` is 2, `p1len` is greater than 2, and the output is 'NO'**
