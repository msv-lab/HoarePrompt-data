Postcondition: ***If `plen` is greater than 0 and `y` is True, indicating that all relevant characters in `p` and `q` are either equal or valid according to the rules, the program prints 'YES'. If `plen` is 0 or `n` is not greater than 1, the loop does not execute, and `y` remains True, leading to no output. In cases where `y` is False, the conditions for printing 'YES' are not met, and thus, 'YES' is not printed.***
