Postcondition: ***If `p1len` is greater than 0 and `y1` is False, the current iteration of the loop is skipped. This occurs when either any `p1[i]` is '?' and `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, or if `p1[i]` is not '?' and does not match `qr[i]`. If `p1len` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `y1` remains True. An IndexError may occur if `p1len` exceeds the length of `qr`, but the loop will not run under this condition.***
