Postcondition: ***`y` is True initially, `i` is 0, and `plen` is greater than 0. If the element at index `i` of the list `q` is not in `good_letters`, the output is 'NO', `y` is set to False, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the element at index `i` of `q` is in `good_letters`, `y` remains True, and no changes are made to `y`.***
