The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `y0` remains unchanged, `y1` is False, `p1len` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `qr` is the reversed value of `q`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
