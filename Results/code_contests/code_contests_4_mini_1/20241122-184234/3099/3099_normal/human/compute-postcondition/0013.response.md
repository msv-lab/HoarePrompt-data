The variable `y` is assigned the value `True`, but there are no previous values for `y` mentioned in the initial state. The other variables remain unaffected, and since there is no conditional statement or further logic to execute based on the value of `y`, the output state will simply reflect the assignment.

Output State: **`y` is True**
