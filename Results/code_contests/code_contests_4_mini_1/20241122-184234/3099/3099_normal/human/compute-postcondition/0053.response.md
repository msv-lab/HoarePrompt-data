To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the provided information step by step.

1. **Understanding the Loop's Execution**: The loop iterates `n` times, and the variable `_` is used as a loop variable. The loop's continuation depends solely on the value of `n`.

2. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**: 
   - If `y` is True, it indicates that the loop's conditions for printing 'NO' were not met, and thus 'YES' was printed. 
   - If `y` is False, it implies at least one condition for printing 'NO' was met during the iteration, and 'YES' was not printed.

3. **Identifying the Current Loop Condition**: 
   - The loop will execute as long as the loop variable has not reached its limit, which is `n`. The current iteration count is not directly provided, but since the loop is structured as `for _ in range(n)`, we can infer that if the loop has executed once, the loop variable `_` will have taken on values starting from 0 up to `n-1`.

4. **Adjustment of States**: 
   - To execute the loop one more time, the loop variable would need to be incremented, indicating that the current count of iterations is less than `n`. Therefore, if the loop has executed at least once already, we need to ensure that the number of iterations is still less than `n`.
   - Since we have no specific information about the current iteration index, we can assume it has iterated up to `n-1`, thus requiring `n` to be greater than that.

5. **Final State Adjustment**: 
   - For the loop to run again, we must ensure that the loop variable's condition allows for another iteration. Therefore, `n` must be at least 1 greater than the current value of `_` (which would be `n-1`).

Based on this reasoning:

State: **`y` is True, `n` is greater than 1**
