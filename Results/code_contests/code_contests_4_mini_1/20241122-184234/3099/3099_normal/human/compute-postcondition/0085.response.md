The code executes the `print` statement, which outputs the string 'NO'. The variables `y`, `i`, and `plen` are not changed by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `y` is initially True, `i` is the current index, `plen` is greater than `i`, and 'NO' is printed.

Output State: **`y` is initially True, `i` is the current index, `plen` is greater than `i`, and 'NO' is printed**
