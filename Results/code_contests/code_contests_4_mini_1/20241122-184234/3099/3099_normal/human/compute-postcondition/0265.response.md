The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`, `pattern` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?", and at most one "*", `n` is greater than 0, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `y0` is False, `i` is 0, `p0len` is greater than 0, `p0` is a question mark ("?"), the character at index `i` of `q` is not in `good_letters`, and the output is 'NO' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
