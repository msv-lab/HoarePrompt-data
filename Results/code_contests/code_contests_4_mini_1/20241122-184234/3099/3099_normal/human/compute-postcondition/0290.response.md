The value of `y0` is assigned `False`. The previous value of `y0` was `True`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`, `pattern` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?", and at most one "*", `n` is greater than 0, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `y0` is False, `i` is 2, `p0len` is greater than 1, and the function prints 'NO'.
