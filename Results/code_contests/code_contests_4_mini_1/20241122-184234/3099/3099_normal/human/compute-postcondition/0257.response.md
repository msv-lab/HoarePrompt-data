The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables, but it instructs the program to skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed with the next iteration. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`, `pattern` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?", and at most one "*", `n` is greater than 0, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, and the output is "NO", and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
