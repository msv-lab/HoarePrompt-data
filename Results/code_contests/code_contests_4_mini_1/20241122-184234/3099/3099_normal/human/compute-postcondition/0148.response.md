The code splits the string `p` at the '*' character into two parts: `p0` and `p1`. The variable `p` is guaranteed to contain at least one '*', so `p0` will hold the substring before the '*' and `p1` will hold the substring after the '*'. The values of `good_letters`, `pattern`, `n`, and `gls` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`, `pattern` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?", and at most one "*", `n` is an input string, `gls` is a string input from the user, `p` is a string input from the user containing at least one "*", `plen` is the length of `p` which is greater than or equal to 1; `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the substring after '*'**
