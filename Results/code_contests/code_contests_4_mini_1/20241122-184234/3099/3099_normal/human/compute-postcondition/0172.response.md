Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`, `pattern` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?", and at most one "*", `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `gls` is a string input from the user, `p` is a string input from the user containing at least one "*", `plen` is the length of `p` which is greater than or equal to 1; `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the reversed substring after '*', `p0len` is greater than 0, `p1len` is the length of `p1`, `q` is an input string from the user, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `qlen` is greater than or equal to `plen - 1`, and `i` is 0. If the character at position `i` in `p0` is not a '?' and is different from the character at position `i` in `q`, `y0` is set to False and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues without changing `y0`.***
