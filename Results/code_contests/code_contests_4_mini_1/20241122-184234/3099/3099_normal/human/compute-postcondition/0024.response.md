The value of `y` is assigned `False`, changing its previous value from `True` to `False`. The other variables (`i` and `plen`) and conditions involving `p[i]` and `q[i]` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `y`, while maintaining the other variable states.

Output State: **`y` is False, `i` is 0, `plen` is greater than 0, the element `p[i]` is not equal to '?', and the element `p[i]` is not equal to the element `q[i]`, and 'NO' is printed.**
