Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`, `pattern` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?", and at most one "*"; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `gls` is a string input from the user; `p` is a string input from the user containing at least one "*"; `plen` is the length of `p` which is greater than or equal to 1; `p0` is the substring before '*'; `p1` is the reversed substring after '*'; `p0len` is greater than or equal to 0; `p1len` is greater than 0; `q` is an input string from the user; `qlen` is the length of `q`; `qlen` is greater than or equal to `plen - 1`; `y0` is False; `y1` is either False or True depending on the subsequent conditions; `qr` is the reversed string of `q`; `i` is an integer equal to 0; if the character at index `i` of `qr` is not in `good_letters`, then 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, indicating that the condition for character matching has not been satisfied. If the character is in `good_letters`, the program continues without any assigned action in this fragment.***
