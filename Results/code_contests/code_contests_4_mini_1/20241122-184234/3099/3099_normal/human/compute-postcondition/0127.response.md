The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `plen` is greater than 0, `y` is False, `n` is greater than 1, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, `i` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
