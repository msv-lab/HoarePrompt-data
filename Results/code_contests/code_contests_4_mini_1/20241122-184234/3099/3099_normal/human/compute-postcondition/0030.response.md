The value of `y` is assigned the value `False`. The previous value of `y` was `True`, but it is now updated to `False`. The values of the other variables `i` and `plen` are not affected. Additionally, the string 'NO' is printed, but this does not affect the state of the variables. Therefore, the output state is: `y` is False, `i` is 1, `plen` is greater than 0, and 'NO' is printed.

Output State: **`y` is False, `i` is 1, `plen` is greater than 0, and 'NO' is printed**
