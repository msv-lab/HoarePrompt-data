`y` is assigned the value `False`, changing its state from `True` to `False`. The values of `i` and `plen` remain unaffected, and 'NO' has already been printed prior to this code execution. Therefore, the output state is: `y` is False, `i` is 1, `plen` is greater than 0, and 'NO' is printed.

Output State: **`y` is False, `i` is 1, `plen` is greater than 0, and 'NO' is printed**
