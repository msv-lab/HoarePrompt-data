According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `plen`. At the end of the last iteration, `plen` is greater than 0, and `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2, and `plen` should still be greater than 2. 

The state change required is to ensure that `plen` is greater than 2 so that the loop can continue executing. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`plen` is greater than 2, `y` is a boolean value, `n` is greater than 1, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, and `i` is 2**
