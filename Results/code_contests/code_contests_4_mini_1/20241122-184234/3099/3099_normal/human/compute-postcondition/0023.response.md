The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'NO'. This does not change any of the variable states, but it results in the output of the specified string. 

The values of `y`, `i`, and `plen` remain unchanged. Thus, the output state reflects only the printed result.

Output State: **`y` is True, `i` is 0, `plen` is greater than 0, the element `p[i]` is not equal to '?', and the element `p[i]` is not equal to the element `q[i]`, and 'NO' is printed.**
