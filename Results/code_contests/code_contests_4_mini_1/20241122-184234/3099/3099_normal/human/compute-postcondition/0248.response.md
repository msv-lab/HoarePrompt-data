The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. In this context, it means that the execution will skip any code that follows it within the loop for the current iteration and continue with the next loop iteration. The values of the variables do not change, but we do not execute the remaining code in the current loop iteration. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`, `pattern` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?", and at most one "*", `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `gls` is a string input from the user, `p` is a string input from the user containing at least one "*", `plen` is the length of `p` which is greater than or equal to 1, `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the reversed substring after '*', `p0len` is greater than or equal to 0, `p1len` is the length of `p1`, `q` is an input string from the user, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `qlen` is greater than or equal to `plen - 1`, `y0` is False, `y1` is set to False, `t` is determined based on the value of `p1len`, and the function prints 'NO' and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
