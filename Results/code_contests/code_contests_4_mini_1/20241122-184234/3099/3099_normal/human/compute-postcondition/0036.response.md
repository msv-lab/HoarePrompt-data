Postcondition: ***`y` is True, `i` is 1, and `plen` is greater than 0. If the elements `p[i]` and `q[i]` are not equal, 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `p[i]` is equal to `q[i]`, the values of `y`, `i`, and `plen` remain unchanged.***
