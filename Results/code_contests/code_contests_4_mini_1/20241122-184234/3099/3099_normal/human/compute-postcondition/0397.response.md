The execution of the `continue` statement does not change any variable values. Instead, it causes the program to skip the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Since `y0` is False, it indicates that there was either a mismatch or an invalid character found, but the loop will continue executing in the next iteration without altering the state of `y0` or any other variables.

Output State: **`y0` is False, and the loop will continue to the next iteration.**
