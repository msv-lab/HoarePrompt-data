The value of `y1` is assigned the value `False`. The previous value of `y1` was `True`, so now it changes to `False`. Other variables such as `y0`, `qr`, `p1len`, `i`, and the characters at index `i` of `p1` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `y0` remains unchanged, `y1` is False, `qr` is the reversed value of `q`, `p1len` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, the character at index `i` of `p1` is not equal to '?', and the character at index `i` of `p1` is not equal to the character at index `i` of `qr`, and 'NO' is printed.

Output State: **`y0` remains unchanged, `y1` is False, `qr` is the reversed value of `q`, `p1len` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, the character at index `i` of `p1` is not equal to '?', and the character at index `i` of `p1` is not equal to the character at index `i` of `qr`, and 'NO' is printed.**
