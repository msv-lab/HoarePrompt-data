Postcondition: ***`y0` remains unchanged, and `y1` is set to False if either the first character of `p1` is '?' and the character at index `i` of `qr` is not in `good_letters`, or if the first character of `p1` is not equal to the corresponding character of `qr` at index `i`. If neither condition is met, `y1` remains True. Additionally, `qr` is the reversed value of `q`, `p1len` is greater than 0, and `i` is 0.***
