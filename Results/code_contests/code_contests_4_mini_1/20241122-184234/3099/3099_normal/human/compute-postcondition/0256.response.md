The `print('NO')` statement outputs the string "NO" to the console. This does not change any variable values or states but simply produces output. The previous states of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`, `pattern` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?", and at most one "*", `n` is greater than 0, `q` is an input string, and `qlen` is the length of `q`, and the output is "NO".
