Postcondition: ***Given that `p1len` is greater than 0, `y1` is False, `y0` is False, `t` is a slice of `q`, `n` is greater than 1, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, `p0len` is greater than 0, and `i` is 1, if the character at index `i` of `p0` is a question mark (`?`), then if the character `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, the program prints 'NO', sets `y0` to False, and breaks out of the loop; if `q[i]` is in `good_letters`, no changes occur. If the character at index `i` of `p0` is not a question mark, then if it does not match the character at index `i` of `q`, the program prints 'NO', sets `y0` to False, and breaks out of the loop; if it does match, there are no changes to `y0` or output.***
