Postcondition: ***`p1len` is greater than 0, `y1` is False, `y0` is True, `t` is a slice of `q`, `n` is greater than 1, and `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`. If `qlen` is less than `p1len - 1`, the program outputs 'NO'. There is no output if `qlen` is greater than or equal to `p1len - 1`.***
