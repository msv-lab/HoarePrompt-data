Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`, `pattern` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?", and at most one "*". Both `y0` and `y1` are true, indicating that specific conditions related to them are satisfied. The intersection of the set of characters in substring `t` with `good_letters` is still non-empty, and 'NO' may have been printed in a previous iteration, or `t` contains none of the `good_letters`, allowing the program to continue executing the remaining code.***
