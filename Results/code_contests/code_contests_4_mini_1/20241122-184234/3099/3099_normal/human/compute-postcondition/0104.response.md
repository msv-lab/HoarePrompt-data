Postcondition: ***`plen` is greater than 0, `y` is True, `n` is greater than 1, and `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`. If `qlen` is not equal to `plen`, the function prints 'NO'. If `qlen` is equal to `plen`, no output is produced and the execution continues without any changes to the state.***
