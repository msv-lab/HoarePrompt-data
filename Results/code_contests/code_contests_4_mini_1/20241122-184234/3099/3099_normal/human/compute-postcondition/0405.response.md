The value of `y1` is set to `False`, changing its previous value from `True` to `False`. The other variables `y0`, `qr`, `p1len`, `i`, and the first element of `p1` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `y0` remains unchanged, `y1` is False, `qr` is the reversed value of `q`, `p1len` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, the first element of `p1` is equal to '?', and the character at index `i` of `qr` is not in `good_letters`, and 'NO' is printed.
