The statement `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. In this case, it does not change the values of any variables. Given that `good_letters`, `pattern`, `n`, `gls`, `p`, `plen`, `q`, and `qlen` are not affected by this statement, the output state remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`; `pattern` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and "?"; `n` is greater than 0; `gls` is a string input from the user; `p` is a string input from the user that does not contain the character "*"; `plen` is the length of `p`; `q` is an input string; `qlen` is the length of `q`; `qlen` is not equal to `plen`, and the output is 'NO'**
