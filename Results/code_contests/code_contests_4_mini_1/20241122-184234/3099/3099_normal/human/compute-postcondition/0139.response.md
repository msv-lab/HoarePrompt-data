Postcondition: ***`plen` is greater than 2, `y` is a boolean value, `n` is greater than 1, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, and `i` is 2. If `p[i]` is equal to '?', and if `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, the function prints 'NO', sets `y` to False, and breaks out of the loop. If `q[i]` is in `good_letters`, no changes occur to `y`, and execution continues. If `p[i]` is not equal to '?', and if `p[i]` does not equal `q[i]`, the function prints 'NO', sets `y` to False, and breaks out of the loop. If `p[i]` equals `q[i]`, the value of `y` remains unchanged, and execution continues without interruption. All cases ensure that `y` is only set to False when the relevant conditions are met, and the program handles edge cases where `q[i]` is either valid or invalid according to `good_letters`.***
