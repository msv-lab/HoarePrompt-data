According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `plen`. For the loop to execute at least once, `plen` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` will start from 0. Since `y` being True does not affect the execution of the loop, it can remain unchanged. 

State: **`y` is True, `i` is 0, `plen` is greater than 0**
