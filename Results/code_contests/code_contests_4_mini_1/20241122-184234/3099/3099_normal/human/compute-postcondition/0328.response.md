The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of the if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `y0` is True, `p1len` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `y1` is False, 'NO' is printed to the output, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
