The value of `y` is assigned `False`, changing its previous value from `True` to `False`. The values of `i` and `plen` remain unchanged. The output state reflects these changes along with the previous states of the other variables. Therefore, the output state is `y` is now `False`, `i` is 2, and `plen` is greater than 0, and 'NO' is printed.

Output State: **`y` is False, `i` is 2, `plen` is greater than 0, and 'NO' is printed.**
