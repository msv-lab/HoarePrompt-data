The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or the most internal structure we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `y0` remains unchanged, `y1` is False, `p1len` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `qr` is the reversed value of `q`, and 'NO' is printed while we break out of the most internal loop or structure.
