Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`, `pattern` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?", and at most one "*", `n` is greater than 0, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `y0` is a boolean variable, `i` is an integer initialized to 0, and `p0len` is greater than 0. If the character at index `i` of `p0` is not equal to the character at index `i` of `q`, the output is 'NO', `y0` is set to False, and the execution exits the loop. If they are equal, the program continues without any modification to `y0`.***
