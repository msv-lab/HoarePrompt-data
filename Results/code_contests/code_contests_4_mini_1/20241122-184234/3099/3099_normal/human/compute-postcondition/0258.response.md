Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`, `pattern` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?", and at most one "*", `n` is greater than 0, `q` is an input string, and `qlen` is the length of `q`. If the length of `q` (qlen) is less than the length of `pattern` (plen) minus 1, the output is "NO", and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program will proceed without outputting anything for this condition.***
