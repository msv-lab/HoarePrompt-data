The command `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and continue with the next iteration. The values of the variables do not change, but we skip the rest of the current loop iteration. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged for the variables.

Output State: **`p1len` is greater than 0, `y1` is False, `y0` is True, `t` is a slice of `q`, `n` is greater than 1, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, and the output is 'NO'**
