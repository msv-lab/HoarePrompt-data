The function `func` accepts three parameters: `good_letters`, `pattern`, and `n`. 

1. `good_letters` is a string of distinct lowercase English letters.
2. `pattern` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?", and at most one "*".
3. `n` is a positive integer representing the number of query strings.

The function processes the query strings based on the provided `pattern` and `good_letters`. 

Since the output details are not provided, I cannot specify the exact return values or conditions based on the queries. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept a string of good letters, a pattern string, and an integer indicating the number of queries, and return results based on the matching logic involving the pattern and good letters against the query strings.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string of distinct lowercase English letters (`good_letters`), a pattern string (`pattern`), and a positive integer (`n`), representing the number of query strings.
