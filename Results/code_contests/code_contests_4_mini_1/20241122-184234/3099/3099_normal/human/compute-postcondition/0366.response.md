Postcondition: ***`p1len` is greater than 0, `y1` is False, `y0` is False, `t` is a slice of `q`, `n` is greater than 1, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, `p0len` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and the element at index `i` of `p0` is equal to '?'. If the character at index `i` of `q` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed, `y0` remains False, and the execution breaks out of the innermost loop or if statement. If the character is in `good_letters`, the state remains unchanged.***
