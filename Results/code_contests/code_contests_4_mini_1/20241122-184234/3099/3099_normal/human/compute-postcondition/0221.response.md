The variable `y1` is assigned the value `False`, but it was already `False`. Therefore, there is no change in the value of `y1`, and the states of the other variables remain unaffected. The output state reflects that `y1` remains `False` and includes all other initial states.

Output State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`, `pattern` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?", and at most one "*"; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `gls` is a string input from the user; `p` is a string input from the user containing at least one "*"; `plen` is the length of `p` which is greater than or equal to 1; `p0` is the substring before '*'; `p1` is the reversed substring after '*'; `p0len` is greater than or equal to 0; `p1len` is greater than `i`; `q` is an input string from the user; `qlen` is the length of `q`; `qlen` is greater than or equal to `plen - 1`; `y0` is False; `y1` is False; `i` is equal to `p1len - 1`, and the output is 'NO'**.
