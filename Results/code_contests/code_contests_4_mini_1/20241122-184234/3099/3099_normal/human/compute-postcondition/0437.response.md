Postcondition: ***`y0` remains unchanged, `y1` is False, `qr` is the reversed value of `q`, `p1len` is the length of `p1`, and `i` reflects the current index of iteration (0 to `p1len - 1`). There is a character mismatch between `p1` and `qr`, or `p1[i]` is '?' and `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters` for at least one index `i`.***
