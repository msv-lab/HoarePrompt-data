Postcondition: ***`plen` is greater than 0, `y` is a boolean value, `n` is greater than 1, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, and `i` is 1. If the character at index `i` of string `p` is not equal to the character at index `i` of string `q`, then the function prints 'NO', sets `y` to False, and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the characters are equal, the program continues without any changes to `y` or a break statement, maintaining the initial state.***
