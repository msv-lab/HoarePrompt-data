The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `p1len` is greater than 0, `y1` is False, `y0` is False, `t` is a slice of `q`, `n` is greater than 1, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, `p0len` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, and the output is 'NO', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
