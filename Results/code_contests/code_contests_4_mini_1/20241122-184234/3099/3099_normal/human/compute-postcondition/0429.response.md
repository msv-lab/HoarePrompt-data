Postcondition: ***`y0` remains unchanged, `y1` is set to False if the character at index `i` (which is 2) of `qr` is not in `good_letters`, causing the program to print 'NO' and break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `qr[i]` is in `good_letters`, `y1` retains its previous value, and the program continues executing without any changes to `y1`.***
