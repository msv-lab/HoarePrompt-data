Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`, `pattern` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?", and at most one "*"; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `gls` is a string input from the user; `p` is a string input from the user containing at least one "*"; `plen` is the length of `p` which is greater than or equal to 1; `p0` is the substring before '*'; `p1` is the reversed substring after '*'; `p0len` is greater than or equal to 0; `p1len` is greater than `i`; `q` is an input string from the user; `qlen` is the length of `q`; `qlen` is greater than or equal to `plen - 1`; `y0` is False; `y1` is either False or True depending on whether a mismatch was found; if `p1[i]` is "?", and if `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, then 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and execution breaks; if `p1[i]` is not "?" and does not match `qr[i]`, then 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and execution breaks; if both conditions are satisfied, the program continues without changes to `y1` or `y0`.***
