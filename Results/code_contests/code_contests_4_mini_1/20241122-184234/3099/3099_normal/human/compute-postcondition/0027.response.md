Postcondition: ***`y` is True initially, `i` is 0, and `plen` is greater than 0. If the element at index `i` of `p` is '?', and the element at index `i` of `q` is not in `good_letters`, the output is 'NO', `y` is set to False, and the execution breaks out of the loop. If the element at index `i` of `q` is in `good_letters`, `y` remains True. If the element at index `i` of `p` is not '?', and if `p[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, then the output is 'NO', `y` is set to False, and the execution breaks out of the loop; otherwise, `y` remains True. This covers all edge cases regarding the conditions of `p[i]` and `q[i]`.***
