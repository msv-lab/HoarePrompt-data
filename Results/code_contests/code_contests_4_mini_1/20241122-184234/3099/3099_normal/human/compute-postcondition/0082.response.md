Postcondition: ***`y` is initially True, `n` is greater than 1, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, `plen` is greater than 0, and `i` is 1. If the character at index `i` in string `p` is not equal to the character at index `i` in string `q`, then `y` is set to False, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if the characters are equal, `y` remains True, and the program continues without any modifications to `y`.***
