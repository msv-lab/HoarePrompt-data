Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`; `pattern` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and "?"; `n` is greater than 0; `gls` is a string input from the user; `p` is a string input from the user that does not contain the character "*"; `plen` is the length of `p`; `q` is an input string; `qlen` is the length of `q`. If `qlen` is not equal to `plen`, the program outputs 'NO'. If `qlen` equals `plen`, there is no output or action taken.***
