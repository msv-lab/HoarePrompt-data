Postcondition: ***`y0` remains unchanged. If the character at index `i` (which is 2) of `p1` is '?', `y1` is set to False and 'NO' is printed if the character at the same index of `qr` is not in `good_letters`. If `qr[i]` is in `good_letters`, `y1` retains its previous value. If `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`, `y1` is set to False and 'NO' is printed, indicating a mismatch. Thus, `y1` will be False if either condition regarding mismatches or invalid characters is met, while `y0` remains unchanged throughout.***
