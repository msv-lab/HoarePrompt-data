`qlen` is assigned the value of `len(q)`, which calculates the length of the input string `q`. The previous states of the other variables (`plen`, `y`, `n`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `plen` is greater than 0, `y` is True, `n` is greater than 1, and `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`.

Output State: **`plen` is greater than 0, `y` is True, `n` is greater than 1, and `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`**
