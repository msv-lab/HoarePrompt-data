Postcondition: ***`y0` is True, `y1` can be either True or False. If `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, then `y1` is set to False, and the program breaks out of the inner loop. Additionally, `p1len` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and the first element of `p1` at index `i` is equal to '?'. If `qr[i]` is in `good_letters`, then `y1` remains True.***
