Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`, `pattern` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?", and at most one "*"; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `gls` is a string input from the user; `p` is a string input from the user containing at least one "*"; `plen` is the length of `p` which is greater than or equal to 1; `p0` is the substring before '*'; `p1` is the reversed substring after '*'; `p0len` is greater than or equal to 0; `p1len` is greater than `i`; `q` is an input string from the user; `qlen` is the length of `q`; `qlen` is greater than or equal to `plen - 1`; `y0` is False; `i` is equal to `p1len - 1`; if the character `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, then the output is 'NO', `y1` is set to False, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. There are no changes to `y1` or further processing if `qr[i]` is in `good_letters`.***
