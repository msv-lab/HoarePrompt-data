Postcondition: ***`y0` remains unchanged, `y1` is False, `qr` is the reversed value of `q`, `p1len` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and the first element of `p1` is equal to '?'. If the character at index `i` of `qr` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
