The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `y0` is True, `p1len` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `y1` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **`y0` is True, `p1len` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `y1` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
