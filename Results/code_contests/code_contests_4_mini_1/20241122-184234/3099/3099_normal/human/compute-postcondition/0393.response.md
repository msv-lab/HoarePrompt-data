Postcondition: ***`p1len` is greater than 0, `y1` is False, `y0` is False, `t` is a slice of `q`, `n` is greater than 1, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, `p0len` is greater than 2, and `i` is 2. If `p0[i]` is '?', and if `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, the output is 'NO', `y0` remains False, and execution breaks. If `p0[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, the output is 'NO', `y0` remains False, and execution breaks. If `p0[i]` equals `q[i]` and `p0[i]` is not '?', there are no changes in the state of `y0` or the output.***
