Postcondition: ***`y0` is True, `p1len` is greater than 0, and `i` is 1. If the character at index `i` of `p1` is '?', and `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, then `y1` is set to False and execution breaks. If `qr[i]` is in `good_letters`, the values of `y1` and the program state remain unchanged. If the character at index `i` of `p1` is not '?', and it does not equal the character at index `i` of `qr`, then `y1` is set to False and execution breaks. If they are equal, the values of `y1` and other variables remain unchanged. In summary, `y1` can only be set to False if `p1[i]` is '?' and `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, or if `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`. Otherwise, all initial conditions are preserved.***
