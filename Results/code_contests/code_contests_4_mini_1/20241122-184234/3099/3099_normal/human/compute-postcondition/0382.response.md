Postcondition: ***`p1len` is greater than 0, `y1` is False, `y0` is False, `t` is a slice of `q`, `n` is greater than 1, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, `p0len` is greater than 0, and `i` is 1. If the character at index `i` of `p0` does not match the character at index `i` of `q`, the program prints 'NO', sets `y0` to False, and breaks out of the nearest loop or if statement. If the characters match, the program continues without any changes to `y0` or output.***
