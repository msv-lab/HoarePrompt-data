Postcondition: ***Given `good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`, `pattern` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?", and at most one "*", `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `gls` is a string input from the user, `p` is a string input from the user containing at least one "*", `plen` is the length of `p` which is greater than or equal to 1; `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the reversed substring after '*', `p0len` is greater than 0, `p1len` is the length of `p1`, `q` is an input string from the user, `qlen` is the length of `q`, and `qlen` is greater than or equal to `plen - 1`, and `i` is less than `p0len`. If for any index `i`, `p0[i]` is a '?', and `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, the output will be 'NO', `y0` is set to False, and the execution breaks. If `p0[i]` is a '?' and `q[i]` is in `good_letters`, no changes are made to `y0`. If `p0[i]` is not a '?' and does not match `q[i]`, the output will be 'NO', `y0` is set to False, and the execution breaks. Conversely, if `p0[i]` matches `q[i]`, the program continues without altering `y0`. Thus, `y0` reflects whether all checked characters in `q` are valid according to the conditions defined by `p0`, and the output will be dependent on the evaluation of these conditions.***
