The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `y` is False, `n` is greater than 1, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, `plen` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, the element `p[i]` is equal to '?', the character `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, and 'NO' is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
