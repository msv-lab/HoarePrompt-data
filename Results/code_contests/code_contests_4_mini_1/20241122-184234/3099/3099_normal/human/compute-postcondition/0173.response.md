Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`, `pattern` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?", and at most one "*". `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `gls` is a string input from the user, `p` is a string input from the user containing at least one "*", `plen` is the length of `p` which is greater than or equal to 1; `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the reversed substring after '*', `p0len` is greater than 0, `p1len` is the length of `p1`, `q` is an input string from the user, `qlen` is the length of `q`, and `qlen` is greater than or equal to `plen - 1`. If `p0[i]` is a '?', and the character at index `i` of `q` is not in `good_letters`, `y0` is set to False, 'NO' is printed, and the execution breaks out of the loop. If `p0[i]` is a '?', and the character at index `i` of `q` is in `good_letters`, `y0` remains True, and the program continues. If `p0[i]` is not a '?' and is different from `q[i]`, `y0` is set to False, 'NO' is printed, and the execution breaks. If `p0[i]` is the same as `q[i]`, `y0` remains unchanged. Thus, after the execution of the if-else block, `y0` indicates whether the conditions were satisfied based on the comparisons and the program may print 'NO' if a mismatch is found.***
