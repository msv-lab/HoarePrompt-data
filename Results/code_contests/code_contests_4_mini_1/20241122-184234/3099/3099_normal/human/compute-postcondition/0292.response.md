Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`, `pattern` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?", and at most one "*", `n` is greater than 0, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `y0` is a boolean variable that starts as True, `i` is 2, and `p0len` is greater than 1. If the character at position `i` in `p0` does not match the character at position `i` in `q`, the function prints 'NO', sets `y0` to False, and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `y0` remains True, and the program continues without breaking.***
