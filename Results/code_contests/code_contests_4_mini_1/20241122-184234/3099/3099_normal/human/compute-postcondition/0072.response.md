Postcondition: ***`y` is True, `n` is greater than 1, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, `plen` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and if the character at index `i` of the string `p` is not equal to the character at index `i` of the string `q`, then `y` is set to False and 'NO' is printed, indicating a mismatch; otherwise, the condition does not change the values of `y`, `n`, `qlen`, `plen`, or `i`.***
