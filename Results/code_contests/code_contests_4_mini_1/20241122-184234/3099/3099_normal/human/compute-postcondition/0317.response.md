The variable `y1` is assigned the value `False`, but since `y1` is a new variable, it does not affect the values of the existing variables `y0`, `p1len`, or `i`. The function has already printed 'NO', which is an output statement but does not affect the state of the variables. Therefore, the output state is: `y0` is True, `p1len` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and `y1` is False.

Output State: **`y0` is True, `p1len` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and `y1` is False**
