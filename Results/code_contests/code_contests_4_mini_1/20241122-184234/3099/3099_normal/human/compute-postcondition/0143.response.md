The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'YES'. This does not change the values of any existing variables in the program. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of the variables that were present before the print statement.

Output State: **`plen` is greater than 0, `y` is True, and all corresponding characters of `p` and `q` are either matching or `p` has question marks that correspond to valid characters in `good_letters`; 'YES' is printed.**
