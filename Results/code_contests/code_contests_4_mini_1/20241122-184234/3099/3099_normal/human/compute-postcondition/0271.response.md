The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`; `pattern` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?", and at most one "*"; `n` is greater than 0; `q` is an input string; `qlen` is the length of `q`; `y0` is False; `i` is 0; `p0len` is greater than 0; the character at index `i` of `p0` is not '?'; and the character at index `i` of `p0` is not equal to the character at index `i` of `q`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
