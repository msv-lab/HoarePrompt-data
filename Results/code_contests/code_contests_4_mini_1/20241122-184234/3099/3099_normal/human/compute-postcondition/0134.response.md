Postcondition: ***`plen` is greater than 2, `y` is a boolean value, `n` is greater than 1, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, and `i` is 2. If the character `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, then the function prints 'NO', sets `y` to False, and breaks out of the most internal loop. If `q[i]` is in `good_letters`, no changes occur to `y`, and the program continues execution without any interruption.***
