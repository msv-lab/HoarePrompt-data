Output State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`, `pattern` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?", and at most one "*". `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `gls` is a string input from the user, `p` is a string input from the user containing at least one "*", `plen` is the length of `p` which is greater than or equal to 1; `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the reversed substring after '*', `p0len` is greater than or equal to 0, `p1len` is the length of `p1`, `q` is an input string from the user, `qlen` is the length of `q`, and `qlen` is greater than or equal to `plen - 1`. If `p0len` is 0, then the loop does not execute and `y0` remains True. If `p0len` is greater than 0 and for any index `i` less than `p0len`, if `p0[i]` is a '?', and the character at index `i` of `q` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed, `y0` is set to False, and the execution breaks. If `p0[i]` is a '?', and the character at index `i` of `q` is in `good_letters`, `y0` remains unchanged. In cases where `p0[i]` is not a '?' and does not match `q[i]`, 'NO' is printed, `y0` is set to False, and the execution breaks. Conversely, if `p0[i]` matches `q[i]`, `y0` remains unchanged. After the loop completes, `y0` indicates whether the conditions were satisfied based on the comparisons for all indices processed, and if `p0len` is 0, then `y0` remains True as the loop does not run.**
