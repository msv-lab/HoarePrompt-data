The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'NO'. The values of the variables `y0`, `p1len`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged values of the variables and the printed message.

Output State: **`y0` is True, `p1len` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, and the function prints 'NO'**
