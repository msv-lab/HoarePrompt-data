The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `plen` is greater than 0, `y` is False, `n` is greater than 1, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, `i` is 0, the character at index `i` of the string `p` is a question mark ('?'), and the character at index `i` of the string `q` is not in the set of good_letters, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
