Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`, `pattern` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?", and at most one "*", `n` is greater than 0, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `y0` is a boolean variable that starts as True, `i` is 1, and `p0len` is greater than 1. If the character at index `i` of `p0` is '?', and `q[i]` is not found in `good_letters`, then 'NO' is printed, `y0` is set to False, and execution breaks out of the loop. If `p0[i]` is not a '?', and `p0[i]` does not match `q[i]`, 'NO' is printed, `y0` is set to False, and execution breaks out of the loop. If `p0[i]` matches `q[i]`, or `q[i]` is in `good_letters`, then `y0` remains unchanged and execution continues.***
