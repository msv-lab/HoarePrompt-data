The variable `y` is assigned the value `False`. The previous value of `y` was `True`, but now it changes to `False`. The values of `i` and `plen` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `y` is False, `i` is the current index, and `plen` is greater than `i`.

Output State: **`y` is False, `i` is the current index, and `plen` is greater than `i`**
