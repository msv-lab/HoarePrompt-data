The value of `y` is assigned `False`, which means it changes from its previous boolean value to `False`. The other variables `plen`, `n`, `qlen`, and `i` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `plen` is greater than 0, `y` is False, `n` is greater than 1, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, `i` is 1, and the function prints 'NO'.

Output State: **`plen` is greater than 0, `y` is False, `n` is greater than 1, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, `i` is 1, and the function prints 'NO'**
