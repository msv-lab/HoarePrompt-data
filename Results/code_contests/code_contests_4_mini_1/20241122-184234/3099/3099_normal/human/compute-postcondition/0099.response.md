According to the code, the conditions for the loop to execute depend on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `plen` is greater than 0 and `y` is True, which indicates that the necessary conditions for printing 'YES' could be met if the loop executed again. However, since the loop checks the value of `n`, we must ensure `n` is still greater than 1 for the loop to run one more time.

Since the current state indicates that `y` is True, this does not affect the loop's ability to execute again. We only need to adjust the value of `n` to ensure it remains greater than 1. The loop variable `_` does not affect the state.

Thus, we need to adjust `n` to be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`plen` is greater than 0, `y` is True, `n` is greater than 1**
