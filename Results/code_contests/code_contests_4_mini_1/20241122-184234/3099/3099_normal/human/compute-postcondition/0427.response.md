The value of `y1` is assigned to `False`. The other variables `y0`, `i`, and `p1len` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `y0` remains unchanged, `y1` is set to False, `i` is 2, and `p1len` is greater than 2.

Output State: **`y0` remains unchanged, `y1` is False, `i` is 2, and `p1len` is greater than 2**
