Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters, `pattern` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?", and at most one "*", `n` is an input string, `gls` is a user-provided string, `p` is a user-provided string, and `plen` is the length of `p`. If there is no "*", for each input string `q`, if its length equals `plen`, and all characters in `p` match the corresponding characters in `q` (considering '?' as a wildcard for characters in `good_letters`), 'YES' is printed. If the lengths do not match or characters do not correspond, 'NO' is printed. If `n` is 0 or `plen` is 0, no output is produced. If there is a "*", for each input string `q`, if its length is less than `plen - 1`, 'NO' is printed. If `y0` and `y1` are both true for any iteration, 'YES' is printed. If `y0` or `y1` is false, no output occurs for that iteration, although prior checks may have printed 'NO' if the intersection of `t` and `good_letters` is not empty. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and no output is produced, leaving all variables unchanged. All edge cases related to the matching criteria and lengths are handled appropriately.***
