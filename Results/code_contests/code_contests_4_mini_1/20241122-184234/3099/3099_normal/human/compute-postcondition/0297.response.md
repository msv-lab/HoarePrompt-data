The `continue` statement causes the loop to skip the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration. Since the value of `y0` is False, indicating that there was a mismatch, the program will continue to the next iteration of the loop without making any changes to the current values of `y0`, `p0len`, or `qlen`. Therefore, the output state remains the same.

Output State: **`y0` is False, indicating a mismatch; the loop continues to the next iteration without changes.**
