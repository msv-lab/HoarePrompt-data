Postcondition: ***`p1len` is greater than 0, `y1` is False, `y0` is False, `t` is a slice of `q`, `n` is greater than 1, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, `p0len` is greater than 2, `i` is 2. If the character at index `i` of `p0` is not equal to the character at index `i` of `q`, the output is 'NO', `y0` remains False, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if the characters are equal, there are no changes in the state of `y0` or the output.***
