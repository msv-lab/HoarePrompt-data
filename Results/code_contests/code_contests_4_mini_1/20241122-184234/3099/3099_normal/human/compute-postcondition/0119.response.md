Postcondition: ***`plen` is greater than 0, `y` is a boolean value, `n` is greater than 1, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, and `i` is 0. If the character at index `i` of string `p` is a question mark and the character at index `i` of string `q` is not in `good_letters`, the program prints 'NO', sets `y` to False, and breaks out of the loop. If the character at index `i` of string `p` is a question mark but the character in `q` is valid, `y` remains True and the program continues. If the character at index `i` of string `p` is not a question mark and does not equal the character at index `i` of string `q`, the program prints 'NO', sets `y` to False, and breaks. If the characters are equal, `y` stays True and no further action is taken.***
