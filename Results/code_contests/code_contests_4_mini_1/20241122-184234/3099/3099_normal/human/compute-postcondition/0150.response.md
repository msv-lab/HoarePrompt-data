The variable `p0len` is assigned the value of the length of `p0`. The previous state of `p0` is unknown, but since `p` contains at least one "*", `p0` represents the substring before that "*". Therefore, `p0len` will be the length of this substring. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`, `pattern` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?", and at most one "*", `n` is an input string, `gls` is a string input from the user, `p` is a string input from the user containing at least one "*", `plen` is the length of `p` which is greater than or equal to 1; `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the reversed substring after '*'; `p0len` is the length of `p0`.**
