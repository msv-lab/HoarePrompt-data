Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`, `pattern` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?", and at most one "*", `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `gls` is a string input from the user, `p` is a string input from the user containing at least one "*", `plen` is the length of `p` which is greater than or equal to 1, `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the reversed substring after '*', `p0len` is greater than or equal to 0, `p1len` is the length of `p1`, `q` is an input string from the user, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `qlen` is greater than or equal to `plen - 1`, `y0` is False, `y1` is set to False, `t` is determined based on the value of `p1len` such that if `p1len` is 0, `t` is the substring of `q` from index `p0len` to the end; otherwise, `t` is the substring of `q` from `p0len` to `-p1len`, and the intersection of the set of characters in `t` with `good_letters` is non-empty, indicating that `t` contains at least one character from `good_letters`***.
