The code prints 'NO', and the state of the variables is not changed by the print statement. The previous values are `y` is initially True, `i` is the current index, and `plen` is greater than `i`. Therefore, the output state is: `y` is initially True, `i` is the current index, `plen` is greater than `i`, and the program prints 'NO'.

Output State: **`y` is initially True, `i` is the current index, `plen` is greater than `i`, and the program prints 'NO'**
