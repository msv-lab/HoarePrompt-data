The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`, `pattern` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?", and at most one "*"; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `gls` is a string input from the user; `p` is a string input from the user containing at least one "*"; `plen` is the length of `p` which is greater than or equal to 1; `p0` is the substring before '*'; `p1` is the reversed substring after '*'; `p0len` is greater than or equal to 0; `p1len` is greater than 0; `q` is an input string from the user; `qlen` is the length of `q`; `qlen` is greater than or equal to `plen - 1`; `y0` is False; `y1` is False; `qr` is the reversed string of `q`; `i` is an integer equal to 0; the character at index `i` of `p1` is a '?'; and the character at index `i` of `qr` is not in `good_letters`; and the output is 'NO' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
