Postcondition: ***`y` is initially True. If the character at index `i` of string `p` is a '?' and the character at index `i` of string `q` is not in `good_letters`, then `y` is set to False and the program breaks out of the loop. If the character at index `i` of string `p` is a '?' and the character at index `i` of string `q` is in `good_letters`, then `y` remains True with no changes. If the character at index `i` of string `p` is not equal to the character at index `i` of string `q`, then `y` is set to False and the program breaks out of the loop. If the characters are equal, `y` remains True with no modifications. Thus, after execution, if `p[i]` is a '?', `y` is False if `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, and if `p[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, `y` is also False. Otherwise, `y` remains True.***
