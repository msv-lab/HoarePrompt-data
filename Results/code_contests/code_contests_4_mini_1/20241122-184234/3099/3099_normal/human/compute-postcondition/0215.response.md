According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `p1len`. If `i` is less than `p1len`, the loop can execute once more. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at its current value, and `p1len` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` must be equal to `p1len - 1`. 

Thus, to allow for one more iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted since the other variables are not directly related to the loop's execution. 

State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`, `pattern` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?", and at most one "*"; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `gls` is a string input from the user; `p` is a string input from the user containing at least one "*"; `plen` is the length of `p` which is greater than or equal to 1; `p0` is the substring before '*'; `p1` is the reversed substring after '*'; `p0len` is greater than or equal to 0; `p1len` is greater than `i`; `q` is an input string from the user; `qlen` is the length of `q`; `qlen` is greater than or equal to `plen - 1`; `y0` is False; `y1` is either False or True depending on whether the program found a mismatch; `i` is equal to `p1len - 1`**
