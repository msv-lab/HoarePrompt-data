Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`, `pattern` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?", and at most one "*", `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `gls` is a string input from the user, `p` is a string input from the user containing at least one "*", `plen` is the length of `p` which is greater than or equal to 1; `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the reversed substring after '*', `p0len` is the length of `p0`, `p1len` is the length of `p1`, `q` is an input string from the user, `qlen` is the length of `q`, and if `qlen` is less than `plen - 1`, the output is 'NO' and the loop continues to the next iteration; otherwise, no specific actions are taken and the program proceeds beyond this conditional check.***
