The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of the if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `y` is False, `n` is greater than 1, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, `plen` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, the character at index `i` of the string `p` is not equal to '?', and the character at index `i` of the string `p` is not equal to the character at index `i` of the string `q`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
