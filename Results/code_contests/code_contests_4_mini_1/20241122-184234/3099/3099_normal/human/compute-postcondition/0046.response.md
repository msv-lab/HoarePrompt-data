Postcondition: ***`y` is True, `i` is 2, and `plen` is greater than 0. If `p[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `p[i]` is equal to `q[i]`, `y` remains True, `i` is still 2, and `plen` remains greater than 0.***
