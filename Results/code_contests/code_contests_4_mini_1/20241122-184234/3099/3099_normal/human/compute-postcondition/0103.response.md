The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables; instead, it is used to skip the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. In this case, `plen`, `y`, `n`, and `qlen` retain their values, and the function prints 'NO'. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `plen` is greater than 0, `y` is True, `n` is greater than 1, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, and the function prints 'NO'.

Output State: **`plen` is greater than 0, `y` is True, `n` is greater than 1, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, and the function prints 'NO'**
