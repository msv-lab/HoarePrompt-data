The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or the most internal structure we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `plen` is greater than 0, `y` is False, `n` is greater than 1, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, `i` is 1, and the output is 'NO' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
