According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` in relation to `p0len`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than `p0len`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Thus `i` needs to be adjusted to be equal to `p0len`, indicating that the loop has reached the end of the range and will no longer execute again after this iteration.

No other states need to be adjusted, as the other variables remain unchanged.

State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`, `pattern` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?", and at most one "*", `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `gls` is a string input from the user, `p` is a string input from the user containing at least one "*", `plen` is the length of `p` which is greater than or equal to 1; `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the reversed substring after '*', `p0len` is greater than 0, `p1len` is the length of `p1`, `q` is an input string from the user, `qlen` is the length of `q`, and `qlen` is greater than or equal to `plen - 1`, and `i` is equal to `p0len`**
