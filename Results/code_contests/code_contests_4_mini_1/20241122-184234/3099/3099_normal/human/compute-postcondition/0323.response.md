Postcondition: ***`y0` is True, `p1len` is greater than 0, and `i` is 1. If the element at index `i` of list `p1` does not equal the element at index `i` of list `qr`, then `y1` is set to False and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the elements at index `i` are equal, the values of `y1` and other variables remain unchanged.***
