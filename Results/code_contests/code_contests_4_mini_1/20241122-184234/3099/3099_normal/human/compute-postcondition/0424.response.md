Postcondition: ***`y0` remains unchanged, and `y1` is set to False if either the first character of `p1` is '?' and the character at index `1` of `qr` is not in `good_letters`, or if the first character of `p1` does not equal the corresponding character of `qr` at index `1`. If either condition is met, 'NO' is printed, and the program exits the most internal loop. It is ensured that `p1len` is greater than 1 and `i` is equal to 1, confirming that `qr` is the reversed value of `q`.***
