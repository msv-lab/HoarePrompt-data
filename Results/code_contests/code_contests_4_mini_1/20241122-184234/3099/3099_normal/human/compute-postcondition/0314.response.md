Postcondition: ***`y0` is True and `p1len` is greater than 0. If `p1[i]` is equal to '?', then if `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, `y1` is set to False and the program breaks; otherwise, `y1` remains True. If `p1[i]` is not equal to '?' and does not match `qr[i]`, the program prints 'NO' and `y1` is set to False. If `p1[i]` matches `qr[i]`, both `y0` and `y1` remain unchanged. The index `i` is 0, reflecting the first character comparison.***
