The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since the state of the variables does not change as a result of this statement, the output state remains the same as before the execution of the `continue` statement. The values of the other variables are not affected, so:

Output State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`; `pattern` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?", and at most one "*"; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `gls` is a string input from the user; `p` is a string input from the user containing at least one "*"; `plen` is the length of `p` which is greater than or equal to 1; `p0` is the substring before '*'; `p1` is the reversed substring after '*'; `p0len` is greater than or equal to 0; `p1len` is the length of `p1`; `q` is an input string from the user; `qlen` is the length of `q`; `qlen` is greater than or equal to `plen - 1`; `y0` is False; `y1` is False; and the loop that checks each character in `p1` against the corresponding character in the reversed string `qr` has detected a mismatch or a condition that caused 'NO' to be printed, leading to `y1` being set to False.**
