The variable `p1len` is assigned the value of `len(p1)`, which calculates the length of the string `p1`. The value of `p1` is determined based on the input string `p`, which contains a substring after the character "*". The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`, `pattern` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?", and at most one "*", `n` is an input string, `gls` is a string input from the user, `p` is a string input from the user containing at least one "*", `plen` is the length of `p` which is greater than or equal to 1; `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the reversed substring after '*', `p0len` is the length of `p0`, and `p1len` is the length of `p1`.
