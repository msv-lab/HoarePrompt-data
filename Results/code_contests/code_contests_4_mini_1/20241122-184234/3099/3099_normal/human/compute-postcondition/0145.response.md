To determine the necessary adjustments at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the given conditions and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

Based on the information provided:

1. The loop iterates based on the value of `n`.
2. If `plen` is greater than 0 and `y` is True, it suggests that the loop has some conditions under which it can print 'YES'. However, if `plen` is 0 or less, or if `y` is False, the loop does not execute any further actions related to `n` or `qlen`.
3. The loop will continue to execute as long as `n` is greater than the current iteration count (which is not specified but is implied to be controlled by `_`).

Given that the conditions for the loop to execute next time require `n` to remain valid, we need to ensure that `n` is still greater than the number of iterations that have already been executed.

Assuming that the last iteration completed successfully and did not modify `n`, the state should be adjusted to reflect the next iteration:

- Since the loop runs for `n` iterations, we need to ensure that `n` is still valid. If we are on the last iteration (which we are now considering), we need to adjust `n` to be one less than its original value to reflect that one iteration has completed.

Thus, the necessary adjustment to the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`plen` is greater than 0, `y` is True, `n` is greater than 1**
