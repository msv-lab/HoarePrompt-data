Functionality: ** The function accepts a string of distinct lowercase English letters (`good_letters`), a pattern string (`p`), and a positive integer (`n`), representing the number of query strings. It checks each query string to determine if it matches the pattern according to specific rules. If the pattern contains no wildcard ('*'), it requires an exact length match and checks for character correspondence, allowing '?' to match any character from `good_letters`. If the pattern includes a wildcard, it requires that the query string meets certain length conditions and character matches both before and after the wildcard, with additional checks ensuring that no characters from `good_letters` appear in the middle section of the query. The function prints 'YES' for valid matches and 'NO' for invalid ones, handling various edge cases, including empty inputs. If `n` is 0, no output is produced. **
