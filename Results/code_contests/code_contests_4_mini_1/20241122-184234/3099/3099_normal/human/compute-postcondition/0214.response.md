Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`, `pattern` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?", and at most one "*"; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `gls` is a string input from the user; `p` is a string input from the user containing at least one "*"; `plen` is the length of `p` which is greater than or equal to 1; `p0` is the substring before '*'; `p1` is the reversed substring after '*'; `p0len` is greater than or equal to 0; `p1len` is greater than 0; `q` is an input string from the user; `qlen` is the length of `q`; `qlen` is greater than or equal to `plen - 1`; `y0` is False; `y1` is either False or True depending on whether the program found a mismatch. If the character at index `i` of the reversed string `q` does not belong to `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and execution breaks. If the character matches a '?', the program continues without action. If the character at index `i` of `p1` does not equal the corresponding character in `qr`, 'NO' is printed, and `y1` is set to False, indicating a mismatch in the pattern-checking process. Thus, `y1` reflects whether all characters matched according to the conditions set by `good_letters` and the pattern.***
