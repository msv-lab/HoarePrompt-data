Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`, `pattern` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?", and at most one "*". `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `gls` is a string input from the user. `p` is a string input from the user containing at least one "*", with `plen` being the length of `p` which is greater than or equal to 1. `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the reversed substring after '*', `p0len` is greater than 0, `p1len` is the length of `p1`, `q` is an input string from the user with length `qlen`, which is greater than or equal to `plen - 1`, and `i` is less than `p0len`. If `p0[i]` does not match `q[i]`, the output is 'NO', `y0` is set to False, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `p0[i]` matches `q[i]`, the program continues to process further without making any changes to `y0`.***
