The variable `good_letters` is assigned the value of a set comprehension that creates a set of characters from the string `gls`. Since `gls` is a string of distinct lowercase English letters, `good_letters` will contain all the unique characters from `gls`. The other variables (`pattern`, `n`, and any other variables) are not affected by this assignment. 

Output State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`, `pattern` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?", and at most one "*", `n` is a positive integer representing the number of query strings, and `gls` is a string input from the user**.
