Postcondition: ***`y0` is True, `y1` is False, `p1len` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `p1[i]` is not equal to '?' and `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`. The program prints 'NO' and breaks out of the innermost loop or if statement. If `p1[i]` is equal to `qr[i]`, the values of `y0` and `y1`, along with the state of the program, remain unchanged, since there is no else part to handle this case.***
