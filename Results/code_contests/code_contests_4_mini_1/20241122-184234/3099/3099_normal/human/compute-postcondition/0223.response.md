Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`, `pattern` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?", and at most one "*"; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `gls` is a string input from the user; `p` is a string input from the user containing at least one "*"; `plen` is the length of `p` which is greater than or equal to 1; `p0` is the substring before '*'; `p1` is the reversed substring after '*'; `p0len` is greater than or equal to 0; `p1len` is greater than `i`; `q` is an input string from the user; `qlen` is the length of `q`; `qlen` is greater than or equal to `plen - 1`; if the character at position `i` in `p1` does not match the character at position `i` in `qr`, then 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If there is a match, the program execution continues normally without any changes to `y1` or `y0`.***
