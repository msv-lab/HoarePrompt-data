According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` in relation to `plen`. The loop will execute one more time if `i` is less than `plen`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `plen` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented to 1. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to reflect that `i` is now 1. `y` remains True since it is not mentioned to change in this context. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`y` is True, `i` is 1, `plen` is greater than 0**
