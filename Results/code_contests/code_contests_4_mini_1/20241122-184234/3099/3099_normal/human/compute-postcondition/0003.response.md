The variable `plen` is assigned the value of `len(p)`, which calculates the length of the string `p`. The value of `p` is unknown, but `plen` will be a non-negative integer representing the number of characters in `p`. The other variables (`good_letters`, `pattern`, `n`, and `gls`) are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects the values of the variables and the newly computed `plen`.

Output State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`, `pattern` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?", and at most one "*", `n` is a positive integer, `gls` is a string input from the user, `p` is a string input from the user, and `plen` is the length of `p`.**
