Postcondition: ***`plen` is greater than 0, `y` is a boolean value, `n` is greater than 1, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, and `i` is 1. If the character at index `i` of `p` is a question mark and the character at index `i` of `q` is not in `good_letters`, the output is 'NO', `y` is set to False, and the program breaks. If the character at index `i` of `p` is a question mark and the character at index `i` of `q` is in `good_letters`, the program continues without modifying `y`. If the character at index `i` of `p` is not equal to the character at index `i` of `q`, the output is 'NO', `y` is set to False, and the program breaks; otherwise, the program continues without changes to `y`.***
