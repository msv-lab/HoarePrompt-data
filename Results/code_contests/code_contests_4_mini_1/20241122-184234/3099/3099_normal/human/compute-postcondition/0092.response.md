Postcondition: ***`y` is initially True. If `p[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, then `y` is set to False, and we break out of the loop; this indicates a mismatch at index `i`. Since `plen` is greater than `i`, it ensures that the index `i` is valid and within bounds of both sequences `p` and `q`. If the condition `p[i] != q[i]` is not met, `y` remains True, indicating that the elements at index `i` are equal.***
