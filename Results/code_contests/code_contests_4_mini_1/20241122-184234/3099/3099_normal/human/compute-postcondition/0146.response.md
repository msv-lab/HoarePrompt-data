Output State: **If `n` is greater than 0, `y` will be evaluated for each input string `q`. If `qlen` equals `plen` and all relevant characters match or correspond to valid characters in `good_letters`, 'YES' is printed for valid cases. If `qlen` does not equal `plen` or any character in `p` does not match `q` (and is not a '?'), 'NO' is printed instead. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and no output is produced. In cases where `plen` is 0, the loop will also not execute, and no output will be produced.**
