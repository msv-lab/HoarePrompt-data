Postcondition: ***`y` is a boolean value, `i` is still 2, and `plen` is greater than 0. If `p[i]` is '?', and `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed, and `y` is set to False. If `q[i]` is in `good_letters`, `y` remains True. If `p[i]` is not '?', and `p[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, 'NO' is printed, and `y` is set to False. If `p[i]` is equal to `q[i]`, `y` remains True. Thus, after the execution, `y` is False only if 'NO' was printed, either due to `q[i]` being not in `good_letters` or `p[i]` not matching `q[i]`; otherwise, `y` remains True. `i` remains unchanged at 2, and `plen` remains greater than 0 throughout.***
