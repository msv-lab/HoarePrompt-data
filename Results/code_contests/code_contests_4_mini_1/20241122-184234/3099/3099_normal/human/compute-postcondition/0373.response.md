Postcondition: ***`p1len` is greater than 0, `y1` is False, `y0` is False, `t` is a slice of `q`, `n` is greater than 1, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, `p0len` is greater than 0, and `i` is 0. If the element at index `i` of `p0` is equal to '?', and if the character at index `i` of `q` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed, and `y0` remains False. If the character is in `good_letters`, no changes are made. If the element at index `i` of `p0` is not equal to '?', and if it is not equal to the element at index `i` of `q`, then 'NO' is printed, and the program breaks out of the loop. If the elements are equal, there are no changes to `y0` or `y1`, and the execution continues.***
