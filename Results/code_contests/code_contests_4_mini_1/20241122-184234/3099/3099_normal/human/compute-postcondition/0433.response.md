Postcondition: ***`y0` remains unchanged, `y1` is set to False if `p1[i]` does not equal `qr[i]`, indicating a mismatch between the characters at index `i` of `p1` and `qr`, where `i` is 2 and `p1len` is greater than 2. If a mismatch occurs, 'NO' is printed, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or statement.***
