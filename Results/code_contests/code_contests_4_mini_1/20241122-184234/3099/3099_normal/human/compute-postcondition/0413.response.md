Postcondition: ***`y0` remains unchanged, `y1` is False if the character at index `i` of `p1` is not equal to the character at index `i` of `qr`. `qr` is the reversed value of `q`, `p1len` is greater than 0, and `i` is 0, while the character at index `i` of `p1` is not equal to '?'. If the condition is satisfied, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `y1` remains True.***
