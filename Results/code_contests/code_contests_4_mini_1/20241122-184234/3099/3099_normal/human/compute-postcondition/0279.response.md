The `print('NO')` statement outputs the string 'NO' to the console. It does not modify any existing variables or states. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged except for the console output. The other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`, `pattern` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?", and at most one "*", `n` is greater than 0, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `y0` is True, `i` is 1, `p0len` is greater than 1, and the output is 'NO'**.
