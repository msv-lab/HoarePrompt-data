The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'NO'. The values of the variables `y`, `i`, and `plen` are not affected by this print operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables in addition to the printed output.

Output State: **`y` is True, `i` is 2, `plen` is greater than 0, and 'NO' is printed**.
