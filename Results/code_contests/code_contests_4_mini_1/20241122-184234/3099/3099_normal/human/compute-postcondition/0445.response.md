Postcondition: ***`y0`, `y1`, `p1len`, `qr`, and `q` remain unchanged. If `p1len` is equal to 0, `t` is assigned the slice of `q` starting from index `p0len` to the end of the list. If `p1len` is greater than 0, `t` is assigned the slice of `q` starting from index `p0len` and ending at the index `-p1len`.***
