Postcondition: ***`plen` is greater than 0, `y` is True, `n` is greater than 1, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, and `i` is 0. If the character at index `i` of string `p` is not equal to the character at index `i` of string `q`, the function prints 'NO', sets `y` to False, and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the characters are equal, `y` remains True, and no action is taken.***
