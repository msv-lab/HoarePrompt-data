According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as the variable `i` is less than `p0len`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `p0len`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `p0len`. 

No other states need to be adjusted since `p0len` remains the same and all other variables are not affected by the loop iteration in terms of their values. 

State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters derived from `gls`, `pattern` is a string containing lowercase English letters, "?", and at most one "*", `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `gls` is a string input from the user, `p` is a string input from the user containing at least one "*", `plen` is the length of `p` which is at least 1, `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the reversed substring after '*', `p0len` is greater than 0, `p1len` is the length of `p1`, `q` is an input string from the user with length `qlen`, which is greater than or equal to `plen - 1`, `i` is equal to `p0len`**
