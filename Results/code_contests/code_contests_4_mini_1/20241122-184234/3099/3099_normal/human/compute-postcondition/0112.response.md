Postcondition: ***`plen` is greater than 0, `y` is False, `n` is greater than 1, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, `i` is 0, and if the character at index `i` of the string `q` is not in the set of good_letters, the program prints 'NO' and breaks out of the loop, indicating that the current character is not acceptable. If the letter in `q` is valid, the program continues without changing `y` or breaking.***
