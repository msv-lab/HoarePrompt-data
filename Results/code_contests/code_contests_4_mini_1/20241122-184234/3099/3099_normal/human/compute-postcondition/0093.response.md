Postcondition: ***`y` is initially True, and if `p[i]` is a '?' and `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and execution breaks. If `p[i]` is a '?' and `q[i]` is in `good_letters`, `y` remains True with no output. If `p[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and execution breaks, indicating a mismatch at index `i`. If `p[i]` is equal to `q[i]`, `y` remains True, confirming they match. The index `i` is valid as `plen` is greater than `i`, ensuring safe access to both sequences.***
