Postcondition: ***`p1len` is greater than 0, `y1` is False, and `t` is a slice of `q`. If the intersection of the set of `t` and `good_letters` is not empty, the program prints 'NO' and continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `p1len` equals 0, `t` is set to `q[0:]`, but this does not affect the current condition as it only relates to how `t` is initialized. The key condition remains that if `t` contains any letters from `good_letters`, the program will print 'NO'.***
