The code executes a `print` statement, which outputs the string 'NO'. The values of the variables `y`, `i`, `plen`, `p[i]`, and `q[i]` remain unchanged, as the print statement does not modify them. Therefore, the output state is: `y` is True, `i` is 0, `plen` is greater than 0, the element at index `i` of the list `p` is equal to '?', and the element at index `i` of the list `q` is not in `good_letters`, and the output is 'NO'.
