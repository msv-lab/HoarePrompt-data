The variable `y` is assigned the value `False`. The previous states of the other variables (`plen`, `n`, `qlen`, `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `plen` is greater than 2, `y` is False, `n` is greater than 1, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, `i` is 2, and the function prints 'NO'.

Output State: **`plen` is greater than 2, `y` is False, `n` is greater than 1, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, `i` is 2, and the function prints 'NO'**
