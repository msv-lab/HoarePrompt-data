To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we first analyze the provided information about the variables at the end of the previous iteration.

1. The loop runs for `i` in the range of `p1len`. Since `i` is currently 2 and the loop is controlled by the range `p1len`, we need to ensure that `i` is less than `p1len` for the loop to execute again.

2. Given that the loop is currently at `i = 2`, for the loop to execute one more time, `p1len` must be greater than 2. Therefore, we can conclude that `p1len` should be adjusted to be greater than 2.

3. The state of `y0` remains unchanged throughout the iterations, and we do not have any information to modify it based on the provided context.

4. The state of `y1` may have been set to False at the end of the last iteration if there was a mismatch or an invalid character check, but since we are only concerned about the state for the next iteration, we do not need to modify `y1` specifically unless there was a condition that would change it.

Thus, the only necessary adjustment is to ensure that `p1len` is greater than 2 for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`y0` remains unchanged, `p1len` is greater than 2**
