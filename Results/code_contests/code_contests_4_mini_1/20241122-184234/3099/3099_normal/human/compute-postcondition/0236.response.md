Output State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`; `pattern` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?", and at most one "*"; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `gls` is a string input from the user; `p` is a string input from the user containing at least one "*"; `plen` is the length of `p` which is greater than or equal to 1; `p0` is the substring before '*'; `p1` is the reversed substring after '*'; `p0len` is greater than or equal to 0; `p1len` is the length of `p1`; `q` is an input string from the user; `qlen` is the length of `q`; `qlen` is greater than or equal to `plen - 1`; `y0` is False; `y1` is either False or True depending on whether a mismatch was found during the loop execution. If the loop executes, it checks each character in `p1` against the corresponding character in the reversed string `qr`. If `p1[i]` is "?" and `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed, and `y1` is set to False, breaking the loop. If `p1[i]` is not "?" and it does not match `qr[i]`, 'NO' is printed, and `y1` is set to False, also breaking the loop. If none of these conditions are met for the entire length of `p1`, `y1` remains True. If `p1len` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `y1` retains its initial value of True while all other variables remain unchanged.**
