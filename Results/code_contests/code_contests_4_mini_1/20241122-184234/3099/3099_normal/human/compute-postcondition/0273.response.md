Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`, `pattern` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?", and at most one "*", `n` is greater than 0, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `y0` is a boolean variable initialized to True, `i` is 0, and `p0len` is greater than 0. If the character at index `i` of `pattern` is a question mark ("?") and the character at index `i` of `q` is not in `good_letters`, the output is 'NO', `y0` is set to False, and the program breaks out of the loop. If the character at index `i` of `q` is in `good_letters`, `y0` remains True. If the character at index `i` of `pattern` is not equal to the character at index `i` of `q`, the output is 'NO', `y0` is set to False, and the execution exits the loop. If they are equal, the program continues without modifying `y0`. Thus, `y0` will be False if there is a mismatch or an invalid character in `q`, and it remains True if all checks are passed without issues.***
