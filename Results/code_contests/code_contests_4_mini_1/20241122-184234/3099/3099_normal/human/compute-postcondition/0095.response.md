Output State: **If `plen` is greater than 0 and the loop executes, `y` will be False if any character in `p` at index `i` is a '?' and the corresponding character in `q` at index `i` is not in `good_letters`, or if `p[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`. If `p[i]` is equal to `q[i]` or `p[i]` is a '?' and `q[i]` is in `good_letters`, then `y` remains True. If `plen` is 0, the loop does not execute and `y` remains True. Additionally, if `n` is not greater than 1, the loop does not execute, and `y` remains True.**
