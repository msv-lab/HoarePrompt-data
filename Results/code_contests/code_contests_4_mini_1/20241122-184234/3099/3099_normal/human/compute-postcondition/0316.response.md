The code executes a print statement which outputs the string 'NO'. The values of the variables `y0`, `p1len`, and `i` remain unchanged as the print function does not affect them. Therefore, the output state is: `y0` is True, `p1len` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and the function prints 'NO'.

Output State: **`y0` is True, `p1len` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and the function prints 'NO'**
