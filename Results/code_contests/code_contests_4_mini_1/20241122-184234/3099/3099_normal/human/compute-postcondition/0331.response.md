The variable `y1` is assigned the value `False`. The previous value of `y0` is `True`, and the other variables `p1len` and `i` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `y1` while the others remain unchanged.

Output State: **`y0` is True, `p1len` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `y1` is False**
