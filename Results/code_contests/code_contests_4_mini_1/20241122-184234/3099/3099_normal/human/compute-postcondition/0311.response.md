The value of `y1` is assigned `False`, changing its state from `True` to `False`. The other variables `y0`, `p1len`, `i`, `p1[i]`, and `qr[i]` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `y0` is True, `y1` is False, `p1len` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `p1[i]` is not equal to '?', and `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`, and 'NO' is printed.

Output State: **`y0` is True, `y1` is False, `p1len` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `p1[i]` is not equal to '?', and `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`, and 'NO' is printed.**
