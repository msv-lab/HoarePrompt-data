According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `p1len`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `p1len` is greater than 1 (since it is ensured that `p1len` is greater than 1). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` should be adjusted to 2. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`y0` remains unchanged, `y1` is set to False if either the first character of `p1` is '?' and the character at index `1` of `qr` is not in `good_letters`, or if the first character of `p1` does not equal the corresponding character of `qr` at index `1`, `i` is 2, `p1len` is greater than 2**
