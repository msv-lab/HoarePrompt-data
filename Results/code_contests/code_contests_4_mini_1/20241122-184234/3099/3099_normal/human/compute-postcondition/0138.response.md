Postcondition: ***`plen` is greater than 2, `y` is a boolean value, `n` is greater than 1, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, and `i` is 2. If the character at index `i` of the string `p` is not equal to the character at index `i` of the string `q`, then `y` is set to False, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, ensuring no further comparisons occur. If `p[i]` equals `q[i]`, the program continues without changing the value of `y`.***
