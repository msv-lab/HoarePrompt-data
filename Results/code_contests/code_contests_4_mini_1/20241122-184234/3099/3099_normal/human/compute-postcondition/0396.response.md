Postcondition: ***`y0` is False, indicating that either a character in `p0` did not match the corresponding character in `q`, or a '?' was found in `p0` with a corresponding character in `q` that was not a good letter. `p0len` is greater than 0, and the loop has executed, checking each character of `p0` against `q`.***
