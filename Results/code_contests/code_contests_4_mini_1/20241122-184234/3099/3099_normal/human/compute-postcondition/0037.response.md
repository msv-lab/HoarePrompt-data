Postcondition: ***`y` is True at the start, `i` is 1, and `plen` is greater than 0. If `p[i]` is '?', and if `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed and `y` is set to False. If `q[i]` is in `good_letters`, the values of `y`, `i`, and `plen` remain unchanged. If `p[i]` is not '?' and `p[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, 'NO' is printed and `y` is set to False. If `p[i]` equals `q[i]`, the values of `y`, `i`, and `plen` remain unchanged. Thus, after execution, `y` will be False if any of the conditions for printing 'NO' are met, otherwise it will remain True.***
