The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop of which we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `y` is False, `i` is 0, `plen` is greater than 0, the element `p[i]` is not equal to '?', and the element `p[i]` is not equal to the element `q[i]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
