Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`, `pattern` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?", and at most one "*", `n` is greater than 0, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, and `y0` is a boolean variable that starts as True. If the character at index 2 of `p0` is a "?" and the character at index 2 of `q` is not in `good_letters`, then 'NO' is printed, `y0` is set to False, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop. If the character at index 2 of `p0` is a "?" but the character at index 2 of `q` is in `good_letters`, `y0` remains True and no output is generated. If the character at index 2 of `p0` is not a "?" and does not match the character at index 2 of `q`, 'NO' is printed, `y0` is set to False, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop. Otherwise, if the characters match, `y0` remains True and the program continues without breaking.***
