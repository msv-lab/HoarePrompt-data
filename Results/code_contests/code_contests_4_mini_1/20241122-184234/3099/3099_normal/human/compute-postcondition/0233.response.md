Postcondition: ***`p1` is the reversed substring after '*', `qr` is the substring being compared with `p1`, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `p1[i]` does not match `qr[i]`, then 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the characters match, the program continues without changes to `y1` or `y0`. This ensures that if `p1[i]` is "?", it can still be satisfied as long as `qr[i]` is in `good_letters`, thus maintaining the correctness of the pattern matching process. The conditions also cover cases where `p1[i]` may be a character that is not a "?" but still does not match `qr[i]`, resulting in the 'NO' output and breaking the execution.***
