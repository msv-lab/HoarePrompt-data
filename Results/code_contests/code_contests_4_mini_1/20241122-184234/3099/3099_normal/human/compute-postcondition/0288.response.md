Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`, `pattern` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?", and at most one "*", `n` is greater than 0, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `y0` is a boolean variable that becomes False if the character at index 2 of `q` is not in `good_letters`, resulting in the output 'NO' and breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the character at index 2 of `q` is in `good_letters`, `y0` remains True, and no output is generated from this fragment.***
