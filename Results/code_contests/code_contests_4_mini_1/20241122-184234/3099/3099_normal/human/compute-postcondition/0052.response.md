Postcondition: ***If `y` is True, 'YES' is printed, indicating that all conditions for printing 'NO' were bypassed during the loop execution. If `y` is False, 'YES' is not printed, which implies that at least one of the conditions for printing 'NO' was met during the loop iteration, such as when a character in `p` did not match `q` or an invalid character was found. Thus, the status of `y` determines whether 'YES' is printed or not, reflecting the success of the conditions checked in the loop before this statement.***
