Postcondition: ***`y` is initially True, `n` is greater than 1, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, `plen` is greater than 0, and `i` is 1. If the character at index `i` of the string `q` is not in `good_letters`, then `y` is set to False, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the character is in `good_letters`, `y` remains True, but no other changes occur.***
