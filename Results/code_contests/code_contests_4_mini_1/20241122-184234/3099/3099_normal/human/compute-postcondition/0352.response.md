Postcondition: ***`p1len` is greater than 0, `y1` is False, `y0` is True, and `t` is a slice of `q`. If both `y0` and `y1` are True, the program prints 'YES'. If `y1` is False, the program does not print anything. Additionally, if the intersection of the set of `t` and `good_letters` is not empty, the program prints 'NO' before reaching this point, but this does not affect the state after the if statement is executed.***
