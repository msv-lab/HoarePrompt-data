The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `y` is False, `i` is 0, `plen` is greater than 0, the element at index `i` of the list `p` is equal to '?', and the element at index `i` of the list `q` is not in `good_letters`, and the output is 'NO', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
