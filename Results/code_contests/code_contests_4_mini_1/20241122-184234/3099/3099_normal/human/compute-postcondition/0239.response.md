Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`, `pattern` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?", and at most one "*", `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `gls` is a string input from the user, `p` is a string input from the user containing at least one "*", `plen` is the length of `p` which is greater than or equal to 1, `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the reversed substring after '*', `p0len` is greater than or equal to 0, `p1len` is the length of `p1`, `q` is an input string from the user, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `qlen` is greater than or equal to `plen - 1`, `y0` is False, and `y1` is set to False due to a detected mismatch or a condition that caused 'NO' to be printed during the execution of the loop. If `p1len` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `y1` remains True while all other variables stay unchanged; otherwise, if the loop executes and conditions for `p1[i]` against `qr[i]` lead to a mismatch or a failure condition, `y1` is set to False.***
