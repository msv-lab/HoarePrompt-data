The value of `y1` is assigned to `False`. The values of the other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `y0` is True, `p1len` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `y1` is False, and 'NO' is printed to the output.

Output State: **`y0` is True, `p1len` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `y1` is False, and 'NO' is printed to the output**
