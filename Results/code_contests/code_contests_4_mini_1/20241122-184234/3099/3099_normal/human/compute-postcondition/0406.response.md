The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop of the if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `y0` remains unchanged, `y1` is False, `qr` is the reversed value of `q`, `p1len` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, the first element of `p1` is equal to '?', the character at index `i` of `qr` is not in `good_letters`, and 'NO' is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
