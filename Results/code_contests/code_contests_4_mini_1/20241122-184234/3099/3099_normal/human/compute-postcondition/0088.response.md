Postcondition: ***`y` is initially True, `i` is the current index, and `plen` is greater than `i`. If the element `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `q[i]` is in `good_letters`, `y` remains True, and no output occurs.***
