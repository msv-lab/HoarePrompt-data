Postcondition: ***`y` is initially True, `n` is greater than 1, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, `plen` is greater than 0, and `i` is 0. If the character at index `i` of the string `p` is a '?', and `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the flow breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `q[i]` is in `good_letters`, `y` remains True and continues without changes. If `p[i]` is not equal to `q[i]`, 'NO' is printed and `y` is set to False, indicating a mismatch; otherwise, the values of `y`, `n`, `qlen`, `plen`, and `i` remain unchanged.***
