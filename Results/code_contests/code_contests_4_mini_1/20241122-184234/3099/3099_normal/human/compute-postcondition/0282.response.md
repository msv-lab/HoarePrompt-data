Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`, `pattern` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?", and at most one "*", `n` is greater than 0, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `y0` is a boolean variable initialized to True, `i` is 1, and `p0len` is greater than 1. If `p0[i]` does not match `q[i]`, the program prints 'NO', sets `y0` to False, and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `p0[i]` matches `q[i]`, `y0` remains True and the execution continues without any modifications to `y0`.***
