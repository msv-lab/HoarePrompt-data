Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`, `pattern` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?", and at most one "*". If both `y0` and `y1` are true, the program prints 'YES'. If `y0` and `y1` are not both true, the program does not execute the print statement, and the previous checks regarding the intersection of `good_letters` with the characters in substring `t` have already determined whether 'NO' has been printed in prior iterations.***
