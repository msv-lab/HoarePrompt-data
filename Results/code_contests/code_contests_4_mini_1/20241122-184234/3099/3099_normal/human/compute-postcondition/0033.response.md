The code executes a print statement that outputs 'NO'. The values of the variables `y`, `i`, and `plen` remain unchanged after execution. Therefore, the output state is: `y` is True, `i` is 1, `plen` is greater than 0, and 'NO' is printed.

Output State: **`y` is True, `i` is 1, `plen` is greater than 0, and 'NO' is printed**
