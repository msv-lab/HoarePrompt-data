According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` compared to `p0len`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `p0len`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `p0len` is greater than 0, which means the loop can execute again. 

For the loop to be executed one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 1 at the start of the next iteration. Other states do not need to be adjusted since they do not affect the continuation of the loop.

State: **`p1len` is greater than 0, `y1` is False, `y0` is False, `t` is a slice of `q`, `n` is greater than 1, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, `p0len` is greater than 0, and `i` is 1**
