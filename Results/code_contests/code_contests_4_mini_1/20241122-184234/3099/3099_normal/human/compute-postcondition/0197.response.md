The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables. Since `y0` remains set to False, indicating that the conditions for matching `p0` with `q` were not satisfied, and there are no changes to the other variables in the current context, the output state reflects that no variables have been altered.

Output State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`, `pattern` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?", and at most one "*"; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `gls` is a string input from the user; `p` is a string input from the user containing at least one "*"; `plen` is the length of `p` which is greater than or equal to 1; `p0` is the substring before '*'; `p1` is the reversed substring after '*'; `p0len` is greater than or equal to 0; `p1len` is the length of `p1`; `q` is an input string from the user; `qlen` is the length of `q`; `qlen` is greater than or equal to `plen - 1`; `y0` is False, indicating the conditions for matching `p0` with `q` were not satisfied or the loop did not execute.**
