The value of `y` is assigned `False`, changing its previous value from `True` to `False`. The values of `i` and `plen` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `y` is False, `i` is the current index, `plen` is greater than `i`, and 'NO' is printed.

Output State: **`y` is False, `i` is the current index, `plen` is greater than `i`, and 'NO' is printed**
