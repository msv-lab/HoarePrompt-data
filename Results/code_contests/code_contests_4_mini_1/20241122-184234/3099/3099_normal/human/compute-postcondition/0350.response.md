Postcondition: ***`p1len` is greater than 0, `y1` is False, `t` is a slice of `q`, and both `y0` and `y1` are True. The intersection of the set of `t` and `good_letters` is not relevant to the current condition, but the program will still proceed as if it can print 'NO' based on the evaluation of `y0` and `y1`.***
