The value of `y1` is assigned `False`. The previous state shows that `y0` is `True`, but `y0` is not affected by this assignment. The variables `p1len` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `y0` is True, `p1len` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and `y1` is False.

Output State: **`y0` is True, `p1len` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and `y1` is False**
