Postcondition: ***`y` is True at the start, `i` is 1, and `plen` is greater than 0. If `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, then 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `q[i]` is in `good_letters`, the values of `y`, `i`, and `plen` remain unchanged.***
