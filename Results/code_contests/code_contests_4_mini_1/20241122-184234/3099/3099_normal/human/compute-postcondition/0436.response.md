Output State: **`y0` remains unchanged, `y1` is set to False if there is a character mismatch between `p1` and `qr` or if `p1[i]` is '?' and `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`. If none of these conditions are met across all iterations, `y1` remains True. Additionally, `qr` is the reversed value of `q`, `p1len` is the length of `p1`, and `i` reflects the current index of iteration (0 to `p1len - 1`). If `p1len` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `y1` remains True, while `qr` is still the reversed value of `q`.**
