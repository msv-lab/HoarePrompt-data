Postcondition: ***`y` is True, `i` is 2, and `plen` is greater than 0. If `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, the function prints 'NO', sets `y` to False, and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `q[i]` is in `good_letters`, `y` remains True, `i` is unchanged, and `plen` is still greater than 0.***
