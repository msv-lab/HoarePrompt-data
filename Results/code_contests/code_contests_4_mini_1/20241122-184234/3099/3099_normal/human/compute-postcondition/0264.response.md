The value of `y0` is assigned `False`, changing its previous value from `True` to `False`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`, `pattern` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?", and at most one "*", `n` is greater than 0, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `y0` is False, `i` is 0, `p0len` is greater than 0, and the character at index `i` of `pattern` (p0) is a question mark ("?"). The character at index `i` of `q` is not in `good_letters`, and the output is 'NO'.
