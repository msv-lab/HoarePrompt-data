The variable `p1` is assigned the value of `p1` reversed. The previous value of `p1` is not specified, but it will now hold the characters of `p1` in the opposite order. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`, `pattern` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?", and at most one "*", `n` is an input string, `gls` is a string input from the user, `p` is a string input from the user containing at least one "*", `plen` is the length of `p` which is greater than or equal to 1; `p0` is the substring before '*', and `p1` is now the reversed substring after '*'.
