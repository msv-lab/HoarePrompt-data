The `print` statement outputs the string 'NO', but it does not affect the values of any variables. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `plen` is greater than 2, `y` is a boolean value, `n` is greater than 1, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, and `i` is 2.

Output State: **`plen` is greater than 2, `y` is a boolean value, `n` is greater than 1, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, and `i` is 2**
