Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters derived from `gls`, `pattern` is a string containing lowercase English letters, "?", and at most one "*", `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `gls` is a string input from the user, `p` is a string input from the user containing at least one "*", `plen` is the length of `p` which is at least 1, `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the reversed substring after '*', `p0len` is greater than 0, `p1len` is the length of `p1`, `q` is an input string from the user with length `qlen`, which is greater than or equal to `plen - 1`, and `i` equals `p0len`. If `p0[i]` is '?', and `q[i]` is not in `good_letters`, the program prints 'NO', sets `y0` to False, and breaks out of the loop. If `p0[i]` is not '?', and `p0[i]` does not equal `q[i]`, the program also prints 'NO', sets `y0` to False, and breaks out of the loop. In cases where `q[i]` is in `good_letters` or `p0[i]` matches `q[i]`, the program continues without modifying `y0` or the control flow, allowing the further evaluation of other conditions in the pattern matching process.***
