The code `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since the initial state mentions that `qlen` is less than `plen - 1`, it indicates that the program is likely in a loop structure, and the `continue` statement will cause the loop to move to the next iteration without executing any subsequent code for the current iteration.

Since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement itself and the output specified to be printed is 'NO', we can conclude that the state remains unchanged except for the continuation of the loop.

Output State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`, `pattern` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?", and at most one "*", `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `gls` is a string input from the user, `p` is a string input from the user containing at least one "*", `plen` is the length of `p` which is greater than or equal to 1; `p0` is the substring before '*', `p1` is the reversed substring after '*', `p0len` is the length of `p0`, `p1len` is the length of `p1`, `q` is an input string from the user, `qlen` is the length of `q`, and `qlen` is less than `plen - 1; print output is 'NO' and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
