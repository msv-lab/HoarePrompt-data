According to the code, the loop will execute based on the variable `i` and the range determined by `p1len`. For the loop to execute, `p1len` must be at least 1, meaning that the substring after '*' in `p` must contain at least one character. 

Since `p1` is the reversed substring after '*', if `p1len` is greater than or equal to 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, we need to ensure that `i` starts at 0 (the beginning of the range). 

Therefore, for the loop to execute, the necessary adjustments to the state are as follows:
- `p1len` must be greater than 0 to allow the loop to run, indicating that `p1` is not an empty string.
- `i` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`, `pattern` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?", and at most one "*"; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `gls` is a string input from the user; `p` is a string input from the user containing at least one "*"; `plen` is the length of `p` which is greater than or equal to 1; `p0` is the substring before '*'; `p1` is the reversed substring after '*'; `p0len` is greater than or equal to 0; `p1len` is greater than 0; `q` is an input string from the user; `qlen` is the length of `q`; `qlen` is greater than or equal to `plen - 1`; `y0` is False; `y1` is True; `qr` is the reversed string of `q`; `i` is 0**
