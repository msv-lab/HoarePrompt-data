Postcondition: ***`y0` remains unchanged, `y1` is set to False if the first character of `p1` does not match the character at index `1` of `qr`, which is the reversed value of `q`. If the first character of `p1` is '?' and the character at index `1` of `qr` is not in `good_letters`, `y1` is also set to False. If the characters do not match, 'NO' is printed, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or structure. Additionally, it is ensured that `p1len` is greater than 1 and `i` is equal to 1.***
