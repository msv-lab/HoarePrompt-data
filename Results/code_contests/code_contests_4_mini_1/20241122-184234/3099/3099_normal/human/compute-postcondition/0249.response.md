Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct characters from `gls`, `pattern` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?", and at most one "*". If the intersection of the set of characters in substring `t` with `good_letters` is non-empty, the program prints 'NO' and continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `t` contains none of the `good_letters`, the program continues executing the remaining code without printing 'NO'. All potential edge cases regarding the lengths of `p0`, `p1`, and the indices in `q` are ensured to be handled appropriately.***
