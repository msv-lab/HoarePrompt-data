Postcondition: ***`y0` is False if the character at position `i` (which is 2) in the string `p0` does not match the character at the same position in the string `q`. `y1` remains unchanged, `t` is assigned based on the value of `p1len`, `n` is greater than 0, `q` is a string obtained from `raw_input()`, `qlen` is the length of `q`, and `p0len` is greater than 1. The string 'NO' is printed, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or conditional statement. If the characters match, there is no change to `y0`, `y1`, `t`, `n`, `q`, `qlen`, or `p0len`.***
