Postcondition: ***`y0` is a boolean value, `y1` is initially True. If the character at index `i` of `p1` is '?', and the character at index `i` of `qr` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed and `y1` is set to False. If the character at index `i` of `p1` is not equal to the character at index `i` of `qr`, 'NO' is printed and `y1` is set to False. If the character at index `i` of `p1` is equal to the character at index `i` of `qr`, `y1` remains True. The conditions ensure that `p1len` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0, thus maintaining valid index access throughout the execution of the program fragment.***
