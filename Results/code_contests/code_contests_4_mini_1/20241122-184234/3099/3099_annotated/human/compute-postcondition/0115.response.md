The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'NO'. Since this statement does not modify any of the existing variables, their values remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is as follows:

Output State: **`plen` is greater than 0, `y` is True, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, the element at index `i` of the list `p` is not equal to '?', and the element at index `i` of the list `p` is not equal to the element at index `i` of the list `q`, and the output is 'NO'**.
