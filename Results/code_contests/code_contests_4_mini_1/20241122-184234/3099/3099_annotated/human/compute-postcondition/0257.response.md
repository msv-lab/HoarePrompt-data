The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`y0` is true, `y1` is true, `n` is greater than the current iteration count, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, and the output is 'NO'**
