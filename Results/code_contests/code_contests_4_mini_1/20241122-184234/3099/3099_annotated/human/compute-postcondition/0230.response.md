The code prints 'NO' to the output, but it does not change the values of the affected variables (`y0`, `y1`, and `i`). Therefore, the output state is `y0` is a boolean value, `y1` is True, `i` is 2, and the program prints 'NO'.

Output State: **`y0` is a boolean value, `y1` is True, `i` is 2, and the program prints 'NO'**
