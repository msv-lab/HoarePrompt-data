Postcondition: ***`y` is a boolean value indicating whether all conditions were satisfied during the loop execution. If `y` is True, 'YES' is printed, meaning all conditions were met, including cases where `p[i]` is either '?' with corresponding `q[i]` in `good_letters` or where `p[i]` equals `q[i]`. If `y` is False, 'YES' is not printed, indicating that either an invalid character was encountered or a mismatch occurred between `p[i]` and `q[i]`, or the loop did not run due to `plen` being 0 or less.***
