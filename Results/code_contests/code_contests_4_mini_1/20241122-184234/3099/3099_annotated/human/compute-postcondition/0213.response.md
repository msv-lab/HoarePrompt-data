Postcondition: ***`y0` is a boolean value, `y1` is initially True, `p1len` is greater than 0, and `i` is 0. If the first element of `p1` at index `i` is not equal to the first element of `qr` at index `i`, the function prints 'NO', sets `y1` to False, and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the first element of `p1` at index `i` is equal to the first element of `qr` at index `i`, the program continues without any changes to `y1`. Since `p1[i]` is not equal to '?', the comparison is valid and does not lead to any additional conditions.***
