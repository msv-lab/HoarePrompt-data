Postcondition: ***`y0` is a boolean value indicating whether a match was found. If the character at index `i` of `qr` (which is the reversed value of `q`) is not in `good_letters`, the program outputs 'NO', sets `y1` to False, and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since `i` is initialized to 0 and `p1len` is greater than 0, it is guaranteed that the character at index `i` of `p1` is equal to '?'. This means that if the condition is met, the match is not found, and `y1` reflects this as False. If the character is in `good_letters`, the program continues without changes to `y1` or outputting 'NO'.***
