Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct lowercase English letters, `pattern` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?" and at most one "*", `p` is an input string with `plen` greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `q` is an input string with length `qlen`, and `i` is 0. If the character at index `i` of `p` is a question mark ('?'), then `y` is set to False if the character at index `i` of `q` is not in `good_letters`, otherwise `y` remains True. If the character at index `i` of `p` is not a question mark and differs from the character at index `i` of `q`, then `y` is set to False. If they are the same, `y` remains unchanged. The program breaks out of the loop or if statement upon satisfying any of these conditions.***
