Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct lowercase English letters from `gls`, `pattern` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?", and at most one "*", `p` is a string containing at least one "*", `plen` is the length of `p`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `p0` is the substring before "*", `p1` is the substring after "*", `p1` is the reversed string of its previous value, `p0len` is greater than 0, `p1len` is the length of `p1`, `q` is the input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, and `i` is equal to the previous value of `i + 1` (which must be less than `p0len` for the loop to continue). If `p0[i]` does not match `q[i]`, then the program prints 'NO', sets `y0` to False, and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. This indicates that the characters at the current index `i` in `p0` and `q` do not match, which is a critical condition that prevents further processing, ensuring that `y0` remains False if this condition occurs.***
