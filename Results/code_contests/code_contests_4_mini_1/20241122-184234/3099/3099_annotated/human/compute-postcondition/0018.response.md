The variable `y` is assigned the value `False`, changing its state from `True` to `False`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects this change.

Output State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct lowercase English letters, `pattern` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?" and at most one "*", `p` is an input string, `plen` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `y` is False, `i` is 0, the character at index `i` of `p` is a question mark ('?'), and the character at index `i` of `q` is not in `good_letters`; and the output is 'NO'.**
