Postcondition: ***`y0` is a boolean value indicating whether a match was found, `y1` remains unchanged, and `t` is assigned based on the value of `p1len`. If `y0` is true and `y1` is also true, the program prints 'YES'. If `y0` is false, the program does not print anything, and if `y0` is true but `y1` is false, there is also no output. The program continues without any output if there are characters in `t` that exist in `good_letters`.***
