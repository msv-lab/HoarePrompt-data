Postcondition: ***`y0` and `y1` are booleans. If both `y0` and `y1` are true, the program prints 'YES'. If either `y0` or `y1` is false, the program does not print anything and continues executing the statements that follow the if block. The program ensures that `p1len` is greater than or equal to 0, `p0len` is a valid index, and `t` does not contain any elements from `good_letters` when checking the conditions.***
