The function `func` accepts three parameters: `good_letters`, `pattern`, and `queries`. 

- `good_letters` is a string of distinct lowercase English letters.
- `pattern` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?", and at most one "*".
- `queries` is a list of non-empty strings of lowercase English letters.

After executing the function body, the function processes the `queries` based on the `pattern` and `good_letters`. The specific outputs are determined by matching the `queries` against the `pattern`, adhering to the given constraints of `good_letters`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `good_letters`, a string `pattern`, and a list of query strings `queries`. It processes each query against the pattern considering the good letters and returns the results based on the matches.**
