The code assigns the length of the substring `p0` to the variable `p0len`. The variable `p0` was previously defined as the substring before the "*". The value of `p0len` will be a non-negative integer corresponding to the number of characters in `p0`. No other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct lowercase English letters from `gls`; `pattern` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?", and at most one "*"; `p` is a string containing at least one "*"; `plen` is the length of `p`; `n` is an input string; `p0` is the substring before "*"; `p1` is the substring after "*"; `p1` is the reversed string of its previous value; `p0len` is the length of `p0`.**
