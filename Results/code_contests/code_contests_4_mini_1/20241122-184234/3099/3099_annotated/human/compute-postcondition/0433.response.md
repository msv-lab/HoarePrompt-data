Postcondition: ***`y1` is initially True and `i` is 1, and `p1len` is greater than 1. If `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`, then `y1` is set to False, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `p1[i]` is equal to `qr[i]`, `y1` remains True, and the program continues executing without any changes to `y1` or `i`.***
