Postcondition: ***`y0` is a boolean value, `y1` is initially True, and `i` is 2. If the value of `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, the output will be 'NO', `y1` is set to False, and the program breaks out of the most inner loop or if statement. If `qr[i]` is in `good_letters`, `y1` remains True, and no changes are made to `y0` or `i`.***
