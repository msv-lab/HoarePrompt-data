The variable `y1` is assigned the value `False`, which overrides its previous value of `True`. The other variables `y0`, `i`, and `p1len` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `y1`.

Output State: **`y0` is a boolean value indicating whether a match was found, `y1` is False, `i` is 1, `p1len` is greater than 1; 'NO' is printed to the console**
