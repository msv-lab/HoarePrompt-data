The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or the most internal structure we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `plen` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented to be less than `plen`, 'NO' is printed, and `y` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **`plen` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented to be less than `plen`, 'NO' is printed, `y` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
