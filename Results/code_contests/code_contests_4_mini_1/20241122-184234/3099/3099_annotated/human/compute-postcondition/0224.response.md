Postcondition: ***`y0` is a boolean value, `y1` is initially True, and `i` is 1. If `p1[i]` is equal to '?', and `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and execution breaks. If `qr[i]` is in `good_letters`, `y1` remains True and execution continues. If `p1[i]` is not equal to '?', and `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and execution breaks. If `p1[i]` is equal to `qr[i]`, then `y1` remains True and no output is generated. This covers the case where `p1[i]` is either '?' or equal to `qr[i]` and includes scenarios where `qr[i]` might or might not be in `good_letters`.***
