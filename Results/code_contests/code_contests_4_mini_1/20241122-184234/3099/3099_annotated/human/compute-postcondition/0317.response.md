The variable `y1` is assigned the value `False`. The previous value of `y1` was `True`, so after execution, `y1` is now `False`. The values of the other variables (`y0`, `i`, `p1len`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `y0` is a boolean value indicating whether a match was found, `y1` is False, `i` is 1, `p1len` is greater than 1, and 'NO' is printed to the console.

Output State: **`y0` is a boolean value indicating whether a match was found, `y1` is False, `i` is 1, `p1len` is greater than 1, and 'NO' is printed to the console**
