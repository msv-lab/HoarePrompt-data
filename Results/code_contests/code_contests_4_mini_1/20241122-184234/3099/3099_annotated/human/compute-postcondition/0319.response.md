Postcondition: ***`y0` is a boolean value indicating whether a match was found, `y1` is set to False if `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters` and 'NO' is printed to the console, while `i` is 1 and `p1len` is greater than 1. If `qr[i]` is in `good_letters`, the values of `y0`, `y1`, `i`, and `p1len` remain unchanged.***
