The code executes a print statement, which outputs the string 'NO'. The values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `y0` is a boolean value, `y1` is True, `p1len` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, the element at index `i` of the list `p1` is equal to '?', and the element at index `i` of the list `qr` is not in `good_letters`.
