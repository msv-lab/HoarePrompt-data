The variable `p1len` is assigned the value of `len(p1)`, which calculates the length of the string `p1`. The value of `p1` is not provided, but it is a substring after the "*" of the string `p`. Therefore, the output state will indicate that `p1len` is the length of `p1`, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct lowercase English letters from `gls`; `pattern` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?", and at most one "*"; `p` is a string containing at least one "*"; `plen` is the length of `p`; `n` is an input string; `p0` is the substring before "*"; `p1` is the substring after "*"; `p1` is the reversed string of its previous value; `p0len` is the length of `p0`; `p1len` is the length of `p1`**
