The statement `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Since `y1` is False, indicating that there is at least one character in `p1` that does not match `qr`, the loop will continue to the next iteration without making any changes to the variable states. As a result, the values of `y1` and `p1len` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`y1` is False, `p1len` is greater than 0, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
