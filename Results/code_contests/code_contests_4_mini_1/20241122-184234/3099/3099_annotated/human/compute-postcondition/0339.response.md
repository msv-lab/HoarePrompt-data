Postcondition: ***`y0` is a boolean value indicating whether a match was found. If `y1` is False, the loop continues to the next iteration without changing any variable states, indicating that either a character in `p1` did not match the corresponding character in `qr`, or a character in `p1` was a '?' that did not correspond to a valid character in `good_letters`. If `p1` is empty, `y1` remains True, indicating a match was found without checks. If `y1` is True, it means that a match has been found based on the prior conditions.***
