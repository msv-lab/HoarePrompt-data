Postcondition: ***`y0` is False if the character at index 1 of `p0` does not match the character at index 1 of `q`, in which case 'NO' is printed and the program breaks out of the most internal loop. If `p0[i]` equals `q[i]`, `y0` remains True, `y1` remains unchanged, `t` is assigned based on the value of `p1len`, `n` is greater than 0, `q` is a string obtained from `raw_input()`, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `p0len` is greater than 0, and `i` is 1.***
