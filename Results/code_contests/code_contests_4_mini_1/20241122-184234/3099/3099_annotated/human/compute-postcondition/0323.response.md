Postcondition: ***`y0` is a boolean value indicating whether a match was found. If the character at index `i` of `p1` does not match the character at index `i` of `qr`, then `y1` is set to False, and 'NO' is printed. The loop or statement is exited at this point. If the characters match, no changes are made to `y1`, and the program continues executing beyond this fragment. Given that `i` is initialized to 1 and `p1len` is greater than 1, it is important to consider that the indices must be valid, and further checks may be needed if `i` were to be incremented in a loop context.***
