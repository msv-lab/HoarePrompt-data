Postcondition: ***`y1` is a boolean value indicating if all conditions were satisfied during the loop execution. If `y1` is False, it means that at least one condition failed during the loop, either due to a mismatch between characters in `p1` and `qr`, or a '?' in `p1` corresponding to a character in `qr` that is not in `good_letters`. In this case, if `p1len` is greater than 0, the loop has executed at least once, and the program continues to the next iteration without altering the state of the variables. If `p1len` is 0, `y1` remains True, and the loop does not execute.***
