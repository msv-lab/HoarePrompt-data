The code executes a print statement that outputs 'NO'. The values of the variables `y1`, `i`, and `p1len` remain unchanged after the execution. Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged values of the variables and notes the printed output.

Output State: **`y1` is True, `i` is 1, `p1len` is greater than 0, and 'NO' is printed.**
