Postcondition: ***`y0` is a boolean value, `y1` is initially True, and `i` is 1. If `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `qr[i]` is in `good_letters`, no changes are made to `y1`, and the program continues execution.***
