The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop of the if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `plen` is greater than 0, `y` is False, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, the element at index `i` of the list `p` is not equal to '?', the element at index `i` of the list `p` is not equal to the element at index `i` of the list `q`, and the output is 'NO', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
