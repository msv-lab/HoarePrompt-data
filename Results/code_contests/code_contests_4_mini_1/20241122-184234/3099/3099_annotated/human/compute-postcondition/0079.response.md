The code `print('NO')` outputs the string 'NO' to the console. The variables `y`, `plen`, `n`, `qlen`, and `i` remain unchanged as the print statement does not affect their values. Therefore, the output state is: `y` is initially True, `plen` is 1, `n` is greater than the number of completed iterations, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, `i` is 1, and 'NO' is printed.

Output State: **`y` is initially True, `plen` is 1, `n` is greater than the number of completed iterations, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, `i` is 1, and 'NO' is printed.**
