According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1. The state of `good_letters`, `pattern`, `p`, `plen`, `p0`, `p1`, `p1len`, and `p0len` does not affect the loop execution directly, but they are part of the context within which the loop operates. Before the loop starts, `_` is typically used as a throwaway variable, so it does not need to be defined beforehand.

To ensure that the loop can execute, we need to adjust `n` to be at least 1.

State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct lowercase English letters from `gls`, `pattern` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?", and at most one "*", `p` is a string containing at least one "*", `plen` is the length of `p`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `p0` is the substring before "*", `p1` is the substring after "*", `p1` is the reversed string of its previous value, `p0len` is the length of `p0`, `p1len` is the length of `p1`**
