Postcondition: ***`y` is initially True, `plen` is 1, `n` is greater than the number of completed iterations, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, and `i` is 1. If the character at index `i` of string `p` is not equal to the character at index `i` of string `q`, then 'NO' is printed, `y` is set to False, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the characters are equal, no changes occur to `y`, `plen`, `n`, `qlen`, or `i`.***
