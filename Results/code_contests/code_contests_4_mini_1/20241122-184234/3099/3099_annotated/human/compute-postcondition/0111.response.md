The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `plen` is greater than 0, `y` is False, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, the element at index `i` of list `p` is equal to '?', and the element at index `i` of list `q` is not in `good_letters`, and we break out of the most internal loop.
