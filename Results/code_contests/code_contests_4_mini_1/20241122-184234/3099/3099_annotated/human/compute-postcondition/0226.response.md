The code executes a print statement, which outputs the string 'NO'. The state of the variables `y0`, `y1`, and `i` remains unchanged after execution. Therefore, the output state is: `y0` is a boolean value, `y1` is True, `i` is 2, and the print statement outputs 'NO'.

Output State: **`y0` is a boolean value, `y1` is True, `i` is 2, and the print statement outputs 'NO'**
