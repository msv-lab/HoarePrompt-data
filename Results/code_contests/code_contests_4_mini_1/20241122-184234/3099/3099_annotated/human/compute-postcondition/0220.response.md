The code prints 'NO', which does not change the values of any variables. The values of `y0`, `y1`, and `i` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `y0` is a boolean value, `y1` is True, `i` is 1, and 'NO' is printed.

Output State: **`y0` is a boolean value, `y1` is True, `i` is 1, and 'NO' is printed**.
