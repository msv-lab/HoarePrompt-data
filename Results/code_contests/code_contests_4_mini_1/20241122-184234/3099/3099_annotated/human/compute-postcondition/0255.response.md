`qlen` is assigned the value of `len(q)`, which calculates the length of the input string `q`. The values of `y0`, `y1`, and `n` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables along with the new variable `qlen`. 

Output State: **`y0` is true, `y1` is true, `n` is greater than the current iteration count, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`**
