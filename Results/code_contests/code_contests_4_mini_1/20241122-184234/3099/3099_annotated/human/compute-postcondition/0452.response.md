Postcondition: ***If `y0` and `y1` are both True, the program prints 'YES'. If either `y0` or `y1` is False, no action is taken and the program continues with the next steps. The value of `t` remains unchanged and is derived from `q`, with `p1len` being 0 or greater, and `t` may or may not intersect with `good_letters`. If `t` contains characters from `good_letters`, it is skipped in the iteration, leading to no interaction with the print statement.***
