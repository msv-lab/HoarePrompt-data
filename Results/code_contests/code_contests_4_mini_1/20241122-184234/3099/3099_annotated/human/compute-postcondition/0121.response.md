The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'NO'. The values of the variables `plen`, `y`, and `i` are not affected by the print statement. Therefore, the output state remains the same for those variables. The output of the print statement does not change their values, so the output state is: `plen` is greater than 0, `y` is a boolean value, `i` is the next index (previous value of `i` + 1), and the output is 'NO'.

Output State: **`plen` is greater than 0, `y` is a boolean value, `i` is the next index (previous value of `i` + 1), and the output is 'NO'**
