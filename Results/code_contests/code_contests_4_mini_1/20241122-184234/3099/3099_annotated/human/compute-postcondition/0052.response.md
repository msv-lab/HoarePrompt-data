Postcondition: ***If `y` is True, the function prints 'YES', indicating that the strings match according to the defined rules. If `y` is False, it means that either there was a character mismatch, an invalid character in `good_letters`, or that the lengths of `p` and `q` did not allow for a match; in this case, nothing is printed. Furthermore, if `plen` is 0, `y` remains True and 'YES' would be printed, as the loop does not execute in such a case.***
