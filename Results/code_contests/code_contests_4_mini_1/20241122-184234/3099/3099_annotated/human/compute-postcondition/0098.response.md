Postcondition: ***If `plen` is greater than 0 and `y` is True, indicating that all corresponding characters in `p` and `q` match or that any `p[i]` is '?' and `q[i]` is in `good_letters`, the function prints 'YES'. If `plen` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `y` remains True, but nothing is printed. If `y` is False, it indicates that there was at least one mismatch in the characters or that a '?' in `p` had a corresponding character in `q` that was not in `good_letters`; in this case, 'NO' was printed previously, and the loop was exited.***
