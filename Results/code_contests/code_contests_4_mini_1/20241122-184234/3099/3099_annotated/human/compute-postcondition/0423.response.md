Postcondition: ***`y1` is True initially and `i` is 1. If `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`, 'NO' is printed, `y1` is set to False, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `p1[i]` is equal to `qr[i]`, `y1` remains True, `i` stays 1, and the values of `p1` and `qr` at index `i` are equal. The length of `p1` is greater than 0, ensuring that index `i` is valid.**
