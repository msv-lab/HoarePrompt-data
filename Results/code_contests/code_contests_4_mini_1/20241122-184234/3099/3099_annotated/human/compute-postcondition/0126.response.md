The code assigns `False` to `y`, which changes its previous boolean value to `False`. The values of `plen` and `i` are unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is `plen` is greater than 0, `y` is False, `i` is the next index (previous value of `i` + 1), and the output remains 'NO'.

Output State: **`plen` is greater than 0, `y` is False, `i` is the next index (previous value of `i` + 1), and the output is 'NO'**
