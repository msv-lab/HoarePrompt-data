Postcondition: ***`y` is initially True, `plen` is 1, `n` is greater than the number of completed iterations, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, and `i` is 0. If the character at index `i` of `p` is '?', then if the character at index `i` of `q` is not in `good_letters`, `y` is set to False and the loop is exited. If the character at index `i` of `q` is in `good_letters`, `y` remains True and the loop continues. If the character at index `i` of `p` does not match the character at index `i` of `q`, then `y` is set to False and the loop is exited. If there is a match, `y` remains True and the execution continues without interruption. In all cases, if `y` is set to False, 'NO' is printed and the loop is exited.***
