According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `n`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0. The state of `good_letters`, `pattern`, `p`, and `plen` does not directly influence the execution of the loop. However, since the loop variable is not used inside the loop, it can start from the initial value, which we can assume to be 0. 

Thus, for the loop to be executed, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0, and we can initialize the loop variable (which is not used) to 0.

State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct lowercase English letters from `gls`, `pattern` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?" and at most one "*", `p` is an input string from raw_input(), `plen` is the length of `p`, `n` is greater than 0, loop variable is 0**
