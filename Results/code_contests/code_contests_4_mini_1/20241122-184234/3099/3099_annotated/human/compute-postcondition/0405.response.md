The value of `y1` is set to `False`, changing its state from `True` to `False`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `y1` is False, `qr` is the reverse of `q`, `i` is 0, `p1len` is greater than 0, the first element of `p1` at index `i` is equal to '?', and the character `qr[i]` is not in `good_letters`, and the function prints 'NO'.
