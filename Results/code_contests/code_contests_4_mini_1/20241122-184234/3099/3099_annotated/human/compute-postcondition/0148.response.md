The value of `p` is split into two parts using the `*` as the delimiter. The variable `p0` will contain the substring before `*`, while `p1` will contain the substring after `*`. As `p` must contain at least one `*`, both `p0` and `p1` will have defined values. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct lowercase English letters from `gls`; `pattern` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?", and at most one "*"; `p` is a string containing at least one "*"; `plen` is the length of `p`; `n` is an input string; `p0` is the substring before "*"; `p1` is the substring after "*".**
