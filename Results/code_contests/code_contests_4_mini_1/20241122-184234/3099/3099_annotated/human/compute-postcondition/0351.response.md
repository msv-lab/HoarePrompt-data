The `print('YES')` statement outputs the string `'YES'` to the console. It does not modify any variables or change the state of the program; it simply displays a message. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables and the printed message.

Output State: **`y0` is true, `y1` is unchanged, `t` is assigned based on the length of `p1`, and the printed message is 'YES'**
