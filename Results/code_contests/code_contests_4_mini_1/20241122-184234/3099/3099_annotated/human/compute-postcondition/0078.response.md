Postcondition: ***`y` is initially True, `plen` is 1, `n` is greater than the number of completed iterations, and `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`. If the character at index `i` in the string `q` is not found in `good_letters`, the program outputs 'NO', sets `y` to False, and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the character is in `good_letters`, `y` remains True, and the state of `plen`, `n`, and `qlen` remains unchanged.***
