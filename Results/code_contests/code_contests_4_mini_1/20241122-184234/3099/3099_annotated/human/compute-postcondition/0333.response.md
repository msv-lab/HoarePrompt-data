Postcondition: ***`y0` is a boolean value indicating whether a match was found, `y1` is set to False if `p1[i]` is not equal to `qr[i]`, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The index `i` is 2 and `p1len` is greater than 2, so the condition for accessing `p1[i]` and `qr[i]` does not cause an out-of-bounds error.***
