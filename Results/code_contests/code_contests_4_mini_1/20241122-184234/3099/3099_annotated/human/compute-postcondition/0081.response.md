The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables but it exits the most internal loop or if statement that it is directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `y` is False, `plen` is 1, `n` is greater than the number of completed iterations, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, `i` is 1, and 'NO' is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
