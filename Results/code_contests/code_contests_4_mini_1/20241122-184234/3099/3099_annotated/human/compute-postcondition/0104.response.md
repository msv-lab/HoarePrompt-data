Postcondition: ***`plen` is greater than 0, `y` is True, and `n` is greater than 1. If the length of the input string `q` (`qlen`) is not equal to `plen`, 'NO' is printed and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `qlen` equals `plen`, nothing is printed and the loop proceeds without interruption.***
