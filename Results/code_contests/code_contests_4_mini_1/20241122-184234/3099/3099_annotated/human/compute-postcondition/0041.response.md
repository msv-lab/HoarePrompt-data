The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `good_letters` is a set of distinct lowercase English letters, `pattern` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?" and at most one "*", `p` is an input string with `plen` greater than 1, `n` is greater than 0, `q` is an input string with length `qlen`, `i` is 2, `y` is False, and the function prints 'NO', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
