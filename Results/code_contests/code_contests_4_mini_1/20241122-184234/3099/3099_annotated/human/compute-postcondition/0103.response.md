The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the remaining code inside the innermost loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables `plen`, `y`, `n`, and `qlen` remain unchanged. The output state indicates that the loop continues without altering the values of these variables. 

Output State: **`plen` is greater than 0, `y` is True, `n` is greater than 1, `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`, and 'NO' is printed, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
