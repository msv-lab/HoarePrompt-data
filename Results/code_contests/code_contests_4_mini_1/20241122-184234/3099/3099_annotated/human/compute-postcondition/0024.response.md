The value of `y` is assigned to `False`, changing its previous state from `True`. The values of other variables remain unaffected. Thus, the output state reflects the change in `y`.

Output State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct lowercase English letters, `pattern` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?" and at most one "*", `p` is an input string, `plen` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, `y` is False, `i` is 0, the character at position `i` in string `p` is not '?', and the character at position `i` in string `p` is different from the character at position `i` in string `q`, and the output is 'NO'.**
