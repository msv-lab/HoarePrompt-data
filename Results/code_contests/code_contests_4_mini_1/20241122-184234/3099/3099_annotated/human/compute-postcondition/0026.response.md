Postcondition: ***`good_letters` is a set of distinct lowercase English letters, `pattern` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?" and at most one "*", `p` is an input string, `plen` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `q` is an input string, `qlen` is the length of `q`, and `i` is 0. If the character at position `i` in string `p` is different from the character at position `i` in string `q`, then `y` is set to False, and the program breaks out of the loop or if statement. If the characters at position `i` in both strings are the same, the program proceeds without altering `y`. The character at position `i` in string `p` is guaranteed to not be '?' based on the precondition.***
