Postcondition: ***`y0` is False if the character at index `i` (which is 2) of the string `q` is not in `good_letters`, while `y1` remains unchanged. The variable `t` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `q` is a string obtained from `raw_input()`, `qlen` is the length of `q`, and `p0len` is greater than 1. If the character at index `i` is in `good_letters`, there are no changes to `y0`, `y1`, `t`, and the loop continues without printing 'NO'.***
