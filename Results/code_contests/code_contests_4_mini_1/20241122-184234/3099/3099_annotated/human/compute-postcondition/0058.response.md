Postcondition: ***`y` is True, `plen` is 0, `n` is greater than the number of completed iterations, and `qlen` is the length of the input string `q`. If `qlen` is not equal to `plen`, the program prints 'NO' and continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `qlen` is equal to `plen`, the program does not print anything and proceeds with the current iteration.***
