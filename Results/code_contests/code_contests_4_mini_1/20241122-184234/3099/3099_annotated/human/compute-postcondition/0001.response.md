The variable `good_letters` is assigned the value of a set created from the characters in the input string `gls`. This means `good_letters` will now contain distinct lowercase English letters present in `gls`. The variable `pattern` and the query string remain unaffected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `good_letters` based on the contents of `gls`.

Output State: **`good_letters` is a set of distinct lowercase English letters from `gls`; `pattern` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, "?" and at most one "*"; each query string is a non-empty string of lowercase English letters.**
