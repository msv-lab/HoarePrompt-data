According to the code, the loop depends on the variable `i` and the length of `plen`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `plen`. At the end of the last iteration, the variable `i` has been incremented by 1. If it is currently equal to `plen`, the loop cannot execute again. Therefore, to allow for one more iteration of the loop, `i` needs to be adjusted to `plen - 1`.

The state of `y` does not need to be adjusted, as it already reflects the conditions based on the previous iteration. The other variables, `plen`, `n`, and `qlen`, also remain unchanged.

State: **`y` is initially True, `i` is `plen - 1`, `plen`, `n`, and `qlen` remain unchanged**
